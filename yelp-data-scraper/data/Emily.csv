"Emily is definitely worth the hype.  The restaurant is a tiny, no-nonsense place and the staff are dedicated to making and serving great food, but Emily's is doing something special that is causing people like me to flock to Brooklyn and wait 2 hours to eat.Having one of New York's top burgers AND top pizzas on your menu is a unique combination, and quite the feat.  You are definitely in for a rich meal, but you will enjoy it.  The burger rivals Minetta (but is unique in its own way), and the pizza does not disappoint.  We couldn't stop talking about the white pie with truffle honey and pistachios for weeks.",5.0
"Have been trying to try the burger here for a while.We came here when the place initially opened, loved the pizza, and then haven't been back to dine in since because the wait is always 2+ hours. But we decided to come in as soon as they opened on a Sunday afternoon (5pm) just to try this famous burger. At 5:15, we got the two last seats at the bar. Our friendly bartender took our order quickly and we put in for 2 beers and 2 burgers, which were great. Really delicious, filling, but I don't know if it's the greatest burger I will ever have in my life, especially for the price. However, it's worth trying if you can get your hands on one. And they cooked it to a perfect medium-rare (which doesn't always happen with burgers). Note: The couple next to us ordered one burger and a pizza to share, and we wished we had done this since the burger is $26 and the pizzas go for less. Smart idea if you just want to try a bite of a couple items. At 5:50pm, they had completely run out of burgers. So plan accordingly.",4.0
"Unfortunately, after trekking all the way to BK, we had to wait an hour and half to have lunch on a Sunday at Emily.  I was not in the best of moods after waiting so long. We had come so far and had so many challenges with train schedules (weekend schedules and construction), so I was determined to stick it out.  Food: We had the Colony and the Emmy Burger and fries.  They were both so good.  My husband had beer and I had red wine.  It was great.  Atmosphere/Decor:  The space is really small and crowded.  There is no where to wait inside the restaurant.  The day we went it was cold and raining, so we were at a lose.  We waited it out at a coffee shop a block down the street.  Not really a lot of good options within a few blocks of this place.  Service: Was lacking and rushed. I loved the food here, but the chances I will go back anytime soon are low because I don't have patience for long wait times and the no reservation policies.4 stars is for the food, everything else would be closer to 3 stars.",4.0
"Maybe this should actually be two stars, but I'm going to lower it to one because there are way too many five star reviews. If I could rate them separately, I would give:0 stars for experience4 stars for the actual foodI'll never go back to the actual restaurant, but I'd be glad to have the food carry-out. This might actually be what they're hoping for with their terrible service. We went on a Friday night around 7pm, which we expected to be insane so we were prepared to wait. We had drinks next door for 1.5 hours, and they texted just a few minutes early of the approximation that they had given us. We had two seats at the bar for our table, which wasn't ideal, but this is pretty common for small restaurants. I should mention that I was elbowed in the back several times during our stay by passers-by, including the waitstaff. I went to the restroom, which is in the back in the hall that leads to the kitchen. I am an average size person, but if you were a larger person, this would be an uncomfortable queue to stand in since it's a compact and high-traffic area. I come back and the bartender slings our water down without looking up and runs back off. He comes back a while later and says, ""all set?""... hmm one fell swoop I guess then? Alright. We order all of our items and he's back off. Brings our beers and everything is fine. We're listening to the blaring 90s music until we run out of water. There's a pitcher on the bar, but it hasn't been refilled lately. The bartender never notices, so we end up having to ask for more water. There were two folks sitting next to us at the bar (who were also out of water), and we noticed that one was eating and the other wasn't. Then I realized that they hadn't brought the woman's food. Now, I understand that these things can happen, but if I'm going out with someone, it's usually because I'd like to eat at the same time as them. Also, they were coughing up 26.00 bucks each for those burgers... and it's not like they were a group of eight (a group of eight should never go to this restaurant unless you've rented it for an event). The man was nearly finished when they brought the woman's food. Our turn! They bring out our first of three pizzas, and... it's not a pizza we ordered. The hostess (I should mention that she did seem to be busting her ass), threw it down and ran back to the hostess stand so we didn't have a chance to mention the error, but in her defense at least she told us what it was.My companion mentions that the bartender repeated the order back to us, so the error is surprising, but these things happen. They take the pizza back and the bartender says that it was his mistake. Although we already knew that, it was fine for him to own up to it instead of shrugging it off I guess. Wait a little longer... and they bring two of our pizzas - this is fine the other won't fit anyway of course. We eat a bit of both, then I consolidate to one tray because I'm not holding my breath that it's going to be done for me. We waited a considerable time for the third... not incredibly long, but probably your average wait for a food order at a normal restaurant. Although we had already waited for a food order, so it was like waiting anew. During this time, there's a gentleman next to us waiting for a to-go order. When the hostess brings the order, she places it on the bar, far enough that it doesn't fall off... until the gentleman hits it with his elbow. The hostess looks mortified and takes the pizzas back to the kitchen. She evidently discovers that one is fine, but the other isn't, so he waits for a new one. As you already know, it's not a short wait, but they're very apologetic and give him a free whiskey and even check in to see if he wants a top off... pretty incredible because certainly no one checked to see if we wanted another drink. The pizza: It was good - certainly something special outside of New York, but here... you can find great pizza so many places. I would not say that it is better than Speedy Romeo or Roberta's (although the latter also has a crazy wait as well typically). We had the William, Rafa, and Emily.  The William was the most flavorful and tasted the most like traditional pizza. The crust for all is chewy, which is just a description, I didn't have a problem with that. Unless you are a big fan of honey, I would not get the Emily as your primary pizza. While it was good warm, it loses a bit of luster as it cools down and the cheese gets a little chewy. It was something unique, but at $22.00 USD, eh... my socks were not knocked off. Overall, disappointed. Was super excited about their ingredients, and was totally sold after reading the pages on their website. I felt like I was going to experience something special. The food was good, but everything else was hot mess express. If you're dying to find out what it's all about, I'd go at a off-peak time during the week or order carry out.",1.0
"Thank you, Emily. I luhhhh you. Let me start off by saying that everything I had was delicious. It wasn't even a little bit bad. - Quinn ($16): mozzarella, fontina, pecorino and ricotta. Needless to say, it was cheesy. But it wasn't overwhelming and even the oil on it gave it a great flavor. It was surprisingly light! The size of the pizza seemed pretty large (6 wide slices), but I was able to eat half of it with ease. - Emmy Burger ($23): I didn't realize a burger could taste so good. I used to work at Umami and I thought that that would be my favorite burger forever, but this one changed my mind! And of course it does with that the dry aged beef, aged Vermont cheddar, charred onions and Emmy sauce. It's not even fair. It also comes with the a large serving of the most perfect fries and aioli. The fries are thin and crispy, just how I like them. Note: the waitress said this takes about 20 minutes to make! Service was good - we were checked on pretty frequently and our waitress was able to give us details about the best sellers and the specials. This place is cozy, and by cozy I don't mean that it's tiny and very...intimate. I actually had a lot of elbow room even though the restaurant is kinda small. It's a little hip, a little modern. I like it. But because this place is small, it will get crowded easily! I came in right when they opened, and there were full within 30 minutes. On a Tuesday. I neeeeed to go back.",5.0
"I decided to check this place out with my boyfriend after Michael Symon featured it on his show recently - and honestly left the place with some mixed feelings.For the food itself - pretty outstanding in my book! We both got the ZoZo pizza pie AND and 2 Emmy Burgers (As Mr. Symon mentioned this is the best burger in NYC, we obviously had to see for ourselves). Now, before I move on - be warned that a  pizza pie and two burgers between two people is quite a lot of food, so unless one or both of you is a food vacuum, don't do this.The ZoZo white pizza ($18) was amazeballs - if it has cheese curds and bacon, then it's obvious that it's going to be delicious. The minty ranch was also a pleasant surprise and went well with the flavors. Next...the Emmy Burger ($23): I must say, it was really, really good...and really, really, REALLY rich. The beef was packed with flavor, and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. There was plenty of cheese oozing out of the burger - definitely served as a constant reminder of the horrible things it was doing on my heart! Caramelized onions were great, and all came together inside a warm pretzel bun. My fingers were packed with oil at the end. I gave this place 3 stars not for the food, but for everything else - the seating arrangements were just way too communal for my liking. My boyfriend and I were literally less than a foot away from the parties next to us - needless to say, it was impossible not to eavesdrop. On that note, it's super loud in the restaurant and on top of that, they were playing loud music, so my boyfriend and I had to move our heads to the middle of the table to be able to hear each other! Definitely not ideal for date night. I also want to note - initially, my boyfriend and I ordered 1 Emmy Burger and 1 pizza pie, but I changed my mind 5 mins later and asked for another Emmy Burger. Our waitress assured us that the pizza will come out first, and then our burgers later. However, when the pizza arrived...so did my boyfriend's burger. Mine didn't come out until another 20 mins later, so I just sat there watching him eat that juicy burger in envy. I realize it's my fault for adding on to the order, but I thought our waitress was going to take care of the timing as promised! Overall - great pizza and burger, but definitely NOT the best in NYC. And honestly, the unpleasant dining experience/ambience makes the trip to this place just not worth it. Will probably not return.",3.0
"A friend saw Emily when watching the food network and asked if I had heard of it. I hadn't but when I looked it up, I realized it was only a 15 minute walk from our apartment. A few nights later we went here for dinner and found it to be a delightful hidden gem in Clinton hill. The majority of the menu is pizzas but they're also known for their burger (there's only one--with a pretzel bun, special sauce, cheese and more--no substitutions). The pizza is reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. We went with the classic and it was YUM. We also decided to try the burger and while it was good, I probably won't splurge again for $23. The fries were very tasty too!We were too full to try the s'mores calzone but hopefully next time!",5.0
"The food here is pretty good. I'm with a lot of other folks though who really don't understand the hype. We went on a lazy Sunday and so we had almost no wait. But unfortunately they had just run out of the burger- I pretty much hate that and we should all just recognize this as the cheap gimmick it truly is. No restaurant in NYC should actually run out of food if there are willing, paying customers...So the only other options we had besides pizza were a beet salad and some olives, both of which were actually pretty tasty. But we really would have liked a few more starter selections if they're going to insist on running out of freakin' food.But surely the pizza- the star of the show- would make everything OK? Hmmm, sadly the pizza was good... but it's not going to make anyone's ""top 5"" list anytime soon. We had the Wrestler and the PXG!, both perfectly acceptable, good but not special pies.We actually thought the service was pretty efficient and the ambiance was nice- dark and small but cozy and welcoming. We also saw Jason Sudeikis there so if you're into such things that was cool...I'd go so far as 3.5, but I can't round up. Sorry... If you're in the area, it's a decent choice but I certainly wouldn't wait in line for it.",3.0
"I went here with two friends on Sunday, and each of us had an Emmy burger. The burgers were absolutely delicious, but HUGE -- it took me over 24 hours until I felt able to eat again. They also come with a ton of thin, tiny fries (which were also delicious, but I could only manage to eat a small portion of those) and two tiny pickles! I definitely want to go back, both to have the burger again (which I would most certainly split with someone else this time!) and to try the other items on the menu (the pizzas looked delicious, and the people sitting across from us were enjoying a giant pretzel appetizer that also looked fantastic). One suggestion I would make is for the creation of Emmy burger sliders: smaller versions of the Emmy burger, maybe 3 per order, so that people could share the deliciousness of the burger amongst one another more easily (or that one person could have the entire thing in smaller pieces). I'm not sure if that would be feasible, but those are just my thoughts :)",4.0
"Beware of burnt edges! Oh, and the 2 hour wait time!!Other than that, this is some of the best pizza I've had in the city. The colony & the lady pizza girl woah! Sweet and spicy and hot and just yum.I was pretty bummed not being able to try their signature burger, as it had sold out for the night, boo... But the pizza definitely made up for it. Order the colony for sure! It has just the right kick to it with the jalapeño and honey toppings alongside those crisp pepperoni. For a white pizza the lady girl was delicious. Maybe I would've started with that one since it is milder, more refined taste, and then hit the taste buds with the colony's jam packed flavors!Feel free to skip their lemon bar dessert though. (And have more pizza instead!)",5.0
"I think I might be missing something here. I went to Emily on Friday night. My buddies arrived right at 5:30, and because they're the best, waited in line and snagged a table before I had even arrived (I work in Hell's Kitchen, Brooklyn is far, etc.) When I rolled in they were already chowing down on a selection of Emily's pizzas. I tried the Colony, the burger pizza, and the vodka pizza. While I'd heard raves about the colony, it was the burger pie that really hit the spot -- thousand island-ish sauce on a pizza? Sounds gross, and even while I was eating it I kept thinking, this is kind of gross, but delicious too. I'd go back for that bad boy, but that's the only thing I'd return for. What about the burger?! You ask. Am I some kind of fun-hating vegetarian or something? Absolutely not, but I just didn't think the burger was all that good. Soft pretzel bun, soft meat, rich sauce and onions...it was just a bit...much. I found the burger to be so rich, it turned me off of eating anything else. You know that sick too-full feeling? I got that after one slice of pizza and 1/4 of the burger, which is way too soon. I found myself gulping water and hoping it would pass. Needless to say, after plunking down a large pile of cash, I was hungry an hour later.If you're into novelty pizza and really, really rich food, come here. Just be prepared to spend a small fortune on hype. You won't be fighting me for a place in line.",3.0
"Best burger in Brooklyn? No way...... maybe the world. Alright, that could be a stretch, but wow oh wow, Emily is the best burger I ever ate. Now the issue with a place as good as Emily is obvious, you can never get in. They don't take reservations and it's always packed. You think your slick trying to go on a Tuesday, ""Sir, it's a two hour wait."" Think you can just grease someone, ""Sir, that's not going to work, and besides your suppose to try to hand me money, not literally lather me up with coconut oil."" Think you can go near closing ""Please note sir, we are all out of our burger tonight, and I will be sending you the bill for that coconut oil thing.""With that being said you have to come with a plan. You can place your name down, go get a drink near by (may I suggest Hanson Dry) and try to come back 2,728 hours later. Or you can do what I did, wait till a record breaking snow storm in which the mayor advises most businesses to shut down, and bank on the idea that it would discourage most people from going out. Success! But I must say, even with this past January's gigantic snow storm, the place was still pretty packed. Was it worth the wait, you bet. Ordered up some drinks and proceeded to scope out the menu. Drinks were good and they have a good selection of wine and beer. We knew we were splitting the burger, but which pizza to get. I heard so much about the Colony, but thought honey on my pizza sounded a bit odd. Ending up going for the camp randal. Great pizza with classic toppings that all pizza lovers enjoy, sausage, peppers, and mushrooms. It was excellent. It's the best fancy foo foo pizza I've had in Brooklyn. Much better than Franny's and a couple of notches over some of my other favorites. Better than Di Fara, that would be a tough one. I think we'll try that Colony next time, I trust them. Now for that burger. Ohhhh that burger. Pretzel bun done to perfection. Oozing juices, flowing out of that perfectly cooked meat. It was like meat butter. I don't know if that's a term, but I'm using it. Delicious caramelized onions, a perfect complementing cheddar, and that Emmy sauce. God bless that Emmy sauce. Better than Luger's burger. Better than Bonnie's. Best burger I ever had, without a doubt. If you can manage to get inside,  don't pass it up and eat away. As mentioned it's probably best to make a reservation and then go get some drinks nearby. I'd also suggest not going too late as the burger will sell out for the day. Now, when's the next apocalyptic event happening? I'm in the mood for more Emily.",5.0
"Emily is a great neighborhood pizzeria with a lot of good things going for it.  They do a nice variety of pizzas, and all have their supporters.  On the last visit I had the luca, the gbx, the vodka, the lady, and the emily.  So basically a good section of the menu.  In general, the sauce and cheese are good.  Above average against the rest of NY pizzerias, but the crust is slightly below average.  I do like the creative pizzas and the wine list, and I recommend coming here with a group of 4 or less, otherwise you are gonna wait a long time! I will definitely be back to Emily sometime soon, and rank it somewhere in the top 20 of New York Pizzerias, but likely outside the top 10.",4.0
"Emily = heaven. Picture this: a magical place where you can get some of the best pizza of your life, even by Brooklyn standards, even on a busy Friday night for dinner because they actually take reservations. Upon arrival, you're escorted by a friendly server to a cozy back booth right by the kitchen where you can watch these incredible pies being shoved in and pulled out of their huge wood burning oven. You may even be greeted by Emily herself! Just when you thought things couldn't get more heavenly, you'll realize that they do more than just terrific pizza. They have a Bibb lettuce salad with radishes and crispy chickpeas that is out of this world, and so much more than a boring side pizza. Best of all, the Emmy burger. Now there are a lot of transcendent burgers out there, but this is one of the most divine. With a devastatingly tender dry age beef burger, a fluffy pretzel bun, grafton cheddar, cornichon, and caramelized onions, you may actually fall on your knees and praise the heavens for this incredible dish - so incredible that I'm willing to pay $21 for a burger. So no, you haven't died and gone to heaven - you've just walked into one of the best pizza spots in NYC!",5.0
I've been here twice and I can't wait to go back! After eating here  I always have to put honey on my pizza! The specials are always my go to if you want to try something new. I can't wait to try the burger!,5.0
"Emily was on my list for a while, and I finally made it over there this past Thursday. Torrential rain and wind tried to hold me back, but nothing could deter me from this haven of delicious pizza.Once I arrived, I found a cozy, petite restaurant with a welcoming bar, where we sat. I eyed up the wings special du jour, and the famous drippy Emily burger on a pretzel bun, but I cannot resist pizza, so I went with a classic pepperoni, my standby. Our pizzas came out quickly, and I was delighted at how thin the crust was, more towards the thickness of a bar pie. It was slightly too charred for my taste (I do not like char), but definitely not overly charred like some Neapolitan style joints.What stood out most to me was the mozzarella cheese, and the pepperoni, both of which were extremely high quality. The mozzarella was incredibly creamy and buttery, with perfect strings that pulled when I grabbed a slice. The pepperoni curled up, despite its slight thickness, and added that great hefty spice that you want in a pepperoni.Overall, I was really impressed with Emily, and I would probably go out of my way to return.",4.0
"Warning: this review is going to revolve around the Emmy burger, though pizzas make a cameo. This is going to sound so pretentious, but I am in a burger club* and the Emmy was high on our list ever since it was announced. And, seriously, the hype around it was (and is) very legitimate. Truth be told, I had it on a Friday with the club, and went right back there the next Friday for my birthday, because the burger's so good, and one of our collective favorites. The meat patty is a good size and high-quality, good mix of fat and both mild and beefy flavors. Topped with cheese and a pile of something akin to the saucy caramelized onions you might get on a dirty water dog. All on a pretzel roll. It's just layer upon layer of sweet and savory, crispy and soft, buttery and acidic. Damn. The pizza is really good too. Do what we did and order the burger and a bunch of pizzas. If anyone judges you for it, that's fine, because that's how you weed people out your life. Can't wait to try the Emmy Squared burger. *but with the ubiquity of Pat LaFrieda meats and amount of places in NYC touting their burger as ""The Best"", how could I not? How could YOU not?",5.0
"I love Emily. It's one of the only reasons why I'll venture out to Brooklyn. Why? Emily is the perfect venue if you're craving both pizza and a burger. I discovered Emily from Instagram, where I kept seeing pictures of the Emmy burger and just had to try it. FYI, the burger isn't on the menu, so it's a ""secret"" item despite not really being a secret due to the amount of attention it's gotten. The burger itself is really juicy and the Emmy sauce compliments it perfectly. It's practically impossible to eat this burger without making a mess all over yourself. But hey, that's the sign of a great burger right?In addition to the Emmy burger, I always get the Colony pizza. It's a red sauce pizza with pepperoni, honey, and jalapeños - the honey and jalapeños make it a unique combo of sweet and spicy which I absolutely love. In fact, I love this pizza so much that I can never get myself to order a different pie! Although the it's ""Pizza loves Emily"", Emily's logo can be ""_______ loves Emily"" because after eating here, I don't see why you wouldn't!",5.0
"The food at Emily is just fine. Is it as outstanding as the New York food media makes it out to be? I'm not completely sold.  From gastronomy to film and everything in between, I'm not the only human who has a hard time letting a cultural experience live up to hype. I do my best not to let admiration from others affect my own personal opinions, and more often than not, I'm able to separate my personal observations from those being trumpeted by professionals and enthusiasts alike. In the case of Emily, I don't feel like the the hype was impossible to live up to, I just think the universal praise is misplaced.  If Emily's pizzas and burgers were on the republican primary ticket, they might be John Kasich and Ben Carson. I'm not overly political (and I'm not a conservative), but there's probably nothing wrong with either candidate. In fact, they have a lot to like about them. They seem like very nice people. Similarly, the three different pizzas our party shared (the vodka, the colony, hamburger pie) and the elusive burger were simply passable in a ""C's get degrees"" sort of way. Do they deserve to be in the conversation for best in either category alongside many formidable competitors? Depends on who you ask, but I'll argue no. It's hard not to compare alternates when drumming up the opinion of what you just ate. To name a few, the vodka pizza wasn't as good as Rubirosa's version in Nolita, the colony (red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, pickled chilli, honey) wasn't as good as the similar Bee Sting at Roberta's, and the burger pizza was a unique creation that's hard to compare, but it was just OK. As far as the Emily Burger is concerned, I think it's my least favorite of any $20+ burger I've had to date in New York City (it's $23 to be exact). The very soft pretzel bun, very soft beef patty, very soft caramelized onions, and intrinsically soft cheddar cheese left a lot to be desired in terms of texture. Perhaps it was my fault for not incorporating the adjunct cornichon spears that sat alongside the burger as though an optional element, but it was the handheld equivalent of eating a bowl of steel cut oatmeal. The flavors worked together agreeably, but with no shortage of delicious and creative burgers in this city, I don't see a reason to ever eat another one. Maybe my opinion isn't a popular one, but what's America if we can't agree to disagree? I do question the local food media of sheepishly forming a favorable democratic opinion of trendy restaurants and big name chefs, but that's a systemic issue that's a byproduct of the rapidly changing social landscape and not the fault of Emily itself. They'll have 30 minute lines before they open with or without my personal opinion, so in concert with the central thesis of this review, they'll be....just fine.",3.0
"Let's be honest - there's a whole lot of competition for Brooklyn pies, but if Emily isn't synonymous with the cuisine, it's quite possible that it should be. Th pizza here is excellent, and while I haven't yet sampled the burger, I will, and if it's all that people are saying it's cracked up to be Emily should snag a fifth star down the road no problem. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Sure, things are a tad bit cramped at Emily, and that's prone to resulting in lines out the door, but similar to other New York establishments I'll argue that's part of the charm. After all, when you're in such close proximity to so many people having a good time and enjoying delicious food? How can you not give in?I was able to snag a barstool late on a Saturday night, and my bartender was excellent from start to finish. While the pie took a bit (15+ minutes-ish), the place was absolutely packed, so it was warranted. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?When I first started coming to New York City regularly, I was admittedly shocked by some of the prices. $20 for a pizza that's only slightly larger than a personal one? Ridiculous! As time has progressed however and my visits have become more frequent, I've grown to understand that anything shy of $20 is reasonable. My speciality Buffalo Chicken Pizza here at Emily came in at $18, and considering half of it sufficed for a light meal, that was more than reasonable considering the quality. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Unless you're relatively new to pizza, which you're obviously not, you have a feel for how buffalo chicken pizza typically goes - buffalo sauce instead of marinara, blue cheese instead of mozzarella, and chicken as the topping. It's a killer combination if done right, but it's all too often just half-heartedly slapped together with a premium price slapped into the mix. Here at Emily? Not the case. Here's what you've got: the wonderful and flavorful thin crust pizza that Emily is known for, but on top of that you've scallion-cilantro pesto, blue cheese, sriracha, and slow cooked and succulent chicken. The combination is wonderful, and while I could have used just a tad bit more chicken, these flavors were divine when brought together. I'm honestly a bit surprised this isn't a menu regular, because no one in their right mind wouldn't crave this on the reg. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?So here's the thing - Emily is excellent, but there's STEEP competition in the area obviously. The differentiating factor here is the burger, and while Emily was sold out when I arrived, a decent burger would be a game changer that would easily up Emily into the five star category. Until then I'll say No Star Granted, but stay posted.",4.0

Success! But I must say, even with this past January's gigantic snow storm, the place was still pretty packed. Was it worth the wait, you bet. Ordered up some drinks and proceeded to scope out the menu. Drinks were good and they have a good selection of wine and beer. We knew we were splitting the burger, but which pizza to get. I heard so much about the Colony, but thought honey on my pizza sounded a bit odd. Ending up going for the camp randal. Great pizza with classic toppings that all pizza lovers enjoy, sausage, peppers, and mushrooms. It was excellent. It's the best fancy foo foo pizza I've had in Brooklyn. Much better than Franny's and a couple of notches over some of my other favorites. Better than Di Fara, that would be a tough one. I think we'll try that Colony next time, I trust them. Now for that burger. Ohhhh that burger. Pretzel bun done to perfection. Oozing juices, flowing out of that perfectly cooked meat. It was like meat butter. I don't know if that's a term, but I'm using it. Delicious caramelized onions, a perfect complementing cheddar, and that Emmy sauce. God bless that Emmy sauce. Better than Luger's burger. Better than Bonnie's. Best burger I ever had, without a doubt. If you can manage to get inside,  don't pass it up and eat away. As mentioned it's probably best to make a reservation and then go get some drinks nearby. I'd also suggest not going too late as the burger will sell out for the day. Now, when's the next apocalyptic event happening? I'm in the mood for more Emily.",5.0
"Emily is a great neighborhood pizzeria with a lot of good things going for it.  They do a nice variety of pizzas, and all have their supporters.  On the last visit I had the luca, the gbx, the vodka, the lady, and the emily.  So basically a good section of the menu.  In general, the sauce and cheese are good.  Above average against the rest of NY pizzerias, but the crust is slightly below average.  I do like the creative pizzas and the wine list, and I recommend coming here with a group of 4 or less, otherwise you are gonna wait a long time! I will definitely be back to Emily sometime soon, and rank it somewhere in the top 20 of New York Pizzerias, but likely outside the top 10.",4.0
"Emily = heaven. Picture this: a magical place where you can get some of the best pizza of your life, even by Brooklyn standards, even on a busy Friday night for dinner because they actually take reservations. Upon arrival, you're escorted by a friendly server to a cozy back booth right by the kitchen where you can watch these incredible pies being shoved in and pulled out of their huge wood burning oven. You may even be greeted by Emily herself! Just when you thought things couldn't get more heavenly, you'll realize that they do more than just terrific pizza. They have a Bibb lettuce salad with radishes and crispy chickpeas that is out of this world, and so much more than a boring side pizza. Best of all, the Emmy burger. Now there are a lot of transcendent burgers out there, but this is one of the most divine. With a devastatingly tender dry age beef burger, a fluffy pretzel bun, grafton cheddar, cornichon, and caramelized onions, you may actually fall on your knees and praise the heavens for this incredible dish - so incredible that I'm willing to pay $21 for a burger. So no, you haven't died and gone to heaven - you've just walked into one of the best pizza spots in NYC!",5.0
I've been here twice and I can't wait to go back! After eating here  I always have to put honey on my pizza! The specials are always my go to if you want to try something new. I can't wait to try the burger!,5.0
"Emily was on my list for a while, and I finally made it over there this past Thursday. Torrential rain and wind tried to hold me back, but nothing could deter me from this haven of delicious pizza.Once I arrived, I found a cozy, petite restaurant with a welcoming bar, where we sat. I eyed up the wings special du jour, and the famous drippy Emily burger on a pretzel bun, but I cannot resist pizza, so I went with a classic pepperoni, my standby. Our pizzas came out quickly, and I was delighted at how thin the crust was, more towards the thickness of a bar pie. It was slightly too charred for my taste (I do not like char), but definitely not overly charred like some Neapolitan style joints.What stood out most to me was the mozzarella cheese, and the pepperoni, both of which were extremely high quality. The mozzarella was incredibly creamy and buttery, with perfect strings that pulled when I grabbed a slice. The pepperoni curled up, despite its slight thickness, and added that great hefty spice that you want in a pepperoni.Overall, I was really impressed with Emily, and I would probably go out of my way to return.",4.0
"Warning: this review is going to revolve around the Emmy burger, though pizzas make a cameo. This is going to sound so pretentious, but I am in a burger club* and the Emmy was high on our list ever since it was announced. And, seriously, the hype around it was (and is) very legitimate. Truth be told, I had it on a Friday with the club, and went right back there the next Friday for my birthday, because the burger's so good, and one of our collective favorites. The meat patty is a good size and high-quality, good mix of fat and both mild and beefy flavors. Topped with cheese and a pile of something akin to the saucy caramelized onions you might get on a dirty water dog. All on a pretzel roll. It's just layer upon layer of sweet and savory, crispy and soft, buttery and acidic. Damn. The pizza is really good too. Do what we did and order the burger and a bunch of pizzas. If anyone judges you for it, that's fine, because that's how you weed people out your life. Can't wait to try the Emmy Squared burger. *but with the ubiquity of Pat LaFrieda meats and amount of places in NYC touting their burger as ""The Best"", how could I not? How could YOU not?",5.0
"I love Emily. It's one of the only reasons why I'll venture out to Brooklyn. Why? Emily is the perfect venue if you're craving both pizza and a burger. I discovered Emily from Instagram, where I kept seeing pictures of the Emmy burger and just had to try it. FYI, the burger isn't on the menu, so it's a ""secret"" item despite not really being a secret due to the amount of attention it's gotten. The burger itself is really juicy and the Emmy sauce compliments it perfectly. It's practically impossible to eat this burger without making a mess all over yourself. But hey, that's the sign of a great burger right?In addition to the Emmy burger, I always get the Colony pizza. It's a red sauce pizza with pepperoni, honey, and jalapeños - the honey and jalapeños make it a unique combo of sweet and spicy which I absolutely love. In fact, I love this pizza so much that I can never get myself to order a different pie! Although the it's ""Pizza loves Emily"", Emily's logo can be ""_______ loves Emily"" because after eating here, I don't see why you wouldn't!",5.0
"The food at Emily is just fine. Is it as outstanding as the New York food media makes it out to be? I'm not completely sold.  From gastronomy to film and everything in between, I'm not the only human who has a hard time letting a cultural experience live up to hype. I do my best not to let admiration from others affect my own personal opinions, and more often than not, I'm able to separate my personal observations from those being trumpeted by professionals and enthusiasts alike. In the case of Emily, I don't feel like the the hype was impossible to live up to, I just think the universal praise is misplaced.  If Emily's pizzas and burgers were on the republican primary ticket, they might be John Kasich and Ben Carson. I'm not overly political (and I'm not a conservative), but there's probably nothing wrong with either candidate. In fact, they have a lot to like about them. They seem like very nice people. Similarly, the three different pizzas our party shared (the vodka, the colony, hamburger pie) and the elusive burger were simply passable in a ""C's get degrees"" sort of way. Do they deserve to be in the conversation for best in either category alongside many formidable competitors? Depends on who you ask, but I'll argue no. It's hard not to compare alternates when drumming up the opinion of what you just ate. To name a few, the vodka pizza wasn't as good as Rubirosa's version in Nolita, the colony (red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, pickled chilli, honey) wasn't as good as the similar Bee Sting at Roberta's, and the burger pizza was a unique creation that's hard to compare, but it was just OK. As far as the Emily Burger is concerned, I think it's my least favorite of any $20+ burger I've had to date in New York City (it's $23 to be exact). The very soft pretzel bun, very soft beef patty, very soft caramelized onions, and intrinsically soft cheddar cheese left a lot to be desired in terms of texture. Perhaps it was my fault for not incorporating the adjunct cornichon spears that sat alongside the burger as though an optional element, but it was the handheld equivalent of eating a bowl of steel cut oatmeal. The flavors worked together agreeably, but with no shortage of delicious and creative burgers in this city, I don't see a reason to ever eat another one. Maybe my opinion isn't a popular one, but what's America if we can't agree to disagree? I do question the local food media of sheepishly forming a favorable democratic opinion of trendy restaurants and big name chefs, but that's a systemic issue that's a byproduct of the rapidly changing social landscape and not the fault of Emily itself. They'll have 30 minute lines before they open with or without my personal opinion, so in concert with the central thesis of this review, they'll be....just fine.",3.0
"Let's be honest - there's a whole lot of competition for Brooklyn pies, but if Emily isn't synonymous with the cuisine, it's quite possible that it should be. Th pizza here is excellent, and while I haven't yet sampled the burger, I will, and if it's all that people are saying it's cracked up to be Emily should snag a fifth star down the road no problem. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?Sure, things are a tad bit cramped at Emily, and that's prone to resulting in lines out the door, but similar to other New York establishments I'll argue that's part of the charm. After all, when you're in such close proximity to so many people having a good time and enjoying delicious food? How can you not give in?I was able to snag a barstool late on a Saturday night, and my bartender was excellent from start to finish. While the pie took a bit (15+ minutes-ish), the place was absolutely packed, so it was warranted. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?When I first started coming to New York City regularly, I was admittedly shocked by some of the prices. $20 for a pizza that's only slightly larger than a personal one? Ridiculous! As time has progressed however and my visits have become more frequent, I've grown to understand that anything shy of $20 is reasonable. My speciality Buffalo Chicken Pizza here at Emily came in at $18, and considering half of it sufficed for a light meal, that was more than reasonable considering the quality. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?Unless you're relatively new to pizza, which you're obviously not, you have a feel for how buffalo chicken pizza typically goes - buffalo sauce instead of marinara, blue cheese instead of mozzarella, and chicken as the topping. It's a killer combination if done right, but it's all too often just half-heartedly slapped together with a premium price slapped into the mix. Here at Emily? Not the case. Here's what you've got: the wonderful and flavorful thin crust pizza that Emily is known for, but on top of that you've scallion-cilantro pesto, blue cheese, sriracha, and slow cooked and succulent chicken. The combination is wonderful, and while I could have used just a tad bit more chicken, these flavors were divine when brought together. I'm honestly a bit surprised this isn't a menu regular, because no one in their right mind wouldn't crave this on the reg. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?So here's the thing - Emily is excellent, but there's STEEP competition in the area obviously. The differentiating factor here is the burger, and while Emily was sold out when I arrived, a decent burger would be a game changer that would easily up Emily into the five star category. Until then I'll say No Star Granted, but stay posted.",4.0

"WORTH EVERY PENNY!  My mouth is still watering from my visit last night to Emily. Let me preface this that my friends and I are burger FANATICS, so when we heard about this place and their famous Emmy burger, we immediately added it to our list. It did NOT disappoint. I think I can speak for my group in our agreement that this was the best burger we've ever had. But first, let's dial it back to the beginning. I knew from reviews that the place was small, so we arrived fairly early (6:15) to put our name down for a table. We were told there would be a 30-45 minute wait (for a table of 3), which wasn't a problem. We hopped over next door for a drink, but before we could even finish our beer, we got the text that our table was ready! We quickly ordered a bottle of wine, and mulled over the menu, even though we pretty much knew what we were going to order. We started with a pizza as an appetizer, because we all thought the pizza's looked amazing, and let's be real, this is more of a pizza place than a burger spot! We opted for the vodka pizza with mozz. Yes, it was yummy, and a perfect appetizer for our main feast, the Emmy Burger. I don't even think I can be fair to the pizza, when comparing it to the burger. In my opinion, the pizza wasn't nearly as special as the burger. The Emmy burger. We ordered 2 to share between the 3 of us (after our light 2 slices of pizza each appetizer). I love that Emily doesn't ask how you want your burger cooked, and also that they don't allow for an substitutions or changes. It's pretty much their way or the highway! And for good reason. The medium rare meat melted in your mouth and the flavor was perfect. The emmy sauce (whatever is in it) is amazing, the cheese and caramelized onions all melt together in your mouth. (drool). The skinny fries were also delicious, and they serve them was a garlic/herb mayo, which was awesome. And a few teeny tiny delicious cornichon pickles! I was legitimately floored when our waitress told us we got the last 2 burgers of the night (at 7:30?!) and we all said how upset we would've been if we came all the way there (sorry, yes it's kind of out there from the Upper East Side and Hoboken where we all live) to be disappointed that they were out of burgers. I guess the size of the restaurant can't accommodate the quantity of burger requests, but to run out of burgers during primetime was unbelievable to me! I recommend coming on a weeknight before 7pm to guarantee yourself a little slice of heaven. Anyway, the service was good, our waitress was friendly, and the place has a very cute atmosphere. Yes, the burger is a little pricey, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. I'd skip the pizza and get my own burger too!",5.0
"Emily first fell into my radar thanks to a bevy of NYC-centric lists that placed their burger as one of the best entrants of the year. To be fair, I don't find myself in the Clinton Hill area very often, and would easily have written it off as a mere neighborhood restaurant otherwise. The restaurant, started by Matt and Emily Hyland, is a tribute to the couple and to the meal that first bonded them many years ago. Don't underestimate the caliber of the food, either; Chef Matt Hyland studied at the ICE and dabbled in The Breslin, Pizza Moto, and Roberta's before honing his skills at Sottocasa. Clearly, the pizza is not to be underestimated either.The restaurant itself is a cozy, understated venue in the heart of a changing neighborhood. Reservations are intended for parties of six or more, so walk-ins and occasional waits are the norm here. Thankfully, on the weekend evening we wandered in, we were able to snag a two-top by the entrance. A cheerful greeting followed by menus and glasses of water, and we were soon going through the concise but sorely tempting options. While there's a handful of starters and the famed Emmy Burger, the bulk of the menu is made up of pizzas, split out by the base sauce. A little hemming and hawing, and we decided on a red pie and the Emmy Burger to share.First and foremost, the Emmy Burger is a must-order. The patty, a sizable blend of dry-aged beef, was cooked to our requested medium-rare and had all the flavor and juiciness one could hope for. It's topped with charred onion, a melted slice of Grafton cheddar, and the ""Emmy Sauce"", which had a zing that was reminiscent of a mild buffalo sauce. Sandwich that between two generous, lightly charred pretzel buns with a side of housemade fries, and you have a formula for success.I can't overlook the excellent pie that we got to try, either. The Rafa, a red suace-based pizza, was topped with mozzarella, peppers, onion, a variety of herbs, and fresh basil. It's a thin crust pizza, but maintains its integrity and chew, even to the very last bite. The sauce is tangy and well-seasoned, and the blend of vegetables and herbs spot-on; it's an aromatic, aggressively-flavored pizza, but highlights each ingredient beautifully.I have a tinge of regret in not keeping Emily to myself; but honestly, it's too good to keep as a simple neighborhood restaurant. The food is simple but delicious, the service welcoming and helpful, and it's the type of place you want to keep going back to time and time again. If the pizza and burger isn't enough incentive, there's an off-menu dish of Korean-inspired wings which has my name written all over it as well...",4.0
"The food at Emily is to die for. Go immediately, I promise, you won't regret it.My friend and I had been wanting to visit this place for about a year.

Ten of my favorite pies, ten of the world's best,* and it'd be difficult for me to say I enjoyed any of them more than that first bite of The Colony:The simple and significant combination of sauce and cheese atop an impeccable crust, with the addition of pickled chilis, the good pepperoni** and honey... This is my perfect pie. The spice of the chili is tempered by the acid from the pickle, and you know I love the sweet and the savory together. That hint of honey puts it over the top. And the Emily (a white pie topped with mozzarella, pistachios, truffle sottocenere, honey) was just as good. Better, if you ask my wife, but I wouldn't ask my wife anything if I were you. (She's not allowed to talk to other people, lest she discover just how far out of my league she is.)Emily may not be perfect*** overall, but if the fascinating and delicious Smokey Carrots are any indication, their non-pizza offerings are just as stellar. I was obscenely envious of the man to my left eating The Emmy Burger, so that's next on my hit list. Having to decide whether to order [what looks to be] an incredible burger or the best pizza I've had in a long time? The struggle is real. ______________*Says me. Maybe I am a homer, but eat any of those and tell me it isn't true. **The thick little slices that curl up into tiny cups of greasy perfection.***I'm not sure if it's an acoustical issue, but it was so loud at 6:30 on a weekday that I couldn't hear my date sitting directly across from me.

Went to this place about a month ago. The freshness and quality of ingredients were top notch. We order a classic and an emily pie and I got a burger. It's a shame i would of given it 5 stars but the food was too salty to enjoy!! I never write reviews But was so disappointed after tryjng to get in so many times before but the wait was too long.,3.0
Been wanting to try this place forever. Came on a Sunday during brunch which is the best time since there is more availability for the Emily burger. They take your name and number so they may text you when your table is ready. That was a plus. Only 2 seaters are at the bar which kinda sucked though.I would give it 5 stars if it was based solely on the Emily burger. It is worth the hype. So much flavor and cooked to perfection. Top 3 of the best burgers I've had to be honest.The pizza is good but not mind blowing. Sorry to say but next time I'd skip the pizza and get just the burger. Got the colony pizza and added sausage but the sausage wasn't worth the extra $5. Not enough sauce. Pizza is not crunchy and  kind of soft. Doesn't make my top 5 best pizzas. Sad to say.,4.0
Hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had. The sauce on the burger is amazing. The pizza was good too but I prefer a thin and crispy crust for my pizza like Vezzo or Spuntos.The pretzel is a great appetizer. It's very airy and not heavy at all. It comes out warm and the cheese and mustard are great accompaniments.Definitely will be coming back for the burger.,5.0
"Let's start from appetizers, my husband and son Hate Kale but they were fighting over the salad which came with plump dry cherries, shaved cheese and a fantastic dressing. I was told by Emily that her husband massages the kale to get it to such a tender texture.  Wow, who knew that heirloom roasted carrots can taste like smoked sausages!!!The Emily Burger is tender and juicy, perfect fries with a little spicy mayo was perfect! Ok now for the The Colony pizza; I had a When Harry met Sally moment! Tasty, crispy crust with a hint of honey , the perfect sauce and tender mozzarella topped with jalapeño slivers and not your commonplace pepperoni .  Delicious! Service is lovely, knowledgeable and patient. I wish for Emily to buy the place next door and expand !",4.0
"You guys, I don't know why everyone isn't talking about the banana cream pudding because it was literally one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. I thought to myself as I ordered it, I know nothing can stand up to the pudding at Magnolia bakery but I'll give it a try. I was at Emily's with a group of 4 and all of us were blown away - even the girl who ""doesn't like banana pudding."" It's like a cloud of whipped, perfectly sweet banana cream mixed with banana slices and of course crumbled graham cracker crust. I hope this isn't seasonal b/c I will be ordering it every time I go.The pizza was of course excellent. We had the colony (spicy with honey, yes please!), the vodka (who knew a pizza this plain sounding could be sooooo good), and the Quinn with sausage added. The Quinn was not too dry or oily like other white pizzas can be, and the addition of the sausage was a great choice. The pizza is not traditional neopolitan d.o.c. pizza, but it is equally as satisfying and it's nice to get some creative options sometimes.The waitstaff was friendly and accommodating.

"Quite simply the best burger I have had in New York, by a good margin.It has the wonderful funk of dry-aged beef, a sauce that is a perfect balance of sweet, spicy and tangy, nicely caramelized onions and a pretzel bun that holds the whole package together admirably.Even though I made the trip for the burger, I was also super impressed by the pizza and even more so by the wings. The Colony pizza was a nice evolution on a standard pepperoni pie, with the honey and pickled peppers providing wonderfully contrasting flavors. The wings were made of high-quality chicken (e.g with flavor), cooked perfectly, and had the same amazing sauce as the burger.Seems like a popular place, glad I went on a Monday night and did not have to wait, but imagine weekends are a madhouse.",5.0
"Pretty disappointed with my visit to Emily.  Service dining at the bar was very friendly.  Overall I would say this is a pizza place that has lost its way and become a one-trick-pony burger joint.  Probably not their fault, the burger is getting just so much press.  At least 50% of the orders coming out of the kitchen are burgers, not pizza.  I see they have raised the burger price to $23.   As for the pizza and salad we had, they were just not special.  The Bibb Salad was full of mismatched ingredients and textures.  Buttery lettuce, way-too large radish pieces and crunchy chickpeas and nothing to pull it together; like someone pulled random things out of the crisper in a challenge to use up ingredients.  The dressing was straight mustard.  Pizzas were fine.  The menu is overwhelming- about 25 speciality pies-so many toppings and overcomplicated combos.  There are also a lot of pies that appear to be ways to charge more for something slightly altered: ""make it a..."" and add $4.  Perhaps someone just really likes coming up with the pie names.",2.0

"Lets get straight to the food review first. Although our pizza was REALLY cold it was still good hence the 4 star. We ordered the Colony with pepporoni,  pickled jalepeno, and honey with added onions. I would have given it a full 5 but it was...  cold.We arrived at roughly 7 pm on a Saturday night... October 10th exactly. The hostess informs me the wait will be roughly 30 minutes then says to hold she will be right back. She returns to let us know the wait will be 75 minutes and she apologizes ever so nicely. Since we we're staying at the Marquis in Times Square we didn't want to spend 2-3 hours in Brooklyn so we decide to order to-go. As we are deciding what to order we hear the hostess tell the non Asian couple behind us it's about an hour and if anything comes up sooner she will call them in roughly 15 mins. Then thr next couple non Asian coincidently is told 45 mins. My date starts getting upset and I calm him down and reassure him she was super nice. We order then ask why the wait time is different she explained it was due to party size. She tells us 20 mins and knocks off 15%. How nice right? The next coincidental Asian girl asks for the wait time and is told an hour and forty five... the following super tall couple?  Thirty to fourty five. The next big group came and they are obviously the hostess' friends... seated immediately...  my date is furious. I say who cares we ordered to go. The hostess starts bringing out people's to-go orders for people who ordered after us. My date goes in to check and she brings out a hard cold pizza that has obviously been sitting out... We are visitors from California and after much research on Yelp and Instagram decided to go out of our way to Brooklyn at 7 pm just to eat this pizza and it's just sad we got cold, hard pizza. The really sad thing? It was still delicious and we really truly just simply wished it was warm...But this might really just be our experience and just that hostess... so a four star review since the pizza is really good.

"They say tomorrow will give you a brighter today. Well tomorrow has come since my visit to Emily, and it's never been so dark and gloomy...Let me elaborate. I walked into Emily, I sat at the bar, and my tastebuds went on an amazing ride. This ride consisted of sweet, spicy, cheesy, and thin crust pizza goodness. And once I thought the ride was over...I went through the loop de loop of a pretzel bun Emmy burger topped with melted cheese and onions.Every girl I ever meet that is named Emily will have to live up to the experience that Emily brought me! I must say though, my expectations are that one may never exceed the experience I had. The Colony pizza was a stormy wave and delicious balance between hot jalapeño and sweet honey, and did I mention thin crust? Well now I did. So what are you waiting for...head over to Emily and know that your heart will immediately be won over. It's quite possible that the name Emily will be the most popular baby name of 2015, and it might just be because of...Emily !",5.0
"A friend and I shared the vodka pizza and the Emmy burger. Both surpassed all expectations. Quite possibly the best burger I've ever had in my entire life. It was cooked to perfection alongside a mountain of thin salty French fries. The pizza was incredible with the thin crust and overflowing sauce with cheese. We met the owner Emily and she was the sweetest person, so welcoming and warm to her restaurant! She suggested we finish our meal with the smores calzone. Even at the level of fullness we were at, we dove into it and were not disappointed. It was the perfect combination of sweet indulgences. I will definitely be returning!",5.0
"What incredible pizza! We arrived around 7 pm on a Saturday night and the wait was one hour. The hostess was lovely and suggested some bars right next door to wait at while we waited for our table to be ready (highly recommend the beer at Hops Hill before dinner). And wow the wait was worth it! The pizza at Emily is fantastic. For four people we shared three pizzas and it was a good amount. We were full but not stuffed. WOW to the ""Emily"" Pizza (white pizza with two cheeses, truffle and honey). The honey on the pizza combined with truffle was mind blowing. Second favorite was the green pizza ""Emzies"" made with tomatillo sauce. Unusual and delicious! Also enjoyed the ""Camp Randall"" pizza but it was definitely less unique than the other two.I can't wait to come back to try the vodka sauce pizza! The service was great, too, in addition to the food. Our waitress was funny and friendly. Lovely evening overall.",5.0
"One of those meals so good your eyes tear up a little as you eat. Quality ingredients and smart, playful flavor combinations are in my opinion what make this place so great. The Colony pizza, for example, comes with pepperoni, pickled chili peppers and honey, and is outstanding. And the Emmy Burger deserves all of the praise it has received so far. A perfect burger with dry aged beef, aged white cheddar, caramelized onion, and special sauce on a pretzel roll...drool. I do think it's hilarious that one of my favorite burgers ever was made famous by a pizza place, but hey - whatever works! I would recommend making a reservation if you can and coming early, because there are long waits and the burger does sell out. But regardless of what you get or when you get there, try Emily. It's a gem.",5.0
"I've heard a lot of great things about Emily, so my girlfriend and I took a special trip here to experience the much-hyped burger. 7pm on a Sunday, we arrived and were told it'd be an hour wait. We kicked around the neighborhood for an hour while we waited for our seat, only to return and hour later and wait another 20 minutes for a table to open up. We were seated around 8:30 and were told right away that they were out of burgers. Awesome, just what I was hoping for! We got up and left.If you're going to advertise the burger as the flagship dish on your website, then not reveal whether or not it's available until seated after an almost 90 minute wait, then be sold out by 8:30 -- I can't be a fan. If I wanted every meal to be a roll-of-the-dice as to whether or not it was going to be enjoyable, I'd go to some hip Tribeca spot. Not Clinton Hill.",1.0
"Holy pizza, I don't think I was ready for what Emily was packing. I really didn't think much of this place before I actually tried it, but when my foodie partner in crime dragged me out I didn't have much of a choice. And I'm really glad I didn't resist too much. We both got a Cheap Date ( whiskey and some other stuff) which was pretty strong but really yummy. There was a brief battle back and forth between the Emily and the Colony but we finally settled for the Colony( spicy peppers, pepperoni and honey) and it was AMAZING. We also split the burger which was probably the best burger I've ever eaten in my life. And that's a big big statement. You know it's the perfect burger when the house staff doesn't ask you how you like your meat, the default option is medium rare. Overall; Emily I'll definitely be back for more",5.0
"I have yet to come to this location, but I did just eat one of the best burgers I've ever had from Emily at Time Out New York's Battle of the Burger. Holy hell, this was good. Competing with the likes of American Cut, the Standard, and the Dram Shop ain't easy, but Emily's burger really stood out. The burger was thick and cooked perfectly; juicy, tender, savory. It was sandwiched between a pretzel bun, which is usually not my preferred choice but the one they use is much softer than others. Emily explained that their buns are made fresh every day. The meat was covered in an orange sauce, which looks very similar to a Buffalo wing sauce. My taste buds were getting sort of burnt out by the time I got to her booth, it was hard for me to identify what I was tasting but I knew I was very, very happy. Emily told me it was her take on Korean BBQ sauces, of which I've had limited experience with. It was creamy without being thick, a little sweet but not in a BBQ sauce sort of way. This isn't a traditional burger, she's shaking things up and I'm just happy to go along for the ride. While this is a pizza place, I'd definitely recommend going a little nuts and trying it out.",5.0

Even at the level of fullness we were at, we dove into it and were not disappointed. It was the perfect combination of sweet indulgences. I will definitely be returning!",5.0
"What incredible pizza! We arrived around 7 pm on a Saturday night and the wait was one hour. The hostess was lovely and suggested some bars right next door to wait at while we waited for our table to be ready (highly recommend the beer at Hops Hill before dinner). And wow the wait was worth it! The pizza at Emily is fantastic. For four people we shared three pizzas and it was a good amount. We were full but not stuffed. WOW to the ""Emily"" Pizza (white pizza with two cheeses, truffle and honey). The honey on the pizza combined with truffle was mind blowing. Second favorite was the green pizza ""Emzies"" made with tomatillo sauce. Unusual and delicious! Also enjoyed the ""Camp Randall"" pizza but it was definitely less unique than the other two.I can't wait to come back to try the vodka sauce pizza! The service was great, too, in addition to the food. Our waitress was funny and friendly. Lovely evening overall.",5.0
"One of those meals so good your eyes tear up a little as you eat. Quality ingredients and smart, playful flavor combinations are in my opinion what make this place so great. The Colony pizza, for example, comes with pepperoni, pickled chili peppers and honey, and is outstanding. And the Emmy Burger deserves all of the praise it has received so far. A perfect burger with dry aged beef, aged white cheddar, caramelized onion, and special sauce on a pretzel roll...drool. I do think it's hilarious that one of my favorite burgers ever was made famous by a pizza place, but hey - whatever works! I would recommend making a reservation if you can and coming early, because there are long waits and the burger does sell out. But regardless of what you get or when you get there, try Emily. It's a gem.",5.0
"I've heard a lot of great things about Emily, so my girlfriend and I took a special trip here to experience the much-hyped burger. 7pm on a Sunday, we arrived and were told it'd be an hour wait. We kicked around the neighborhood for an hour while we waited for our seat, only to return and hour later and wait another 20 minutes for a table to open up. We were seated around 8:30 and were told right away that they were out of burgers. Awesome, just what I was hoping for! We got up and left.If you're going to advertise the burger as the flagship dish on your website, then not reveal whether or not it's available until seated after an almost 90 minute wait, then be sold out by 8:30 -- I can't be a fan. If I wanted every meal to be a roll-of-the-dice as to whether or not it was going to be enjoyable, I'd go to some hip Tribeca spot. Not Clinton Hill.",1.0
"Holy pizza, I don't think I was ready for what Emily was packing. I really didn't think much of this place before I actually tried it, but when my foodie partner in crime dragged me out I didn't have much of a choice. And I'm really glad I didn't resist too much. We both got a Cheap Date ( whiskey and some other stuff) which was pretty strong but really yummy. There was a brief battle back and forth between the Emily and the Colony but we finally settled for the Colony( spicy peppers, pepperoni and honey) and it was AMAZING. We also split the burger which was probably the best burger I've ever eaten in my life. And that's a big big statement. You know it's the perfect burger when the house staff doesn't ask you how you like your meat, the default option is medium rare. Overall; Emily I'll definitely be back for more",5.0
"I have yet to come to this location, but I did just eat one of the best burgers I've ever had from Emily at Time Out New York's Battle of the Burger. Holy hell, this was good. Competing with the likes of American Cut, the Standard, and the Dram Shop ain't easy, but Emily's burger really stood out. The burger was thick and cooked perfectly; juicy, tender, savory. It was sandwiched between a pretzel bun, which is usually not my preferred choice but the one they use is much softer than others. Emily explained that their buns are made fresh every day. The meat was covered in an orange sauce, which looks very similar to a Buffalo wing sauce. My taste buds were getting sort of burnt out by the time I got to her booth, it was hard for me to identify what I was tasting but I knew I was very, very happy. Emily told me it was her take on Korean BBQ sauces, of which I've had limited experience with. It was creamy without being thick, a little sweet but not in a BBQ sauce sort of way. This isn't a traditional burger, she's shaking things up and I'm just happy to go along for the ride. While this is a pizza place, I'd definitely recommend going a little nuts and trying it out.",5.0
"Went here this past Friday. Ordered the burger- delicious. But for $23 it should be!!! We also ordered the Colony which was pretty good. We didn't love the Uncle ray though. If you try the pizza crust without anything else, it is pretty bland. Not sure what it is missing but maybe, salt? For dessert we had the s'mores calzone. it was gross. The dough was bland and awful. My husband didn't even have more than 2 bites, which is rare! I just ate the inside (marshmallow and chocolate). overall, it was okay. I would only go back for the burger but probably not since i wouldn't want to spend $50 on 2 burgers.",3.0

"Emily may be the best pizza I've had. Ever. If not, it's definitely top 5.Their pies are inventive and some of them are unlike anything I've seen elsewhere. And they're actually surprisingly big.I came here for lunch and split two pies with a friend. It was a lot of food, but it was so good that I kept eating until I hated myself (I do that a lot).For the sake of variety, we went with one red and one white. The red was The Colony, which came with pepperoni, pickled chili and honey. The chilis were amazing - not too spicy, and gave it just the right amount of kick. The honey was subtle, and not overpowering. Every bite was a combination of salty (pepperoni), spicy (chilis), sweet (honey), or all three. You really need to try this one.Our second pie was the eponymous Emily. This one was definitely sweeter (we were warned beforehand when ordering). I've never had crushed pistachio on a pizza, but it works. Really well, in fact. It also had truffle cheese and a generous honey glaze. Since it was sans sauce, this one was baked a little crispier, which made it that much more amazing. Between the pistacchios and the truffles, there was a nice balance of savory to go along with the sweet.They also have good beers on tap and whiskey! But it was 12:30 in the afternoon (that means I only had a beer).Our server was super friendly. She provided us with wonderful recommendations/conversation, and kept the indie tunes playing on the stereo.The decor of the place is also great.

"Always thoroughly enjoy the food here and the burger is every bit as amazing as all the reviews suggest (And those fries!), but last time I went for Saturday brunch, I had a very strange experience with the service. It was a fairly small brunch crowd with plenty of open tables and space at the bar. While my date and I were ALMOST at the end of our meal, I went up to use the bathroom. When I came back, we'd been moved two seats over by the hostess. I asked my date what happened and he said the hostess came over, took my stuff and moved it while I was gone. They then quickly wiped down the bar where we were previously sitting so a new party of two could come sit down. No one asked if we wanted another round or dessert. They just moved us, cleaned the area, and brought the check. While it may have looked like we were done with our meal, we had not asked for the check and had made no indication that we were ready to leave. And to top it all off, the new party decided to sit somewhere else because the corner they had requested (the corner I had two minutes earlier been enjoying) was too cramped.Very simply, this is not how you treat your guests. The whole experience left a very bad taste in my mouth. The food shines, but when the service is this sub par, the clientele is not going to stick around.I also find the blonde bartender incredibly awkward.",2.0
"Emily is on Fulton Street, conveniently located near the subway. It's in a neighborhood displaying all the classic signs of mid-gentrification. There is the trendy restaurant, the new craft beer bar and new construction juxtaposed against dilapidated houses. There was a lot of hype surrounding Emily. I learned about the restaurant through one of my favorite food bloggers on Instagram. The restaurant is small and quite busy. We tried twice to get a table but the wait was over an hour long. We finally got a seat on the third try. Was it worth the wait? Eh. It did not blow me away nor did it fall on its face. It was somewhere in between. We started with wings and they were delicious. The presentation of the wings was on point and we quickly dove in. It was tangy yet sweet and hard to put down. It was the best tasting dish of the night. We ran through those pretty quick and waited for our burger. The wings had been so good that we thought the burger was going to blow us away. We we're impressed by the burger's arrival but disappointed by the taste. The sauce was overwhelming and it really hid the flavors of the meat. The Emmy sauce was good, but that was all we could taste. In my opinion, a good burger needs highlight the favor of the meat not conceal it. They were serving dry aged beef but all we got was sauce. Dry aged beef deserves more respect.",3.0

It has elements of cute (signs pointing you to the bathroom, handwritten notes in the bathroom, wine served in lab beakers), but also a cultured feel (an old map of New York and a wooden mandolin slicer on the wall).I will gladly come back to Emily until I have tried all of their pies.",5.0
"Always thoroughly enjoy the food here and the burger is every bit as amazing as all the reviews suggest (And those fries!), but last time I went for Saturday brunch, I had a very strange experience with the service. It was a fairly small brunch crowd with plenty of open tables and space at the bar. While my date and I were ALMOST at the end of our meal, I went up to use the bathroom. When I came back, we'd been moved two seats over by the hostess. I asked my date what happened and he said the hostess came over, took my stuff and moved it while I was gone. They then quickly wiped down the bar where we were previously sitting so a new party of two could come sit down. No one asked if we wanted another round or dessert. They just moved us, cleaned the area, and brought the check. While it may have looked like we were done with our meal, we had not asked for the check and had made no indication that we were ready to leave. And to top it all off, the new party decided to sit somewhere else because the corner they had requested (the corner I had two minutes earlier been enjoying) was too cramped.Very simply, this is not how you treat your guests. The whole experience left a very bad taste in my mouth. The food shines, but when the service is this sub par, the clientele is not going to stick around.I also find the blonde bartender incredibly awkward.",2.0
"Emily is on Fulton Street, conveniently located near the subway. It's in a neighborhood displaying all the classic signs of mid-gentrification. There is the trendy restaurant, the new craft beer bar and new construction juxtaposed against dilapidated houses. There was a lot of hype surrounding Emily. I learned about the restaurant through one of my favorite food bloggers on Instagram. The restaurant is small and quite busy. We tried twice to get a table but the wait was over an hour long. We finally got a seat on the third try. Was it worth the wait? Eh. It did not blow me away nor did it fall on its face. It was somewhere in between. We started with wings and they were delicious. The presentation of the wings was on point and we quickly dove in. It was tangy yet sweet and hard to put down. It was the best tasting dish of the night. We ran through those pretty quick and waited for our burger. The wings had been so good that we thought the burger was going to blow us away. We we're impressed by the burger's arrival but disappointed by the taste. The sauce was overwhelming and it really hid the flavors of the meat. The Emmy sauce was good, but that was all we could taste. In my opinion, a good burger needs highlight the favor of the meat not conceal it. They were serving dry aged beef but all we got was sauce. Dry aged beef deserves more respect.",3.0
"I read about Emily in Timeout New York's best pizza issue.  We decided to go check it out.  Although the place was fun, the staff friendly and the ingredients fresh...the pizza itself was unremarkable - by the way...they also sell cheeseburgers which kinda doesn't make sense to meIf you live in the neighborhood...there is no reason not to check this place out...but for those interested in finding the best pizza in NYC and are willing to travel to eat it...Emily does not deliver the level of pizza worth travel for",3.0

"Best gourmet pizza I've had, definitely better than Grimaldi. It's flavorful and light and the different topping combinations, YUM!

So be mindful about coming here. I think as busy as this place they could expand as the place is so small and popular.",5.0
Love Emily. Great pizza and an amazing burger. I've only split it which works pretty well because its so rich. Make sure to plan ahead because you'll frequently have to wait! I can't wait to go back.,5.0
"Mmmm...I love Emily's pizza. I could not get enough of the sweet honey + spicy tomato sauce + pepperoni trio that is the Colony. When I would feel sassier, I would order the Emily on top of the Colony. The ""Emily Colony"" in my belly and in my heart forever. I would always get takeout -- eating in the restaurant was kind of annoying for me since it was extremely loud. People were talking over other people to talk over the booming music. It put a damper into a few nights out when everyone at the table felt both overwhelmed and exhausted from the noise so we just sat there and waited until we finished the delicious pizzas. The slices are crispy and thin but retain a fluffy and chewy texture. They fold perfectly into hand sized pizza sandwiches and leave you satisfied with flavor. Too bad Emily's is too far away from where I live now.",5.0
"I would like to lay their burger down by the fire and spend some quality time with it.  It's a thing of beauty..  The beef has that earthy and musty dry age quality.. Its a big old burger, i would guess, it's a half pounder or so.. It comes cooked perfectly medium rare.. The fries are like battered thin simplot guys that come out crispy and hot.  The bun is a perfectly soft pretzel bun.. And if the burger ended there, it would still be delicious.. But, these beautiful people were not happy with just a delicious burger, no, these people were striving for perfection.. And they may have found it with their mixture of stewed onions.. It tastes like a tomatoey, paprika wine sauce with the sweetness from the stewed onions and hints of wine mixing with the beef.. It's next level..  It's takes on more steak quality than just a burger the same way the burger at Minetta Tavern will.    My 7 month old came to dinner with us and he tried his first bit of beef there.. He devoured it and was passed out before we left the table..  In the words of Sam Jackson, that is one tasty burger... Oh, they also have fantastic pizza too...",5.0
"Small crowded place. The restaurant was fully packed by 6PM on a Sat. The one and only large table we were seated at seem to be right in the kitchen. It can be a hazard since the pizza stick is pretty active and you can get hit if you get up without looking. Its pretty awesome because we can see how our food was prepped. Party of 7 and we ordered a salad to share, 4 pizzas, 3 burgers, one order of wings and the smores calzone.The burger was Phenomenal! Pregnant so I had to order the burger medium well and it was so juicy and cooked just right. The beef tasted so fresh and the condiments with it was just perfect. Will come back just for the burger which comes with fries. Out of the 4 pizzas we order, the Emily- white pizza with loads of ricotta cheese was the best. The Colony (red sauce, cheese, pepperoni, pickled chili's and honey) has an awesome contrast -spicy, salty and sweet at the same time. The Amazeball- meatballs- was too salty for my taste. Dont remember our last pizza. I was so full by then.The wings were not on the menu but you can always order it. There were 7 wings in our order which was perfect for our table of 7. The wing i had was too dry. The smores calzone sounds and looks delicious with the gooey marshmellow and melted chocolate, but there was wayy too much dough to chocolate/marshmellow ratio. I had the middle piece too. Can def pass on this desert with all the carbs i already consumed..=(",4.0

"This is my second Yelp review ever. The first was due to a horrible experience at another establishment near my apt.

Just all around top notch from everyone we encountered, which made for a great experience for us. But the food, my word, the food was out of this world. We decided to have a mini-feast on the Emily & Rafa pizzas and the Burger. Each was exquisite - the pistachios and honey on the Emily were just a combo I never thought would work so well on a white-style pizza, the sauce on the Rafa was heavenly and a great savory balance, but the Burger may have been one of the richest and most decadent burgers we have ever had (+ my fiance said the fries were ""her perfect fries""). We each took a bite, just looked at each other, and went ""Wow."" We had to literally force ourselves to stop eating all of the items or we would have kept going until we exploded.And dessert - of course we had to try the S'mores Calzone and the Banana Pudding. Each was just the right amount of sweetness coming off dinner and a fantastic way to cap the night.They've made two huge fans in Christine and I - nearly 12 hours later we're still raving to each other about it.

"I love love love Emily's!! As far as specialty pies go, I'd have to say that Emily's takes the cake, or I guess I should say, pie when it comes to my fave in Brooklyn! I dream about and regularly crave their namesake pizza, the Emily! Oh-My-God, this pizza is unreal-- mozzarella, pistachios, truffle and honey makes for the perfect combination of salty, savory and sweet. I've had other pizzas with similar ingredients, however, never as well executed as Emily's-- the perfect ratio of truffle and honey.  I really can't even handle how much I love this pizza. The Colony is another good, unique choice and I love the balance between spicy(pickled chili) and sweet(honey). As far as their classic goes, it was good, but not the best I've ever had. They also have pasta dishes, with pasta made fresh from Sfoglini Pasta Shop. The cavatelli was soooo delicious! Mmm.lemon, ricotta and poppy combined to make an insanely flavorful bowl of pasta. I loved that the lemony flavor really came through without being overpowering.As far as dessert goes, the S'mores Calzone is  AMAZING. I must preface this by saying that, s'mores might be one of my favorite treats so I am partial to loving this dessert. Mmmm the dough is perfectly charred with crumbled graham cracker crust and it comes oozing with marshmallow and chocolate--d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s!!!I'm pretty sure I could eat the Emily and S'mores calzone every day and live a very happy life.",5.0

"Well, I go to enough restaurants, I might as well start Yelping about them.Went to Emily on Sat, 2/22. There was approximately an hour wait at 7, but (as all no-resy restaurants should do), they took my number and we got to sit at a bar a few doors down and have some drinks. They called almost exactly an hour later. All subsequent service was fantastic as well, with extremely friendly staff. We got the Classic, the Emily, the special for the night (Kimchee pizza), and the burger. The Emily and the kimchee pizzas were well above-average, though across the board the crust could have been a little bigger. The Classic was standard, which is to say probably a little below your high-end NYC pizza expectations. The burger, however, made up for it. I had no idea you could get a pretzel roll so soft.Finally, the smores calzone - pretty much exactly what you'd expect, and if you REALLY want to make yourself feel like you overdid it, go for it (especially if you have more than 2 people).Cocktails and beer and wine were good selections.So, while Emily might only get 4 stars pizza-wise compared to your Paulie Gees or your Kestes/Motorinos/etc., the service is way up there, and that gets it full marks.",5.0
"Had a wonderful meal here with my mom when she was visiting me in Fort Greene this passt summer.  We walked from my apartment - kind of desolate at night but still safe.  There was a line outside even on a Tuesday night!  Mercifully, they take your phone number down and text you when your table is ready.  My mom and I split a mushroom pizza and an arugula salad and each had one of the wines on draft.  Everything was superb.  It was exceptionally hot outside and the A/C was broken inside, but there were fans everywhere and our server kept refilling our water!  After dinner we walked down the street for ice cream even though we were already stuffed from pizza.Can't wait to go back and try the burger.",5.0
"One of the best burgers I've ever had - a bit of a trek for a manhattanite and a long wait at that. The best way to put it is if you had to make a choice between there pizza or the burger, go with the burger (their special). I never liked cheese, but it was a subtle addition to the overall medium rare flavor that complimented the burger rather than cover it up. Spot is a little tight but great for a adventurous date",4.0
"THIS PLACE IS SO DELISH.I went 2x in one weekend and tried 3 pizzas. The North Maple tasted like a camping trip wrapped up in a meal. The Emily was truffle oil heaven. The Vodka was the best ""cheese pizza"" I've ever had in my life. The pizza didn't take long to come out and the chardonnay was like melted buttah.Go here, put your name in, go get a drink somewhere else on the block, and come back. You won't regret it.",5.0
"Emily, the gem of Clinton Hill. Loved by many a reviewer both critical and not.  I have been here a few times.  I can heartily recommend the burger which is superb.  The wedge salad is also a simple but very tasty salad.  The pizzas are adequate but not worth traveling for. You can find similar quality ""specialty"" pizza in dozens of restaurants throughout the city.Now to the bad. Went there this evening for dinner, it was 79 degrees outside, but substantially hotter inside. I could feel the AC, just barely, but it was clearly just a hint, like the honey they dribble on a few of their pies.  I was sweating profusely my entire meal.  I understand AC is expensive but how pricey can it be to cool this perfectly rectangular space.The acoustics in here are amazing. You can literally hear every conversation being had by every other customer. The only difficulty being deciding which screaming child to focus on. I am of the impression that methods for controlling sound in one's business establishment can be readily searched on the internet. A little foam here, a tasteful tapestry there, and voila! One can hear oneself think.Finally, I respect a restauranteur's desire to be the best and to believe that one's recipe are ambrosia for the gods. But I do believe oregano and parmesan are commonly asked for seasonings at a pizza place.  Just saying.... ya know, I can't be the only person to have asked for it. Not only did they not have them, but a concerted and obviously fabricated search was made to find them.Thanks Emily, I have a healthy respect for what you and your hubby have accomplished. That being said, I will limit myself to take out. That way I can avoid the noise, the heat, and have my choice of adding a dab of oregano or parmesan to my pie.",2.0
"I've tried many pizza places in the NYC area since graduating college and exploring the food scene here. Some serve classic, yet delicious pizzas. Some serve greasy, sub-par pizza by the slice. Others, like Emily, wow you by creating a masterpiece out of their pizza pies.Emily is slightly out of the way, in the Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn, but well-worth the traveling time.

"I think that this review may be a bit controversial for a place that is as popular as Emily, but I think that it is fair:2 stars = ""meh, I've experience better""...and I have. The establishment's service is where it is losing a lot of stars. This isn't about the food alone.The food might be spectacular, and there's a lot, A LOT, of outstanding food in New York. The way this place is managed makes it a quite frustrating and disappointing experience. There is a LINE just to put your name on the list, which is understandable. What isn't, is the fact that we stood in said line just to put our name down with only 10 people ahead of us for an un-godly amount of time. We expected to have a long wait, maybe even 3 hours, but there is no reason why just writing people's names down on a piece of paper and telling them to come back in a few hours is that difficult. At this point they should have a system down for managing their customer flow. Total shambles, just stupid.If you're coming here from the city, and it's pretty far out of the way, be aware that you will have a very long wait and a bit of disorganization. If you decide to bail, there's not a lot of other options near by.EDIT- I've been back since, and I still stand behind my issues with the hosting. The food is actually quite good, although I have had better pizza around Brooklyn at a hand full of places. Emily is just very hyped up right now, so it is a fun place to eat - just be prepared to wait A WHILE. The food is good, but not SPECTACULAR (except maybe the burger, that's good but they sell out of it! Just make more! Minetta tavern offers a similar burger and they don't sell out)",2.0
"Hmm. Think I must have been eating a different pizza to some of the other reviewers. For me Emily was kind of disappointing. We'd driven over at 6.30 on a freezing Monday night and discovered that there was already an hour wait. They suggested we head to the bar a few doors up to wait but I'm too old and pregnant to do such things so we happily opted for takeout. 15 mins later we had pizza in hand. Maybe the eat-in atmosphere makes all the difference, but the pizza itself was distinctly average. I had the Emily with extra bacon and my boyfriend had the Uncle Ray. Now I like my crusts thin and crispy but these were almost like a flatbread - they could hardly hold the toppings, went soggy very quickly and had absolutely no texture or flavor. It just felt a little unsatisfying. I thought the taste of the Emily was ok although nothing too special, but my boyfriend actually left a slice of his, which has honestly never ever happened in the history of takeout. We ordered the Bibb salad with crispy chickpeas which was both tiny and entirely average. As was the Key Lime Pie (which is still half-eaten in our refrigerator, again something which never happens!). The olives were nice. The order was over $80 and the food just wasn't good enough to justify that price tag. I hear wonderful things about the burger and would consider going back to try that on a Sunday when they're not likely to be sold out an hour into service, but if I'd waited an hour for those pizzas I'd have been seriously disappointed. You can definitely get better pizza elsewhere in Brooklyn.Sorry Emily. I so wanted to love you but you're going in the hype over substance category for me right now. Hope you prove me wrong with the beef!",3.0
"Very good thin crust pizza.  Superb vodka pie, very good classic, a little meh on the Colony (pepperoni flavor not quite right, peppers lacked any real pickled zing and the honey was flattened by the other flavors) and on the wings (a nice idea - buffalo meets sweet chili - but something just not hitting a home run).  Great char on the pie, crackery thin crust that totally held up, brisk service, and my son even loved the smell of the soap in the bathroom.  A 5 pm opening time on the weekends makes it a great option for parents with young kids. Sold! Emily is a winner.  Would be happy to return when we're nearby again.",4.0
"The Emily Burger truly is the best burger in New York City. One bite in and I was forced to put the burger down, recline and reflect on the true meaning of life. It's truly an experience not worth ever passing up. Yes the pizzas are great, but this burger is truly devine.",5.0
"Well, I go to enough restaurants, I might as well start Yelping about them.Went to Emily on Sat, 2/22. There was approximately an hour wait at 7, but (as all no-resy restaurants should do), they took my number and we got to sit at a bar a few doors down and have some drinks. They called almost exactly an hour later. All subsequent service was fantastic as well, with extremely friendly staff. We got the Classic, the Emily, the special for the night (Kimchee pizza), and the burger. The Emily and the kimchee pizzas were well above-average, though across the board the crust could have been a little bigger. The Classic was standard, which is to say probably a little below your high-end NYC pizza expectations. The burger, however, made up for it. I had no idea you could get a pretzel roll so soft.Finally, the smores calzone - pretty much exactly what you'd expect, and if you REALLY want to make yourself feel like you overdid it, go for it (especially if you have more than 2 people).Cocktails and beer and wine were good selections.So, while Emily might only get 4 stars pizza-wise compared to your Paulie Gees or your Kestes/Motorinos/etc., the service is way up there, and that gets it full marks.",5.0
"Had a wonderful meal here with my mom when she was visiting me in Fort Greene this passt summer.  We walked from my apartment - kind of desolate at night but still safe.  There was a line outside even on a Tuesday night!  Mercifully, they take your phone number down and text you when your table is ready.  My mom and I split a mushroom pizza and an arugula salad and each had one of the wines on draft.  Everything was superb.  It was exceptionally hot outside and the A/C was broken inside, but there were fans everywhere and our server kept refilling our water!  After dinner we walked down the street for ice cream even though we were already stuffed from pizza.Can't wait to go back and try the burger.",5.0
"One of the best burgers I've ever had - a bit of a trek for a manhattanite and a long wait at that. The best way to put it is if you had to make a choice between there pizza or the burger, go with the burger (their special). I never liked cheese, but it was a subtle addition to the overall medium rare flavor that complimented the burger rather than cover it up. Spot is a little tight but great for a adventurous date",4.0
"THIS PLACE IS SO DELISH.I went 2x in one weekend and tried 3 pizzas. The North Maple tasted like a camping trip wrapped up in a meal. The Emily was truffle oil heaven. The Vodka was the best ""cheese pizza"" I've ever had in my life. The pizza didn't take long to come out and the chardonnay was like melted buttah.Go here, put your name in, go get a drink somewhere else on the block, and come back. You won't regret it.",5.0
"Emily, the gem of Clinton Hill. Loved by many a reviewer both critical and not.  I have been here a few times.  I can heartily recommend the burger which is superb.  The wedge salad is also a simple but very tasty salad.  The pizzas are adequate but not worth traveling for. You can find similar quality ""specialty"" pizza in dozens of restaurants throughout the city.Now to the bad. Went there this evening for dinner, it was 79 degrees outside, but substantially hotter inside. I could feel the AC, just barely, but it was clearly just a hint, like the honey they dribble on a few of their pies.  I was sweating profusely my entire meal.  I understand AC is expensive but how pricey can it be to cool this perfectly rectangular space.The acoustics in here are amazing. You can literally hear every conversation being had by every other customer. The only difficulty being deciding which screaming child to focus on. I am of the impression that methods for controlling sound in one's business establishment can be readily searched on the internet. A little foam here, a tasteful tapestry there, and voila! One can hear oneself think.Finally, I respect a restauranteur's desire to be the best and to believe that one's recipe are ambrosia for the gods. But I do believe oregano and parmesan are commonly asked for seasonings at a pizza place.  Just saying.... ya know, I can't be the only person to have asked for it. Not only did they not have them, but a concerted and obviously fabricated search was made to find them.Thanks Emily, I have a healthy respect for what you and your hubby have accomplished. That being said, I will limit myself to take out. That way I can avoid the noise, the heat, and have my choice of adding a dab of oregano or parmesan to my pie.",2.0
"I've tried many pizza places in the NYC area since graduating college and exploring the food scene here. Some serve classic, yet delicious pizzas. Some serve greasy, sub-par pizza by the slice.

Rafa and Arnie were delicious. I think the ham on the Arnie was a touch too salty for the pie. And I'm not sure why they made this a folded pie. But I loved it anyway.

"""Pizza Loves Emily"" and I love Emily's pizza.The Emily that this great new spot is named after made this delicious meal even more enjoyable, as a gracious host providing excellent service.We arrived early on a Saturday night to find a very nice, cozy, welcoming atmosphere. It's a smallish place, with some tables and bar seating near the open kitchen with the large pizza oven in the back.The menu here is great, with a large number of starters and small plates, in addition to pastas and several pizzas, which are helpfully divided into two categories - The Reds and The Whites.For once, we didn't order way too much. Just a little too much:- Stix ($9)When I asked what this one was, Emily helpfully informed us that it was deep fried bread, and was their take on garlic knots. That was all I needed to hear to help me decide which of the many apps to start with. These were really delicious, especially those first few that were crispy and piping hot. There was a ton of garlic on them, which is always a good thing. After they sat for a bit, they were a little saturated with the oil though, which made them a little too heavy to deal with, but they were great when fresh.- Spaghetti with 'nduja, uni and pistachios ($16)This was some really amazing pasta. The spaghetti was cooked al dente with a nice chewy texture, and it had a great salty taste from the uni, with an added crunch from the pistachios. This is definitely a good choice to enjoy before the pizzas.- Rafa ($14) with pepperoni ($3)One of The Red pies, this one comes with mozzarella, sauce, peppers and onions. We also added some much needed meat with pepperoni, which came in large discs, with 2 to 3 on each of the 6 slices. The crust on this pizza was incredible. The pizza itself is very thin crust and is very chewy. It depends on whether or not this is the style you like, but if you can appreciate a good thin, chewy crust, you will love this.- Emily ($19) with sausage ($3)One of The White pies, I figured we had to try the namesake of the restaurant. Again fueling my need for meat, we added some sausage to the pie, which by default is topped with mozzarella, taleggio, pistachios, truffle spread and honey. This was another amazing pie, though I started getting a little overwhelmed with the copious amounts of delicious truffle spread. Still, that crust was on point too, with that great chewiness and crispiness at the same time.- S'mores Calzone ($10)They also have Pizza Churros ($8) and the always excellent Coolhaus Ice Cream Sandwiches for dessert ($7), but even without getting those, I know that you must get this S'mores Calzone, as it was truly incredible. The calzone is pretty big, and is cut up into 4 pieces, each one oozing with hot, melty, gooey chocolate, marshmallows and graham cracker crumbs. It's so fresh and hot that you should take a minute before you eat, or you will burn your mouth and hands. This was a good opportunity to chat with Emily. Once that was done, I really tore into this satisfying dessert. There is a really generous amount of that delicious, melted chocolate, spread all throughout that amazing pizza dough. Make sure you save room for this, or get it even if you are full.This is a perfect spot for a really nice, relaxing, satisfying meal. Brooklyn is getting saturated with this these similar types of pizza joints, but this one is among the best, and the great, friendly service is a welcome change from most places. I have had some better pasta and pizza before, but the atmosphere and service here really elevated the experience for me. Also, that S'mores Calzone is ridiculous, especially compared to a lot of pizza places that just have a sad fried dough or other forgettable dessert option. I would love to come back to try some more of the great food before this place takes off with the success it deserves.",5.0
"Very cute place! The pizza is 5 stars! We had ""the colony"" which had sauce, pepperoni, pickled chiles and honey. It was salty, sweet and spicy- all in one bite! The dough was thin and crispy. The sauce was delicious and everything tasted really good! Had the Lil Rhody also for brunch, which was good, but not great. Next time, I would try more pizza instead or come for dinner and try their pasta dishes. Pastas are not offered during brunch.",4.0
"Incredible pizza--not NY-style, more Italian-proper, I think?  Each pie is a little larger than a personal pie, great for sharing.  My table tried four pies and I enjoyed them all, with the most memorable being the ""green"" pizza, which uses tomatillo sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I'm not saying I'd want this to replace regular pizza, I'm just saying I haven't seen it anywhere else before, ordered it thinking it'd be just a kind of curiosity, and ended up loving it.For appetizers, I tried the smoked carrots, which smelled like sausage.  A nice and not-unhealthy small plate.For dessert, the banana pudding is like everything good you ever wanted to put in your mouth and then did and then were happy.Didn't try the pastas nor the cocktails--please ask me to come here with you so I have an excuse to do so.Service was warm and efficient.  The space is small and welcoming--dim, exposed brick, stylish somehow.  Awesome soundtrack--they were incongruously but wonderfully playing psychedelic 60's Cambodian pop the entire time I was there.",5.0
"Emily is like Franny's Marco, but with warmth and value. Emily herself is so charming and the restaurant follows suit. Prices are reasonable here so you could eat a real meal for a real price. The crew behind the original Brooklyn Central, bring that bangin' oven and pizza plus Sfoglini pastas with flair and flavor to Clinton Hill.A charcuterie plate of meats, cheeses, honey and figs was a heavenly start. The crispy pig ears salad over greens with mustard vinaigrette- hello food lover- this is for you. My favorite though was the pasta- Lemony cavatelli with ricotta and poppy seeds for $10. I was blown away by the lemony flavor- a true original like Emily herself. The smores pizza dessert is here plus others, but will save the sweet treat for next time.",5.0

"""Pizza Loves Emily"" and I love Emily's pizza.The Emily that this great new spot is named after made this delicious meal even more enjoyable, as a gracious host providing excellent service.We arrived early on a Saturday night to find a very nice, cozy, welcoming atmosphere. It's a smallish place, with some tables and bar seating near the open kitchen with the large pizza oven in the back.The menu here is great, with a large number of starters and small plates, in addition to pastas and several pizzas, which are helpfully divided into two categories - The Reds and The Whites.For once, we didn't order way too much. Just a little too much:- Stix ($9)When I asked what this one was, Emily helpfully informed us that it was deep fried bread, and was their take on garlic knots. That was all I needed to hear to help me decide which of the many apps to start with. These were really delicious, especially those first few that were crispy and piping hot. There was a ton of garlic on them, which is always a good thing. After they sat for a bit, they were a little saturated with the oil though, which made them a little too heavy to deal with, but they were great when fresh.- Spaghetti with 'nduja, uni and pistachios ($16)This was some really amazing pasta. The spaghetti was cooked al dente with a nice chewy texture, and it had a great salty taste from the uni, with an added crunch from the pistachios. This is definitely a good choice to enjoy before the pizzas.- Rafa ($14) with pepperoni ($3)One of The Red pies, this one comes with mozzarella, sauce, peppers and onions. We also added some much needed meat with pepperoni, which came in large discs, with 2 to 3 on each of the 6 slices. The crust on this pizza was incredible. The pizza itself is very thin crust and is very chewy. It depends on whether or not this is the style you like, but if you can appreciate a good thin, chewy crust, you will love this.- Emily ($19) with sausage ($3)One of The White pies, I figured we had to try the namesake of the restaurant. Again fueling my need for meat, we added some sausage to the pie, which by default is topped with mozzarella, taleggio, pistachios, truffle spread and honey. This was another amazing pie, though I started getting a little overwhelmed with the copious amounts of delicious truffle spread. Still, that crust was on point too, with that great chewiness and crispiness at the same time.- S'mores Calzone ($10)They also have Pizza Churros ($8) and the always excellent Coolhaus Ice Cream Sandwiches for dessert ($7), but even without getting those, I know that you must get this S'mores Calzone, as it was truly incredible.

"Wow, this place is absolutely delicious. I had already heard good things about it, so I came in with pretty high expectations and they were easily surpassed. Being a born and bred New Yorker, I take my pizza pretty seriously. I came here with a group of 6 people and were reasonably accomodated in the back. I was running late and the hostess called and nicely told us that there was a reservation coming in at 945pm and that we would have to finish promptly. This was a nice touch as she was very easy going and polite. Food rundown:The Emily - maybe the star of the night, the honey, pistacchio and truffle was an amazing blend to go along with the thin crust. You need this on your table.The Colony - 2nd place, definitely for people who like a little spice in their life also highly recommended.Vodka pie - also very good, but I think I am spoiled by Rubirosa, but definitely an enjoyable pie.The Camp Randall - I liked this as well, but not in the same league as the above mentioned.Luca - Simple and delish!However, the star of the night surprisingly might have been the Emmy burger. We ordered the last 2 in the house and wow, this may be one of my favorite burgers in the city thats not Minetta Tavern black label. The preztel bun is a great touch, the meat is so juicy and the special sauce and cheese were amazing. I seriously would go back just for the burger, easily top 3 in the city. For desert we got the S'mores Calzone which sounds better than it is, it was a little too doughy for us. I would skip dessert and just load up on pizza and burgers. Great, great place!",5.0

"I ate at Emily last night with 9 friends to celebrate our masters graduation, and from start to finish it was a perfect experience. Their staff are all completely accommodating, lovely, and attentive (shoutouts to waitress Emily and the host, Annie, both of whom kept their cool despite our morphing party size). They started us off with champagne, which was such a kind gesture. I had their Auntie Blaze cocktail (Rye, orange liqueur, angostura bitters, citrus) which was so good, I'd love to come back and try the rest.We ordered nine pizzas (crazy, I know), including the Emzies, the !PXG!, TWO of the Emily's (it's just that good), the Colony, the Lady Pizza Girl, the Red Planet, and the North Maple. Each was incredible; I think my favorite had to be the Emzies, though clearly I have strong feelings about all of these. The crust is chewy but crisp, the sauce is just sweet enough, and the topping combos are inspired.  Despite this excessive ordering, somehow our bill was still one of the more reasonable I've ever paid in New York. Whatever this place is doing, it is doing it SO RIGHT. It's amazing to see a restaurant that truly makes people happy and is packed, consistently. I'm in love.",5.0
"The pizza here is incredibly well done. I've been living in NYC my entire life so I definitely don't throw those words around casually. The cocktails were also delicious. My only issue with this place was the somewhat snarky hostess. We walked in expecting a wait, which is fine, but she had us standing there while she looked around deciding if she'd seat us in one of the empty tables. We were kind of confused by this. Then she begrudgingly says she can seat us, as if she's doing us a huge favor. It was like she was pretending to be friendly but failing miserably. I don't know, weird. Maybe she was having an off night. Anyway, the food here is great and I wish this business much success.",4.0
"No shortage of praise for this place. All of the pizzas are great, but it's actually the other dishes that always blow me away. Te burger, deeply meaty on a pretzel bun, is my favorite in all of Brooklyn. No joke. Other dishes like the carrots and ricotta is deceptively complex and inspiring. Random specials like a gojuchang pig ear salad have shown what they can do. Weekend nights are often packed and it's always comically loud, but the food redeems.",4.0
"My girlfriend and I had the absolute pleasure of dining at Emily tonight (4/20). Everything was wonderful from the moment we sat down. We had the smoky carrot appetizer (amazing local carrots), the Colony pizza, and the North Maple pizza. Both pies were wonderful. The combination of sweet and spicy was delectable. We were also floored by the incredible cocktail menu. We tried the Golden Gate and the Floral Print. After we ordered a second round of the Floral Print, the bartender informed us that she created the Floral Print recipe. So good! All in all, we are looking forward to coming back very soon. Thanks Emily!",5.0

I think they should ask when you put your name on the list is sitting at the bar an okay option. Some people might want a back to their seat or to face their people while eating.

I even did a pizza tour in Italy.  Pizza and I are intimate. Perhaps the more unique pizzas are where all the buzz is coming from...Honey, goat cheese, pepperoni kinda pies.

"Arrived at Emily Saturday evening at 6:30 and had an hour wait for a party of two. They take your number and text you when your table is ready. The restaurant is small and noisy, and my friend and I were seated at the bar a little over an hour later. I started with a delicious red wine on tap and ordered the curried carrots as an appetizer. This was an interesting dish, served cold and on a bed of grains. It was healthy at best. We split their signature burger on a pretzel bun, which was cooked to perfection, and the Wrestler pizza with pepperoni, olives and mushrooms. Both entrees were good, but I'm not sure they were worth the wait.",3.0
"This burger is truly one of the best I have ever had period. The fact that there also serving up amazing pizza along with it is beyond me, but hey I'm not complaining. They're pizza flavors are unique but go in with an open mind and you will not regret it. Check this place out ASAP and don't be surprised if it is crowded and they've run out of burgers.",5.0
"The Colony pizza is honestly the best pizza I've ever had, we had it 2 nights ago and I'm still thinking about it.-1 star because they were out of the burger and I really wanted to try it",4.0
"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! We had the burgers and the whole plate, from the taste to its arrangement didn't disappoint. Whatever the sauce is on the burger is awesome. The space is a little small, super loud and no reservations for groups under 6. But, definitely worth trying on a non weekend night.",4.0
"I went to Emily again last night with a group of 6 and we made a reservation for 5:30 (a little early but skipped the wait) and got a great ""chef's table"" by the pizza oven, in the kitchen. Emily was in the kitchen that night and was super friendly, the pizza was delish and she gave us an extra the kitchen had made by accident. Such a fun night, my group of 6 all picked one of the dishes as the best they ever had between the banana pudding, chicken wings, and colony pizza. Request the table by the oven if you have a big group!",5.0
"Oh wow, what can I say about the pizza at Emily? You will continue thinking about it long after your meal is over. The Colony has officially become my favorite pizza in NYC. It lived up to the hype. Go here, and be prepared to wait. But the wait will be worth it!",5.0
"Don't be that guy and order the burger.  I did...  Probably the saltiest most under cooked burger (rare) that I've ever had.  The description on the menu was amazing & the waitress told me it was a good choice.  The restaurant was jammed packed and we were under the gun to dine quick otherwise I would've returned the burger.  Just stick with the pizza and you'll be happy.  Gave it 3 stars because pizza is good, not great but good.  Lesson learned, if you go to a pizza joint stick to the pizza and don't be daring.",3.0
"LOVE this place.they have unique, creative pizzas, like the namesake.On our second visit, we tried the burger, which was great!",5.0
"Great pizza !! great burger !! Nice little establishment definitely is worth a visit. Emily greets kindly and make sure all is well. Air condition is a big issue but I'm sure they will get that fixed, because sweating through an hour while consuming a colony is not a good time at all.",3.0
"I liked that Emily's pies weren't Neapolitan. It was refreshing. Too often pizzerias are either lumped into slice-type joints or Neapolitans. While I'm not knocking the latter, it's hard to argue against their homogeneity, differentiated only by how far they can push the toppings envelope or how closely they tack to tradition.Emily is a welcome middle ground. The pies are slightly larger than you'd find at a Neapolitan pizzeria, and their crusts are more dense than the more pillowy foundations found at the high-end pizza restaurants.We ordered a Lady something or other white pie and a Emilza green pie. The tomatillo base on the green pies could be roughly described as a taco pizza. It was great. The white pie was excellent, too. Definitely could eat this every day, and I'll be back for another round, maybe to try one of these honey-drizzeled pizzas.",5.0
"I actually came for the pizza due to my never ending quest for a pie that blows me away but left feeling meh about the pizza and ""it doesn't get any better"" about the burger! We showed up when the doors opened on Labor Day thinking it might be kinda empty but there was still a line. The place is small but we were seated right away. The service is Brooklyn casual which totally works, everyone was friendly. We decided to try just about everything on the menu I mean seriously, we traveled all the way from Hell's Kitchen for this! We started with a surprisingly good bottle of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo. Next up the food. The kale salad was a miss and I like kale so this was the only slight disappointment but we certainly weren't there for the greens. We ordered the burger and it  definitely lives up to the hype with the fries being great too! The meat is high quality cooked perfectly medium rare, the sauce is yummy; no need for any other condiments and the pretzel roll puts it over the top. Next up the wings...hmmm...wasn't a HUGE fan of these but hey, I'm a Buffalo gal so.... I wish they were split like buffalo wings but the blue cheese was a very good fancy rendition. For pizza we ordered the special that was basically a buffalo chicken pizza, I wouldn't have ordered that as I'm a pizza purist but I was overruled by the table and it was definitely good. We also ordered the pizza with pepperoni and a touch of honey which is like the 1986 at GG's. The pizzas were good, don't get me wrong but I'm all about the charred bottom which seems so elusive and neither of these pizzas changed that. I would definitely recommend Emily's ESPECIALLY for the burger but not sure I'd trek all the way to BK and wait inline for the pizzas.",4.0
"Definitely a fan! I arrived on a Saturday night at about 7pm or so and the wait wasn't bad at all. table was just paying and we were quickly seated by Emily herself! It's not a big place and I'm pretty sure as it gets more popular the wait will get really long. I had the Colony and the name sake Emily. Both were amazing!! I appreciated the twist on the Colony with the pickled chili. They make their pies a little different so it's not just a copy of the famed Roberta's bee sting. The namesake Emily was so different from any pie I've ever had with the truffled cheese. Delicioso!! Crust was just a tad too thick for my preference but nevertheless I still loved the pies. I really wanted to order the smores calzone, but it looked ginormous for two people. We ended up bringing home most of the two pies anyway. I'll certainly be returning to try other pies and the calzone! I'm pretty sure Emily is going to blow up sooner than later.",4.0

Our group of four tried the Colony (pickled chili, pepperoni, tomato sauce, mozzarella, and honey) and the  Emily (mozzarella, pistachios, truffle sottocenere, honey). They were both so, so, so, so good. I usually try to savor my food rather than inhaling it, but I couldn't stop myself with these pizzas. We also sampled the Brooklyn Bangers sausage (sausage with grits and house relish). It was quite good, but I could check out another of the small plates next time. The drinks are great as well; I tried the leaning fields (lavender lemonade and vodka) and loved it. Finally, I really appreciated the friendly service. We showed up on a Saturday at 8:30 and were told we'd have about a 45-minute wait (I was expecting much worse).

"First visit was fantastic. Service was quick, attentive and friendly. The pasta with duck ragu, which unfortunately is no longer on the menu, was absolutely superb - perfectly al dente with a light but flavorful sauce. The Colony pie had a good balance of flavors from the richness of the pepperoni, the tart/spiciness of the pickled chilies and the sweetness of the honey. Ordered the burger, which has been getting a lot of praise from the press lately and the Emily pie on my second visit. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare but unfortunately the liberal use of salt, the EMMY sauce, the cheddar and the dense pretzel bun drowned out the any flavor I would've gotten from the dry aged beef. The Emily pie was delicious and decadent with truffle and honey, but would've preferred the pistachios to be more coarsely chopped to add a textural contrast to the mozzarella. Overall, a good restaurant if you live or happen to be in the area and don't mind a wait, the occasional snippy attitude from the staff and eating in tight spaces.",4.0
"If you find yourself asking, ""Did I just go all the way out to Brooklyn so that Emily could sprinkle crushed pistachios on honey soaked burnt crust and call it a self-titled revolution?"" then I sincerely hope you didn't use up your weekly calorie allowance following it up with the S'more Calzone. The two highlights of the place are: the solid drink menu - if you do a good job at taking advantage of that, the rest of this review becomes less relevant - and the burgers, although anything tastes great topped with caramelized onions and placed between two pretzel buns (even that would have spiced up the S'more Calzone a bit).The overcrowded and underwhelming cramped space makes you wonder whether you're in Clinton, Brooklyn or the box that Tilda Swinton slept in at MoMA...of course Tilda Swinton just ordered Dominos and had a fine evening.",2.0

Get a reservation if you've got more than 2.Pizzas about the size of a car steering wheel, prices range from $14-19, and absolutely worth the price of admission. I was under a lot of pressure too. The buddy I was with doesn't have the New York experience that I do, and absolutely insisted that we get GOOD New York pizza for dinner. Emily saved my reputation.Every single pizza is thoughtfully crafted. The ""Colony,"" which is indeed named after the one and only Colony Grill in Stamford, was the star of the show. Sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, jalapenos, pickled chili sauce, and a honey drizzle finish.*makes ""mind blown"" gesture*What the WHAT? All of it on daily fresh made dough, fired super hot, a little of that good New Haven-style burnt edge, served with a smile. The RM3 was also an excellent pie, which you might call their ""meat lover's.""If you're in the Barclay's Center area, it's a 10 minute walk. You must go.",5.0
Small but great place the burger was great!  Pizza w sausage just solid nothing great & pepperoni was good but not exceptional.  My wife ordered the Emzies pizza w/o onions and it was incredible!  Great flavor that just blows up in your mouth we will be back.  Worth the wait & nice atmosphere we had a good time,5.0
"First visit was fantastic. Service was quick, attentive and friendly. The pasta with duck ragu, which unfortunately is no longer on the menu, was absolutely superb - perfectly al dente with a light but flavorful sauce. The Colony pie had a good balance of flavors from the richness of the pepperoni, the tart/spiciness of the pickled chilies and the sweetness of the honey. Ordered the burger, which has been getting a lot of praise from the press lately and the Emily pie on my second visit. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare but unfortunately the liberal use of salt, the EMMY sauce, the cheddar and the dense pretzel bun drowned out the any flavor I would've gotten from the dry aged beef. The Emily pie was delicious and decadent with truffle and honey, but would've preferred the pistachios to be more coarsely chopped to add a textural contrast to the mozzarella. Overall, a good restaurant if you live or happen to be in the area and don't mind a wait, the occasional snippy attitude from the staff and eating in tight spaces.",4.0
"If you find yourself asking, ""Did I just go all the way out to Brooklyn so that Emily could sprinkle crushed pistachios on honey soaked burnt crust and call it a self-titled revolution?"" then I sincerely hope you didn't use up your weekly calorie allowance following it up with the S'more Calzone. The two highlights of the place are: the solid drink menu - if you do a good job at taking advantage of that, the rest of this review becomes less relevant - and the burgers, although anything tastes great topped with caramelized onions and placed between two pretzel buns (even that would have spiced up the S'more Calzone a bit).The overcrowded and underwhelming cramped space makes you wonder whether you're in Clinton, Brooklyn or the box that Tilda Swinton slept in at MoMA...of course Tilda Swinton just ordered Dominos and had a fine evening.",2.0
"Their pizza and service are always consistently good! The kale salad is also on point. Even when I venture outside of my usual Colony and Emily pizza orders to try whatever specials they have going on, I'm never disappointed. Solid pizza option, especially if you don't want a dollar slice, a tourist hole or to deal with the wait/scene at Roberta's.",5.0

"This was not worth the trek out to Clinton Hill (from Manhattan) for us. There was an hour-long wait around 6pm on a Saturday although we didn't mind and the servers were very nice. We went next door to Hanson Dry for a drink and that was actually an awesome bar with some great cocktails...We split a pasta and a pizza for dinner. Both were decent, but not great. We were very excited to try the s'mores calzone for dessert, but didn't like it at all. It was enormous! Way too large for two people. It was basically the same dough as pizza... way too much crust relative to the chocolate and marshmallows inside. I kind of dug out the insides to get at the small part with the most chocolate and then we left the rest.",3.0
"Wow. I admit, I'm flummoxed by the high ratings for this place. All I can conclude is that Brooklynites really like their salt!The food here was abysmal. We got the Brussels sprouts, which we had to send back to the kitchen because they were inedible (and I never send stuff back, I hate to waste the food!). When we told the waitress it was too salty, she had the balls to condescendingly tell us (two Asian women, no less), ""Oh, no, it's because of the fish sauce."" I had to break it to her that we knew what fish sauce was.We also ordered a salad, pizza, and pasta. The pizza was all right, but still too salty (though nothing near the sprouts), as was the pasta. I thought I was going to walk out with kidney failure by the end of the meal.The only reason this place got 2 stars and not one is because they ended up taking the sprouts off the bill.",2.0

"Writing this review to address a specific set of issues.The food at Emily is very good and the love they've put into curating their menu and cooking their food is evident. It's also obvious that between the ingredients they use and the realities of Brooklyn real estate, they need to charge certain prices to keep the lights on. The prices at Emily are not unreasonable, nor do they smack of greed (see: Franny's), but they are at a level that sets certain expectations of service and this is where the issues arise.Because their clientele is an amalgam of walk-ins and reservations, the hostess has a very hard job- she has to balance being charming with denying people seating. I can sympathize with this. The problem is that meanwhile, the owners/management are granting reservations over email and then neglecting to clue in the hostess. So then she's in an awkward position and the arriving party who confirmed their seating with owners has one set of expectations and the hostess has another. I've seen reviews here that assail the surliness of the hostess. My guess is that a certain point comes every night beyond which the stress of trying to make 100 people happy when you only have room for 25 begins to filter out through subsequent customer interactions. Alright, so let's say you do sit down to eat. Now you wait, first for attention, then for drinks, and then the food comes out in dribs and drabs- some pies showing up surprisingly quickly, while others arrive when you're ready for the check. Again, there are probably perfectly valid explanations for why this is happening, but I don't think it's unreasonable of a customer to prefer sitting down, eating and paying without having to cut slack for nearly every non-food aspect of their experience at a place where they're likely to spend upwards of $40/pp. I would never tell anyone not to eat at Emily, I certainly intend to go back and try some of the pizzas we haven't had yet, but I really do wish that they held their customer service to a higher standard. It's clear they face obstacles to running what might be their ideal restaurant, but it's worth developing work-arounds to those for the sake of customers' experience beyond eating food.",3.0

"I have been chasing an awesome burger for what seems like a year now--I've had several disappointing burgers in this time that have only increased my cravings. It was all worth the wait and the mediocre versions when I finally had the burger to end all burgers Saturday night, the Emmy burger.  It was absolutely perfectly cooked, covered in caramelized onions with a delicious tasty sauce on the side.  Definitely ask for more sauce--it's too good not to use liberally.  The fries that came with my burger were also top notch.  The rest of our dining experience was pretty great as well--although it seemed like it took way too long to get our food (particularly since two other couples around us who sat down at the same time were paying by the time we got our food), the bartender/server (we were seated at the bar) clearly realized that this was an issue and offered another round of drinks on the house.  Honestly now I'm reconsidering my original stance on the pizza--a few of the white pies that the went by looked too good not to try!  Emily, I will be back!",4.0
"I love having this place in the neighborhood. Usually I go on a week night and sit at the bar. Everyone working is friendly and accommodating. I'm not generally a fan of fancy pizza, but Emily seems to do it just right. My favorites are the The Wrestler and The Emily. They have a good beer selection and wine on tap. Also, try the s'mores calzone for dessert. Yum!  This place is a keeper :)",5.0
"Superb. The staff can be a bit snooty at times (telling my table at like 5:55 than ""some important media people are coming at 7:30"" and so we need to eat fast... like WTF?... and also in their tone when you're waiting on a table) but the food redeems all here.A great spot. From the Emzies to the Colony to the Lady Pizza Girl to the Emily everyone has enjoyed the pizzas here time and time again. The Emily can sometimes be a bit heavy or inconsistent on the honey, and the Emzies varies based on the type/cut of the olives, but at the end of the day, you walk in here and get some of the best pizza anywhere in the world at a reasonable price.I'm typically a pizza purist - that is, I like simple fresh ingredients and at most joints I'll order a margherita or the equivalent. But Emily's is hands-down the place that shine's brightest in my mind for the inventive ingredient combinations. (Having tried all of Paulie Gee, Roberta, Lucali, Grimaldi, Juliana's, etc. - this definitely wins for this style of pizza).It's a wood-burning oven but it has some of the elements that make the coal-oven pizza of New York so special. The crust isn't too puffy and doesn't try to play Neapolitan too hard, which in my mind is a plus. Some of the other joints above nail that (e.g., Roberta), but others (e.g. Paulie Gee) whiff because of the odd uncomfortable hybrid of their toppings with their dry charred crust. Emily's overall is instead very New York-Neapolitan, and it's worth the wait and the trip.",5.0

"This place is a very good representation of New York City itself. Crowded, overpriced, overrated, and full of white people. Emily seems to have some of the most effective blogging/social media marketing I have seen since the ramen burger. The most popular menu item here, like many pizza places, is the hamburger. Luckily they run out of hamburgers at 8:30pm during the week so if you get here at 8, wait the 45 minutes to get a table and find out you will not be getting a hamburger, you get to watch those more privileged than you eat theirs  while enjoying your mediocre neopolitan pizza. Which there must be a shortage of in this city because all of these basic girls seem to be take the same bus from the Upper East Side and getting off at Clinton Hill (it's a ""cultural experience"" for them to be in Brooklyn at all) to take instagram pictures of their food as some kind of proof of consumption on social media. But that's expected, their bodies feed on instagram likes, not actual food sitting in front of them.And that is what's really wrong with Emily...without the NYC food trend hype machine, this would be just another mediocre pizza place in a gentrifying part of Brooklyn. But a few bloggers/social media personalities pick it up, people don't want to miss an ""it"" spot, they give it undeserving 5 star reviews on yelp, and people who disagree think they just lack the palette to enjoy such a renowned restaurant so they too give it a glowing review and the whole thing feeds off of itself ad infinitum. The restaurant compounds the hype and exclusivity by limiting the supply of their most popular item to a handful per day.

"No question about quality of the pizza - other reviewers have expounded upon those topics abundantly, and I agree with them.  We've had just about every pizza on the menu, and they're all fantastic.  Special shoutout for the Quinn five cheese white pizza.This 5-star is for the service we've received the 10 or so times I've been to Emily since they opened. Last night was maybe even the best, as I made a reservation for 8 and they held the back table in the kitchen for us. It was really cool to watch every pizza go into the oven and every meal get plated. They put a lot of care into the product and the way the kitchen runs.They've got super-friendly people, many of the same employees from when they opened as far as I can tell.  And it shows through a really cool culture of workers at the restaurant. We've seen them joke, dance, and enjoy each other, and it carries over to fun interactions with patrons.This is how a small business should run, and I love the way they do it at Emily.",5.0

When she took time to look up from the seating chart to take my  to go order, I asked for the classic with basil and she insisted I meant to order another pizza that had a completely different cheese.  I asked if I could grab a glass of water at the bar she told me she was seating the bar and I was ""welcome to hang by the door."" I told her I would grab my water and come back. When  I went to the bar to get the water the bartender acted like I asked for Evan from the Alps and seemed confused that I asked for water since I wasn't dining in.

"This was good, but not mind blowing.  I think you can get a better brick oven pizza at other places in Brooklyn.",2.0
"Emily, I love your restaurant. It is a true neighborhood gem and I am so lucky to live nearby. And I LOVE your pizza! The Colony is easily one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Just two requests:1. Bring back the Little Gems Caesar salad (it was the best one!)2. Turn down the music (it is too loud to have a conversation)The rest is perfect!",5.0
"No question about quality of the pizza - other reviewers have expounded upon those topics abundantly, and I agree with them.  We've had just about every pizza on the menu, and they're all fantastic.  Special shoutout for the Quinn five cheese white pizza.This 5-star is for the service we've received the 10 or so times I've been to Emily since they opened. Last night was maybe even the best, as I made a reservation for 8 and they held the back table in the kitchen for us. It was really cool to watch every pizza go into the oven and every meal get plated. They put a lot of care into the product and the way the kitchen runs.They've got super-friendly people, many of the same employees from when they opened as far as I can tell.  And it shows through a really cool culture of workers at the restaurant. We've seen them joke, dance, and enjoy each other, and it carries over to fun interactions with patrons.This is how a small business should run, and I love the way they do it at Emily.",5.0
"The burger is at the top of all NYC burgers. I also had the Emily pizza with sausage- delicious. The brownie sundae was only ok- I don't recommend it. Also, the straws are made of paper- which is kind of gross.",5.0
"Great pizza! Horrible hostess! When she took time to look up from the seating chart to take my  to go order, I asked for the classic with basil and she insisted I meant to order another pizza that had a completely different cheese.  I asked if I could grab a glass of water at the bar she told me she was seating the bar and I was ""welcome to hang by the door."" I told her I would grab my water and come back. When  I went to the bar to get the water the bartender acted like I asked for Evan from the Alps and seemed confused that I asked for water since I wasn't dining in. I was initially told my order would take 20-25 minutes but the hostess came to the bar and told me that my order would be expedited. I'm pretty sure it was get me out of there but that's fine, I didn't want to wait 25 minutes for my pizza anyway.  Emily, please let your hostess know that being rude and condescending is no way to treat customers who dare to enter without a reservation!",4.0
"This is an amazing restaurant! We shared Emily's pizza which was pistachio, honey, and truffle oil, the vodka pizza and Emily's burger and it was all amazing! The food was delicious, ingredients seemed really fresh and they were cooked to perfection! The staff was very friendly and courteous and the atmosphere was great! Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice meal in Brooklyn!",5.0
I love Emily's! It's oh so delicious! I've been here a handful of times now and I have to say I've never once been disappointed! Plus the owner is so sweet. Highly recommend this place!,5.0

"I was here for the first time in February or March of this year and had the burger -- and loved it (surely one of the best I had ever had--I even found it worth the extravagant $19, that's since gone up to $21!). Tried the pizza too and it was definitely exciting with some of their more daring combinations and the fashionable honey--but not great. Even back then, the service wasn't very good and we left with the impression this was the assembly-line approach to dining and service. I've been back there a couple of times in the last weeks and discovered that the service takes even longer now and generally doesn't make for a pleasurable experience. Everyone is crazy busy and stressed out, which prolongs the waits and tends to make even occasional friendly gestures feel a bit passive-aggressive. Now, the main problem is the pizza is not actually very good... The dough is tough rather than crispy and delicate and the toppings (although, to be fair, some are really very good) tend to be super salty which kills off pretty much any other flavor except for the most picante (and don't get me wrong, I like salty and I'm liberal with my sodium). So, in terms of its main product, this place, in my opinion, is fa-a-ar behind spots like Paulie Gee's, or Barboncino and Speedy Romeo's, where they also like to slap you around a bit, to be fair -- but where even the simplest pies are delicious. That's how you know s good pizza, right?In other words, it seems that struck by sudden fame and determined to squeeze what they can out of the establishment, they're on a fast track to wasting it all by trying to bite more than they can chew -- forgetting the dough is tough as hide and the toppings salty. Not worth coming back.",2.0
"The good:Cute and cozy spot, nice brick oven, interesting pizza options, nice branding that doesn't feel like a traditional fancy pizza place.The not-so-good:We ordered food to go so we could eat it with friends over at Hot Bird, but the food took w-a-y longer than the 7 to 9-minute wait the hostess quoted. And when the food did arrive (without napkins), it was pretty lackluster. The sad little $9 portion of sugar snap peas could barely last beyond two bites. The William pizza, while flavorful, was kind of cold and soggy. Oh, and because waiting for our food took so long, we lost our table at Hot Bird and ended up having to eat our dinner on a random street bench. In the dark.",2.0

"I'm not entirely sure who came up with the namesake pizza at Emily -- but when we figure out who came up with that delicious combination of sweet-savoury-salty-nutty, I want to kiss them for creating what is essentially the biggest gamechanger of pizzas I've had in my entire life.Aside from having our minds blown into oblivion by the Emily, our table also shared the Colony and the RM3! Each had their own unique and outstanding characteristics that separated it from the others. My next favourite would be the Colony, which was a surprisingly tasty mix of pickled chilis and honey on a red pie. For meatlovers, the RM3! is what you want -- it has what my friend calls ""all the meat you could ever dream of"" which is essentially a solid portion of sausage, pepperoni, and ham.Besides the food, the atmosphere is very pleasant, with lots of table space for everyone and plenty of drink options on the menu. Our waitress was also extremely pleasant and enjoyed our geeky humour so much that she asked us to come back with more of our friends. Personally, I'm already planning my next trip back for another dose of the Emily. If you have half a brain in your head, you will order this pie and thoroughly enjoy how amazing it is.",5.0
"Came here last night with 4 friends who all love pizza. We've been anxious to try this place and for the most part it didn't disappoint - we had about a 40 minute wait in a nearby bar and there were 5 of us put at a table for 4 which made it rather cosy, but it's a tiny place and I understand that. What I didn't understand is why the hostess was pretty surly with my friend, and once I knew this, when we finally did get our table, I walked in with a big smile and hello to her - she looked at me as if I had antlers. Luckily our waitress was super nice but really, the FOH is a pretty important position, and the treatment we got there might keep us from returning.Pizza was amazing though - we all left happy and with some yummy leftovers for lunch today.",4.0

For the Whites, we always get the namesake, The Emily. It comes with mozzarella, pistachios, truffle sottocenere, and honey. It. Is. Amazing. I mean, really.

I don't know, maybe if new style means completely burnt pizza then OK. Maybe it's because the place is so dark that the poor pizza guy can't see what's going on with his  pizza. But seriously as european who's been in italy many times (from north to south) I am completely fine with a little burnt edges that's something that comes naturally and is wanted but this pizza (actually three pizzas) were way too burnt and had color and taste of coal. If it hadn't been burnt I believe it could be good.But at the end the pizza slice from those cheap shitty places at every corner was better experience then this new style pancake.",2.0

Then I read the negative reviews complaining about being asked to keep a screaming baby quiet, about not getting prompt take out pizza, and about how Williamsburg has infected Clinton Hill. And I was reminded how awful restaurants are where they don't try to minimize screaming kids, where they prioritize pick ups and deliveries over those customers who are eating in, and the snobbery and poor service of many wburg joints.

Drinks were a little pricey but the wine selection is decent and the cocktails are totally worth the extra couple bucks. I got the Leaning Fields- a homemade lavender lemonade spiked with vodka- and it was every bit as amazing as it sounds.We got there around 5:30pm on a Saturday and it was mostly families with little kids, but I have a feeling the scene is much different around 8 or 9, with the fully stocked bar I saw in back.

"Great pizza & desserts. I'd give em 5 stars, but had an issue with one staff member who is there frequently.",4.0
"Don't bother. The problem is the wet, flabby, and pointless ""crust."" Ruins what might otherwise be decent pizza. Why can't they keep the crust crisp? On the plus side, the salads are fresh and spare. Service is fine; space is unremarkable. Not at all worth the trip from Manhattan.",2.0
"Yes! My boyfriend and I went to Emily last night and it was fantastic. We got the Colony and the Lady Pizza Girl at the recommendation of other Yelpers, and they were both tasty and interesting. I had never had honey on pizza before, and it's definitely something I'll be trying at home in the near future! The two pizzas were enough for our meal and we still had some left over for lunch today.The service was wonderful, and a woman named Emily (maybe the owner?) checked in on us a couple of times to see that we were doing alright. The decor was nice, and the selection of music was also fantastic. The place is a little pricey, but it was worth it for the awesome pizza and the cozy atmosphere.",4.0
"I invited my two friends to this place after reading some good reviews and visiting emily's website. The girl at door was really friendly (she actually came to the bar next door to tell us our table is ready) But that was the only good thing.Website describes the pizza as ""new style"". I don't know, maybe if new style means completely burnt pizza then OK. Maybe it's because the place is so dark that the poor pizza guy can't see what's going on with his  pizza. But seriously as european who's been in italy many times (from north to south) I am completely fine with a little burnt edges that's something that comes naturally and is wanted but this pizza (actually three pizzas) were way too burnt and had color and taste of coal. If it hadn't been burnt I believe it could be good.But at the end the pizza slice from those cheap shitty places at every corner was better experience then this new style pancake.",2.0
"Went there for the first time last night and was greeted by Emily herself. Had camp Randall, Angelina, and banana pudding for dessert. I was going to give this place four stars for friendly service, delicious pizza and wine, and a great (though a tad too loud) atmosphere. Then I read the negative reviews complaining about being asked to keep a screaming baby quiet, about not getting prompt take out pizza, and about how Williamsburg has infected Clinton Hill. And I was reminded how awful restaurants are where they don't try to minimize screaming kids, where they prioritize pick ups and deliveries over those customers who are eating in, and the snobbery and poor service of many wburg joints. And am increasingly thankful that Emily was not any of those things. So 5 stars it is!",5.0
"super cute place with yummy food! i've had a number of their pizzas now (two visits in two weeks) and the standout is the ""emily"" pizza (honey & pistachio, whattttt!!!) and the smores calzone. also, they have wine on draft (always fun) and they have very friendly staff. totally a great place to hit up in clinton hill!minor quibbles: i definitely liked the pizza more than the pasta and the dough is a smidgen salty but I also am not huge on copious amounts of salt so..take it with a grain of... you know, nevermind...",4.0
"as discussed elsewhere, the food here is really amazing.  special props to the RM3 and the Emily.  note that you should avoid the green pizzas if you don't like spicy food.i'm mostly writing this review because i wanted to specially note that the staff here is among the friendliest & most helpful i have ever experienced in brooklyn. mad ups.",5.0
"This place is awesome, can't believe this was tucked away on Fulton street and I never knew about it till now!We got the Angelina (white pizza with kale, ricotta and lemon) and some other white pizza with ricotta,  mozzarella and sausage. The crust was perfectly thin and the toppings were refreshingly creative without being too much. Drinks were a little pricey but the wine selection is decent and the cocktails are totally worth the extra couple bucks. I got the Leaning Fields- a homemade lavender lemonade spiked with vodka- and it was every bit as amazing as it sounds.We got there around 5:30pm on a Saturday and it was mostly families with little kids, but I have a feeling the scene is much different around 8 or 9, with the fully stocked bar I saw in back. Didn't notice any outdoor seating but maybe it's too early in the season?Overall great experience, I'll definitely be back!",5.0

When we asked for the check, it came right away and we didn't feel pressured to get dessert or any other drinks.Food (all pizzas have ammmmaaazing dough)-The Colony Pizza - delicious blend of spicy and sweet. Never had a pizza with honey as a topping but it worked so well to calm down the spicy from the peppers.-The Emily - pistachios, truffle, and a whole bunch of other goodness. A little too oily due to the truffle oil but it was still delicious with a nutty texture from the pistachios.-The Special - the night's special had a combo of white sauce, brussel sprouts, and some kind of meat. This was my favorite one of the night. I might be a little biased because I love brussel sprouts.Would I go back? Yes. I see this as a great spot to catch up with friends or to bring a first date.

"These are initial pizza impressions only and should be 3.5 starsI tried the Luca and Olympus Mons. Something seems unusual about the crust. It's very flat, yet pliant. I think they're using 00 flour but perhaps are not proofing it overnight? There's almost no puff that you see at places like Saraghina, Roberta's or Paulie Gees. Last night they might have been having temperature control problems with the oven... the char is pronounced but the pizza didn't have the snap or rigidity I expected from the color.  Tomato sauce had a high acidity but needed some olive oil. Couldn't tell where they came from.  The service was very nice and the pizza came quickly.   I really like the wine list and will be back to test out more dishes.  Best",3.0
"Made a reservation for an early dinner Saturday night and was lucky enough to be seated in the back where we watched all the action unfold in the open kitchen. This was also a rustic and warm spot to enjoy a quiet conversation. The courteous and friendly staff made great suggestions and got everything to us at the perfect time. I had a deliciously complex gin-cocktail (the Winglet) while my boyfriend enjoyed a rich chocolatey wine. We opened with the Stix, which gives you the chance to appreciate the crispy-yet-chewy texture of the dough against a simple, delightful garlic/basil flavor combination. We then moved onto the Camp Randall and the Emily. We agreed that the Camp Randall was rather standard, but that the Emily was truly outstanding and worthy of a namesake pizza. The flavor combination of the honey and truffle sottocenere worked wonderfully, while the pistachios offered a surprising crunch and further complemented the truffle flavor with their nuttiness.  At this point, we really didn't have much space left in our bellies... Though, we couldn't really leave without trying the S'mores Calzone, having watched so many of them puff up in the oven. This proved a good decision--the chocolate was perfectly dark, not too sweet, and made a perfect end to a lovely meal.Overall, Emily was a great dining experience--charming, delicious, and filled with hardworking, friendly people. We'll be back!",5.0
"SO I made the mistake of my life and decided to listen to instagram and time out New York and pay Emily's a visit for either their famed burger or pizza. If only I had been able to experience the food. The place was packed. Understandable. I was told it was over an hour's wait. I asked if I could get a seat at the bar which did look packed from the entrance and was told the bar is part of the wait list seating. Holy Cow. . Now to the problem and the reason why I am giving a one star rating. The hostess from hell. Maybe she was having a bad day, whatever it was I do not know but she was very very rude, smarmy and unfriendly. I attempted to order a pizza and wings to go and the way I was treated and addressed made me demand my money back and leave in a huff, humiliated, and I will NEVER go back. I have lived in NYC for most of my adult life, and I have a thick skin but she was downright evil in the way she addressed me and how she almost spat in my face as she told me I could  'wait outside for my food, it's a beautiful day', when I asked where I could wait for my food. If I didn't know better I would say maybe they just don't like a certain kind of people in the restaurant, I don't know.  I KNOW I will not be giving any establishment my money that won't treat me with dignity. It is 2015 for heaven's sake - I can do that. They are there because of gentrification and yet they treat people with distrespect. Great job.",1.0

"Pizza was good but not worth a trip or wait. Wish we didn't try the burger. Too saucy sweet, couldn't taste the meat. Needed something to balance the greasiness and sweetness, and a few cornichons were not enough.",3.0

"Hands down my favorite place in the neighborhood, and probably my favorite pizza in NYC.  Even the plain cheese is divine.  I'm in love with the kale salad, too.  And the waitstaff is friendly and efficient.  The downside is the inevitable wait for a table, but I'm glad to see this place is popular.  It deserves to be.",5.0
"These are initial pizza impressions only and should be 3.5 starsI tried the Luca and Olympus Mons. Something seems unusual about the crust. It's very flat, yet pliant. I think they're using 00 flour but perhaps are not proofing it overnight? There's almost no puff that you see at places like Saraghina, Roberta's or Paulie Gees. Last night they might have been having temperature control problems with the oven... the char is pronounced but the pizza didn't have the snap or rigidity I expected from the color.  Tomato sauce had a high acidity but needed some olive oil. Couldn't tell where they came from.  The service was very nice and the pizza came quickly.   I really like the wine list and will be back to test out more dishes.  Best",3.0
"Made a reservation for an early dinner Saturday night and was lucky enough to be seated in the back where we watched all the action unfold in the open kitchen. This was also a rustic and warm spot to enjoy a quiet conversation. The courteous and friendly staff made great suggestions and got everything to us at the perfect time. I had a deliciously complex gin-cocktail (the Winglet) while my boyfriend enjoyed a rich chocolatey wine. We opened with the Stix, which gives you the chance to appreciate the crispy-yet-chewy texture of the dough against a simple, delightful garlic/basil flavor combination. We then moved onto the Camp Randall and the Emily. We agreed that the Camp Randall was rather standard, but that the Emily was truly outstanding and worthy of a namesake pizza. The flavor combination of the honey and truffle sottocenere worked wonderfully, while the pistachios offered a surprising crunch and further complemented the truffle flavor with their nuttiness.  At this point, we really didn't have much space left in our bellies... Though, we couldn't really leave without trying the S'mores Calzone, having watched so many of them puff up in the oven. This proved a good decision--the chocolate was perfectly dark, not too sweet, and made a perfect end to a lovely meal.Overall, Emily was a great dining experience--charming, delicious, and filled with hardworking, friendly people. We'll be back!",5.0
"SO I made the mistake of my life and decided to listen to instagram and time out New York and pay Emily's a visit for either their famed burger or pizza. If only I had been able to experience the food. The place was packed. Understandable. I was told it was over an hour's wait. I asked if I could get a seat at the bar which did look packed from the entrance and was told the bar is part of the wait list seating. Holy Cow. . Now to the problem and the reason why I am giving a one star rating. The hostess from hell. Maybe she was having a bad day, whatever it was I do not know but she was very very rude, smarmy and unfriendly. I attempted to order a pizza and wings to go and the way I was treated and addressed made me demand my money back and leave in a huff, humiliated, and I will NEVER go back. I have lived in NYC for most of my adult life, and I have a thick skin but she was downright evil in the way she addressed me and how she almost spat in my face as she told me I could  'wait outside for my food, it's a beautiful day', when I asked where I could wait for my food. If I didn't know better I would say maybe they just don't like a certain kind of people in the restaurant, I don't know.  I KNOW I will not be giving any establishment my money that won't treat me with dignity. It is 2015 for heaven's sake - I can do that. They are there because of gentrification and yet they treat people with distrespect. Great job.",1.0

"This little tiny pizza place was incredible. Our group ordered three pizzas and they were all excellent. For a place that serves brunch and lunch as well, it was surprisingly empty inside. I wish we could have tried more daring pizzas - some of them come with a light drizzle of honey that seems weird as a pizza topping but is surprisingly tasty. Definitely recommend this place!",5.0

"Here's how you lose 3 stars solely because of poor service. And by the owner, Emily Hyland, no less.   Last night, after a 45-minute wait, my boyfriend and I were seated at the bar. Fine, however, when we noticed not one, but two open two-seater tables, we asked the hostess if she wouldn't mind if we switched to a table. Uh oh, what ensued was nothing short of a passive-aggro fit, in which the hostess told us that a party of four was waiting for the table. The two-seater table in question was on the far end of the restaurant, next to just one other two-seater table, occupied by a couple who had just arrived. So if this was a space meant for 4 people, they'd have to wait another hour at least. Anyway, not even 5 minutes after we were seated -- and after the hostess once again reprimanded us for asking for a table, said party of 4 was seated at a table for -- you guessed it -- FOUR. We decided to fuggetaboutit and enjoy our night, BUT not before the hostess goes ""The next time you come to dinner here, you should specify that you prefer a table over a bar seat BEFORE I put your name on the wait list."" After dinner, the hostess returned to apologize to my boyfriend and tell him that she was in fact, the OWNER of Emily. Wait. It gets better. As we're eating dessert, she returns to give us two free glasses of champagne -- nice -- AND to inform us once more that she is the owner of Emily. I thought she might pull up a 3rd chair to sit and tell us yet again that she's the owner. Here's a tip: Treat your patrons with respect, and then you won't have to resort to freebies and phony small talk. Or better yet, hire an experienced hostess. All that said, the food was incredibly perfect. From the radishes in butter to the smoky carrots to the cavatelli -- and then finally, The Colony Pizza. But I just can't imagine eating there ever again -- or recommending it to friends for that matter. Thanks, Emily: The Owner.",2.0

"Umm...yes, yes, yes and more yes.We first ran into the owners of Emily when they co-opened Brooklyn Central in Park Slope. A few months of weekly (and sometimes daily) attendance followed, but we fell off the BC wagon during Hurricane Sandy (work was a bit hectic). Much to our sadness, when we returned, we discovered the owners had parted ways, and while we loved the food, much of what we enjoyed about BC was the atmosphere created by Emily as manager/hostess.Happily, the party's just moved a little uptown! Emily continues to serve most excellent pizza, and the cocktails aren't too shabby either! After our triumphal reunion with this fabulous food, we vowed to bring a group of friends with us...and we did!

However, the service is quite spotty and the sound levels are horrid. It's an incredibly hectic place to eat, let alone carry a conversation in.

"Great pizza addition to the neighborhood.  This was my second time here and it was just as good as the first time I tried it when it first opened.  Consistency is key.  This place is small, so be prepared to wait if you come during peak time. We arrived at 6 on a Sunday and were able to snag a seat at the bar, but even the bar seats filled up within 10 minutes of us sitting down.  Nice wine selection, and there is a large range  of bottle prices, but it would be nice  if they had more than 2 glass options for whites and 2 glass options for reds.  The sweet potato and sausage appetizer  was excellent.  So much flavor and spice and the cilantro complimented it well.  I had the duck ragu during my first visit, and that was also excellent. You cant go wrong with any pizza, we had the colony and it had the perfect balance of hot with the chilies and sweet with the honey. I am looking forward to trying some of the other pizzas, there are quite a few to choose from.",5.0
"I'm very spoiled with Pizza. Really, I have tried Lucali's, Di Fara's, John's at Bleekers, etc.Normally, I try the Margarita when I'm at a new place.

My wife and I was in a pizza mood and we heard of this Italian place about 10 minutes walk from us in Clinton Hill.We decided that we would have a glass of Wine and try something.I have to say we were blown away!First, the service was excellent! Very good, great atmosphere, nice decor and definitely friendly! It makes me feel like I am eating a nice meal with family (which I was, of course)!We saw some of the food being served and we though, ok, maybe we should try one of the specialty pizzas?When it comes to the best specialty pizza I have tried so far, well...... the Emily at Emily really did it for me! It put this Italian place on the map!The Emily was such a good white pizza with a combination of really nice cheese and other honey, etc. that we could not stop eating it!We had to try another one, the Colony. It was really good too. BUT, The Emily is currently my favorite of all specialty pizzas so far!We has 2 glasses of Cabernet. The wine was awesome! Just perfect.Just before the pizza, we tried the Kale salad. It was really enjoyable! Tasty with dried cherries, a really excellent combination!Anyway, just those dishes made this our Favorite Italian Pizza place to date!",5.0
"Cute neighborhood restaurant with a few 'pros' that set it above the rest in that category. Emilys has that hallway design of a lot of places; thin storefront that goes deep into the block. You can see the wood fired oven in the back and their menu is definitely pizza centric, but with a few pastas and some very good small plates and apps as well. Pizzas are all good if you like thin-crust but not super-crispy. Apps include a really nice selection of kale, snow peas, pig ears (chewy but awesome) and brussell sprouts. Above all that is that they are very friendly here. I have been by 3 times, the third time I came in for a light snack and was perpetually bothered by a crazy lady who got furious at me for not having a bite of her pizza, she was weird and left, and the staff were unbelievably apologetic and kind about it, more than was expected. Anyhow, brooklyn gets a bad rap for having too cool for school service in the restaurants, an unfortunate byproduct of being the more casual borough, Emilys is certainly a neighborhood place, and one I feel very comfortable visiting.",5.0

"Ive eaten at Emily's three times now.  The first time was beyond amazing.  The pizza dough is flavorful.  The crust is crispy and they have interesting toppings.  Ive ordered the pig ear salad which was delicious with crispy pig ears and nice accompanying greens.  The s'more calzone is huge and addictive.  I went for brunch and had the arctic char pizza.  It was good but could more cheese and less salt.  The last two times Ive gone there have been minimal growing pains such as long waits for food and missing toppings from my pizza.  Overall, Emily's is the best pizza Ive had in Brooklyn.  It is already becoming crazy popular and I forsee long waits in the not so distant future.",4.0

The cheese is cheesy. Seriously, perfect sauce and crust.  Possible best pizza in brooklyn?  You heard it here first.  Salad was good too. We will be back. Regularly. Welcome to the neighborhood, Emily.",5.0
"Great small pizza place, you better expect to wait for a table. Small cozy pizza place which is good for small groups of diners. The pizzas are made in a brick oven so they are top of the line. Save space for the dessert, i recommend you try the s'more calzone!",4.0
Gorgeous new space. The pizza was divine. Amazing flavor combinations.Waitstaff was attentive and recommended some yummy wines.Tried the colony which was delish--super spicy and sweet. The Emily (my fave) was out of this world. Definitely have the intention of trying all!,5.0
"Great pizza addition to the neighborhood.  This was my second time here and it was just as good as the first time I tried it when it first opened.  Consistency is key.  This place is small, so be prepared to wait if you come during peak time. We arrived at 6 on a Sunday and were able to snag a seat at the bar, but even the bar seats filled up within 10 minutes of us sitting down.  Nice wine selection, and there is a large range  of bottle prices, but it would be nice  if they had more than 2 glass options for whites and 2 glass options for reds.  The sweet potato and sausage appetizer  was excellent.  So much flavor and spice and the cilantro complimented it well.  I had the duck ragu during my first visit, and that was also excellent. You cant go wrong with any pizza, we had the colony and it had the perfect balance of hot with the chilies and sweet with the honey. I am looking forward to trying some of the other pizzas, there are quite a few to choose from.",5.0
"I'm very spoiled with Pizza. Really, I have tried Lucali's, Di Fara's, John's at Bleekers, etc.Normally, I try the Margarita when I'm at a new place. It's just simple and if a place makes a good one, then I will try a different pie later. My wife and I was in a pizza mood and we heard of this Italian place about 10 minutes walk from us in Clinton Hill.We decided that we would have a glass of Wine and try something.I have to say we were blown away!First, the service was excellent! Very good, great atmosphere, nice decor and definitely friendly! It makes me feel like I am eating a nice meal with family (which I was, of course)!We saw some of the food being served and we though, ok, maybe we should try one of the specialty pizzas?When it comes to the best specialty pizza I have tried so far, well...... the Emily at Emily really did it for me! It put this Italian place on the map!The Emily was such a good white pizza with a combination of really nice cheese and other honey, etc. that we could not stop eating it!We had to try another one, the Colony. It was really good too. BUT, The Emily is currently my favorite of all specialty pizzas so far!We has 2 glasses of Cabernet. The wine was awesome! Just perfect.Just before the pizza, we tried the Kale salad. It was really enjoyable! Tasty with dried cherries, a really excellent combination!Anyway, just those dishes made this our Favorite Italian Pizza place to date!",5.0
"Cute neighborhood restaurant with a few 'pros' that set it above the rest in that category. Emilys has that hallway design of a lot of places; thin storefront that goes deep into the block. You can see the wood fired oven in the back and their menu is definitely pizza centric, but with a few pastas and some very good small plates and apps as well. Pizzas are all good if you like thin-crust but not super-crispy. Apps include a really nice selection of kale, snow peas, pig ears (chewy but awesome) and brussell sprouts. Above all that is that they are very friendly here. I have been by 3 times, the third time I came in for a light snack and was perpetually bothered by a crazy lady who got furious at me for not having a bite of her pizza, she was weird and left, and the staff were unbelievably apologetic and kind about it, more than was expected. Anyhow, brooklyn gets a bad rap for having too cool for school service in the restaurants, an unfortunate byproduct of being the more casual borough, Emilys is certainly a neighborhood place, and one I feel very comfortable visiting.",5.0
"An exceptional time from the food to the service. Unique and delicious food in incredibly thoughtful combinations. Thanks, Emily!",5.0
"Had a great dinner here- fantastic pizza, the s'more pizza for dessert was a bit much but made a great late night snack later on. The service was excellent and reasonably priced. With service and food like this it is sure to be a success, I look forward to going back.",5.0
"Ive eaten at Emily's three times now.  The first time was beyond amazing.  The pizza dough is flavorful.  The crust is crispy and they have interesting toppings.  Ive ordered the pig ear salad which was delicious with crispy pig ears and nice accompanying greens.  The s'more calzone is huge and addictive.  I went for brunch and had the arctic char pizza.  It was good but could more cheese and less salt.  The last two times Ive gone there have been minimal growing pains such as long waits for food and missing toppings from my pizza.  Overall, Emily's is the best pizza Ive had in Brooklyn.  It is already becoming crazy popular and I forsee long waits in the not so distant future.",4.0
Went to Emily for the first time last night. Had to wait to get in which was a good sign. Got the wrestler and the colony pizza. Both were delicious but I liked the colony better. Staff was very friendly. Beer and wine selection was good but I hope they add some rotating beers on tap. Will definitely be back. A little on the pricey side for pizza but worth it.,5.0
"We usually have lunch here, given the long dinner wait times. The food is simply amazing, I'd place the pizzas almost on par with more well known places such as Roberta's. The new expanded menu offers more varieties, and everything we have tried out has been excellent.",5.0

Came here for Sunday brunch. Everything we tasted was delicious. We ordered the kale salad which was simple but tasty. The Emily pizza was the best. Followed by the Q. Would definitely come back for dinner to try the other items not offered for brunch.,5.0
"OK, someone downthread called it Williamsburg pizza and I have to agree... I am not a hater & if that's what you like by all means have a great time. The people are nice the prices are reasonable but I'm sorry it's just not my style. I am a native NYer and things like honey or duck fat are not pizza ingredients in my humble opinion.",2.0
"when tasting table sent me an email about this place, I was on it! As a pizza connoisseur that have been to Di Fara's, PaulyGee's, Roberta's, Grimaldi's and Franny's (unfortunately) this place is one classy act! unpretentious and full of personality, the food speak for itself! I cannot wait to bring my friends here from Manhattan and Astoria! thank you for the good work!  and don't forget to order the S'mores Calzone and Pizza Churros for dessert!!!! oh yes!!!",5.0
"The food was perfect. The wine was perfect. The atmosphere was perfect. The staff was perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. My friends and I tried some salads, cheeses, pizza and pasta. Everything we had was amazing and did not disappoint. The Emily pie is a must if you go here! My only regret is I didn't leave room to try the dessert. But that's okay because I will definitely be back!",5.0
"Awesome pie, but the most child unfriendly place in the neighborhood.  It's really a shame.  Would love to be a regular, but they are aggressively unfriendly if you have kids with you.",2.0
"Great addition to Fulton Street, great food, friendly staff, and a few doors down from Hanson Dry which is a real plus. First time there and we will add it to our list of local faves. You have to be really good at pizza to make ""the list"" in Brooklyn and this is great pizza.Only complaint is one I find most common lately, who wrote the loud music rule?",4.0
"This place is wonderful!! Ok let's get the part about the long wait out of the way. We showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday, we were a party of four. Emily was extremely kind as she explained that it looked like it might be a 2 hour wait. She suggested we head next door for drinks which we did and they were great! I popped in an hour after we put our name on the list just to see if anything changed, again Emily was so nice and let me know that it wouldn't be as long as she thought. A few minutes later she called and we had a table. the total wait was about an hour and 20 minutes. Normally this kind of thing could be annoying but the way Emily handles the room is great!!!  When we sat down the waitress was great and Emily kept checking in on us. The wine selection was great and fairly priced. We specifically went for pizza so we decided to spilt three different pies. The pizza combos were interesting and thoughtful but not overly complex. The Dough was great, the sauce was amazing and the cheeses!! wow the cheeses!!   To top the experience off Emily was kind enough to give us a ice cream sandwich because we waited a while for our table. Needless to say we will all be going back. The only problem with this restaurant is it is not in my neighborhood.",5.0
