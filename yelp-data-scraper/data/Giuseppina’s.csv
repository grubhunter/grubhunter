"Do you want to eat an amazing pizza, in an amazing location, with an amazing staff? Look no further. This place is as good as it gets.The interior could not be cooler, it's perfectly set to feel like you're the only ones in the room. Or could that just have been us? Our pizza was so good, perfect if you ask me. It tasted exactly like I'd expect from a NYC pizza place, and I could have ordered another whole pie. If you're in this area (or even if you're not), I highly recommend stopping in. You won't find a better place for a pizza.",5.0
"A little on the pricey side, but the pizza and wine were both fantastic! Pizzas are sized perfectly for sharing between 2 people, and they offer awesome toppings. The place is cash only, and the ONLY food on the menu is pizza and calzones (which is fine by me, but this wouldn't be a great place to bring a picky eater/someone expecting to order pasta, salad, etc.)",4.0
Delicious pizza. Fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. A great ambiance too. Price is pretty high for pizza. Even though it was definitely great it was hard to believe to pay more then $31 for an 18 inch pizza pie. I wasn't a fan of there option for truffle sauce added as a topping. The sauce hardly made any flavor difference. Definitely over priced. Probably won't be back.,3.0
"I am nothing if not a man of science. So when I recently read a study that said that men eat 93% more pizza when they're around women, I had to put the postulate to the test. I set forth to eat at some of the best pizzerias on the east coast 4 days out of 8. Oh the things I do for knowledge.Granted, I was only in the company of women 50% of the time (you need a control, after all). After the first two samples helped set a baseline for how much pizza I could eat in one sitting (result: a lot), my friends and I ventured to Giuseppina's, also known as the Lucali of South Slope (a phrase known only to me because I just made it up). Giuseppina's is quite literally the brother restaurant of Lucali (Chris Iacono runs Giuseppina's while his brother Mark runs Lucali).Where the two brothers' restaurants differ:1) Giuseppina's takes reservations (or at least they provide a rough time of when you should be there if you call day-of)2) They are more adventurous with their available toppings ($30 for black truffles, for instance)3) They serve beer and wine (whereas Lucali is BYOB)4) No sightings of Jay-Z and Beyonce at Giuseppina's (n=1 is not statistically significant, however)Where the two restaurants share similarities is the quality of the pizza. Large 18"" pies. Airy crust with just the right amount of char underneath. Floppy enough that you need to fold a slice in half (like you're supposed to).There were 10 of us, so we went with 3 pies and 2 calzones (yes, calzones are something else the two restaurants have in common).The pies we got:1) Margherita2) White pie3) Regular with shallots, hot/sweet sausage and artchoke heartsThat last one was custom-ordered (like Lucali, you pay for toppings a la carte, but basil and garlic is free). The sausage and the artichoke worked well together. Just the right balance of spicy, oily, and crunchy.Also split a pepperoni calzone because obviously, we hadn't had enough cheese. So much ricotta in a super crispy shell. Of course, it wouldn't be an Iacono calzone without a large bowl of tomato sauce for dipping.Other things worth mentioning:1) Their wine selection is good (the Barbera was excellent) and they're all reasonably priced, which makes sense since they're...2) ...CASH ONLY!3) They also play great music from the 60s and 70s. Great laid back atmosphere all around.4) Service was also great!In conclusion, I polished off about an entire pie by myself, which was approximately 93% more pizza than I thought I could. So I guess that study has some merit. Sample size is too small, so I'll have to do further research. Will publish my findings as they come.Oh, and review #1,700.",5.0
Pizza was good. Service was nice too. I thought it was a little pricey. The wine was not great. I would come back and have their pizza but maybe they should let customers BYOB.,4.0

"A dog was being walked outside the front door and dropped a dookie.My family and I are a party of 5. We add our name to the list, 1/2 hour wait we're told. Not a problem! We go get cash at an ATM  (Giuseppina's is a CASH ONLY spot) and come back 28 minutes later.The large table, has a bunch of 6 foot giants eating. Even the ladies! That's some big azz folks. The restaurant is packed and they're sitting, laughing and texting while we're waiting for them to get up. My wife starts laughing and whispers something to my kids.What???They all start laughing. They're betting the giant people all do a doo doo dance in the dookie. Don't bet against me, I stack the deck. The folks get up and I tell the 6'7 dude there is dookie chunks so be careful. I win :DWe all sit down and I order a bottled Italian beer. No beer taps at Giuseppina's.We order two pizzas, a Margarita and a pizza with prosciutto, shallots and portobello mushrooms. Oh yeah, add LOTS OF BASIL!The restaurant mysteriously clears out. There is no one in the restaurant except a couple sitting behind us.The waitress comes over. I'm so sorry, we're out of Basil.WHAT??The couple behind us? Gets their pizza LOADED with basil.Hmm...Our pizza comes out without basil and my Brooklyn-French-Canadian wife starts getting antsy:The Shallots aren't totally cooked, the cheese has no oil or taste, the oven has this ""Burst"" of flame, its a wood-gas hybrid and more importantly, there is no basil!We get the bill, $75 bucks?!?!?!I'm assuming the owner comes over and says I'm sorry we ran out of basil.(Thats because the other table got ALL the remaining basil, you could have split it 3 ways..)Also, how does an Italian restaurant/pizza place not have any salad? Have a mozzarella/tomato/basil app, regular tossed salad, some semblance of a salad would be awesome!If you've ever witnessed Dom from Di Fara assemble a Brooklyn pizza. He drizzles olive oil on the pizza as well as cuts fresh basil over the top. I know Giuseppina's is related to the Lucali chain. Hey, everyone has a weird auntie..Giuseppina, you got the crust right. As for the price and running out of basil on a busy Saturday night, charging us full price and not offering us a appetizer (oh wait, you don't have any) the best I can give you is a 3 star yelp review. Actually, I'm going add this place to my NY Pizza list so you fine yelpers can make a decision off my experiences.Never again.",3.0
"THIS PLACE IS GREAT. For lots of reasons.First of all, my 3 friends and I were just perusing Yelp for nearby pizza places, actually looking for a cheap place, you know them, New Yorkers -- those $1 slice places! Our friend found Giuseppina's and led us here, and we thought, oh no! We are not dressed classy enough! But then we just gave it a try. Turns out, we WERE classy enough, because this place is gorgeous and candlelit, but also very welcoming and very reasonably priced. A casual delicious pie is only $22, which is great for the budget of twentysomethings. A glass of wine was inexpensive  too, which was exactly what I was in the mood for. This place was really great and I can't wait to go back soon! It's nice to have a classy place to grab some quality pizza that isn't snooty at all and is affordable for lil' ole me. :)",5.0
"Confession up front: I am not a lover of American pizza. This pizza is absolutely delicious. Definitely not a cheap meal for two; quite reasonable for four. We however are pigs and consumed an entire 8-slice pie. Basic pizza with garlic and basil leaf topping is $22. Additional toppings are $3 each: we had artichoke hearts (1/2 heart per slice) and sausage, which was crumbled (could have used a little more) and very flavorful. House wine was $8 per glass and it was a good sized glass. Service was very attentive and friendly, although we were there on a slow night. We were too full to try anything else although the Nutella calzone was tempting. My only complaint is the cash only policy (seriously cuts into my miles or cash back on dining).",4.0
Why this place isn't rated #1 in Brooklyn blows my mind. If your going anywhere but here or Lucalis.. You're just doing it wrong.Don't leave with out getting both a pizza AND a calzone. You've got room,5.0
"You have to be a pizza lover to come to this place. I am sorry to say, but I don't like pizza. I haven't had a slice for over 15 yrs until last night, which was more of a tiny bite than a slice.

The rest of my party raved about this place, but the wine we had was very good. I guess you could say you would have to try it for yourself.",3.0
"I've lived in a few blocks from this place for 3 years and I finally made it. The hype is absolutely worth it.The moment I walked in here, the smell of garlic and roasted meats/veggies/cheese instantly gave me a hint of what was to come. The aromas were not of your standard pizzeria fare, but this isn't your standard pizzeria - you can't, and wouldn't want to buy it by the slice here. The pizzas come out of the back wall, which is a gigantic brick oven that has a volcano of flame spouting up in the middle of it -  it's pretty mesmerizing to watch the pizzas enter and exit the inferno.Anyway, to the pizza. My table was about 20 people for a friends BDAY, and it seemed pies kept coming until we couldn't finish anymore. We had all of them except the ""Giuseppina Special"" which says $50/ea on the menu, no dice there. I don't really have a favorite because they were all amazing. My advice is to come here with at least 4 people to get 2-3 different pies to eat because if you only get one, you're missing out. I had a bite of one of the calzone's as well. Also pretty amazing, but that was the first thing I ate so it kind of got lost in the process. We got some dessert calzones, which I can speak about and say they're phenomenal. Get that too...and the wine, also really good and affordable.This place is a hidden gem, and I feel fortunate to live so close. Definitely a top 10 pizza in NYC.",5.0
"Delicious pizza, just as good if not better than Grimaldi's, Lucali, Motorino, etc. We came here on a Saturday night just before 6 and tables filled up quickly.

So we invented a new dish: the speck sandwich made with the pizza crust! We had this good italian speck, perfect to help us enjoy all that extra crust. The picture will show you.

"Lucali's was closed for the Labor Day weekend, so a very nice man washing his car outside suggested we try Giuseppina's (""his brother's place"") instead. We tried a small calzone and pie with one of the special toppings of (crumbled) sweet/spicy sausage (adding garlic and basil - free but you must request it). The calzone came without sauce, but you didn't need it at all. It was the  best, ""lightest"" calzone I have ever had; not heavy at all. The dough held its structure and crispness against the cheesy filling (just enough ooze to be creamy but not so much to make a mess).The pie came out quickly and beautifully. Same great dough as the calzone - crisp and thin but still pliant and chewy. Pies are a little light on the sauce and cheese, but I will say that the toppings did not overwhelm the dough, and these are slices that you can easily fold.This place has a warm ambience, ample seating and friendly staff.

We offered to leave a credit card number as collateral, but Chris instead just took our word that we'd come back with the money, and even suggested that we could pay the balance next time we came, whenever that might be.

I have no idea what they do here but it's pure food for the soul. Thin crust cooked perfectly we always get the same thing, hot pepper and pepperoni. They do fresh basil and garlic too for free, a must. The first night we found this place we came straight back the next night to eat there again. We eat here once a week and the consistency is 100%.

"After working all day without meal breaks, much of it spent walking around in 28 degree weather, we were hungry, tired, cold and our legs hurt. Checked Yelp for a place we could enjoy a good pizza and an adult beverage. Yelpers pointed to two places: Lucali's or Giuseppina's. We headed to Lucali's, did the usual 20 minutes hunt for parking, walked a few blocks but we didn't even get in the door! The young lady at the door pointed us out toward the pavement as she informed us it will be an hour wait. I could swear she was smirking as she said it but I could have just been grumpy. I'm sure it's some good pizza for folks to wait outside in this cold for an hour. Back in the car and on to Giuseppina's, totally different experience! Found a parking spot right away... ok, that's just good luck. Walked into a heavenly atmosphere of warmth, low lighting and earthy, smokey wood scent. Just like home, everything revolves around the kitchen counter and the centerpiece of the room is the wood- burning pizza oven. Service was excellent. The plain pizza we ordered came out in less than 15 minutes and it was magnificent! Crunchy flaky crust, flavorful sauce and just the right amount of cheese. A glass of Pinot Noir complimented the pie perfectly. Delicious! We left happy, full and totally satisfied. Thanks Guiseppina's, well done. We'll be back next time we're in town.",5.0

We walked right in, our waitress was definitely old school Brooklyn and very friendly.. It's an interesting spot as it's almost directly across the street from Toby's.. Toby's is a place that has a wood burning oven that has wonderful pies as well.. However, Toby's is also a bar and has other things besides pizza.. I had to use the ATM at Toby's and was happy to see that this place is packed.. Rightfully so.. So the verdict is, the pies are as good as Lucali, however, there is no line but, you can't bring your own wine... It did make me realize it's been too long since I have been to Toby's..",5.0
"Owned by the brother of Lucali Pizza owner, we came here based on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Brooklyn when we found out Lucali would be closed during our time in NY. Arrived at 6:30 on a weekday and we were promptly seated. One pizza was enough to feed 2 people. Added only pepperoni and mushroom for toppings. Extra garlic and basil (free). Paid for extra sauce which was totally worth it!",5.0
"Excellent brick oven pizza.  Prompt and courteous service, but it's a bit cramped.  Cash only.  If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.",4.0
"I really had high hopes for this place. Ordered a large calzone to share with another person only to find only 4 pieces of pepperoni in it. They really skimp out on the toppings. I pretty much paid a shitload to eat bread and cheese. It is ridiculous that each topping costs $3. Our waiter was completely inattentive and never came to our table to refill our waters or ask how our meal is going. We sat through more than half of our meal with no water. I definitely will not be back. If I want a calzone that's packed with flavor and with ingredients and for the fraction of the price, I'd rather go to D.P. Dough.",2.0
Great pizza and very reasonably priced ($22 for 8 large slices)*note - I only give 5 stars to places you should go out of your way to experience + shouldn't leave a city without trying.,4.0
"Loved this place. Visiting from out of town and saw the other awesome recommendations for it. Seeing how well others wrote intimidates me at times into being a mere lurker. But clearly, I liked it well enough to say something. We were seated within minutes, and I'm not sure I would call the ambience Middle Earth-like. Maybe the Leaky Cauldron is a more accurate. No, that's not it, I'm just grasping.This is what they call NY-style, right? Thin crust and fresh ingredients combined to create a true synergy of flavors that I won't forget. We had half pepperoni and half mushroom/spicy sausage. Cash only. Local feel, global appeal.",5.0
"Very tasty pizza and super fast service. I got the shallot pizza and it only took like 7 minutes to cook. What was really notable here was our kind and generous treatment by owner Chris. After getting the check, my friend and I realized that we didn't have enough cash between us to pay the bill, and neither one of us had an ATM card. We offered to leave a credit card number as collateral, but Chris instead just took our word that we'd come back with the money, and even suggested that we could pay the balance next time we came, whenever that might be. We ended up finding a bunch of quarters in the car and were able to settle the bill before the restaurant closed-- but we still wanted to give Chris a shout-out for the friendly vibe and great customer service at Giuseppina's.",5.0
"Giuseppinas is hands down amazing! The pizza is amazing, always cooked to perfection. The atmosphere is serene, spacious, and clean. The wait staff is also very nice and attentive. There's not a bad thing I could say about this place! BTW It's very family friendly as well as romantic! I suggest going to Giussepinas on your next hunt for the best pizza in Brooklyn!",5.0
"I almost don't want to leave this review because I can always get a table here still. It won't be like this forever but Chris, the owner deserves your business more than I deserve a seat without a wait. This is hands down not just the best pizza in Brooklyn (yes Robertas and Pauly Gee doesn't come close) but actually the best pizza I've had in the world, including the areas of Italy and Sicily I've been too. I have no idea what they do here but it's pure food for the soul. Thin crust cooked perfectly we always get the same thing, hot pepper and pepperoni. They do fresh basil and garlic too for free, a must. The first night we found this place we came straight back the next night to eat there again. We eat here once a week and the consistency is 100%. Chris the owner is such a nice guy. His brother owns Lucali and Chris worked there too but has set up a place here that's a stand out in its own right. Amazing place and a true Brooklyn institution that - for now at least - remains relatively undiscovered.",5.0
"After working all day without meal breaks, much of it spent walking around in 28 degree weather, we were hungry, tired, cold and our legs hurt. Checked Yelp for a place we could enjoy a good pizza and an adult beverage. Yelpers pointed to two places: Lucali's or Giuseppina's. We headed to Lucali's, did the usual 20 minutes hunt for parking, walked a few blocks but we didn't even get in the door! The young lady at the door pointed us out toward the pavement as she informed us it will be an hour wait. I could swear she was smirking as she said it but I could have just been grumpy. I'm sure it's some good pizza for folks to wait outside in this cold for an hour. Back in the car and on to Giuseppina's, totally different experience! Found a parking spot right away... ok, that's just good luck. Walked into a heavenly atmosphere of warmth, low lighting and earthy, smokey wood scent. Just like home, everything revolves around the kitchen counter and the centerpiece of the room is the wood- burning pizza oven. Service was excellent. The plain pizza we ordered came out in less than 15 minutes and it was magnificent! Crunchy flaky crust, flavorful sauce and just the right amount of cheese. A glass of Pinot Noir complimented the pie perfectly. Delicious! We left happy, full and totally satisfied. Thanks Guiseppina's, well done. We'll be back next time we're in town.",5.0
"Visited Giuseppina's on date night with my girl and was completely blown away. The weather was wet and cold and we didn't want to trek too far so we just popped into the first place we could find.FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Giuseppina's is like a pub from Middle Earth - warm, smells like a fireplace, candles everywhere - dim but in that soft, fire-lit kind of way that makes you want to live there. The wood-fired oven was roaring and the smell of amazing food was thick in the air. THE FOOD: We ordered a large pizza and it was absolutely MASSIVE. The crust was thin and perfectly crisped. The sauce was so good that I'd drink it straight. SERVICE:Our server was friendly and attentive. He greeted us with a smile seconds after we walked in even though the place was busy. We never waited more than a few minutes for anything and he handled multiple tables with ease and a great attitude.PRICE: It's a little on the pricey side for a large pizza but for a date night it was totally worth it. Plan on spending $50-$65 for two people plus a drink or two.FINAL WORD:We both LOVED this place and agreed that we'll be bringing our out of town friends here at the earliest opportunity.",5.0
"Many great contenders, but this is my favorite pizza in the borough. Thin, bubbly crust, very high quality toppings (the mushrooms are enormous, fresh thin slices), very fast service, really pleasant candle-lit but unpretentious restaurant environment. Make sure to ask for the free, but optional, garlic and basil for your pie. I usually split a single pie between 2-3 people and leave stuffed. I'm not sure if their pies would truly shine if you didn't eat there - they're just so fresh and crispy. Its more of a date-night place than where you order your netflix pie (Luigi's fresh mozz pie is my fav for that, just up the street).It took me a few visits to try the nutella calzone dessert, but do yourself a favor and try it. Its small, but super rich, so its shareable for 2. Like a delicious donut-calzone hybrid with ricotta and nutella. I wish I was eating it right now.",5.0
"Superb pizza served at your table by the best people in Brooklyn - the best New York pizza experience I ever have is here  -I  can sit down and have a beer and my pizza comes out fast and fresh made to order - and the restaurant is beautiful - brick oven, brick walls, soft lights, nice tables and decor.  And it's worth the price because  you get way more than what you pay for.  I take offense to the cheapskates here that ding the restaurant for it's prices.  Don't go leaving 3 star reviews - the prices are listed on the menu and on the walls - quit with the reviews saying, ""I was shocked at the bill.""  And yes, it's cash only and only open in the evening - deal with it.  If you deal with it, you'll realize why you're dealing with - because you love it.",5.0

Unfortunately our eyes were bigger than the stomach. We order a pie with half choice of onions with portobello mushrooms and other half with prosciutto & artichokes. While we waited for our beautiful pie, we sipped on our choice of Pino Noir/a white (like a chardonnay) glass of wine, both good wines. They have wine and beer only!  We admired the restaurant as it was small, warm, dark, Candle lit, woodsy place which complemented the brick oven in the middle of the place.

Our waiter, Hendrick, was so friendly and answered any curious questions we had in reference to this place, which has been in S.Slope for the last 4 yrs.

"I've never understood the appeal of ""New York"" style pizza.  I've never been to Grimaldi's, or DiFara, or Lucali, because quite frankly, there's nothing that's worth waiting 3 hrs on.  So after reading that Giuseppina's was ""like Lucali but without the wait"", I decided to go see what this New York pie business was all about.When we got there, the place was filled.  The server said it was about a 20 min wait.  Not bad, and we actually got seated in 10.  On the way in I heard someone say ""Nobody knows about this place but it's always packed!"".  The remark alone made my night... comedy and good food all in one neat package.The setup is impressive.  The lighting is intimate and the staff is unpretentious and friendly, but what really stood out was the setup of the chef's counter.  It takes up more than a 3rd of the restaurant and the chef stands at the center, chewing slowly on a toothpick, surveying the scene like a commander in charge of a battle.  I had the good fortune of having a table facing the counter so I could watch him.  His movements were always slow and deliberate despite the bustle going on around him.  The ingredients were all arranged in piles around the counter and he would take his time in preparing each pie.  It was like watching an artist work... I was fascinated by the process.Then came the pie itself.  I liked that the menu was extremely simple... no fuss.  Why would anyone NOT get fresh garlic and basil on their pies?  Why was that an option?  Who would say no?  ""Would you like your pizza covered in deliciousness or not?""  I'll take deliciousness.  When it came out, it was perfect.  The crust was precisely charred (they had a temperature gauge on the oven, so I loved that there was a science to this too), and it tasted simply amazing.I don't know how any of the places I mentioned up top could be any better than this.  So if you ask me, if you want the proper New York pizza experience, go to Giuseppina's.",5.0

"By now, Giuseppina's has a reputation that precedes itself.  Most people in the know have heard about it and understand the connection to Lucali, its significance, and why people rave about it.  It has taken me a while to get there, but yesterday afternoon, I finally made the pilgrimage.The place was practically empty when we arrived, which was fine, as we only came to do one thing.  We ordered a pie with hot sausage and mushrooms, and I ordered a beer.  They only offer two things here, pizza and calzone, and they do them very well.  The pizza crust was paper thin, but the ingredients were thrown on lovingly and made the drooping of the slice inevitable.  Very fresh and delicious toppings, along with the standard inclusion of garlic and basil.  The pizza was delicious, but the crust was literally cracking apart and falling all over my plate like a piece of clay crumbling apart in your hand.  It was like flatbread or overdone naan.  My only quibble about the food product.Then the bill came.  Whoa, Nelly!  I don't recall the exact numbers, but I believe the pie was $24, the toppings were $5 each and the beer was $6.  That's $40.  Add a $10 tip on there and we just dropped 50 bones for a really good pizza and 1 beer.  To me, that's unsustainable.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the meal, but that's ridiculous.  As such, this will be my ""special occasion only"" pizza place.  I do well, but I can't rationalize dropping that kind of coin on a pizza, sorry.5 stars for food/service + 3 stars for value = 4 stars overall",4.0
"Came to Giuseppinas on an early Sunday evening at 535pm - and they were already packed. We were lucky to get a cozy spot next to the open kitchen area. The restaurant is super warm and candlelit. Many a family was there for Sunday dinner in Sunset Park. By the way - grab a drink at Brooklyn Pub next door if you have time - nice neighborhood watering hole OR to the 13000 sq foot Greenwood Park a block away. But anyway - I digress. Guiseppinas is owned by the brother of the owner of Lucali. The pizza is the same people - without the wait and a lovely beer and wine list! Our waiter was highly attentive and friendly and not fussed. They know they have a great product here and they are proud of it. So we order a pizza - there is only one size - with hot peppers, mushrooms and the optional free garlic and fresh basil. The pizza comes out hot and absolutely beautiful! Nicely charred and bubbly and fresh and hot. I absolutely loved this pizza - although let it be known that Table 87s standard hot peppers and garlic are better...but that's just the way it is. My wife thought the crust here was a little dry - I'm not sure I agree but I could see it. Anyway - this pizza is amazing and if you get a chance come here and devour. I will certainly try the calzone and desert calzone another time!",4.0
"Really loved my pizza experience here!!!!First, the pizza was great. Really thin (the way I like) and delicious. I had the white pizza - yum! They also let you customize a pie - we got half white, half pepperoni (since my pizza companion wanted pepperoni and i don't eat meat). I really loved having that option without having to get individual pies. Also, the Nutella calzone stuffed with cheese was a wonderful dessert! They serve beer and wine here btw, no cocktails. Second, the service was fantastic. Our server (Mike?) was sooooooo nice and friendly. Also, the pizza chef (Chris?) came by and was super nice as well and wanted to see how we liked the pizza. Everyone was just so warm, pleasant and welcoming. Third, the vibe here is awesome. It's cute and cozy, with dim lighting. But it's not formal or stuffy. Makes an excellent date place. Place opens at 5:30pm on Saturdays btw. Don't go by the hours listed here. But if you are a little early, don't despair, go have a beer at Brooklyn Pub across the street, friendly, low-key bar. Would love to come back here!",5.0
"So, tonight is not a night that you want to wait 2 hours for Lucali?  It's not the right mood for the attitude of the Lucali's girls? You want glass of wine with your fancypantsy pizza?Joe-Sep-Pina's!The pizzas are the real deal.  In the thin crust, wood-fired universe of NYC, Lucali can only really get a run for it's money by Giuseppina herself.Aside from that, the place is nicer than Lucali, with dark woods, newer tables, and more space. It doesn't have Lucali's romantic speakeasy sensibility, but you can save that for another day.The owner and his waitstaff are always terrific -- kind and inviting. (Whereas Lucali's Iocono is always strangely aloof...)  They are generous with the extra basil and extra sauce, and you can park out front.And there is a little bar next door to wait if you do happen to catch a short wait for a table.The only downside (really the only) is that it's not the *most* subway-friendly.",5.0
"For my money, pizza doesn't get much better than this. It's not the doughy bread with sauce and cheese you get across the rest of the country. It's not the huge, floppy $1 slices that make you sad immediately after you finish the last, floury bite. It's not the excellent Neapolitan pies being turned out by places like Paulie Gee's and Sottocasa. This is Brooklyn pizza at its finest.The crust is thin, but not cracker; it's got a nice chew, and is topped with unimpeachable sauce, excellent cheese and the freshest toppings in the city. Get what you want, but know that you don't need any of it except the garlic and basil, which are free. ALWAYS get the garlic and basil. That's all you need for an essentially perfect pie, but I suppose a little pepperoni never hurt anyone either.As can be expected with its affiliation, this place has many similarities with Lucali. The service is casual but attentive, and old-school enough to still call us ""youse guys."" The atmosphere is perfect for a date, but convivial enough for a group dinner. The menu is pleasantly simple, with nothing but pies and calzones. More important are the differences; unlike Lucali, they have beer and wine here (positive or negative, depending how you look at it), and there's not nearly the same wait. If you can make it to the South Slope, there's no reason not to treat yourself to some of the best pizza around.On my last visit, my appetite wasn't what it normally is. I had to fight to finish the pie we split between the two of us, and I STILL wanted to order another. It's dangerously good.",5.0

"By now, Giuseppina's has a reputation that precedes itself.  Most people in the know have heard about it and understand the connection to Lucali, its significance, and why people rave about it.  It has taken me a while to get there, but yesterday afternoon, I finally made the pilgrimage.The place was practically empty when we arrived, which was fine, as we only came to do one thing.  We ordered a pie with hot sausage and mushrooms, and I ordered a beer.  They only offer two things here, pizza and calzone, and they do them very well.  The pizza crust was paper thin, but the ingredients were thrown on lovingly and made the drooping of the slice inevitable.  Very fresh and delicious toppings, along with the standard inclusion of garlic and basil.  The pizza was delicious, but the crust was literally cracking apart and falling all over my plate like a piece of clay crumbling apart in your hand.  It was like flatbread or overdone naan.  My only quibble about the food product.Then the bill came.  Whoa, Nelly!  I don't recall the exact numbers, but I believe the pie was $24, the toppings were $5 each and the beer was $6.  That's $40.  Add a $10 tip on there and we just dropped 50 bones for a really good pizza and 1 beer.  To me, that's unsustainable.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the meal, but that's ridiculous.  As such, this will be my ""special occasion only"" pizza place.  I do well, but I can't rationalize dropping that kind of coin on a pizza, sorry.5 stars for food/service + 3 stars for value = 4 stars overall",4.0
"Came to Giuseppinas on an early Sunday evening at 535pm - and they were already packed. We were lucky to get a cozy spot next to the open kitchen area. The restaurant is super warm and candlelit. Many a family was there for Sunday dinner in Sunset Park. By the way - grab a drink at Brooklyn Pub next door if you have time - nice neighborhood watering hole OR to the 13000 sq foot Greenwood Park a block away. But anyway - I digress. Guiseppinas is owned by the brother of the owner of Lucali. The pizza is the same people - without the wait and a lovely beer and wine list! Our waiter was highly attentive and friendly and not fussed. They know they have a great product here and they are proud of it. So we order a pizza - there is only one size - with hot peppers, mushrooms and the optional free garlic and fresh basil. The pizza comes out hot and absolutely beautiful! Nicely charred and bubbly and fresh and hot. I absolutely loved this pizza - although let it be known that Table 87s standard hot peppers and garlic are better...but that's just the way it is. My wife thought the crust here was a little dry - I'm not sure I agree but I could see it. Anyway - this pizza is amazing and if you get a chance come here and devour. I will certainly try the calzone and desert calzone another time!",4.0
"Really loved my pizza experience here!!!!First, the pizza was great. Really thin (the way I like) and delicious. I had the white pizza - yum! They also let you customize a pie - we got half white, half pepperoni (since my pizza companion wanted pepperoni and i don't eat meat). I really loved having that option without having to get individual pies. Also, the Nutella calzone stuffed with cheese was a wonderful dessert! They serve beer and wine here btw, no cocktails. Second, the service was fantastic. Our server (Mike?) was sooooooo nice and friendly. Also, the pizza chef (Chris?) came by and was super nice as well and wanted to see how we liked the pizza. Everyone was just so warm, pleasant and welcoming. Third, the vibe here is awesome. It's cute and cozy, with dim lighting. But it's not formal or stuffy. Makes an excellent date place. Place opens at 5:30pm on Saturdays btw. Don't go by the hours listed here. But if you are a little early, don't despair, go have a beer at Brooklyn Pub across the street, friendly, low-key bar. Would love to come back here!",5.0
"So, tonight is not a night that you want to wait 2 hours for Lucali?  It's not the right mood for the attitude of the Lucali's girls? You want glass of wine with your fancypantsy pizza?Joe-Sep-Pina's!The pizzas are the real deal.  In the thin crust, wood-fired universe of NYC, Lucali can only really get a run for it's money by Giuseppina herself.Aside from that, the place is nicer than Lucali, with dark woods, newer tables, and more space. It doesn't have Lucali's romantic speakeasy sensibility, but you can save that for another day.The owner and his waitstaff are always terrific -- kind and inviting. (Whereas Lucali's Iocono is always strangely aloof...)  They are generous with the extra basil and extra sauce, and you can park out front.And there is a little bar next door to wait if you do happen to catch a short wait for a table.The only downside (really the only) is that it's not the *most* subway-friendly.",5.0
"For my money, pizza doesn't get much better than this. It's not the doughy bread with sauce and cheese you get across the rest of the country. It's not the huge, floppy $1 slices that make you sad immediately after you finish the last, floury bite. It's not the excellent Neapolitan pies being turned out by places like Paulie Gee's and Sottocasa. This is Brooklyn pizza at its finest.The crust is thin, but not cracker; it's got a nice chew, and is topped with unimpeachable sauce, excellent cheese and the freshest toppings in the city. Get what you want, but know that you don't need any of it except the garlic and basil, which are free. ALWAYS get the garlic and basil. That's all you need for an essentially perfect pie, but I suppose a little pepperoni never hurt anyone either.As can be expected with its affiliation, this place has many similarities with Lucali. The service is casual but attentive, and old-school enough to still call us ""youse guys."" The atmosphere is perfect for a date, but convivial enough for a group dinner. The menu is pleasantly simple, with nothing but pies and calzones. More important are the differences; unlike Lucali, they have beer and wine here (positive or negative, depending how you look at it), and there's not nearly the same wait. If you can make it to the South Slope, there's no reason not to treat yourself to some of the best pizza around.On my last visit, my appetite wasn't what it normally is. I had to fight to finish the pie we split between the two of us, and I STILL wanted to order another. It's dangerously good.",5.0

"These guys were great, the server was friendly and made suggestions to our order, shallots, instead of onions, that made the pizza better.

"My bf had been raving on about the pizza here for months and I finally succumbed this weekend to his ongoing pleas.  It's not that I don't like pizza, in fact, quite the contrary, I'm just extremely loyal to establishments like Co in Chelsea, Lombardi's and Grimaldi's so bringing in another player at this point was deemed simply unnecessary.Well, I'm happy to report that Giuseppina is a game changer. I think it's the crust on this pizza makes it, it's so thin it doesn't overwhelm the toppings and is crispy without being dry.

"Really cool concept. Actually came here because Lucali's wanted us to wait for 2 hours...outside. They suggested ""his brothers place"" and we shot over as fast as we could. Happy we did. ""Pizza bar"" directly in front of the coal fired brick oven. All the ingredients freshly scattered in front of the pizza maker. You order it, he makes it in front of the whole place, turns around and pops it in the oven.Love the simplicity. Calzones, pizza, beverages. We had the cheese calzone which was huge, split it between 4 of us. The spicy sausage pizza was great (think of your typical italian sunday sauce sausage), but the olive and onion was even better. They actually messed up the olive and onion order and gave us mushrooms instead. Quick fix and an apology from the pizza maker in front of the entire place. He actually joked that he was gonna fire the guy, and if you saw the kids face, he might have believed it!! Great place, will return!",4.0

"In response to the South slope spotlightAll of you people who who praise Giuseppina's so highly - do yourself a favour and try out Franny's on flatbush ave or Roberta's in bushwick.Giuseppina's is way too expensive for what it is - a weird ""cracker-crust"" pizza. Not that I would prefer ""La Famiglia"" which is just disgusting.Previous review:Based on take out:The pizza is actually reasonably OK. However, it is waaaayyyyy too expensive!!! I am giving it only 1 stars because someone has to do it. You simply can't justify paying $27 for an amount of food that small, and I am talking about their 20 inch pizza. Don't understand why people accept this!?!?!Yes, I know, a thin crust IS good, but this almost too thin and kind of in the not entirely correct way. Actually more like some kind of thin flatbread. If you wanna know what I mean by the correct way, go to either Roberta's in Bushwick, or Forcella in Williamsburg!At Giuseppina's they do use some kind of mozzerella, which similar to the kind Lombardi's use, the overly white and square shaped kind - but this is still not the real thing, which it should be at this price - and too little topping.My personal opinion is that a fair price would have been somewhere around $14I am not going to get pizza from there again, which means that I am probably not getting pizza in this neighborhood anytime soon since there aren't  any alternatives. It wasn't bad - just ridiculously overpriced. Hate the fact that they don't take credit card - but since I am not coming there again - peace with that...",1.0

It's a very similar setup to Lucali, where it's an open kitchen and you choose your own toppings for your pies. They also put tons of fresh basil leaves on top- my favorite!Our server was attentive and I loved his Brooklyn accent! He pointed us in the right direction for wine as well, so props to him for that.

"4.5Still really good, but maybe not quite on the level of Totonno's and definitely not on the level of Patsy Grimaldi's newly opened Juliana's.  The secret weapon here is the fresh garlic and basil.  The cheese and tomato sauce are already in the highest echelon, but are transcendent with the fresh basil and garlic add on (which is free).  Unfortunately, what ultimately gets between Giuseppina's and the pizza crown, is the crust.  Yes, it's good, but yes it needs more char and could definitely do with being a little on the chewier side.  Service is great, though and house red is still being flogged at $20 a pop.Quips aside, this is the definitely the best pie you can buy South of Brooklyn Heights and North of Gravesend.",4.0

"Really cool concept. Actually came here because Lucali's wanted us to wait for 2 hours...outside. They suggested ""his brothers place"" and we shot over as fast as we could. Happy we did. ""Pizza bar"" directly in front of the coal fired brick oven. All the ingredients freshly scattered in front of the pizza maker. You order it, he makes it in front of the whole place, turns around and pops it in the oven.Love the simplicity. Calzones, pizza, beverages. We had the cheese calzone which was huge, split it between 4 of us. The spicy sausage pizza was great (think of your typical italian sunday sauce sausage), but the olive and onion was even better. They actually messed up the olive and onion order and gave us mushrooms instead. Quick fix and an apology from the pizza maker in front of the entire place. He actually joked that he was gonna fire the guy, and if you saw the kids face, he might have believed it!! Great place, will return!",4.0
"Great calzone, and a lovely ambiance. Nothing short of genius. If you are looking for a New York experience this is the place to go!",5.0
"Yes yes and yes! No need to reiterate what others have written....except maybe, get the Nutella calzone if it's on the chalkboard. Broke our Yom Kippur fast here last night after visiting Greenwood Cemetery and Prospect Park's Memorial Grove. And now we want to make it part of our annual tradition. Or just move there so we could eat there on a more frequent basis. Yes folks, it is that good! Date night, family night, just go.",5.0
"In response to the South slope spotlightAll of you people who who praise Giuseppina's so highly - do yourself a favour and try out Franny's on flatbush ave or Roberta's in bushwick.Giuseppina's is way too expensive for what it is - a weird ""cracker-crust"" pizza. Not that I would prefer ""La Famiglia"" which is just disgusting.Previous review:Based on take out:The pizza is actually reasonably OK. However, it is waaaayyyyy too expensive!!! I am giving it only 1 stars because someone has to do it. You simply can't justify paying $27 for an amount of food that small, and I am talking about their 20 inch pizza. Don't understand why people accept this!?!?!Yes, I know, a thin crust IS good, but this almost too thin and kind of in the not entirely correct way. Actually more like some kind of thin flatbread. If you wanna know what I mean by the correct way, go to either Roberta's in Bushwick, or Forcella in Williamsburg!At Giuseppina's they do use some kind of mozzerella, which similar to the kind Lombardi's use, the overly white and square shaped kind - but this is still not the real thing, which it should be at this price - and too little topping.My personal opinion is that a fair price would have been somewhere around $14I am not going to get pizza from there again, which means that I am probably not getting pizza in this neighborhood anytime soon since there aren't  any alternatives. It wasn't bad - just ridiculously overpriced. Hate the fact that they don't take credit card - but since I am not coming there again - peace with that...",1.0
"Giuseppina's is one of those places where I kick myself and say, ""Why haven't I come here before?!""A mere 10 minute walk from my apartment, this place serves awesome pies in the most unassuming location. 3 friends and I came by around 8:30 on a Sunday and there was no wait.The interior is intimate and candlelit. It's a very similar setup to Lucali, where it's an open kitchen and you choose your own toppings for your pies. They also put tons of fresh basil leaves on top- my favorite!Our server was attentive and I loved his Brooklyn accent! He pointed us in the right direction for wine as well, so props to him for that.

"I would think that if you are serious about pizza this is indisputably a top 10 destination within NYC, and quite possibly top 5.  As many reviews note this is the Lucali style. but in an off-the-beaten-path location with little or no wait for tables.  (Before I found this place I had the worst luck getting into Lucali, always waiting an hour or more.  If you have a car or are otherwise willing to travel a little Giuseppina's seems like a no-brainer.)So, I would describe the Lucali style as being close to the classic NYC / Neapolitan thin-crust pie, executed as well as possible.  If you like Pepe's in New Haven, for example, you will find this to be competitive (and, maybe, slightly better!  Though I don't think they do a clam pie.)  The cheese calzone is also nice for a change of pace.",5.0

"I came here the day after Christmas with my family, after we gawked at the lights in Dyker Heights we drove back to my brother's neighborhood to warm up with some delicious pizza.

I'm part Italian, and grew up in a very Italian neighborhood in the 'burbs, so I've eaten a lot of pizza, and calzones in my lifetime - but Guiseppina's by far serves up the best. We tried the Margherita pizza (classic mozzarella basil and tomato) and another - maybe sausage and pepper - and tried a cheese calzone (small) with sauce - everything was perfectly cooked, the same was amazing, the crust was that perfect brick oven northern italian style crust, and the calzones - my goodness - I usually don't even like calzones (they can be so heavy), but damn, those were good.

"Lucali is one of the last major NYC pizzerias to avoid my grasp.  This is due primarily to the hours, as well as my long running intrigue with more off-the-grid places.  A few weeks back, my friend and I resolved to rectify this, but then remembered the recent news.  Lucali was closed while Mark Iacono recovered and sorted out a mess of a situation in his old neighborhood.  Then I remembered that his brother Chris, who took quite awhile getting this place open, finally did actually open.  Given the location in southern Park Slope right by Toby's Public House, we decided to check this out instead.  We came a bit before 6pm, but they hadn't formally opened and the oven hadn't heated up to proper temperatures yet.  After splurging on expensive beer at Eagle Provisions, we came back a half hour later.  The place is dark and intimate inside with candles everywhere, a little dim lighting, brick walls, soft Italian-ish music playing, and the huge wood fired oven front and center.  Chris Iacono was working the oven, which I appreciate immensely; some many would-be pizzaiolos think it's sufficient to slap their name on a place and then sit back on their asses.  Our waiter was a Brooklyn guy, was very friendly and knowledgeable, as well as efficient.  Being Park Slope, the place was full of families as well as a few couples and tables of friends.  It never had a wait that night, but it did stay pretty full.  That is awesome, as this place probably deserves the hype that its brother pizzeria gets.We got a pizza that was half hot sausage, and half olives and onions (my friend's) choice.  It was pretty freaking great, but not at all what I was expecting.  I've always heard people talk about Lucali and its smoky-sweet crust, and I imagined it being along the lines of a NY-Naples hybrid pie along the lines of Totonno's, or at least NY-style like Di Fara, but it was neither.  It was sort of crisp crust like they serve at places like Joe & Pat's in Staten Island, except with more flavor and more rise.  This rise helped it hold up to the toppings, and despite the surprise I thoroughly enjoyed this crust.  As for the toppings, they were at the high quality level you could expect.  The fresh mozzarella was luscious and milky.  The tomato sauce was flavorful if a little subtle.  The olive oil used was light and fruity, tying the various elements together.  The hot sausage--from Faicco's in the West Village and Dyker Heights--was great as could be expected, and was applied in small crumbles.  As a whole the pie didn't strike me as world-beating, but it was pretty addictive.With a mellow, low-key atmosphere as opposed to its perpetually mobbed relative, it's a wonder why Giuseppina's isn't more popular.  I  still haven't tried Mark's original place, I have to say his brother makes some damned great pizza.  A place that both makes great pizza and is a neighborhood hangout can be rare even in Brooklyn.  I even saw a Rockwellian scene where a little girl walked over to the oven to watch Chris make pizza and he showed her how, even giving here something to taste.  Above all else, Giuseppina's is genuine--which is even more rare in today's restaurant scene--and in my book that makes it a must go.  As for Lucali, well..I'm see them soon.",4.0

"If, in your quest for the best slice of pizza in Brooklyn, you've found yourself beneath the Brooklyn Bridge waiting in line with heaps of starved tourists, you've done it wrong. Sure, that place is a fine pizza joint and they make a decent enough pie, but hop the F train a few stops into Brooklyn and head to Guiseppina's to find the best slice of ""traditional"" NY style pie.Giuseppina's serves up traditional oven fired pies and offers an array of standard toppings along with a few less common topping items like marinated artichoke hearts. The pizza is absolutely top notch and every bit as good as any other pie I've had in the city. To top it off, you don't have to wait outside in a lengthy line freezing or sweating to death depending on the season and the service is incredibly friendly and helpful. My experience eating at some of the more famous, landmark-type pizza joints has felt like being rapidly herded through the process of ordering, eating, and getting the f*** out, left only with searing heartburn from consuming slices of pizza at a pace that's comparable to that seen in the Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Competition. Giuseppina's, on the other hand, is friendly, intimate, and not rushed at all. They want you to not only enjoy the pizza but also the experience of dining.It's tough for me to really explain how much I prefer this place to any of the other well-regarded pizza places. The experience at Giuseppina's makes me wonder why anyone patronizes those other spots. Sure, they offer solid pies, but you never have time to actually enjoy what you're eating.

I liked the vibe here - all the other patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves in varying degrees of effusiveness. Families, couples, and groups of friends. I like that. It looked like a serious, grown up place from the outside, but it felt not at all hoity-toity inside. The crust on this pizza was really great. Thin and crispy. Don't get me started on the toppings. Basil, olives, cheese, garlic - all excellent. The pepperoni itself left a little to be desired, though. I like mine noticeably spicier. Overall, great pizza, attentive and informed servers, and a cozy environment. I loved it!",4.0

"We came here for our 6th Pizza Club meeting, and it ranked as the top place all around. Thursday night, quiet, a few groups in the whole place. We ordered 2 pies and went halvsies on each with the toppings - shallots and hot peppers, cheese, a pepperoni, and a mushroom. That was ambitious for the 3 of us, but it turns out it was the best decision we made, for the pizza was DELICIOUS. Crust - thin but sturdy enough for the toppings, AND the edges bubbled up, crisped, and made these huge air pockets. A pile of fresh basil in the middle of each pizza was great - I personally love lots of it. All of the ingredients were super fresh, and tasted so. The sauce was just the right thickness and flavor - tomatoey without the pasty-ness of, well, tomato paste. The cheese was gooey without overpowering the rest of the pizza. He's really got the ratio of ingredients just right! The pizza was piping hot when it came out. Since we ordered two, they brought us the first one as it was finished, then when we looked almost finished with it, brought out the 2nd one. We stuffed ourselves...AND were each able to take a slice or 2 home for leftovers. The owner came over and chatted with us, and he was super nice. FYI, he's not the one who was in the knife fight last year (that was his brother, of Lucali). I really appreciated that small touch, and I would definitely come back and bring lots of friends, for the pizza was that good!",5.0

My experience eating at some of the more famous, landmark-type pizza joints has felt like being rapidly herded through the process of ordering, eating, and getting the f*** out, left only with searing heartburn from consuming slices of pizza at a pace that's comparable to that seen in the Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Competition. Giuseppina's, on the other hand, is friendly, intimate, and not rushed at all. They want you to not only enjoy the pizza but also the experience of dining.It's tough for me to really explain how much I prefer this place to any of the other well-regarded pizza places. The experience at Giuseppina's makes me wonder why anyone patronizes those other spots. Sure, they offer solid pies, but you never have time to actually enjoy what you're eating. Give Giuseppina's a shot and I think you'll be left wondering the same thing.",5.0
"I never expected to eat a $40 pizza in my life, but now I am glad that I did. The everything pizza here was killer, nearly as good as DiFara's. The restaurant was very dim, so it's a good thing you don't have to read a long menu. But it was bright enough for great conversation and enjoying the obviously lovingly-crafted pizza. I liked the vibe here - all the other patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves in varying degrees of effusiveness. Families, couples, and groups of friends. I like that. It looked like a serious, grown up place from the outside, but it felt not at all hoity-toity inside. The crust on this pizza was really great. Thin and crispy. Don't get me started on the toppings. Basil, olives, cheese, garlic - all excellent. The pepperoni itself left a little to be desired, though. I like mine noticeably spicier. Overall, great pizza, attentive and informed servers, and a cozy environment. I loved it!",4.0
"Yes, it's kind of expensive.  Yes, limited menu (Pizza and Calzones...that's it).  Yes, sometime s the wait is stupid long.  What do you do?  You save up, realize you will have an amazing freaking pizza experience (because it's ALL FRESH.  ALL...FRESH), and don't go at peak hours ...or you just do take away and enjoy your awesome food somewhere else.Sometimes they are open.  Sometimes they aren't.  It's a craps shoot...but I get REALLY happy when I get that basil and mushroom pizza in my hands.",4.0
"We came here for our 6th Pizza Club meeting, and it ranked as the top place all around. Thursday night, quiet, a few groups in the whole place. We ordered 2 pies and went halvsies on each with the toppings - shallots and hot peppers, cheese, a pepperoni, and a mushroom. That was ambitious for the 3 of us, but it turns out it was the best decision we made, for the pizza was DELICIOUS. Crust - thin but sturdy enough for the toppings, AND the edges bubbled up, crisped, and made these huge air pockets. A pile of fresh basil in the middle of each pizza was great - I personally love lots of it. All of the ingredients were super fresh, and tasted so. The sauce was just the right thickness and flavor - tomatoey without the pasty-ness of, well, tomato paste. The cheese was gooey without overpowering the rest of the pizza. He's really got the ratio of ingredients just right! The pizza was piping hot when it came out. Since we ordered two, they brought us the first one as it was finished, then when we looked almost finished with it, brought out the 2nd one. We stuffed ourselves...AND were each able to take a slice or 2 home for leftovers. The owner came over and chatted with us, and he was super nice. FYI, he's not the one who was in the knife fight last year (that was his brother, of Lucali). I really appreciated that small touch, and I would definitely come back and bring lots of friends, for the pizza was that good!",5.0
"it's just ok I would say - little expensive and you can't fold the slice..for a true NY guy no fold is no dice.Roberta's, Paulie gee's etc are much better just sayin' - the locals gotta make it at least as good as those newer hipster spots??",3.0

"For starters, this is not a pizza joint you run into to grab a quick slice, it's a pizza restaurant, and one that's totally worth checking out. I found the service to be quick (but not rushed) friendly & attentive without being overbearing. The menu is small (which I like). Mainly pizza (with a handful of topping options) and calzones. My one complaint would be that I found their selection of wines to be lacking a bit. The quality of pizza: outstanding. Super thin crust, nice and light. All the ingredients tasty and as fresh as can be. I will definitely be visiting again soon.",4.0
"On days when I crave Brooklyn pizza, I crave Giuseppina's. I love the limited menu, as it means this restaurant does one thing really really really well.

"Good pizza close by to the apartment.  Limited menu of pizza and calzones only, and limited toppings.  The simple stuff.  Decent wine and some beer. No menu = no prices, but the pie was good.  Not the best pizza I've had, but pretty good to make it the local joint.",3.0
"I went in expecting this to be more than pizzas and calzones and while that was my mistake if that's all you are gonna make, it better be good. This wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  We had just a plain cheese calzone so I can't vouch for the pizza. There wasn't much of a selection of toppings or fillers for the calzone but again, it was still an enjoyable meal. I feel that the meal was more expensive than it should have been. Also, I really wish restaurants would be upfront about not excepting cards. I hate that my husband had to leave me at the table by myself while he had to go find a ATM to pay.  It was a long wait for what I hoped would be a great italian restaurant in my neighborhood but all we got was another pizza place across the street from an existing pizza place (which is much better and more versatile).",2.0
"This place is so good. I don't know where they get their cheese, but it's incredible.The pizza is delicious, but it would be a crime to come here and not order a calzone. But be forewarned, Giuseppina's will ruin you for all other calzones in NYC.",5.0
"Oh. My. Lord. Oh. My.This pizza had me completely obsessed. Yes, they could have a more customer centric approach, but that pizza? The best I've had short of Italy.

I find that kind it lame to shun inclusive customer service in that way. Not that I want vegan g-free pizza! No don't touch that dough! But a salad maybe?

The middling: Pizza was alright for what you got: $20 for the pie (a generous 18"", about 8 huge slices, we definitely took leftovers home) and other than garlic and basil (which are free), other toppings are $3/pop, kinda pricey. Neapolitan-style, traditional pizza. The bad:  Toppings are barely there. We ordered shallots, mushrooms and hot peppers.  In the 2.5 slices I had, I didn't have one mushroom, got some peppers (read: 3 thin slices). I didn't taste any garlic (but the Gentle Man did on his slices) yet there was a TON of basil? Weird that they would be kinda stingy on what you were paying for, yet generous on the free topping? We got a bottle of Aglianico - which was okay, but not WOW. It was $26, and the priciest bottle on their (short) list, which was actually a nice surprise, as they have an affordable list. Local tip:  While you are waiting for your table (they'll take your phone number and call you when it's ready), head across the street past Brooklyn Pub, 2 doors north, to Lot 2 for salad/appetizer and a glass of wine while you wait.  There is *only* pizza and calzone at Giuseppina's.",4.0

Then ordered a pizza with half cheese and half hot sausage and shallots. So delicious!! You can tell the ingredients are top quality. The end of the crust was tiny bit crunchy for my taste, but still so tasty nonetheless. At the end of the meal, the owner came over and said hello. I asked how the calzones were and mentioned that I had never eaten a real New York city calzone.

"I've read the reviews for giuseppina's and I'm surprised at the generally positive feedback - we must be going to two completely different places. I live close to giuseppina's and have been there exactly once, by choice, because frankly they just aren't good. In short: the pizza is relatively expensive (relatively because it's just a normal pizza pie; nothing like Toby's which is a block a way and has much - MUCH -- better gourmet pizza). The ""famous"" calzones are mostly dough and don't have much filling - and like the pizza, aren't good enough to command that sort of price. Staff is friendly but s-l-o-w. And the menu is limited (basically just a few varieties of pizza and calzones). Verdict? If you want good pizza or Italian food, hit toby's which is a block away. If you want a bar, you could still hit Toby's or go to Brooklyn pub, across the street (incidentally they have decent pub fair). If you want romantic, stay at home; giuseppina's is not worth the money.ALSO I keep reading about this disgruntled, douche bag chef/owner - the other day I saw him scream and yell at this poor young woman whose dog had the nerve to use the bathroom in front of giuseppina's. Oh and they weren't even open - it was 10 am on a Monday.",2.0
"Fabulous! We ate there a few weeks ago. Its owned by a family member of another popular Brooklyn pizza place so we decided to try it out. Loved the atmosphere inside the restaurant and the simplicity of the menu. Pizza and calzones only. We were only in the area visiting from Albany NY, otherwise we would definitely be returning. Very delicious food and the service was excellent. We arrived around 830 pm and were greeted with a warm welcome from the staff and owner.",5.0
"I love when restaurants keep it simple, and this place does just that.  Pizza and calzones, and excellent ones at that.  The decor is inviting, with views of the brick oven and pizza-making.  Service is excellent, and parking has not been an issue for me.  The food is pricey, let's be honest.  We were a family of four, ordered one large calzone and one pie with sausage on only half the pie.  Waters all around, and one soda.  Our bill was $54, excluding tip.  But again, there are no surprises here.  If you are willing to pay for good, quality pizza - Giuseppina's is the place.",5.0
"Pizza is a very personal thing, and I should preface this review by stating that I was raised on Denino's pizza on Staten Island, and now live within walking distance to DiFara's, both of which set, by all accounts, very high (though the latter is also very expensive) bars. But I have to say that we were disappointed, and expected much more given the reviews below. This pizza was, well, eh. Crackery crust vs. thin-and-crunchy-outside-chewy-inside. Sweet sauce with very little flavor other than the sweetness. Fresh mozzarella is always wonderful, and here no less so... but it didn't make up for the sum of the parts, if you know what I mean.  Clearly, people like it, so maybe you will, too. It's not *bad* pizza. Everything is nice and fresh. But if you've had Denino's, DiFara's, and/or Totonno's, and are hoping this is that, but closer to home... it's not.",3.0
"Wow. I thought after 20 years in NYC, I've had the best pizza. But not till last night did I really. This place is outstanding. They only have pizza and calzones. What more do you need? And they do both great. Our new favorite. We'll be back.",5.0
"This place is down the street from me and has the BEST pizza in NYC by a mile. I know a lot of people make the same claim, but really, it is. Try for yourself. It can get a little busy so you may have to wait to get in (well worth it) but its pretty chill inside. Nice ambiance and very laid back. What I love most about this place is that they do one thing: Pizza. (and calzones, which is pretty much an inverted pizza) Instead of having a 10 page long menu they do one thing and make it superb. The pizza is made in a wood burning stone oven right in front of you and the ingredients are super fresh. All I can say is you need to try it. I've had all makes and models of pizza and this one is just the bees knees.",5.0
"This place is great. My wife and I have been looking for a good pizza restaurant since moving to the south slope and this is definitely the best pizza we've had in the area. When I read the owner is related to Lucali, I hoped it was going to be good. We went last night and had two pizzas - one with pepperoni, black olives and hot pepers, and another with artichoke hearts. They were both delicious. I'l be going back for sure and I was excited to see that they also make pizza to go. Highly recommended!",5.0
"The calzones are extraordinary, the pizzas excellent, and the wine very drinkable, and the owner is always in front of the brick oven making your meal.",5.0
"I think they changed up the cheese here.  It's still good, but the cheese now has kind of a regular NYC pizza place taste.  Also they use a bunch of boar's head meats which is pretty gross if you ask me.  The pizza with pepperoni is still really good, but I'm less of a fan now.",4.0

"I've read the reviews for giuseppina's and I'm surprised at the generally positive feedback - we must be going to two completely different places. I live close to giuseppina's and have been there exactly once, by choice, because frankly they just aren't good. In short: the pizza is relatively expensive (relatively because it's just a normal pizza pie; nothing like Toby's which is a block a way and has much - MUCH -- better gourmet pizza). The ""famous"" calzones are mostly dough and don't have much filling - and like the pizza, aren't good enough to command that sort of price. Staff is friendly but s-l-o-w. And the menu is limited (basically just a few varieties of pizza and calzones). Verdict? If you want good pizza or Italian food, hit toby's which is a block away. If you want a bar, you could still hit Toby's or go to Brooklyn pub, across the street (incidentally they have decent pub fair). If you want romantic, stay at home; giuseppina's is not worth the money.ALSO I keep reading about this disgruntled, douche bag chef/owner - the other day I saw him scream and yell at this poor young woman whose dog had the nerve to use the bathroom in front of giuseppina's. Oh and they weren't even open - it was 10 am on a Monday.",2.0
"Fabulous! We ate there a few weeks ago. Its owned by a family member of another popular Brooklyn pizza place so we decided to try it out. Loved the atmosphere inside the restaurant and the simplicity of the menu. Pizza and calzones only. We were only in the area visiting from Albany NY, otherwise we would definitely be returning. Very delicious food and the service was excellent. We arrived around 830 pm and were greeted with a warm welcome from the staff and owner.",5.0
"I love when restaurants keep it simple, and this place does just that.  Pizza and calzones, and excellent ones at that.  The decor is inviting, with views of the brick oven and pizza-making.  Service is excellent, and parking has not been an issue for me.  The food is pricey, let's be honest.  We were a family of four, ordered one large calzone and one pie with sausage on only half the pie.  Waters all around, and one soda.  Our bill was $54, excluding tip.  But again, there are no surprises here.  If you are willing to pay for good, quality pizza - Giuseppina's is the place.",5.0
"Pizza is a very personal thing, and I should preface this review by stating that I was raised on Denino's pizza on Staten Island, and now live within walking distance to DiFara's, both of which set, by all accounts, very high (though the latter is also very expensive) bars. But I have to say that we were disappointed, and expected much more given the reviews below. This pizza was, well, eh. Crackery crust vs. thin-and-crunchy-outside-chewy-inside. Sweet sauce with very little flavor other than the sweetness. Fresh mozzarella is always wonderful, and here no less so... but it didn't make up for the sum of the parts, if you know what I mean.  Clearly, people like it, so maybe you will, too. It's not *bad* pizza. Everything is nice and fresh. But if you've had Denino's, DiFara's, and/or Totonno's, and are hoping this is that, but closer to home... it's not.",3.0
"Wow. I thought after 20 years in NYC, I've had the best pizza. But not till last night did I really. This place is outstanding. They only have pizza and calzones. What more do you need? And they do both great. Our new favorite. We'll be back.",5.0
"This place is down the street from me and has the BEST pizza in NYC by a mile. I know a lot of people make the same claim, but really, it is. Try for yourself.

"Went last night with a party of 14 for a friends birthday. Absolutely delicious pizza made with high quality ingredients and a great selection of wine and beer. The best part of the evening was the warm and hospitable staff who treated us so well despite being such a big table. Our server Brian was so sweet, and the staff even plated and served us the cupcakes that we brought in. Fantastic night!",5.0
Pizza. Period. That's about all they serve here. And they've perfected it. Love this place.,5.0
"We went here twice in their first week open, and I have been dying to be back since.  The crust is abolutely perfect--paper thin, yeasty taste, and charred bottom.  The sauce tastes fresh and isn't too sweet.  The mozzerella is creamy and melts beautifully.  I wanted to hate it here because they are across the street from Toby's (which I also love), but the pizza is just heartbreakingly good.  Listening to Sinatra and Dino while I eat doesn't hurt either ;)",5.0
"The food was good no problems there. In fact it was very tasty, how ever i was still hungry and was already 20 bucks in. That was a little off for me. A little cheaper and i'll go here 3 times a day even though they open at 6 pm. Bummer",4.0

"Yum!  It was pretty empty on a Sunday night, so getting a table wasn't a problem.  And the pizza was delicious -- better than the pizza on my last several visits to Lucali.  Service was great. It was a bit too dark in there and would have been livelier with more fellow diners, but I will definitely be going back.",4.0

"To be fair, I had DiFara's last weekend- so that pie of perfection is still fresh in my mind.  This pizza was definitely satisfying and is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  BUT, one of the investors must not be a fan of pork.  They had no sausage and only beef pepperoni.  Also, we ordered hot peppers on our pizza and they put jalapenos on it!  In my pizza snob world, it needs to be an Italian Hot Pepper.  The crust can be very, very crispy like a cracker.  All this being said, I did like the place and will be back.",4.0
