"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. The pizza is incredibly fresh and delicious. My friend and I ordered a small margherita and mushroom truffle pizza to share. It was so flavorful, thin and the right amount of everything. Definitely ask for garlic sauce on the side!The restaurant itself is very charming and cozy, perfect for a date night or small group dinner!",5.0
"When this gorgeous space opened up in Cobble Hill, I must have passed it a dozen times before finally grabbing some friends for dinner. The first thing they noticed was the thing I love so much about this place: It's huge! Seriously, it's rare to find something that's warehouse-sized in this 'hood, and it's a nice spot to bring a big group for a meal.The pizza is amazing (and fairly priced, those complaining didn't comment on the massive size of it). The drinks are also superb--loved the Japanese influence, which was a nod to their chef.My only complaint is that the service can be a bit slow at times, but hey that might be the Italian way.",4.0
"Why it took a century to bring decent pizza to New York is a mystery to me.  When it did, it came with a price.  Considering the ingredients on the menu aren't designated DOC, (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), it's a bit much.The space is cool, the food good, but it's overpriced and cold inside.  We kept our jackets on throughout dinner, and noticed other diners did too.  Are we paying for the heat?-14"" Margherita Pizza is $14!  (DOC is $19)-Penne with Tomato Sauce $18!-Lasagna $18!Ellipsis.Drop the prices by two bucks down the menu, and you'll be a winner, otherwise it's a bit absurd.*A note on Service- We are New Yorkers, we know how restaurants work.I felt like we were being waited on by the owner overlooking the manager, who was overlooking the waiter, giving the uncomfortable feeling of being a tourist in Rome.I was waiting for the €3 for the bread charge.  Ellipsis.",3.0
Amazing atmosphere and delicious food. Beet salad is mouth watering and pizza is always made to perfection.,5.0
"This rustic chic eatery is so much more than just a pizza joint, but they definitely know how to pizza. I was pleasantly surprised by how stylish and spacious this place is. Complete with a full bar and a bartender who, I've heard, makes some rockin' cocktails, I could even see bringing a date here.My friends and I ordered a carafe of their house red, two apps (kale salad and burrata with eggplant), and two medium pizzas (Capricciosa and Diavola). The kale salad wasn't anything special, but the burrata with eggplant was delicious and unlike anything I'd ever tried before. The pizzas were also very delicious. Thin, but still soft crusts and great, fresh flavors. Just looking at the photos make me hungry.Note that the mediums are rectangular and about 2.5' long! Definitely enough for 3, or 2 hungry people. Our bill came to just under $130 before tip; a good value for the amount and quality of food you get!",4.0
"Such a wonderful experience at this place ! The food and wine , divine ! The staff are amazing and so friendly ! They make you feel like you are eating at a restaurant in Venice . If you are looking for an authentic Italian restaurant absolutely come here ! I wish I could give it 10 stars !",5.0
"I am so glad I get to update this review with 5 stars because I've really been rooting for Numero 28.Came for the third time last night at 11:45pm (yes, they were still serving food!) and the service was absolutely stellar. The food, as it's always been, was on point. (So far I've tried the reginella and frichetta pizzas, the homemade fettuccine in tomato sauce topped with fresh basil, and the bruschetta). The classic, fresh flavors plus the kindness of my waiter just made my night.Thank you, guys. Keep it up!",5.0
Solid addition to the neighborhood / diverse menu / good staff / cocktails could be more interesting but solid / you should try it.,4.0
"Beautiful restaurant with authentic Italian pizzas (and staff!). We went in during brunch hours (they do have a brunch menu), but decided to stick with personal pizzas- the Italian way! If you've ever had pizza in Italy, this is going to bring you back to that delicious moment. If not, let me give you a virtual taste. Italian style pizzas are usually 10-12 inches and made for a single person. That's a sort of fun size where you're going to feel really happy (and then really sad) if you eat the whole thing yourself, but you might start slapping your dining partner's hand if you just share one. The pizza is very thin, though not crispy, and has the best quality ingredients and sauce adorning it. Bellissima! The restaurant is very well done, cozy and chic, and the staff are great. Highly recommend checking it out.",5.0
"We all enjoyed our plates here!  Shrimp Risotto, pizza, and lasagna!   Great ambiance inside and in Brooklyn!  Pizzas are huge and super tasty with their fresh ingredients!  We recommend eating all our choices and def recommend the Creme Brûlée! Will come back again!",4.0
"I came here with my parents around 10 PM on Saturday night. The space is gorgeous; it's cozy and light with great front windows (the front walls are entirely windows) that overlook a quiet, residential block. The room was lit with candles and soft lighting that gave it a romantic, comfortable feel. The waiter was fantastic and the food was spectacular. My dad and I shared the Arugula salad (fairly basic: arugula, cherry tomatoes, and Parmesan cheese with a nice, light balsamic dressing) and a sausage pizza that was enormous (we got a medium--there were plenty of leftovers). My mum ordered the calamari which were delicious (lightly fried, chewy, perfection) and the eggplant Parmesan which I believe is an appetizer but satiated her just fine.The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is wonderful, the service is great. I HIGHLY recommend Numero 28 for date night or just a nice dining experience.",5.0
"Some of the best pizza made by reeeeaaal Italians... From Italy LOLA we dropped in for a quick bite at midnight.The staff was friendly, no one rolled their eyes at us strolling in almost at closing.The place was lovely, warm and intimate. Nicely decorated and clean. Even their bathrooms were well kept.We didn't explore everything that's offered here because the place was closing but there was a full bar with some interesting looking cocktails on their menu.The pizzas were pricy but worth every penny. We got a margarita pizza. Thin crust, fresh, flavorful, non greasy... Just top quality. They gave us a bowl of fresh parm cheese to sprinkle as much as our hearts want. But honestly, the pizza was so flavorful, I chose to just enjoy it as is.We were very impressed and we're glad we stumbled on this place accidentally.After we took our first bite, we basically committed to coming back to try more. Great little gem here.",5.0

"Okay, I am very picky about my italian food. I was really impressed by this place. It was the closest to authentic since I dined at Obica. It is not the same level in quality of products and style, this place is a bit more casual and easy. But for what this place is, the pizza, caponata, burrata, and the tiramisu were all lovely. The server was really friendly. The atmosphere is very inviting and casual. I was there for Easter walked in with my boyfriend and we were both pleasantly surprised. Flavors were good and it was just an overall pleasant experience. It deserved 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations.",5.0
"I'm a regular customer of the other pizzeria in the East Village location and this was my first time at Cobble Hill location.It was the perfect evening to sit on the lounge next to the window and dine.We had the pizza Tokyo (crispy flat bread topped with fresh tuna, scallions and mayo-wasabi) OMG!!and the grilled Octopus served over mashed chickpeas was outstanding! The food is authentic and prepared by their Italian (and hot!) chef.The servers are always smiling and making sure that you have a fantastic time.I definitely recommend this place , try them and you'll be back for more :)",5.0
"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT:Come here for good fresh pizza, good vibes, and delicious cocktails. Further details below my friends! :)After a few drinks across the street at the 61 Local bar, my friends and I decided to grab dinner here. Their pizza is really fresh and the server suggested we order a large pie. The cool points here is that you can order your specialty pizzas and divvy it up across one pie... SO we each got to order our desired flavors.The icing on this gem of a venue is their signature cocktails. I believe their bartender either came from or used to operate a speakeasy in NYC (I don't recall which). I wish I took a picture of their drink menu since I didn't realize this is a new addition to the Numero 28 Cucina chains in NYC, but please order up your drink of choice and I promise you can't go wrong (all 3 of us literally tasted each different drink order and we loved each one).Cheers!",4.0

So please do yourself a favor, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.",5.0
"The pros: gorgeous space, if a little bit too on-the-nose for bougie hipster Brooklyn. The pizza was delicious. Right amount of chew and crisp in the crust. Cocktails: I had the Kipling which had grapefruit, Montenegro, and earl grey infused gin. Balanced and delicious. The cons: Uneven service. Our waiter was horrible, ignoring my drink order and not taking my date's-- he was distracted with incoming guests. Which was odd because the restaurant wasn't even busy. Later when I asked him for my drink he claimed I never gave the order to him, which was charming, really. Nice to blame it on the customer. Thanks. I could really have done without the attitude. I'm docking one star for that. The risotto with radicchio and taleggio was a special but it was a little bland. The portions are BIG. This is not a bad thing necessarily, but be warned.",3.0
"After waiting for the opening of this little jewel impatiently, I have finally got to try the new Numero 28 in Cobble Hill with a few friends, and let me tell you something, you are going to ADORE this place. Of course, if you are fond the followings:- A nice location: just at the edge between Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill, with a quiet yet fun surrounding atmosphere.- A great bar/restaurant concept: I love the interior, the furniture, the music and the HUGE (full) bar. You'll be amazed by the cocktails you are going to get. The bartenders are clearly well-experienced, I got a gin-cucumber drink served in a freshly cut green pepper inserted in a chilled mint julep cup, which tasted amazing!- The food: I was expecting something good already, being an habitué of their LES venue, but they managed to surprise me. We started off with an experimental pizza topped with tuna sashimi, freshly made wasabi mayo and scallions, but I won't deceive you, it is not in the menu yet so it may not be available. We also ordered some of their fish appetizers, including the polipo and the tuna tartare, which were both EXQUISITE. Following up, three different tastes of their delicious pizzas (my favorite so far is the broccoli rabe and salsiccia) and a (fantastic) creme brulee and panna cotta with a few espressos to conclude.At this point, I don't know if you might still be reading this review instead of heading to Numero 28 already, but if you are, don't think another minute and try this place, you won't regret it!",5.0
This pizza is it!! We ordered a medium diavolo and it was perfection. It arrived on a long wood cutting board which was a nice rustic touch. We have been to a few other wood fired pizza places and all had very wet crusts. Número 28 has it down to a science be every piece had the perfect (to us) consistency. I adore the charred color on the crust and it adds that amazing smokey taste. The sauce is insane. It tastes just like the freshest tomato and not tomato paste. The soppressata is a lovely textural topping and the mozzarella was nicely melted. The decor and ambience was a nice rustic/urban cafe feel. We loved that the front windows were open for that indoor/outdoor dining experience. While the service left a bit to be desired the food made up for it. This is definitely going to become our regular pizza fix.,5.0

"Pretty disappointing considering we've been going to the other Number 28 establishments in the city. This one did have a nice decor and does accept cards, but the quality wasn't that great compared to the others. Partner got the Capricciosa, and I usually get the Rustica, but they didn't have it. They did have a similar version with Kale. We tried to order some beer but they seemed to be out of everything except the bland stuff. As far as the pizzas go, one was undercooked and the other was burnt. The flavor wasn't there, which was sad since we do like the other restaurants which sold us on flavor. Maybe it was an off night, but it was pretty disappointing to be let down on so many fronts at once. Overall, try the ones in the city if you have a bad experience here.",2.0

Sad part is some local zoning issue with a church has temporarily revoked their liquor license.

"Just want to start by saying that the food was excellent, but the service every time I've been here has been exceedingly poor.Of the three of four times I've been to Numero 28, I've had the cheese plate, bruschetta, salad, and numerous pizzas and pastas. I was more than happy with the food, but the service was only mediocre. The pizza and the pasta seemed to be made on a totally different schedule - they tried to bring out my friend's pasta with our appetizers, but she asked them to wait until our entrees came out. The waiter seemed pretty annoyed about it, and I noticed a lot of tables had food coming out at different times - the couple next to us got their meals like 20 minutes apart. The staff was also not particularly repsonsive or friendly. It took us a long time to flag the waitress down for water and the check, and no one came by to see how we were doing after our food came. I keep going back because the food is good and my friends like going, but to be honest, I regret it while I'm there every time because the service is so awful.",2.0
"Can't express enough how great of an addition this restaurant is to the neighborhood! Having frequented Numero 28 in the east village, I knew the pizza and pasta would be delicious.

"We've been here twice, and are quite pleased that Numero 28 opened this spot on Bergen Street. The space itself is open and airy, with floor-to-ceiling windows that fully open, creating an indoor/outdoor vibe if you are seated near the front. At the owner's suggestion, we had the reginella, which was deceptively simple - margherita with fresh buffalo mozarella. The pizza is delicious. It comes out on long wooden boards, and you can customize your pizza or do half and half with different types. We also tried some of the salads as starters and enjoyed those.",4.0
"Just okay. Not sure if it's because we have had such amazing pizza and meatballs at other places in Brooklyn, but it was nothing special. While the sauce was good, the meatballs were over cooked and hard. They also needed a lot of salt.  The Pere salad was nothing special- the dressing was also lacking salt.  The pizza was fine, but a little soggy on the bottom. The service was just okay- we waiting a long time for the food and had to ask several times for water and remind the waitress to check for our food.  The Sangria was good. All in all, mediocre food and service. I would rather go to Luzzos or Sotto Casa or Lucali.",2.0
"Never again! The waiter this past Friday night was so rude and unpleasant. We were a party of 4 and sat by one waiter then told to ""move"" because the table was ""reserved"" by another waiter a few minutes later.  We quietly moved tables. But then sat there waiting for menus for over 10 minutes. We all felt very unwelcome and left. There were TONS of available tables in the place. We live down the block and have tried the place 3 or 4 times and all but one time there were frustrating issues. We are very easy going people. Not ever bringing people there again. We had a lovely dinner at Chez Moi that night. Next time we go to Table 88 where we always have a lovely time.",1.0

"Just want to start by saying that the food was excellent, but the service every time I've been here has been exceedingly poor.Of the three of four times I've been to Numero 28, I've had the cheese plate, bruschetta, salad, and numerous pizzas and pastas. I was more than happy with the food, but the service was only mediocre. The pizza and the pasta seemed to be made on a totally different schedule - they tried to bring out my friend's pasta with our appetizers, but she asked them to wait until our entrees came out. The waiter seemed pretty annoyed about it, and I noticed a lot of tables had food coming out at different times - the couple next to us got their meals like 20 minutes apart. The staff was also not particularly repsonsive or friendly. It took us a long time to flag the waitress down for water and the check, and no one came by to see how we were doing after our food came. I keep going back because the food is good and my friends like going, but to be honest, I regret it while I'm there every time because the service is so awful.",2.0
"Can't express enough how great of an addition this restaurant is to the neighborhood! Having frequented Numero 28 in the east village, I knew the pizza and pasta would be delicious. What I wasn't prepared for were the cocktails. Mamma mia, were they good!! You can tell a great deal of thought was put into crafting the drink menu and the bartenders really know their stuff. The restaurant has an airy and lofty vibe but the decor is cozy and the staff make you feel right at home. I had the D.O.C. pizza but will definitely be back to try the Pizza Tokyo!",4.0
Absolutely delicious! Their pizza is wonderful and the pasta is perfection. We've visited a few times and they have never disappointed!,5.0
I came here for a late snack . I ordered a couple of appetizers . They were all fresh and delicious .I hope they get their liquor license soon .,5.0
"We've been here twice, and are quite pleased that Numero 28 opened this spot on Bergen Street. The space itself is open and airy, with floor-to-ceiling windows that fully open, creating an indoor/outdoor vibe if you are seated near the front. At the owner's suggestion, we had the reginella, which was deceptively simple - margherita with fresh buffalo mozarella. The pizza is delicious. It comes out on long wooden boards, and you can customize your pizza or do half and half with different types. We also tried some of the salads as starters and enjoyed those.",4.0
"Just okay. Not sure if it's because we have had such amazing pizza and meatballs at other places in Brooklyn, but it was nothing special. While the sauce was good, the meatballs were over cooked and hard. They also needed a lot of salt.  The Pere salad was nothing special- the dressing was also lacking salt.  The pizza was fine, but a little soggy on the bottom. The service was just okay- we waiting a long time for the food and had to ask several times for water and remind the waitress to check for our food.  The Sangria was good. All in all, mediocre food and service. I would rather go to Luzzos or Sotto Casa or Lucali.",2.0
"Never again! The waiter this past Friday night was so rude and unpleasant. We were a party of 4 and sat by one waiter then told to ""move"" because the table was ""reserved"" by another waiter a few minutes later.  We quietly moved tables. But then sat there waiting for menus for over 10 minutes. We all felt very unwelcome and left. There were TONS of available tables in the place. We live down the block and have tried the place 3 or 4 times and all but one time there were frustrating issues. We are very easy going people. Not ever bringing people there again. We had a lovely dinner at Chez Moi that night. Next time we go to Table 88 where we always have a lovely time.",1.0
"We wanted this place to be great. This space is in the perfect location and has failed so many times. I don't know if it is under the same ownership, but this is another total fail. The bar is ok. The food is ok to good. The service is terrible. I waited for my third visit to write a review because I wanted to love it, but three times in and same story: there is always a big party there who knows the owners and the service only pays attn to them; it is overrun by small children wandering and crying (and I have my own - this is the complaint from my 7yo); and our grownup meals came out a full 21 minutes before the pizza we ordered for the younger folk. Ridiculous.",2.0
"This review is for their breakfast service: I was on my way to 61 Local to grab my coffee--always a great place, but I saw the window open across the street at Número 28 today, and since it was a sunny, lovely morning, it made better sense to sit at the window, outside, than to sit inside in the dark. This place is under new ownership, but the open, inviting interior remains the same. The wide marble bar also remains--one of the most inviting and comfortable bar spaces in the neighborhood. I was told that several of their bartenders migrated over from the Japanese speakeasy Angel Share (!)--that is why several other commenters have mentioned that they seem to know their stuff.",5.0
This is one of the best pizzas in New York. I am not a fan of American-style pizza. Numero 28 use good ingredients and make good Italian-styled pizzas,4.0
Just randomly decided to go have a drink and loved the layout of this place so I sat at the window bar...Best decision ever!! This watermelon cocktails were so worth it and refreshing...Then I got in on the food...The Chef Allessandri definitely knows what he's doing with that grilled octopus mmmmm... I can still taste it!! The pizza was amazing too..Definitely my new spot !! The open concept it perfect for the neighborhood and a summer night in BK!! Love love love!!,5.0
"We've eaten here 3 times and I'm a fan.  The pizza is so good, it wasn't until the third visit we tried something else.   We had the Bronzino, simply prepared and accompanied by a generous portion of grilled vegetables.  The salads are generous, carefully dressed and perfect for sharing.   The pizza is fantastic with a wide range of options.  With the large pie, you can have up to 3 different types which helps solve any disagreements in your party including between meat eaters and vegetarians.  The toppings are fresh and generous and the crust is well cooked and never soggy.  Decor is funky - they play vintage Micky mouse cartoons silently in the lounge area, often with zoned out kids relaxing while their parents enjoy their meal.",4.0
