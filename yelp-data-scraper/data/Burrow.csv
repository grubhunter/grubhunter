"This place is the most amazing hidden gem.We popped in here just for a cup of coffee, after seeing all the amazing desserts, we got two with our coffees. They were so amazing, that we turned around and picked up three more!The Almond Tulle, incredibly crisp and delicate. Perfectly caramelized.The Raspberry jam bar with their own private jam, which we asked if they sold it because if they did we seriously would've bought a quart to take home.The Tea Cake was sublime. I haven't enjoyed one as much outside of Japan.The Maple Madeline excellent with a subtle twist. The most challenging this is making sure I time visits here for when they're actually open!They are absolutely worth it, warm, friendly staff in TINY cozy atmosphere.",5.0
"What a special place - you can tell everything here is made with as much love as talent. The owner is a real artist. The chocolate ganache cookie is the best cookie I've had in recent memory. The shortbread is light, buttery, and a touch salty while the ganache is silky and barely sweet. It's perfectly balanced. If you like subtle desserts that don't punch you in the face with sugar, you'll probably like it here. Cookies are $2 each, cakes are around $5 a slice. Very reasonable for such unique and delicious desserts. I hope Burrow stays around a while.",4.0
"It's almost criminal how good the smell is during lunchtime in my office's lobby - the smell of freshly baked scones and muffins in the air. MmmmmMmm.I bought a few scones from here. There were really good :). Maybe a little dry but overall, super delicious. If only this placw had a sign because it's next to impossible to spot from Jay Street.Will be going back fo' sure.",4.0
"Lots of places in NY get hailed as ""hidden gems,"" but Burrow really earns the moniker.  There's only a small and very discrete sign in front of the apartment building whose lobby Burrow calls home.  Much like the Weasleys' home of the same name in the Harry Potter books, you have to *know* what you're looking for ahead of time when it comes to his cozy little spot.  Once you've found it, you'll be greeted by the friendly proprietor ready to make you a warm drink or serve up a pasty from their mystical case of offerings.  I didn't sample any beverages myself, but thoroughly enjoyed my double chocolate chip cookie that was equal parts chewy and crisp.  Would definitely come back to try other goodies they have to offer, and to mystify my friends with what a ""hidden"" New York spot *actually* looks like :)",4.0
"Finally got to try this place after discovering it on Instagram. Extremely adorable shop! I bought a pistachio cake and a snow ball. All their items here are too cute to be eaten. I thought some of the items were toys. They have a huge assortment of cookies. Definitely a take out and to go place. the snow ball is delicious, it made me reminiscent of the almond cookies I had in Macau. Super yummy and lightly powered with sugar. I successfully brought the pistachio cake on my flight to Minnesota and shared it with my boyfriend. It was fantastic! It was like a mousse cake but it was light and creamy and not too heavy. I didn't feel guilty or gluttonous while eating it. Thanks to Burrow for providing an ice pack with my cake to keep it at perfect temperature. Definitely coming back to try the rest of their goodies, such an underrated and delicious secret this shop is!",4.0
Lapin purchased a couple of treats for me the other day. He gotten a couple of scones and two chocolate mousse cake (he also got a cookie but ate that without sharing -.-). The blueberry scone was a bit dry and tasted like Pillsbury  biscuits and the mousse cake was fluffy but kind of bland. The treats are a bit small and bland for the price. If you like soft and subtle tastes (not too sugary) this might appeal to you more than it did to me.,3.0
"Best pastries baked w/ love and care. Just like the couple who run this place, it is simple, high quality and just the right portions and sugar content. All of my friends and I are a big fan. Try this when you are in the neighborhood. Great location for cyclists and pedestrians alike, the place exudes the sweet, buttery smell of goodness. Excellent coffee as well!!! Highly recommend.",5.0
"Really cute hidden cafe. Seems to be Japanese owned and operated so the quality is really high. Pros:Solid coffeeThey have non dairy milk Really delicious homemade pastries (the ovens make the place really warm)Very reasonable prices Kind staff Cons:Small space with limited seatingLatte and cappuccino foam is too ""foamy"" and solid. Limited hoursVery warm due to a lack of air conditioning, but maybe they just didn't turn it on yet. I'm looking forward to being a regular here!",4.0
"Classic French desserts with Japanese sensibility. Sweet yet very light.Ayako-san makes some of the tastiest treats around. I regularly pick up a snack here when I need a mid-day boost. Additionally she is always coming up with new creations, so there's even more incentive to check in regularly and see what indulgences are available. This is also my go to spot for teas and (hipster-free) coffee.I've also ordered cakes for special occasions and I've had them provide catering for sweets at some of my events. If you haven't already done so, you need to follow her Instagram: burr0w",5.0
Tragically late-opening coffee shop/Pâtisserie. I walk by it every morning at 7:30am and a tear comes to my eye.,4.0

My first review on yelp!! Fantastic pistachio cake!! Best birthday cake ever!! Super friendly staff!!,5.0
"Ayako-san is the BEST!!! She made incredible cakes for our dinner party that were the HIT of the evening. She is incredibly talented artistically AND at making the most phenomenol cakes I have ever tasted. Every single cake she makes is absolutely fantastic. My favorites were the strawberry shortcake, pistachio cake, and chocolate cake. All the desserts are perfectly balanced and most importantly, not too sweet. It's the absolute ideal level of subtle sweetness that Japanese and Korean cakes are known for. Love this place!",5.0
"Had my best best best ever Apple pie so far. If I live in the city, I will try everything here. Love it.",5.0
"Small patisserie inside 68 Jay St lobby but worth the effort to find it. Because they are so small their cookies and cakes are extremely fresh--more than other businesses in Dumbo even. Some of my faves are the hazelnut cookies, madeleines and maple cream puff. Def make a trip to Dumbo for these fresh sweets!",4.0

"Little bakery with pastries by the Instagram-famous Ayako Kurokawa. Genius looking desserts, perfect as gifts. Make sure to check out her website to view the portrait cakes she makes, and other whimsical custom orders. Cookies are very rich, best enjoyed with a hot cup of tea or coffee. My mom does not like sweets, but loved their maple madeline. Their caramels (both strawberry and mango flavored) are the best caramels I've ever had.However, be warned that this is a very small space, no seating/maybe a chair or two but definitely no tables. It's more of a take-out place (I hope they expand into a slightly bigger space with window lighting some day! They deserve it.)",4.0

"Burrow is an absolute gem in Dumbo! All of their baked goods are incredibly delicate and delicious, but my favorite is the chocolate ganache cookie. It is magic.

"My son and I come here after fencing for a weekly treat. This lovely, homely little bakery is run by charming Japanese folk. The pastries are simple and perfectly baked. We love the fig and also the chocolate ganache - both melt in-the-mouth delicious. The hot chocolate is incredible - a mix of milk and dark chocolate flavours plus toasted coconut and rich cream. It is simply the best hot chocolate we have ever had. We love this shop - the staff and gentle, quietly-given service are a throwback to another era and reminds us of why we loved living in Japan (many moons ago!).",5.0

The desserts are always different and each one is a little work of art.  I love coming to work and smelling all the concoctions baking. The staff is lovely.
