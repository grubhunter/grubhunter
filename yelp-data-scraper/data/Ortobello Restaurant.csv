"came here for dinner with my colleague.She recommend this spot, it's her regular family dinner spot for Italian food.I have to say this is by far the more authentic Italian place i been to and best flavor.Colleague ordered a bacon spaghetti and i had the lasagna.They were both good, pasta made fresh in the kitchen when you order!!!!  a huge +++++I do want to point out though, my lasagna was too salty, they could go light on the sauce.We have cappuccino and tiramisu for desert even though we cannot finish out big plates of food.  lol  BUT, this cup of cappuccino was the best!  yes, it was a bit heavy with wimp cream, it was a great treat. Tiramisu actually had a shot of espresso in it!  WOW!  i was shocked and amazed and grateful.  It was worth every penny.Def recommend this place and i will be back!",4.0

"This seems like an authentic classic old school Italian restaurant. It's small with a homey vibe. Looks like a family run business. To start we had the mussels marinara. The portions were huge and the marinara sauce was great. We dipped the free bread that they gave us in the sauce and it was wonderful. For entrée, we had the pollo marsala, which is chicken in marsala wine sauce with mushrooms. This I wasn't a fan of. The taste was light and not a flavorful dish. But, if you prefer something light this is a good choice to get. Also ordered the tortellini bolognese. I love the bolognese sauce, which is like a minced meat and tomato sauce. The tortellini is a type of pasta stuffed with cheese. I didn't know that it had cheese filling or I would've chose something else. It wasn't the type of cheese that I like either, so it was too much cheese for me. I would've enjoyed it much more if it were a different type of pasta with no filling. And last, we had the shrimp marinara. You can't go wrong with this dish. It has big shrimps and clams in the dish. The spaghetti coated in marinara sauce was just delicious. The portions here are so big that we couldn't finish everything and had to take the leftovers to go. I highly advise you to not over order. One entrée can definitely be shared between 2 people. Even the appetizers are humongous. They accept credit cards, but tips need to be in cash. Prices are in the $20's, which is reasonable for the portions that they give.",3.0
"We made a reservation at the restaurant several days before. Upon arrival, an older, blond hostess/owner  informed us that there was no space available. When I told her we had a reservation, she told me I was lying. I found the card with the reservation information on it, and she still refused to believe that I had a reservation. We left in shock as she chased us down the street looking to start an argument.!!!!  "" Fratelli d'Italia"" Avoid this place at all costs. We went to a different restaurant, Europa, at 6423 20th avenue, where we were treated very nicely.",1.0
"I might've had my expectations set a little too high for this restaurant. I was expecting something out of this world but it was just good old Italian food. Don't get me wrong, I love Italian food but didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary.  The only dish that I absolutely loved was the seafood salad. This refreshing dish is perfect for a hot summer.  Actaully, it'll be good on any given day. It's super light and tangy. Everything else was pretty good but not jaw dropping good. Prices are fairly steep for a Brooklyn restaurant but I guess the large portion makes it worth it. I also really liked the fact that this place is run by Italians who can actually speak Italian. It feels extra authentic. I would definitely be returning to try more dishes and of course for that yummy seafood salad.",4.0

"This place is authentic. It is So authentic that when I walked in with my family...we felt like we don't belong and only the Italians should come here. Warning: they got BIG portions!!!!!Me, my wife and our two kids ordered the Mozzarella Logs, mussels in white sauce and baked clams as starters; then we had spaghetti with meat ball, seafood risotto and chicken cutlet with mozzarella cheese and salad over it..... The portions were so huge that we barely made a dent, so be mindful when you order. Let's talk food: The mozzarella logs are not your typical mozzarella sticks! These logs are HUGE! One log is probably equal to 3-4 of the regular sticks combined and a order comes with like 8-10 of them..... We each had one and packed the rest. The mussels..... I normally don't eat mussels...its my wife and daughter's thing. But these mussels were sitting in a buttery sauce loaded with garlic, fused with lemon that is simply irresistible. The baked clams.... Hmm.... Where do I begin? These are not your average Joe stuff either! Fresh clams stuffed with garlic and stuffings baked to perfection on top of garlic sauce ...did not expect this level of foods coming out of this small, old local restaurant. ---------------------------------------Main course:Spaghetti with meatball: the meatballs pack a subtle yet elegant flavor.... Not the best I have had but definitely sits in the top 5. The sauce is really what made it special. I like my spaghetti just a little hard so I felt their spaghetti was a bit over cooked and soft. Seafood risotto- OMG!!!!!! Soooo good!!!! Shrimp, mussels, octopus, abalone!!! The flavor was incredible! So delicious. All the yumminess of the seafood got soaked into the rice..... Need I say more? For $30 it is a gigantic plate!!!!! Mozzarella + salad over fried chicken cutlet was decent but nothing special, although it is good I would still say skip it and order something else. Our waiter has to be at least 60. Good, old fashioned clean service with that true local flare. Love it love it.  He came by and said ""if you guys finish all the food I buy you cheese cake on the house!"" Laughs and walks away. Hahahah. Great dinner, great service, great food. These local jewels need to stick around for at least a few more generations.",4.0
"Warning - you will wait for what feels FOREVER.... But it will be some of the best food you've ever had.. EVER! One of the closest tastes to Italy I've ever had in the states!It's a tiny restaurant on a Bensonhurst corner. Have some wine will you wait because every item is made fresh to order. You will become addicted! My personal favorites are the pasta fagoli, stuffed mushrooms, capellini primavera and farfalle al salmon. I love the feel of this restaurant. My uncle was an Italian artist and it reminds me of being in his studio. They also make awesome hero sandwiches perfect for incredible lunch takeout!",5.0
"One of my friends recommended me coming to this place for authentic Italian food. Boy was I amazed by the food here. This place is by far the  best Italian food I have had and I live in the neighborhood and I never knew about it. I wish I knew about this place earlier !The portions are huge here, just like your regular family style Italian restaurant. The waiters are also very friendly here and always checking up on you if you need anything.I don't think I wanna write any description or how good the food are because I don't want to spoil for you guys! You guys should definitely their pepper orreganto, penne vodka , bowtie pasta with salmone, and their steak. They are all excellent. The pasta sauces here are all homemade, they are very rich in flavor. Trust me, you guys will come back again like me!",5.0
"Oh dear Ortobello. Why is your food so good? If you're famished, you should skip this spot, because quality food does take a while here. However, if you manage to stay alive with the complimentary bread, then you will reap the benefits of a hearty and yummy meal. The portions are gigantic. I got the veal parm and it was bigger than my face. Their seafood linguine is ginormous! It could've feed all six of us! They don't skimp on the amount of seafood or the variety. Our seafood linguine had mussels, clams, squid, octopus, fish, and this other shell fish that I can't think of the name. When the guy brought out the dish, he even took the scenic route to make sure all the other patrons saw the dish before arriving to our table. I think most people who venture out to this part of Brooklyn will probably flood to another more notable restaurant, but wait until more discover Ortobello!",5.0
"A very cozy family run Italian restaurant. Very authentic.

Super big!!Stuffed mushrooms were good, descent size and I loved the sauce.I also ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken, big plate.3 orders, 3 ppl, besides the mushrooms...

"Huge Portions! Wonderful wait staff and the floor manager for the night was super friendly. He had a pleasant smile and was great to every table and patrons. It's bare bones decor but you really come here for the food. Had nicely fried up and huge portions of fried calamari. Went nicely with the house sauce which you see had chunks of tomato in it. Ceasar salad was good. Lot's of parmesean and ceasar sauce that enveloped every green leaf. The chicken parm was the standout. Crispy edges, a wonderful sauce, and the melted mozz on top had the right amount of crisp. The chicken masala tended to be a bit salty but the chicken itself was cooked perfectly with huge mushrooms.

He laughed and said, ""No, and don't reheat it at home in the microwave, use the stove"". To say the food here is good would be an understatement, it is ""Multo Bene"" (magnificent).The owner came over to our table and asked us if we enjoyed our dinner. I wanted to grab him, give him a big hug and a kiss, but I know I will be back... I don't want things to get weird. ""Everything about your place is beautiful"" I said, he smiled and walked away.

"Came here one Sunday afternoon with the bf and his parents to try it out for the first time. I've lived in Bensonhurst my whole life and used to pass this place on the way to school on the bus each morning, never thinking it was a place to eat. It has one of those old rusted looking signs, but that just added to the authenticity of how long it's been there.We walk into a small but intimate space with an ""at Nonna's* house"" type of feel (exercising my 7 years of school taught Italian and Bensonhurst upbringing ). We must've gotten lucky because no one else was there so we had free choice of seating. Only half way through our meal did a couple walk in for their lunch.We ordered the ""best mussels in town"" in red sauce, baked clams, linguini with red clam sauce, chicken parm and rigatoni alla vodka and a bottle of wine($35).The mussels were ok, but was a large portion and the sauce was very good. The baked clams were great! Tender and the breading and sauce were delicious. The linguini with clam sauce was also very good with good flavor. The rigatoni was good, but a little too creamy. The chicken parm was heaping and pretty good as well. Most things were priced decently for the portion size and they also have 3 course meals where you can pick an app, entree and dessert starting at around $27.50 and I believe you can also get this to go. Portions were big so we had some leftovers for lunch Wouldn't mind trying it again and would definitely get the baked clams!",4.0
"WOW! I'm blown away by this place. It has an old school mob family kinda feel. The chef is great. Friendly guy with a big personality. The food is even better!

"Just returned from Ortobello's Restaurant and I have to say, this will always be my favorite Italian restaurant. Today I was with mom and sis and the two of them chose to go with the chicken parm. There are no wrong/bad choices at this restaurant because everything is amazing. The staff is beyond friendly and they have all of my respect. As for myself, I went with a dozen baked clams to start and followed that up with their famous zuppa di pesce. Now I need to say that the zuppa di pesce is the biggest vessel of food I have ever seen. I tried to take it down but I hit the infamous food wall and had to tap out. You will see the before and after pic that Andy (the owner) took. Ortobello's is family owned and operated.

"Just got home from a great dinner at Ortobello's. Doesn't look like much from outside but it was very nice inside. Pretty small place so parties of over 2-3 might want to call ahead. We (2 people) got there about 745ish and about 20 min later the place was full. Food: for an appetizer we got mozzarella in carozza. Wasn't like the usual carozza I've had at many other restaurants. This was in a butter and wine sauce maybe? Whatever it was it was great. Huge portions! About the size of a brick of mozzarella. And we got two huge bricks. So 1 came home with us. My girlfriend got veal sorentino. Very good. The veal was cooked very nicely. The eggplant was tender and the prosciutto was a nice addition. After seeing all the pictures of chicken parm on yelp I had to try. Again huge portions. Never seen a cutlet that big. Cheese was smothering the chicken and the sauce was great. Both entrees came with a side of either pasta, potato croquettes or a salad. Croquettes were great and the pasta was al dente and nice amount of sauce. After so much food we really didn't want dessert so we decided to get an espresso each. Extremely surprised when we were brought a pot of espresso and a bottle of sambucca. Price was about 20-25 an entree and the appetizers ranged from about 15-25. The espresso was 10 but we got a whole. Prices may seem steep but the amount of food you get is enough for leftovers for.the next day. Overall, a great time with great food.

As a small business owner myself, I always try to look pass the negative and reports all that is good.With that been said, here is what I think of this place. Hubby and I was looking for some quiet and small intimate  place for dinner. As we walked in we were greeted by our waiter who was amazing (a solid 5 star for him alone). We place our order of stuff clams (a little too much breading) the eggplant rotini was amazing and huge. ( also a solid 5 star). Then came the main course which as you can guess it was gigantic. Veal was up to par and my fried fish was good (solid 4 star). So all in all we really enjoyed our evening out. But here's what went wrong, a women who worked or own this restaurant came in. As with all the other customer who came through the door, we always had a smile on. Even through we made eye contact with her she had no acknowledgement which is fine since she is not my waiter who was fantastic. But it did get a little busy with just one waiter and I saw her helping with water refill and I ask for some cheese. She snapped at me and said it was on the table but seeing there wasn't any she went and gave it to me. Alright also no biggie, again she is not my wonderful waiter, but when the check was given she snatch it with a mean face. I have no idea why she is like that, maybe we did not speak Italian like some of the other customers there. But even if she was not happy she should have the etiquette of at least when taking the check said thank you. ( the check was almost $100 for two) She really ruin my evening with my hubby. It's not the money spent but the precious time we had without any kids this evening. Again it's not my waiter's fault And I tip above average.In conclusion, I might go back and cross my finger she is not there. Nah why chance it. I was thinking of coming here with my kids but NO WAY, I don't want to have my kids expose to this unnecessary discriminatory behavior.",1.0
"awesome food and even more awesome environment. with a Bensonhurst that is rapidly becoming Chinese, it is cool to see one of these old-school italian american restaurant still hanging on the block. i just loved the decor of the restaurant and family feel you get from the servers and owners. the prices are affordable toojust one knock though... it took quite a long time for our entrees to be served after the appetizers. from some previous posters, it seems like this is a reoccurring thing at the restaurant which prompts me to leave the 4 stars instead of the 5. i'll definitely come back and hopefully that will be something that'd be improved upon.",4.0
"So turned off before even sitting down.  Walked by and decided to go inside to check it out.  It's small and quaint.  I asked to see the menu before they seat me to see what they have and the waiter just rolled his eyes and gave me a ""are you serious"" look.

This place has the worse service I ever experienced! My friends and I went to get a table there and we were greeted by this waiter who was rude and had his nose up in the air as if he was didn't care for our business. Food was not any better than your average place either. It is BY FAR the worse service I've ever experienced. I would never come here again and this waiter obviously doesn't care to bring business in for his employer. Do not come here unless you are italian yourself because you won't be welcomed here.,1.0
I live close to this place and decided to try their menu with my bf. The portions are really good and one dish can actually feed two people. We ordered the mozarella in ricotta and the chicken sorrentino  which were delish and they don't play with the cheese. Cheese over cheese! Overall the place is really good! But the kitchen is a bit slow and my bf and I did not like the fact that they charge you $5 if you share the dish. The old waiter was really unfriendly to our table because I guess he got some attitude from the woman in the table next to ours but the son of the owner of the stablishment took our orders and his service was really nice. Will I come back again? YES. But maybe to take out only.,4.0

"Two stars for decent food. Went for dinner for the first time to celebrate friends bday. Grew up in the neighborhood and have never been plus yelp has good reviews also many commenting on the large portions. We go in and are seated immediately to the left of the door next to an old school telephone that kept ringing for the entire 1 and half hr that we sat there waiting for bread to be served to us. (Waiter took our order impatiently) so back to ordering. There's a sign that says $5 cover charge for shared entrees. That was fine. So we order an appetizer and an entree it was just two grls how much could we possibly eat? and waiter says to us, ""you can't share entrees"" I pointed to the sign. He says ""let me ask"". He comes back and points to the bottom of the menu where it says no sharing for dinner.  Since when do you dictate what customers order???",2.0
"I lived around the corner from Ortobello for six years, seen the crowd it attracts, and never tried until recently.  The place is a hole in the wall with 1970s decor - mirrors and that pressed board made to look like white stone, and tacky hand written signs all over the walls.After two visits I can safely say NEVER AGAIN!  It was crowded the night of our first visit. we were seated and waited about 15+ minutes for water and menus, and another 15+ minutes for drinks.  From the moment we came in the waiters and hostess kept apologizing about the delay.   We waited well over an hour for our meal.  The food was just ok, nothing exceptional.   My friend actually didn't care for his Penne Vodka and barely touched it.  We gave Ortobello a second chance one night when it was not busy.  Still the excruciating wait for food and the apologies.  I ordered a veal chop medium, it was huge and tasty but raw near the bone.  I expect better for $44.  My attorney is old school Brooklyn Italian and recently asked me about  ""that place on your corner.""  He told me that people raved about it for years, they finally tried it and the food was nothing special.  And of course, a long wait!  I don't know what the attraction is, maybe something about coming back into the old neighborhood.  Not for me.",1.0

"It is very close to authentic homemade italian food. The way that you are served is very traditional in italian culture where you get the appetizer and then you get soup or salad and then you get your main course with a side and finally a dessert (if you do the special) BUT you have plenty of time in between courses to talk and just sit around (so you dont get all your food at once and you dont get it back to back either). Its a small place but its very nice.I had stuffed mushrooms, which were fantastic, salad, which was good, ziti, which was pretty good and chicken marsala which was filling and yummy. The portions are big (their steaks are bigger than a baby) and its yummy.

"Man, I must have passed Ortobello over a thousand times in my time in Brooklyn and never thought much of it until I got a recommendation from a friend. This place is a no-frills real old school Italian place. It's got a good feel to it, and that's part of what I love about it. It's not modern, and certainly not trying to be. It just is what it is. Lets the negatives out of the way : The menu is unoriginal and fairly straight to the point. You won't find any curveballs. Also, no credit cards accepted as of fairly recently. That kind of detracts from the experience as many of us get points for dining. But again, if I want to go here that won't stop me. Orrechette abbruzesse was very good, sometimes I  find that if the quality of the sausage isnt quite up to snuff the whole dish suffers, but that wasn't the case here. It came together really well. Also the chicken piccata was one of the best I've had, but granted that's a hard dish to mess up. Watch out for one factor though...the portions are excessively large. And there is some cardinal rule about sharing that they have written on the menu if I'm not mistaken. So expect to have some extra lunch for work the next day.

"I've read some great reviews about this place so I was pretty excited to try it out with my family. Unfortunately, it did not turn out as I had hoped. The place was extremely small with 3 people manning the tables. I felt very unwelcomed and awkward here. The wait staff completely ignored our table, serving other tables (people who came in after us) with water and bread before us. I understand you have ""regulars,"" but try not to ignore the new customers because i definitely will not be coming back. I don't want to see waiters showing customers pictures on their phone or family disputes in front of customers . What I wanted to see were waiters who would refill my water instead of ignoring the empty cups on our table and some sort of answer for waiting over an hour for our dishes to be served. I understand that this is an ""authentic"" restaurant and that everything is made to order, but when we asked what was taking so long, do not blame the customers that we ordered complicated dishes. I understand that each pasta dish has its own sauce, but after seeing multiple dishes being served to other tables (who were seated after us) I don't really believe it was because ours was more complicated. And they definitely shouldn't tell customers that we should have came earlier if we wanted food before 9. Not once did our waiter check up on us or update us on what was taking so long with our food. Actually they never really apologized for the wait. They just repeated the same line, ""everything is made to order and to be patient."" I think waiting over an hour is being pretty patient.We waited an hour and 45 minutes before our dinner was served. I don't even know why we waited this long. The waiter claimed that the ""wait would be worth it"" and I have to be honest, I didn't find the wait worth it. The dishes seemed to be rushed. The pasta was undercooked in one of the dishes, the chicken was dry and I found nothing special about any of the sauces that went with the pasta. Although I wasn't wowed with the main dishes, the calamari was pretty good. I've been to plenty of other authentic Italian restaurants and I have never been treated so rudely as this restaurant. The service we received was insulting. We shouldn't have to be ""regulars"" to get good service. I will definitely not be coming back here.",1.0

Ok I used to come here all the time but moved out of state so this is my first time back in a long while. The Caesar salad was fantastic as always. ( 2nd only to new corners) the dinners were hit and miss. The vodka sauce was separating as we ate it and turned into an oily mess. The beef  Braciole  was good but not worth the price ( very small serving in a place that usually goes big) I'll be back and I hope it goes back to normal. It's a real old school place and the owner is a hoot.,3.0
Just say wow to this restaurant. It looks like a diner from the outside but go in and order the food you think you were at Carmine's. The food portions are HUGE but are fantastic. The service by the husband and wife are just great. They make you feel like you are sitting at an Italian family dinner on Sunday's (anyone who has or been to one knows how much food is served).Been there 4 times in the past year and will go back many many times,5.0
I must have walked by this restaurant almost everyday going to take the subway to work. Today i decided to give it a try with my family. Of all days today was the busiest day all tables were full and we had to wait outside. Decor: when going in the restaurant it looked pretty small inside. There was properly 10 tables and the back is where all the magic happens AKA the kitchen. At first glance of the restaurant it look like a old school Italian restaurant. The inside looked old school too i was fine with it. Food: We got the Calamari which was awesome and tasty and got the baked clams and mussels was also very good and lovely. We also got the seafood Linguini which was amazing and flavorful and also had a nice texture to it. We also got the farfalla al salmone was my favorite dishes and it was packed with flavors and well seasoned.Overall the service was on point and i will be coming back here soon. i recommend getting the calamari and the farlalla al salmone. One of the best Italian restaurant i have ever ate at. So what you waiting for?,5.0
We have been looking for a great restaurant for awhile well we found it.  Ortobello is fantastic food was so good I felt like I was eating at home.  Service was great friendly.  I took my mom out for dinner they gave us so much food we could not finish it all.  I highly recommend coming here we will be back,5.0
"I found myself checking this place out recently as it is located right next to my haircut salon. I regret not checking it out earlier as it is completely amazing! I've never been in a real Italian restaurant before whose food is cooked by Italians themselves. It is a family owned business so you can expect some traditional food. During my visit there I recently was in the mood for some pasta and stake as most people on here recommend it. I expected the portions to be small, those of a fast food perhaps. I was totally mistaken; the portions were larger than expected. Surprisingly, I was pretty full as I find myself walking out hungry from most places I visit. The staff is warm hearted and treat you like family. The tables are spotless and the place itself overall is taken care of very nicely. I highly recommend checking this place out for some authentic Italian food as you will be astonished by the fresh quality of their food :)",5.0
"Ortobello is AMAZING!! The clams, the artichokes, the pasta, everything is so good! My boyfriend and I like to come here maybe just 3-4 times a year, but each time has been nothing short of exceptional. My only suggestion would be to maybe serve oil with the bread instead of butter. Other than that though, I would suggest this place to anyone who wants amazing Italian food with a charming and low-key atmosphere :)",5.0
"From the mussels marinara, baked clams,mozzarella logs (yes LOGS because they are HUGE and DELICIOUS), the stuffed artichoke, to the eggplant parmigiana , pasta primavera (my fav) to the tiramisu and cannoli, the food here is EXCELLENT!!!!! You can have a bunch of appetizers and it would be enough because the portions are a very generous size OR try any one of the many dishes that I have tried, and you will be satisfied , guaranteed to leave with a full stomach and a doggie bag of leftovers !! This is food you don't want to let go to waste ! It's a great atmosphere with the old school decor, Italian music playing in the background and you never feel rushed to leave.If you haven't been here yet, I highly recommend it !!! Buon appetito!",5.0
"Yelp reviews do not lie. This place was great, classic Italian joint. Arugula salad is delicious and tremendous, loaded with fresh arugula, crunchy tomatoes, red onion, garlic and picked vegetables and pepperocini. Stuffed artichoke was gluttonous and had a yummy broth which disappeared into the filling making for cheesy amazingness gooey crumbs, easily scooped up by their warm bread. Finally, arrabiata, perfect AL dente linguini, topped with piping hot, perfectly spicy sauce.",5.0
"4 stars for great food. The place is old looking with old wooden chairs and the upper half of wall is mirrored. The waiter may have been part asleep because he took our food to wrap and forgot to give it back to us claiming we didn't ask for 2 half full plates to be wrapped...what an idiot. Salmon farfalle was good with fresh salmon that was cooked perfect. Pasta was a bit over cooked. Order it al dente. Portions are very big and you can share with 3 ppl, at least. Chicken and shrimp portio? was great and shrimp were fresh and big...very tasty. Def check out this spot if you want to eat good with no frills.",4.0
I was definitely surprised here at this joint! I had the chicken parm and it was a huge platter which I actually couldnt finish. This place is completely no frills from the outside but inside its old school italian. The waiter was very nice but seemed to lack body awareness and kept leaning on us and was just overall not very coordinated. I would come here again for the chicken parm but if I was close by and craving.,4.0
Ok I used to come here all the time but moved out of state so this is my first time back in a long while. The Caesar salad was fantastic as always. ( 2nd only to new corners) the dinners were hit and miss. The vodka sauce was separating as we ate it and turned into an oily mess. The beef  Braciole  was good but not worth the price ( very small serving in a place that usually goes big) I'll be back and I hope it goes back to normal. It's a real old school place and the owner is a hoot.,3.0
Just say wow to this restaurant. It looks like a diner from the outside but go in and order the food you think you were at Carmine's. The food portions are HUGE but are fantastic. The service by the husband and wife are just great. They make you feel like you are sitting at an Italian family dinner on Sunday's (anyone who has or been to one knows how much food is served).Been there 4 times in the past year and will go back many many times,5.0
I must have walked by this restaurant almost everyday going to take the subway to work. Today i decided to give it a try with my family. Of all days today was the busiest day all tables were full and we had to wait outside. Decor: when going in the restaurant it looked pretty small inside. There was properly 10 tables and the back is where all the magic happens AKA the kitchen. At first glance of the restaurant it look like a old school Italian restaurant. The inside looked old school too i was fine with it. Food: We got the Calamari which was awesome and tasty and got the baked clams and mussels was also very good and lovely. We also got the seafood Linguini which was amazing and flavorful and also had a nice texture to it. We also got the farfalla al salmone was my favorite dishes and it was packed with flavors and well seasoned.Overall the service was on point and i will be coming back here soon. i recommend getting the calamari and the farlalla al salmone. One of the best Italian restaurant i have ever ate at. So what you waiting for?,5.0
We have been looking for a great restaurant for awhile well we found it.  Ortobello is fantastic food was so good I felt like I was eating at home.  Service was great friendly.  I took my mom out for dinner they gave us so much food we could not finish it all.  I highly recommend coming here we will be back,5.0
"I found myself checking this place out recently as it is located right next to my haircut salon. I regret not checking it out earlier as it is completely amazing! I've never been in a real Italian restaurant before whose food is cooked by Italians themselves. It is a family owned business so you can expect some traditional food.

"Yes, the portions are indeed HUGE, but I'm not quite sure that all of the food is equally delicious. I eyed the adjacent table's giant seafood platter ($45), which 6 people were sharing happily. Perhaps I would've been raving about Ortobello and giving it 5 stars if I had been eating that instead. Unfortunately, I meant to celebrate a joyous occasion with my mother and brother, and the entrées that we ordered fell rather flat. The calamari was excellent - flaky, fresh, and addicting. Very good for the price, though I was puzzled about the sauce that accompanied it. I THINK it's supposed to be their homemade tomato sauce, but I didn't taste anything particularly special about it. :( I definitely would recommend the calamari, though; it was pretty delicious. (As an afterthought, we regretted that we hadn't ordered the clams, which they seem to be famous for). By the time the three of us had finished the calamari, however, we were already pretty full. Yikes!We ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and the farfalle al salmone (both slightly under $20), and I reeally, really wish Ortobello did half portions for half the price. The spaghetti with meatballs was disappointingly plain - nope, I still don't see anything special about the tomato sauce ... - and although the farfalle's sauce was delicious, the salmon was overcooked and really quite mediocre. I was very disappointed with the salmon pieces themselves, and wished that I had ordered shrimp or clams instead. We ended up taking most of the entrées home. The next day, when I reheated the farfalle on the stovetop, the sauce had unyieldingly separated and refused to emulsify. It grossed me out a little to see the copious amounts of butter coating my farfalle. I was also pretty disappointed with the bread and butter that they gave us; at classier Italian restaurants like this one, I would've expected warm bread and room-temperature butter at the very least, if not roasted cloves of garlic. The waiter was very kind, and this might just be a nutrition slant, but I did not appreciate that he wanted us to eat even more food. No, these portions are ridiculously huge! It's not okay to eat this much. :( I would want to come here again, but either with a) more people so I can try the seafood plater or b) only one order.",3.0

I come from an Italian family (my father left Italy for the USA when he was 17. So I've never felt the need to venture out for Italian food. But if I do, Ortobello is the place.

"Ever since we were turned on to this place about ten years ago it has taken over as the go to brooklyn style italian american restaurant.

The staff are all awesome and friendly and treat you like you are at their home. It takes a good amount of time for the food but its well worth it. If veal or chicken parm are your thing, when your order comes out you will say holy shit!!!!! Giant tender cutlets of veal or chicken!!! GIANT im not kidding look at the pic.

"We went there upon my FiL's recommendation on my husband's b'day.This is a nice cute family run place. The owner's son is very friendly and welcoming.My FiL has been going there regularly for quite sometime now because of their food.For appetizer they ordered a parmesan dish with anchovies and liked it. It was quite a lot so we got it packed to go.For entree we had chicken parm, veel and some pork dish. I ordered penne in marinara sauce with broccoli rab for myself.The food is good, the portions are huge and the price is right.We passed on the dessert but having heard that it was my husband's b'day they gave us a complimentary piece of cake to celebrate.

"My mother (who is 100% Italian) is in town and we decided to go out for Italian. Last time we were here, we went to La Palina.  We were going to go last night but they were closed for a private party.  I checked Google maps and found Ortabello and we decided to give it a try.  I'm glad we did.From the outside, it looks very unassuming.  You walk in and the place doesn't look like much.  Hand-written signs on one wall and a rather overwhelming creche on the other.  Smallish- 10 tables.  It looks and feels like a small neighborhood joint- which is precisely what it is.  Most of the people there seemed to be regulars. And the closeness of the tables encourage conversations between tables and people seem quite comfortable asking the table next to them questions about their meal.  And I have to say that the sound level is comfortably quiet.  You can have a conversation without having to shout.We were greeted by a man we later found out is the owner's son.  Very friendly Brooklyn wise-ass.  The waiter, an older old-school Italian gent, brought us menus and my mom ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio-  ""we got red, we got white"" and it was Carlo Rossi or something like that- but huge glasses.  No pretense, just basic Italian table wine.  And the owner is the cook and comes out of the kitchen every now and then to talk with customer/friends.We ordered.  My mom ordered the gnocchi, I ordered the lasagna.  As we sat there chewing on the very delicious bread, the smells of the food going by were amazing.  When you can smell the fresh herbs, you know it's good.  I was ready to chew my own arm off by the time our food arrived.Our food arrived and mother of sweet sweet Jesus, they are HUGE.  I'm a pretty good-sized guy and one look and I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it.We dug in and oh my god.  I thought I died and went to heaven.  The sauce was amazing, the meat in the lasagna tender and tasty with a bit of sweetness to offset the tangy sauce.  Every bite was nirvana.  And my mother's gnocchi-  it's a difficult dish to get just right.  Lots of times they are tasteless lumps of dough.  Not here.  Very tender and the fresh basil on it...This is pretty much the best Italian food we've ever had, hands down, and that includes Rino's in East Boston.  The prices for the portion sizes are ridiculously low- $20 or so for an entree that will feed you for another meal or two.  I can't wait to go back there again and try some of their other dishes.  Yeah, it was that good.",5.0
"I've lived in the area for 20+ years and have never tried this place. I've always said that this restaurant must be good since its been around for so long.

( and not in a bad way )With a party of 4 we had two appetizers from their lunch menu ( The portions are smaller than the dinner menu ). We were full by the time our entries came.  The mozzarella and peppers were very fresh. The fried calamari was tender, and some of the largest calamari I've seen. Could of used a little more salt for my pallet. I had the veal parmigiana. The portion of veal was the size of the plate. The veal was thick cut, moist and cooked to perfection. My daughter had the chicken parmigiana, she commented saying it was some of the best chicken she has eaten. I've  read reviews saying that a woman was their complaint about the Resturant. Met her, she is one of the owners with her husband. She is 70 years old, her husband 75. If you take the time to talk to her she is a very pleasant person, and not for nothing but at her age to be taking orders, and waiting tables is a feat in itself.

"Like a lot of the reviewers here, I've passed this place a thousand times. My wife and I are home now from our first, but not last visit to this family-run gem. My wife had a huge Caesar Salad with obviously home-made dressing and croutons. The dressing was creamy, garlicky and heavenly without being greasy like a lot of places. She then had Penne ala Vodka with a white vodka sauce that also was creamy and garlicky but managed to taste like a vodka sauce should. Her Penne was perfection! Fresh and al dente I had the best baked clams I have ever had. Very fresh clams topped with bread crumbs lavished with a butter and garlic sauce. The bread crumbs were crispy, the clams were just out of the water fresh. I'm ordering them again the next time we go. The veal parmigiana was tender and juicy with an obscene amount of mozzarella and a home-made tomato sauce that was so good it almost brought tears to my eyes. It was so good we got a quart to take home.The staff treated us like family from the moment we walked in until we left, and we never felt rushed like we have in other places. The decor looks like it's never changed from the first day they opened the doors, but that's fine because they keep the place very clean. The kitchen door is open and it looked spotless. The next time you're going up or down Bay Parkway, don't pass this place, go in.  One caveat; bring cash, they don't take credit cards.",5.0
"Just ate here and had a terrible experience. The bake clams were just ok and the salad was ok as well. The salad dressing was good. We waited for a LONG time for our entrees (an hour) and saw everyone in the restaurant served before us. A young couple came in and were served immediately.  The server blamed us for not ordering something simple. We ordered spaghetti, chicken parm and chicken franchese. Not complicated. YOU never blame the customer for your lack of decent service. We came with our 6 year old son and he was starving.  When the manager realized the mistake, she did reprimand the staff and tried to correct the mistake but made no attempt whatsoever to accommodate us for the terrible service. When the food finally came it tasted rubbery and not properly cooked because it tasted rushed. The broccoli was brown and when I asked server to take it back which he did, he did not offer to replace it or give me something else . The manager said ""see it was worth the wait"". It was NOT worth the wait. We will NEVER come back here again. A good manager would have offered free dessert or a discount or complimentary glass of wine. We were offered NOTHING.  Obviously this place knows nothing about service and how to properly treat a customer. It took us an hour to get there any we heard such great things. Such a HUGE disappointment.  Obviously the restaurant was not listed in the Zagat top 100 restaurants for a reason. I feel like I just through $100 in the toilet. I am not surprised that it wasn't busier. This is what we get for trying something new. We are going to stick to our favorites, Carmine's, Tony's diNapoli, Amelia's. It took everything in my power not to create a scene. We just wanted to get OUT. I am disgusted that these type of restaurants are still around. I don't know how they survive with such terrible service and sub par food.",1.0
"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. The dishes are huge! I would recommend sharing. The server was extremely friendly and everyone seemed to know each other.

I've past by this restaurant 1000s of times. Looked like an old place in need of a makeover.

Food was good but I was horridly chased out of this place and asked to never leave again. Aside from the obnoxious 'American express not accepted' signs all over your face.

"Like a lot of the reviewers here, I've passed this place a thousand times. My wife and I are home now from our first, but not last visit to this family-run gem. My wife had a huge Caesar Salad with obviously home-made dressing and croutons. The dressing was creamy, garlicky and heavenly without being greasy like a lot of places. She then had Penne ala Vodka with a white vodka sauce that also was creamy and garlicky but managed to taste like a vodka sauce should. Her Penne was perfection! Fresh and al dente I had the best baked clams I have ever had. Very fresh clams topped with bread crumbs lavished with a butter and garlic sauce. The bread crumbs were crispy, the clams were just out of the water fresh. I'm ordering them again the next time we go. The veal parmigiana was tender and juicy with an obscene amount of mozzarella and a home-made tomato sauce that was so good it almost brought tears to my eyes. It was so good we got a quart to take home.The staff treated us like family from the moment we walked in until we left, and we never felt rushed like we have in other places. The decor looks like it's never changed from the first day they opened the doors, but that's fine because they keep the place very clean. The kitchen door is open and it looked spotless. The next time you're going up or down Bay Parkway, don't pass this place, go in.  One caveat; bring cash, they don't take credit cards.",5.0
"Just ate here and had a terrible experience. The bake clams were just ok and the salad was ok as well. The salad dressing was good. We waited for a LONG time for our entrees (an hour) and saw everyone in the restaurant served before us. A young couple came in and were served immediately.  The server blamed us for not ordering something simple. We ordered spaghetti, chicken parm and chicken franchese. Not complicated. YOU never blame the customer for your lack of decent service. We came with our 6 year old son and he was starving.  When the manager realized the mistake, she did reprimand the staff and tried to correct the mistake but made no attempt whatsoever to accommodate us for the terrible service. When the food finally came it tasted rubbery and not properly cooked because it tasted rushed. The broccoli was brown and when I asked server to take it back which he did, he did not offer to replace it or give me something else . The manager said ""see it was worth the wait"". It was NOT worth the wait. We will NEVER come back here again. A good manager would have offered free dessert or a discount or complimentary glass of wine. We were offered NOTHING.  Obviously this place knows nothing about service and how to properly treat a customer. It took us an hour to get there any we heard such great things. Such a HUGE disappointment.  Obviously the restaurant was not listed in the Zagat top 100 restaurants for a reason. I feel like I just through $100 in the toilet. I am not surprised that it wasn't busier. This is what we get for trying something new. We are going to stick to our favorites, Carmine's, Tony's diNapoli, Amelia's. It took everything in my power not to create a scene. We just wanted to get OUT. I am disgusted that these type of restaurants are still around. I don't know how they survive with such terrible service and sub par food.",1.0

Anyway, a friend of mine, a 5'10-5'11 bag of bones, ordered the chicken parm and subsequently attacked half the loaf.

"This place is the definition of a hole in the wall. I have driven past this establishment many times and actually assumed it was a Chinese restaurant from the 70's. Upon hearing that the food was amazing I had to give it a shot. First and foremost it turns out that this is an Italian Restaurant. The decor is not very appealing, but let's be honest we go out to eat for the food. It is a very small place which seats maybe 20-30 max. The menu is massive and the portions can feed a group of 4-6 people. The artichoke appetizer was absolutely delicious (you must like garlic to enjoy). You get the feeling when you are there that is a neighborhood restaurant with waiters that have been there since the plastic was taken off the seats. If you are looking for fancy this is not your place. If you are looking for a full belly that will not hurt the wallet, check out this neighborhood hole in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.",5.0

"This place is by far my favorite Italian place of all time.  The food is fantastic, the service is always great and you gotta love small Italian places that have been around forever.  In terms of the appetizers I highly recommend the baked clams, calamari or the mussels in marinara sauce.  If you like salad, you can't go wrong with the house salad since it comes with their balsamic based house dressing.  If they actually have bottles for sale buy it, it's worth it - I love their dressing!  Now for the mains, we've always been partial to a couple of the dishes and to be honest my family hasn't varied much in what we order 'cause it's always so good!  We'll usually go with either/or both the penne alla vodka with shrimp and/or the farfalle boscaiola.  For the other entrees you can't go wrong with any of their chicken dishes especially the pollo capricciosa! Always crunchy and the toppings is always super fresh.  Now if you're a seafood person and you've got enough people go for the zuppa de pesce (it's on the bottom right of the menu).  Be warned it is HUGE but definitely one of my family's and my girlfriend's favorites!  If you somehow manage to have room when you're done definitely go for a slice of the lemon ricotta cheesecake.  Espresso (maybe a little sambuca) + cheesecake = a great finish!The place has been family owned and run for years and still my go to place for home-style Italian cooking.  The people there are always warm and friendly and basically treat you like an old friend.  Make sure you come with your appetite, their portions are huge! Considering I grew up across the street from the place and we've known the family for over 15 years, going there for dinner always feels like coming home.",5.0
"Saw the 2 great reviews so I had to stop by, plus being so close to where I live now I figure ""why not?""We were greeted by ""Old School"" Italian service...no frills, no bullshit kinda sensibility, so it was slightly rough around the edges.  I'm over it, and ordered the Calamari, Stuffed mushrooms apps leading into a Rigatoni with Ricotta & tomato sauce entree.  Portions are HUGE!  I'd limit the apps to 1 per table of 4.  The calamari tasted fresh and were cut into big pieces.  The stuffed mushrooms, although big were pretty bland in flavor.  My rigatoni came out and the pasta was cooked perfectly, but again the flavors weren't there.  Its as if they had misplaced the salt & pepper...I would think simple seasoning like that wouldn't be missed, but it was.  Major faux pas.If it weren't for their large portions, I'd probably give them 2 stars.  Bring your own salt/pepper and things should be fine.",3.0
"True Italian homemade food... Ahhhhhhhhh Expensive but worth every penny!!! However, I went there on Sat 4/21 and decided to order steak (what a mistake) for a change and funny enough, they got my order wrong and it took too much to make.

DO NOT GO HERE FOR STEAK unless you are starving and just want a huge piece of ""rib eye"" to kill your hunger.  On the flip side of things, a 20 year customer told me order any pasta but not the steak, as per his words...

The calamari melt in your mouth and so does everything else. Its a must try for anybody. Just remember to order conservatively because the portions are HUGE.",5.0
I'm in love with this place! The people who work there are all very friendly and the food is always amazing! It may take a while to get your food but after your first bite i guarantee it will all be worth the wait! I go into a food coma everytime! the hot antipasto is to die for as well as the chicken piccata. I love that it is a family style restauraunt so the portions are huge and great for sharing. My boyfriend and I have ate in 3 times and ordered take out twice and both times we got a complimentary bottle of wine! This will forever be my favorite restaurant! Always full happy and satisfied after dining here.,5.0
"This place is the definition of a hole in the wall. I have driven past this establishment many times and actually assumed it was a Chinese restaurant from the 70's. Upon hearing that the food was amazing I had to give it a shot. First and foremost it turns out that this is an Italian Restaurant. The decor is not very appealing, but let's be honest we go out to eat for the food. It is a very small place which seats maybe 20-30 max. The menu is massive and the portions can feed a group of 4-6 people. The artichoke appetizer was absolutely delicious (you must like garlic to enjoy). You get the feeling when you are there that is a neighborhood restaurant with waiters that have been there since the plastic was taken off the seats. If you are looking for fancy this is not your place. If you are looking for a full belly that will not hurt the wallet, check out this neighborhood hole in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.",5.0
"Decent food, the place has not been remodeled since 1970. Prices way to high. $18.00 pasta dishes. I guess I will stick with Bay Ridge places.",3.0
"This place is by far my favorite Italian place of all time.  The food is fantastic, the service is always great and you gotta love small Italian places that have been around forever.  In terms of the appetizers I highly recommend the baked clams, calamari or the mussels in marinara sauce.  If you like salad, you can't go wrong with the house salad since it comes with their balsamic based house dressing.  If they actually have bottles for sale buy it, it's worth it - I love their dressing!  Now for the mains, we've always been partial to a couple of the dishes and to be honest my family hasn't varied much in what we order 'cause it's always so good!  We'll usually go with either/or both the penne alla vodka with shrimp and/or the farfalle boscaiola.  For the other entrees you can't go wrong with any of their chicken dishes especially the pollo capricciosa! Always crunchy and the toppings is always super fresh.  Now if you're a seafood person and you've got enough people go for the zuppa de pesce (it's on the bottom right of the menu).  Be warned it is HUGE but definitely one of my family's and my girlfriend's favorites!  If you somehow manage to have room when you're done definitely go for a slice of the lemon ricotta cheesecake.  Espresso (maybe a little sambuca) + cheesecake = a great finish!The place has been family owned and run for years and still my go to place for home-style Italian cooking.  The people there are always warm and friendly and basically treat you like an old friend.  Make sure you come with your appetite, their portions are huge! Considering I grew up across the street from the place and we've known the family for over 15 years, going there for dinner always feels like coming home.",5.0
"Saw the 2 great reviews so I had to stop by, plus being so close to where I live now I figure ""why not?""We were greeted by ""Old School"" Italian service...no frills, no bullshit kinda sensibility, so it was slightly rough around the edges.  I'm over it, and ordered the Calamari, Stuffed mushrooms apps leading into a Rigatoni with Ricotta & tomato sauce entree.  Portions are HUGE!  I'd limit the apps to 1 per table of 4.  The calamari tasted fresh and were cut into big pieces.  The stuffed mushrooms, although big were pretty bland in flavor.  My rigatoni came out and the pasta was cooked perfectly, but again the flavors weren't there.  Its as if they had misplaced the salt & pepper...I would think simple seasoning like that wouldn't be missed, but it was.  Major faux pas.If it weren't for their large portions, I'd probably give them 2 stars.  Bring your own salt/pepper and things should be fine.",3.0
"True Italian homemade food... Ahhhhhhhhh Expensive but worth every penny!!! However, I went there on Sat 4/21 and decided to order steak (what a mistake) for a change and funny enough, they got my order wrong and it took too much to make. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that the piece was huge, but NO TASTE... even the waiter told me to use ""SAZON"" (which would turn my steak orange)... lol  Is this guy for real? lol  I told him I eat steaks often and know my flavors very well. DO NOT GO HERE FOR STEAK unless you are starving and just want a huge piece of ""rib eye"" to kill your hunger.  On the flip side of things, a 20 year customer told me order any pasta but not the steak, as per his words... ""not their cup of tea"".",4.0
"Just got back from this place and the secret is out. Why are all the ""Hole in the wall type places always the best? Just disregard the decode of this place, and focus on the food. Just spectacular, the bow tie pasta with salmon, awesome, and they sell their sauce to go!!",4.0
"As far as Italian food goes in Brooklyn... Ortobello's is TOPS.And while I'm a Brooklyn native, the husband is not... but he insists we ALWAYS make a stop here whenever we're back in town.Warning: Be sure to BRING-YOUR-APPETITE! This place is as authentic as they come, therefore the portions are HUGE.",5.0
"Came back here with friends recently. After trying some of their other dishes, I'd say they're a solid four stars. I really enjoyed their house wine, which was not too dry. I loved their tiramisu (but not their cheesecake, though my husband liked the cheesecake more than the tiramisu so I guess it's a matter of taste). The tiramisu was really authentic, moist, spongy, delicious. I don't know how they make their coffee but I like mine light and milky (but not thin and watery) and it was delicious. Dinner dishes still good. Come here on a super empty stomach, though, or be prepared to take a lot of food home. The size of their portions is ridiculous. Also, the waiter we had last time, not sure if he's part of the family running it or what, was really really great. Tall, broad guy. We ordered two desserts to share and, on top of being friendly and helpful all night, I felt like he gave us just enough to split between four people. Will be coming back.",4.0
"Ortobellos is the best Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. PERIOD.  Before you go - you have to know that his place is old style family Italian eating. That means - expect to have a 3 hour dinner and leave very full. It is a small family owned eatery and I have been going there for the last 12 years. The owner, Gino, does all the cooking himself with a big Italian heart - you can TASTE the love he puts in to every thing he makes. I have had several large family parties there and when I have guests from out of town - If I don't bring them to Ortobellos they are insulted.  All the food is family style - which means two or three people can share most of the dishes. Awesome Caesar Salad, the BEST baked clams in Brooklyn home made and drenched in garlic. His Alfredo sauce is very rich with egg yolks and light enough to not be cloying. The chicken Picatta is outstanding - rich sauce with lot's of capers. Home made Italian bread too. You can get all the basic classic dishes - lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, if that's what you crave - but try  some of the other specialties - you won't regret it ( until you step on the scale ). The waitstaff is the wife and son of the owner - lovely people. They treat their customers like family,  I always feel like I'm coming home to dinner. If they like you - they may bring you a special bottle of wine from the old country. Great for dates, great for families - don't miss this place and make a reservation - they are ALWAYS crowded.",5.0
"I can empathize with Rob D. about not wanting to put the word out, but hey it deserves it. It's small, but then again so are homes in Brooklyn, so it has a 'family' atmosphere; the owners are there to greet you, and even take your order. Food will take a while, it's made to order, and you will taste the freshness, and the generosity of the portions. The baked clams are awesome, the eggplant rollatini appetizer is bigger than most entrees I see around. The linguini with clam sauce has an aroma that entrances. I have to talk myself out of getting it every time. I've heard the chicken masala is amazing. Strangers sitting next to me order what they see on my plate; I can see they want to try a bite, and hell if they asked, I'd give them a forkful. The wine choices are 'red' and 'white'; keeping it cold and simple. The tiramisu is the best I have had, you can taste the marscapone; no cheating done here! They take reservations for small and larger parties, but don't be late, or your table will disappear. Amazing Italian dinners/feasts without the annoying relatives sitting next to me; it's a win-win every time.",5.0
"gave it one star because i don't think i can select zero stars.came here two weeks ago with a party of four and saw that the restaurant is small.  they probably have around 10 tables so service should be quick.  hardly.  i made a joke to my friends that it's not one person cooking back there, it's more like half a person.  the main (or only) waiter andy is friendly and charming, that is, if you can get his attention.  we ordered very basic dishes, like a salad, two small appetizers, simple pasta and a chicken dish.  it took around 40 minutes to get the appetizers, and they totally forgot the salad.  for a simple dish that contains lettuce, tomatoes and onions, you would think they could throw that in a bowl and bring it out immediately.  dressing was delicious though, you'll want to dip your bread in that sugary goodness. they give you the dressing in a jar, so you won't have to ask for more.the chicken was dry on the inside, and the corners of it were hard/overcooked.  the pasta wasn't as creamy as i hoped, but it was sufficient, though lacked taste.  all in all, a dinner that should have taken an hour took over two hours.  it would have been worth the wait if it tasted better, but we couldn't wait to get the check and leave.  way overpriced, i might add.if you want a great inexpensive meal that's also quick, go to any of the chinese restaurants in the area.  they're consistent and you won't have any complaints.",1.0
