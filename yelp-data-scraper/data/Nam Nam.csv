"Some of the best banh mi I've had in the city. Consistently great food, customizable level of spicyness, never too busy, and very inexpensive. Not a huge bubble tea fan in general, but their bubble tea is so good I actually get it every time I come here!Recommendations include the banh mi chicken sandwich and chai bubble tea.Go check it out.",5.0
"Hidden among residential stoops & scattered mom and pop's grocery stores is an unmarked storefront called Nam Nam.  While reaching epic ""hangry"" levels, I googled the closest banh mi place to my location.  This tiny place- I'm talking room for 8 max to sit comfortably within the shop, is the least fussy place you will find in all of Williamsburg.  A simple, somewhat wrinkled menu with several options for noodles($7.50-$8), sandwiches($6.25-$6.5), and one side, the summer rolls($5) can be found right by the register.  The drink menu was handwritten with permanent markers on the side of a fridge.  It doesn't get more basic than that, folks.To ease my hunger pains, I ordered the popular grilled pork sandwich to go.  After unraveling the wrapped halves, I saw a haphazardly put together sandwich.  I was in dismay by the sheer amount of carrots(see photo).  Humans eat with their eyes, and my eyeballs were turning red by straining to find meat.  After spreading the bread open, I found minimal sliced pork had been stuffed into the inner side of my bread.  Less than 30% of my sandwich was non-vegetarian.  Though I liked the marinated flavor of the pork, because of the poor construction of the sandwich, the bites without the carrot bordered on too salty.  Other classic components like pickled daikon, cucumber and fresh cilantro were out of commission.  I think I got one cilantro leaf.  Generous.For $6.5, Nam Nam is on the higher end of banh mi pricing, and definitely lacking in the ratio of meat to pickled veggies to bread department.  Sandwiches are hard to make right; a certain art form was lost in the way they stacked the ingredients.  I wanted to 'nom nom' my way through, but my mouth was full of bunny food.  ""Eh, what's up, Doc?""",2.0
"Inside of the place looks like somebody's garage. Too dirty for preparing food. For some reason they only take cash. They refuse to put a sign that says cash only. So, customers have no idea they can't use credit cards like everywhere else until after the food is cooking. Then they have the nerve to act surprised, claim this is the first time it ever happened, and complain to the customer that food is supposedly wasted because of their negligence. Management was unnecessarily rude. Not worth walking to another store, paying ATM fees just to make them happy.",1.0
"Being from Houston and thus spoiled by some of the best Vietnamese in the country, I've been on the search for a good banh mi in New York to satisfy my cravings in between trips home. I can't claim that Nam Nam is as good as home, but it might be the closest it gets here. (Albeit pricy at $6 compared to the $3.50 norm in Houston but I guess that's standard for New York) I've had both the cold cuts and the pork banh mis here before. While upon first look the sandwiches seem to be stuffed with vegetables, there's still a sizeable amount of meat as well. The pork is well marinated and while not exactly as authentic as I'm accustomed to, it's quite delicious in its own right. As many have mentioned, the sandwiches are missing the pickled daikon radish, but the pickled shredded carrot, cucumber, and cilantro are perfect and taste exactly like I remember from back home. The sandwich also comes with a fairly liberal smear of a Vietnamese mayonnaise sauce. Overall, the banh mis here taste the closest to home I can find.The only problem is the bread. The bread is softer and lacks the crunchy crust and slightly gluten-y ""chewiness"" that should be in a proper baguette for a banh mi. Even in spite of this, however, Nam Nam is so far the most authentic banh mi I can find in New York.",4.0
"Delicious bahn mi in east Williamsburg. A bit out of the way if you're traveling from Manhattan or the Bedford stop but don't let that discourage you! I got the original and the pork flavors - both were delish with the pork being my favorite. If you're a big fan of pulled pork sandwiches or anything similar I would highly recommend checking this place out. I just wish the bread was as fresh and crispy as the other reviewers mentioned. Mine was crispy in a toasted way, not a freshly baked way. Pretty sure they buy their bread in bulk from a generic manufacturer. Lastly I would highly recommend adding spice to your sandwich. If you can handle a couple squirts of sriracha sauce (which is basically what they do to make it spicy) you're golden.",4.0
"A really solid vegetarian bánh mì. Crispy and light. Fresh vegetables on top. Piping hot. Quick service.I was sticking around for a bit so I got the vegetarian noodle dish, as well. I wish there was a bit more clarification on the menu that it's just essentially vermicelli. I was hoping for a thicker noodle. Should have asked. Nevertheless, it was solid.You could pass this place without ever knowing it was there. Maybe they like it like that? I did. I hung out for awhile and got some work done - far away from the germ infested hell holes of the **COUGH** area coffee **COUGH** shops.",5.0
"I love banh mi and I would recommend my fellow banh mi lovers here! I went with the spicy grilled pork sandwich and needless to say, they will see me again and again in the future. This is probably the first spot that I have been to in NY that puts hoison sauce in their banh mis. Delish!This spot is definitely a hole in the wall. Cause there is no big sign with ""Nam Nam"" on it or anything. You will need to use Google Maps to get there. Also, this joint has no restroom for customers and it is CASH ONLY!",4.0
"After a couple of cat-sitting hours, I just had to eat something. I wanted bubble tea and the prices were just right here! I ordered a grilled pork sandwich and a milk black tea boba online through Yelp and quickly made my way to the restaurant in the somewhat pouring rain. When I arrived, my food was ready a few moments after. Since walking through the rain as my stomach demanded nourishment did NOT sound appealing, I opted to just stay inside to eat. As I eagerly bit into my sandwich, I fell in love. It may or may not be the fact that I was hella hungry, but this was definitely the best banh mi I ever had. It had crunchy baguette, yummy well-cooked pork and the typical ingredients of banh mi like cilantro, cut up carrots, pickled daikon, and cucumber.I wanted my sandwich spicy...but I didn't actually find it spicy. I just ended up squirting a ton of sriracha sauce on it. Ughhhh, I still didn't find it spicy!!! Curse my strong spicy tolerance! On a scale of 1-10, it was a 0.75 spicy to me. Maybe I'll ask to make it super spicy next time and see what they'll come up with.The bubble tea was good! The milk tea wasn't overly sweetened nor did it have an over abundance of milk. It had the right ratio and the tapioca balls were cooked just fine. They were a bit softer than I would have liked, but I still ended up devouring it anyway. If you want a reasonably priced sandwich and something to satisfy your hunger, you definitely have to give this place a shot!~",5.0
Quite a nice little cafe tucked in the local residential neighborhood. I agree with many of the reviews here that if it wasn't for yelp reviews and that little red yelp sticker by their door I wouldn't be brave enough to give this place a chance from the look from outside.The cafe itself is quite small with only 2-3 tiny tables and small benches. Everything is minimalist to help keep the cost down I would think. If you were lucky enough to pay this place a visit though i would definitely recommend the Cold Cut Bahn Mi. They are quite generous with the meats and carrots and the ingredients are quite fresh. Even though they are missing some daikon radishes on the sandwiches they do have a bit creamer sauce on the veggies than the traditional bahn mi I been having in Chinatown and Queens this is a quite a nice little twist on it.The price being the main selling point here as each sandwich is only about $5-6. Even being a cash only place I definitely think you do get quite a bit of bang for your bucks. During the visit we had some Vietnamese coffee to go with it and I thought they really did go overboard with the ice since it was filled to the very top. If you were like me hopefully asking nicely would result in more coffee to ice ratio :)Overall its a great little cafe for a quick grab and go sandwich spot. I do really appreciate they have AC running indoors though so we got a nice little quick lunch break while we were in the area.,4.0
"I'm starting a new genre of music right here on Yelp. It's called V-Rap. The V stands for Vietnamese, not V*gina, unfortunately.Here's my first offering:Uh, uh. Uh, uh.You gotta go to Nam NamI don't give a Dam DamIf you call this Spam SpamGet here while you Can CanMy gf she's so Glam GlamGot a dark fake Tan TanMakes money on the Cam CamNada goes to Uncle Sam SamIt all goes to Nam NamGeorge Michael had the Wham WhamFlintstone had the Bam BamFrisco has the Tram TramThe Rock has Summer Slam SlamJosh Duggar keeps it in the Fam FamMexicans have the Flan FlanStudents have to Cram CramBut before the Exam XamYou gotta eat at Nam NamWHAT?!What to get: Bahn Mi with PorkWhat else: Avoid Josh Dugar's Hand HandNam Nam may as well rename itself Nom Nom because it is delicious enough to own that moniker.This is, hands-down, unequivocally, undeniably, indisputably, the greatest Bahn Mi sandwich I have ever put in my mouth. In fact, it's so good, I'll go one step further and say it's one of the very best sandwiches I've ever eaten, and one of New York's best ""things to eat."" In fact, if you're only going to Nom Nom 3 things in Brooklyn, then Nam Nam needs to be One One of your Nom Noms.But enough of all this double-talk.Why is it so freaking good, you ask?Well first of all, it's the bread. This is some of the best, sexiest, crustiest, yummiest French bread you'll find anywhere. It's the kind of bread which, if you find in a store, you will immediately bag-it. I mean, baguette. You know what I mean. It's some of the best-tasting bread you'll ever eat.And then there's all the veggies on the sandwich. The cilantro (coriander if you prefer) and carrots and bits and pieces of this and that. They're so divine, they cannot be described.And the meat... unlike many cold-cut Bahn Mi's, they add chunks of delicious marinated pork, warm and juicy, delicious and heavily spiced, and it just takes the entire sandwich through the roof, from deliciousness into the realms of unbelievability.I've been writing so much today, my hands feel Numb Numb.You have to understand, I'm not crazy about Bahn Mi, and I am absolutely crazy about this sandwich. It's not just the best Vietnamese food I've ever eaten, it's one of the best things - period - I've eaten, anywhere. James Bahn 007 and Simon Le-Bahn of Duran Duran both feel the same way as Mi.My fave Goo Goo Dolls song is Name Name.And everything is handmade. You won't find any German ""Auto-Bahn"" here. On the contrary, it's ready in 5 minutes and will make you ""C*m C*um"" in your pants within 10 seconds of biting into it. Oh, and did I mention it's dirt cheap? It's closer to $5 than $10. I know. Ridiculous. Insane. Criminal. I can't explain it.And in my garden, I have a Gnome Gnome.So, if you're in Brooklyn, you *must* come to Nam Nam. And if you're looking for the best Vietnamese food in North America, you *must* eat here. I've had the very best Bahn Mis in San Francisco and elsewhere, and while they were enjoyable... they had nothing on Nam Nam.And on that note, I think we need some more V-Rap.I like girls but prefer Man ManDanielle?

"I am not sure I'd call this authentic Thai but for sure it is tasty Thai. This tiny shop on an industrial stretch that seems out in nowhere serves up big portions of cheap food. I had the tofu banh mi, which came stuffed with fried tofu and pickled carrots, cucumber and a tasty spicy mayo. The baguette was toasted to perfection, crispy and light and almost seeming hollowed out inside to accommodate all the stuffing. I say the banh mi wasn't authentic because it lacked almost any  jalapeno and the daikon and had a few sprigs of cilantro. It was absolutely scrumptious anyway and one of the best vegetarian banh mis I have ever had. And for the bargain price of $5.75. Sis had the grilled chicken bun(Nam Nam staff calls it chicken noodle!), chock full of grilled, seasoned, tender chicken on a large bed of vermicelli. In lieu of cilantro and Thai basil, she had shredded lettuce and plenty of delicious pickled carrots. There were no peanuts and sis told me she didn't taste any fish sauce. She had no cilantro in her bun for some reason. But she gobbled the large portion up anyway, quite happily. When picky sis just devours without complaint, it's a sign that a place merits 4 or 5 stars. When picky sis forgets to offer me any vermicelli, I know Nam Nam's bun is sitting well in her stomach, despite her comments about a few missing ingredients.  I think because Nam Nam is not close to Chinatown, and limited to the markets in East Williamsburg, that the proprietors have decided to sub ingredients with what could be readily purchased in the grocery stores nearby in a pinch.This isn't a place for sitting or lingering.

"Little hole in the wall but as we are on our search for authentic Vietnamese comparable to Story Road, we decided it was worth the 1/2 hr trek. And boy was it. Kind of hidden without a prominent sign, the only giveaway was that an Asian dude stepped out to hand a customer his brown bag of goodness. Step up 4 steps, place your noodle or sandwich order, pay, and your munching in 10 minutes tops. Across from PS 250 and a few doors down Brooklyn Ball Factory I have  found a good place. The only recommendation is I would pay more for higher-quality well-grilled pork. Both the noodles and bahn mi had pork that was dryer than my preference. The lychee iced green tea was Delish. Other than meat quality we thoroughly enjoyed the noodles and that bread was the best I've ever had. Usually I leave the hard-to-chew bread for the birds but mmmmmmm it was effin good.",4.0
"This was a damn good banh mi, actually. I was worried about finding a good one nearby, because being from Houston I'm spoiled for banh mi, but I'd take any of my banh mi snob friends here for the grilled pork.  The bread is good, a teensy bit on the heavy side but has a lovely crumb.    The pork is nice, meaty chunks with a good flavor. There's some small amount of creamy sauce on it, not too much so it adds a moist aspect similar to pate.  I think I might ask for some pate next time.  and the veg is nice and vinegary, balancing out the sandwich. And for NYC prices, it's dirt cheap (as one would expect), although I think you'd get laughed out of the south side if you tried to charge $5 for a regular banh mi in Houston. ;)I didn't much care for the coconut bubble tea, kind of tasted like a coconut candle smells.  But it was warm outside so I drank it. This is definitely going to be a to go place for me, I think, the inside is really small and dingy and doesn't seem like the type of place I'd really be able to relax on my lunch hour. It's a nice short walk from my place, though, so I'm happy with that arrangement.",4.0
Great banh mi and bun. One of the best place in town for banh mi! I tried the grill pork bun and it's also pretty legit. Overall it's a 5/5 place. It's cheap and good.,5.0
Definitely one of my go-to bahn-mi places! I always get the spicy cold cut but it's usually a hit or miss with the amount of meat/pate. It's usually overstuffed with veggies. A few times there were no pickled daikon which saddens me.  I usually order from here because it's close to my home and very convenient.,4.0
"Hole-in-the-wall kind of place. The selection is small but very yummy! I had the chicken sandwich and the pork sandwich. The sandwiches come with shredded carrots, cucumber, and some kind of herb, in a toasted white baguette type bread. They have bubble teas, i tried the lychee- delicious, almond - amazingly fragrant, and a green apple green tea with tapioca pearls- greatest drink ever. The place is small and rather cramped.2 stars for the space, 4 for the food, 5 for excellent customer service.Btw- cash only",4.0

"So good! After our trip to Vietnam my bf and I only wanted a great banh mi and spring rolls. Bread is not a perfect match but super good. Everything in Williamsburg disappointed but nam nam.

"Was recommended to go get Bahn mi sandwiches here. They have a simple menu. The sandwiches are amazing. I don't even like sandwiches.

"Little hole in the wall but as we are on our search for authentic Vietnamese comparable to Story Road, we decided it was worth the 1/2 hr trek. And boy was it. Kind of hidden without a prominent sign, the only giveaway was that an Asian dude stepped out to hand a customer his brown bag of goodness. Step up 4 steps, place your noodle or sandwich order, pay, and your munching in 10 minutes tops. Across from PS 250 and a few doors down Brooklyn Ball Factory I have  found a good place. The only recommendation is I would pay more for higher-quality well-grilled pork. Both the noodles and bahn mi had pork that was dryer than my preference. The lychee iced green tea was Delish. Other than meat quality we thoroughly enjoyed the noodles and that bread was the best I've ever had. Usually I leave the hard-to-chew bread for the birds but mmmmmmm it was effin good.",4.0

Damn I really wanted to like this place. Seemed focused out of the way. Nice little joint. I ordered veggie noodles with fish sauce. Decided on takeout.

"Another blink-or-you'll-miss-it hole-in-the-wall-esque joint that the lovely borough of Brooklyn has become so famous for.  An unassuming building is the actual shop, with the only indication of it as a banh mi joint being an upright fold-able chalk board with menu items written on it.Insert cliche ""don't judge a book by its cover"" variation here, but seriously, a place looking like this does not scream ""we make awesome banh mi!""  The baguette is toasty and almost pressed (which I like so I don't need to dislocate my jaw to take a bite), the pickled veggies give that sour zing which just sets off the banh mi brilliantly as it cuts against any grease the meat gives off, and the cold cuts and the pate are as tasty as it gets.  They certainly don't skimp on the cold cuts, and the pate gives that unique smooth and savory texture and taste (respectively) that any self respecting banh mi ought to have.  The end product delivers in spades.The bubble tea is also a favorite item, with many of my friends who I've been here with raving about it.  Might be high time that I get one for myself.  Easily one of the best banh mi joints in NYC, maybe even THE best.  But one thing's for certain, for anyone that loves banh mi (or food for that matter), the trip to East Williamsburg for this place is worth it.",5.0

"After crying that there are no good Vietnamese places in around my new digs in Brooklyn, I am saved! Stopped by here during lunch on MLK, and I was not disappointed.

This place is so spot on everytime. It's cheap. It's not presumptuous. It's fast good food. I'm not a Vietnamese food expert but all I can say is that everytime I get my takeout from there I have a filling sandwhich for under 6 dollars. That is a great thing. I always get the spicy chicken sandwhich and a soda but their bubbles teas range in flavor and are delicious as well.,5.0
"Just moved in about a block or so away and have already found one of my favorite places. Been here a week and I've already had the $5.75 Bahn Mi from Nam Nam twice. The classic and the chicken. Honestly would stick with the chicken but I'm not usually a pork fan anyways. My friend got the noodles which were just as good. Place is a hole in the wall with about 6 small tables so don't expect much. But the food and order process is made quick and easy. I can easily just step in, order, and walk away within 10 minutes - and that's with other people there. Very easy recommendation to make.",5.0
"Stumbled onto this little hole in the wall in Williamsburg and instantly became a fan. For around six bucks, you have your choice of either banh mi sandwiches or rice vermicelli noodles - both are good, but the banh mi definitely stands out as being one of the best I've had. The rice vermicelli noodles come in a to-go container no matter what, which is convenient if you cannot finish your meal.The place itself is very small, so seating is limited. Street parking is a given in Williamsburg. Great for a place to grab a quick meal to go though!",5.0
"Was craving some Vietnamese and looking for something close to my friend and I, and we came across this cute little place. I got the vegetarian bún and some taro boba tea, and it was all super fresh and tasted perfect. The menu is very simple, no BS, just has what it needs. I liked how quiet and low-key it was as well.",5.0
"Small hole in the wall type of place that has amazing food awesome teas, and very affordable. The only downside is the limited seating.

"Unassuming. Unpretentious. It is small, hole-in the wall kind of place, no sign outside other than sidewalk easel. Casual with couple tables and mismatched chairs, newspaper to flip thru while waiting for your order and simple menu hand-written on the back of the fridge.Easy to find street parking around the block.It just this simple. They make darn good Bahn Mi. Period.Crispy bread, perfect amount of meat and veggies and just right touch of spice. Juicy, yummy, deliiiiiiiicious!!!Love it.",4.0
Damn I really wanted to like this place. Seemed focused out of the way. Nice little joint. I ordered veggie noodles with fish sauce. Decided on takeout. Got back to my crib only to find a bowl of lukewarm noodles with a few carrot shavings and obviously microwaved yet somehow still cold tofu bread nuggets. Couldn't even finish half. Felt like I got had for a quick 7.50. :(,1.0
"Another blink-or-you'll-miss-it hole-in-the-wall-esque joint that the lovely borough of Brooklyn has become so famous for.  An unassuming building is the actual shop, with the only indication of it as a banh mi joint being an upright fold-able chalk board with menu items written on it.Insert cliche ""don't judge a book by its cover"" variation here, but seriously, a place looking like this does not scream ""we make awesome banh mi!""  The baguette is toasty and almost pressed (which I like so I don't need to dislocate my jaw to take a bite), the pickled veggies give that sour zing which just sets off the banh mi brilliantly as it cuts against any grease the meat gives off, and the cold cuts and the pate are as tasty as it gets.  They certainly don't skimp on the cold cuts, and the pate gives that unique smooth and savory texture and taste (respectively) that any self respecting banh mi ought to have.  The end product delivers in spades.The bubble tea is also a favorite item, with many of my friends who I've been here with raving about it.  Might be high time that I get one for myself.  Easily one of the best banh mi joints in NYC, maybe even THE best.  But one thing's for certain, for anyone that loves banh mi (or food for that matter), the trip to East Williamsburg for this place is worth it.",5.0
"I kid you not when I say, this is the best sandwich I ever had in my life (spicy pork bahn mi). I do not know what they do in this dingy little side-walk shop of a take out joint, but my oh my these sandwiches are so jam packed with flavor I imagine it tastes like an uppercut feels like. Pow! I've been to the go-to joints in manhattan and all that, but really those look and taste like a Subway sandwich compared to these bad boys. Only 2 blocks from the Montrose L train stop, you guys are really making it hard for me not to pick one up every day after work.",5.0

I love Nam Nam for quick yummy food that I don't have to feel guilty about. Delivery is available and pretty fast. You can get bahn mi or bun for five or six bucks and both are worth the price. The bahn mi bread is delicious every time. I also usually get the summer rolls which are also good. I get the bun spicy and always pour all the vinegar on it...

"Probably one of the more expensive banh mi's I've ever had. I partially blame this on Brooklyn being Brooklyn, but rarely paying more than $3.75 for a banh mi in the Buford Highway area of Atlanta my entire life, $6-7 for a banh mi feels a little steep. In regards to the banh mi itself, I had a spicy pork and my overall review would be ""it's pretty okay."" Not the best I've had, but not bad. They're pretty heavy on the carrots and are pretty skimpy on the cilantro and cucumbers, with no peppers or pickled daikon to be seen at all.Again, overall, it's a bit pricey for banh mi standards and while it's not a place that comes to mind when I think ""excellent banh mis,"" at the end of the day, Nam Nam still makes a decent sandwich.",3.0

"Sadly, I (somehow) survived a year in NY without ever trying banh mi. This, friends, was my first experience and it was EUPHORIC. Was walking around the area one night with friends looking for cheap, delicious eats and stumbled upon this complete hole-in-the-wall joint. No flashy signs, logos, banners--nothing. ""Nam Nam"" is written in faded chalk market on one of the walls inside but that's about it. It's very small inside. Maybe 3-4 tiny tables for dining. A rack of old magazines. A simple cashier area. A paper menu is available by the cashier for diners to browse through and one is taped on the window outside too. Simple overall. But when the food is this good, nothing else really matters. To date, I've had the chicken and pork bahn mi several times, always made spicy (much recommended). The meat has always been tender, delicious, well-seasoned, and the baguette, always warm and soft on the inside with the most PERFECT crunch on the outside. I usually pick out my cilantro (never been a fan!), but the mound of shredded and lightly pickled carrots and cucumber slices inside balance out the meatiness nicely. One sandwich will fill you up for a good while. Chicken is $5.75 and Pork is $6.50 (?). SO worth it. Bottles of Sriracha around if you want more spice. Bubble tea is all right. I've had better at specialty tea shops. The taro is a little too sweet, and the bubbles a bit too soft. But if you want something sweet to wash everything down with, one'll do. Service is quick. I've always come to pick it up, ready in about 5 minutes, a little under 10 if they're busy. Same lady managing the cashier. She's not super chirpy but she's courteous and does her job efficiently.

For $5.50, you get a crispy baguette sandwich packed with delicious juicy grilled pork, carrots, cilantro, and cucumbers. The proportion of meat to veggies is perfect and it's not a bad portion either.

Its cheap, tastes good and in an area pretty sparse with good restaurantsSmall place, no real utensils/everything can be taken out or thrown awayHad the Bun, it was fresh and good, pork was fatty in the good places. I would of prefered a little more textures, maybe throw in some crushed peanuts but thats just my preference for Bun. Also the meat wasnt aplenty but it was like... 6 dollarsBubble tea... was disappointingVietnamese coffee was decentOverall it was good food for a good price in a barren area.

"Delicious, Quick, 5$ Bahn Mi ...not a nice girl at the front...but I come for the food not your smile anyway ;). Was doing something in the area and wanted something quick and tasty and this fit the bill. Was not let down by the pork Bahn Mi.

"I give Nam Nam 3 stars. The bread is deliciously crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sandwich itself is served nice and toasty. I ordered the cold cuts banh mi spicy and non spicy and the grilled pork spicy and non spicy. For under 6 bucks a sandwich, it is a great deal. I would have given them 4 stars if the sandwiches had included pickled daikon and fresh jalapeños as a condiment...both of which are traditionally offered on banh mi sandwiches. For spicy sandwiches, sirarachi (sp?) hot sauce is added.  For the location, convenience and quick service...this place is worthy of a second visit. Don't forget to order the bubble tea. Had the Taro and the almond, both were great.",3.0

"I've lived in East Williamsburg for almost a year and I'm kicking myself for not trying Nam Nam earlier! I came by here on a Tuesday afternoon with a friend to pick up a couple of their banh mi sandwiches and a small vietnamese iced coffee, which was perfect for the 90 degree weather we were having. I ordered the spicy roasted pork banh mi (I added pate for $1 because I love that stuff) and my friend got the chicken banh mi. Seating is practically non-existent (2 tiny tables inside) so I recommend ordering to go. That's what we did, and the sandwiches were still warm and delicious half an hour later. It's a little different from banh mis I've had in the past in that there was only shredded pickled carrot and one small sliver of pickled cucumber, no radish. I think radish would've tasted great in the sandwich, and was slightly disappointed there was none, but it was still delicious. A bit too much carrot for my liking, but I just picked some out. I had a bite of my friend's sandwich and that too was amazing. I convinced him to try mine, even though he doesn't really like pork and the thought of eating liver really grossed him out, and even he really liked it! For banh mi, it was a little bit on the pricy side ($5-$6 per), but you get a pretty big portion and lots of meat. Service was also pretty prompt. Took less than 10 minutes for our 2 sandwiches and iced coffee. Although I'm used to banh mi shops having your sandwiches ready before you're even done paying the $2.75 that it costs, but maybe that's too high of an expectation. I'm moving away from East Willyb in a couple weeks so I'll definitely be coming back for more before it's not a 10 minute walk from me anymore!",5.0

"Right across the street from my former  elementary school lies this unassuming, unlabled Vietnamese sandwich shop. My love for Bahn Mi's is deep and I am out satisfying my Bahn Mi Addiction at least once per week in Chinatown. I figured giving Nam Nam a try with it being so close to me would be a great idea. The service is quick here. I walked in at  8:15 pm. I left by 8:23. I ordered a Pork Bahn Mi. Not Spicy. The sandwich isnt packed like the other and cheaper sandwiches I have ordered from other places. And its also a smidgen more than what I pay in Chinatown. The pork was tender. But a little on the peppery side. It was well played though with the house special mayo that they slather onto the bread. The bread was nice and fresh too! The place isnt bad and I cant wait to try their Pho. I will also be back to try the Chicken Bahn Mi.",4.0
"Hole in the wall, not my scene...there was no scene!  This is def a hipster spot.Very simple, you go in there, place your order from the limited menu and call it a day.  The sandwiches are pretty good though and the bubble tea is, well it's bubble tea, bubble tea is always great. I would pick up another sandwich from this spot.",3.0

"The sauce, the ingredients - a sandwich that creates a party in your mouth. Unfortunately I don't live in Brooklyn, otherwise I'd become addicted pretty fast. Healthy, amazing food for cheap.",5.0
"Just okay banh mi and summer rolls. The summer rolls were filled with 90% rice noodles, a couple shrimp and some flavorless iceberg lettuce, not a herb to be seen. The sauce seemed watered down.The banh mi bread is nice and crusty, but the tofu, which was supposed to be spicy, didn't have much flavor at all, and what herbs were actually in the sandwich were unchopped so you would accidentally pull out some giant stalk you had to chew up with your mouthful.Nothing special, lack of Vietnamese flavor (Cyclo kills this place, but then again NYC isn't a great place for SE Asian food unless you find the few spots in Queens).My biggest problem was the WASTE. They serve everything in plastic takeout containers which they do not recycle. Imagine the waste from every couple that comes in to order a bowl of noodles or an appetizer! Get some plates, Nam Nam.",2.0
"Place has no sign so it's Little difficult to find. Had the original, chicken, and pork. Had all 3 spicy. Original : not a huge fan but edible Pork : good but I've had better. Missing the bbq flavor. But still very good. Chicken : definitely the best of of the 3 and the best chicken bahn mi I've had. There is no radish/daikon in the veggies but I'm not complaining because the veggies are delicious. The bread is ridiculously good and it comes out nice and toasty. At $5.00 to $5.50 it is fairly priced.",4.0

"My coworker found this place on Yelp and a few of them came here last month. They had a pretty decent experience so we came back to celebrate another coworker who was leaving us for another job.This place really is a hole in the wall, and unless you are already looking for it you wont find it. Its kind of off the beaten path and not where the majority of peple are. Its extremely small- only able to sit about 12 people comfortably with tables and chairs. Five of us came here and were able to get a table. We had to ask three times for the table to be cleaned from left over food from previous patrons. Rather than bringing out a wet rag and a cleaning solution to properly clean the table, the guy brought out a napkin and proceeded to do a crappy wipe down. When we told him the table was sticky and needed to be wiped down with something bigger and wet, he gave us an attitude walked away and came back- presumably with the same napkin only wet. Needless to say the table was still gross and I had to wipe it down with the wetnaps in my bag (GOES FROM A 5 STAR TO 3 STAR REVIEW). The way I see it if you dont care about the cleanliness of the front of the store where your customers sit, how much effort is put in behind the counter?Theres two options when ordering food- you pick a meat (if you want) andbasically choose the noodle dish or the sandwhich. It comes with a side of sauce in a plastic container which I really appreciate because it lets the costumer choose how much sauce and such. This was either our first or second time having Vietnamese food, so a walk through would have been appreciated. What would have been nice prior to ordering was to be told that we have an option on what kind of sauce. The fish sauce it comes with smells absolutely disgusting and I was releived that it wasnt already in my dish otherwise I would have sent it back. My coworker was already aware of an alternative sauce which I have no idea what was in it but its apparantly the ""vegan"" option It had a slight peanut/soy smell and it smelled delicous. When two of us asked to switch the sauce, it was another huff and puff (really dude??) Overall the food was really tasty. We had a mixture of the noodles and sandwiches and everyone was really happy with their dishes. It was a light meal, not heavy at all. The chicken tasted really good but I have no idea what kind of sauce/marinade was used. My only complaint about the food itself was the chicken dish was all dark meat and it was extremely fatty. Looking at the dish I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of chicken I was given, but by the time I picked out the fatty pieces I was only left with about half of the original portion. The ONLY thing about my dining experience that is a 5 STAR rating is the BUBBLE TEA. All I can say is the Almond Bubble Tea was heaven and I could drink that all day every day.",4.0

The menu is simple, the space is small yet cozy and you feel some what safe knowing cops hang out there (or not if you're a drug dealer, prostitute, theif, etc.).

The sandwich was large, the bread was very fresh, the carrots, cucumber, and garnish they used on the sandwich were fresh and crunchy. It was still hot when I got back home.The chicken wasn't very spicy apart from one pepper, but everything else on the sandwich was extremely delicious.

So ive been here a few more times for the sandwiches. Their grilled pork sandwich is actually pretty good. And their classic is decent as well. Its not quite up to my Seattle standards but its good. I go there every now and then when im in the neighborhood. I wouldnt say its the best sandwich shop in nyc but its decent especially once you throw that sriracha on (which is a bit weird to me but still delicious).,3.0

Got the vegetarian sandwich and it was better than most that I have tried.  It even beats the ones in San Jose and that's the mother land of Vietnamese sandwiches. I especially like this one because the tofu is not deep fried. The tofu is pan fried and chunky whereas most places make it seem like you're eating fried shredded tofu.  The bread is also good and they give you tons of veggies.  The sandwich could have used a little bit more soy sauce though.,4.0

"One of my friends yelp'ed this place when we were planning out our study adventure in Brooklyn. This place is pretty much a hole in the wall in a far off corner of Williamsburg, with no sign marking the store front. My friend and I walked back and forth using google maps to tri-angulate where it was. Inside, the restaurant is very spartan with two tables for food and a register where you order the food. Yet, don't let all of these things preventing you from stopping by. The banh mi here is delicious, though the pho is so-so.Pork bahn mi ($5): Crispy toasted baguette filled with lots of moist, flavorful barbequed pork. 4/5Traditional bahn mi ($5): A great banh mi filled lots of cold cuts.

"With about a 4 block walk from the G train, I arrived at Nam Nam, which is located closer to corner of  Manhattan Avenue and Leonard Street.  The decor is not bad. Yellow painted walls with classy paintings on it.  There are about 8 to 10 cushioned seats total, some wooden tables.  The owner is very friendly. I asked him which banh mi to get. He suggested the pork, so that is exactly what I got. I like all of these options, but I couldn't decide.  They have cold cut, pork, chicken and vegetarian sandwiches.  The prices range from $5 to $6 for their banh mi sandwiches, and now, they have Pho, which is $8.50.  This eatery also has summer rolls for $4 or $5, I forgot. I did ask about the facilities, being that I needed to use them, and he explained to me that their bathroom is out of order, so we could use the deli's water closet next door.  So keep this in mind!  I am compelled to mention this because I ordered the iced Vietnamese espresso with condensed milk before I knew this. (Why, oh why?)  I wanted to let you know that their banh mi is amazing and worth traveling over to Montrose Ave.  Closest train is G at Broadway and B46 from Kings Plaza.  I did see a L train stop somewhere close by, but I think it's like a 15 minute walk over here.  On the way from the train, I saw an auto repair shop, a wholesale meat seller, and an amazing savings.  I really did enjoy my sandwich.  The bread was really crunchy(toasted), the carrots were pickled just right, and the mayo has a hint of garlic(just in case you despise the lingering tasty smell of it), and the meat was delicious.  The cilantro and cucumber was fresh and made the smells of banh mi mouthwatering.  I need to state that a few pieces of the pork had cartilage so you have to chew thoroughly or just rid of it.  I believe that my espresso was so strong that my eyes started blinking less.  This is a great place for studying, since it is quiet. Most people take their orders to go and no one really sits here for long.  They have great big window doors to let the natural sunlight in. That makes me happy!  (that and the good food, that is!)",4.0
"This place is ultra good, cheap and they deliver. Downside of delivery is that you don't get to have the Banh mi after it has just been freshly made. The crunch of the bread and the warmth of the roll as well as the different temperatures of the fillings from jambon, pate, to pickled daikon/carrots enhances the Banh Mi eating experience. When everything has become the same temperature due to it being a sandwich, and the bike ride it takes to get to your house then you miss that experience. Not that the meal isn't good it's just not AS good.If you live on this end of Williamsburg, I'm sure you appreciate the fact that you have this option. In my opinion, Nam Nam's Banh Mi is better than Grand Banh Mi (now under a different name).The spicy is fire. The peppers put in the burn - if you like heat then do it.All the banh mi on the menu is good, the bubble tea is awesome (coconut or taro - both recommended), vietnamese coffee also solid. Really happy this place opened up. A bit regretful that I hadn't yelp-ed about it earlier but better late than never.Way to be delicious Nam Nam!",5.0
All I'm going to say is that I never want to stop eating the chicken banh mi sandwiches.,5.0
Got the vegetarian sandwich and it was better than most that I have tried.  It even beats the ones in San Jose and that's the mother land of Vietnamese sandwiches. I especially like this one because the tofu is not deep fried. The tofu is pan fried and chunky whereas most places make it seem like you're eating fried shredded tofu.  The bread is also good and they give you tons of veggies.  The sandwich could have used a little bit more soy sauce though.,4.0

"One of my friends yelp'ed this place when we were planning out our study adventure in Brooklyn. This place is pretty much a hole in the wall in a far off corner of Williamsburg, with no sign marking the store front. My friend and I walked back and forth using google maps to tri-angulate where it was. Inside, the restaurant is very spartan with two tables for food and a register where you order the food. Yet, don't let all of these things preventing you from stopping by. The banh mi here is delicious, though the pho is so-so.Pork bahn mi ($5): Crispy toasted baguette filled with lots of moist, flavorful barbequed pork. 4/5Traditional bahn mi ($5): A great banh mi filled lots of cold cuts.

"I am a BANH MI lover. It's in my blood!! I was hanging out in Bushwick and me and my friends came across this place. Normally I go to Ba Xuyuen- best Banh Mi place in NYC. We came here because of convenience. The Asian lady greeted us and service was prompt and she spoke proficient English. This place is tiny and there's no bathroom. I ordered the classic one for $5.50 and a pork chop with noodle - no soup (bun in Vietnamese). It was okay. The bread was toasty and inside was soft. They had daikon, and cilantro with headcheese, barely notice the pate, and there was some more pork meat. The spicy level was a joke. Not spicy at all. I asked for very spicy and there was only a little bit of sriracha sauce. My idea of spicy would be raw jalapenos or thai chili peppers. But then again this is Bushwick so most people would not care. The bun was okay. The noodles were very standard and the pork chops were not as flavorful as the other places in Chinatown. This place does satisfy the craving and this place is obviously catered to the non-authentic taste buds since banh mi and Vietnamese cuisine is very new to this area.",2.0
"Was in the mood for Banh Mi today, so I swung by this place and grabbed a spicy pork sandwich.The bread was fantastic - just the right combination of crusty and soft.

The pickled carrots and daikon were not overwhelmingly sweet and vinegary, which is good for me, because sometimes that can overwhelm the sandwich.The ambiance is reminiscent of a small semi-shabby cafe.

"worth the hype... much better than any banh mi I have had in NY.   They actually have GOOD bread, which is a crazy thing not to do well but is usually neglected.   Had the classic and the pork, and the pork won by a margin but both were excellent; great proportions, great ingredients, great texture throughout.",5.0
"Their vegetarian (vegan, actually) banh mi sandwich is awesome.   It has lightly fried seasoned soft tofu with a little bit of mushrooms, plus carrots, daikon, cucumber and fresh cilantro on a perfectly toasted baguette.  A nice balance of sweet, salty, spicy, soft, chewy, crispy. I prefer to get the sandwich to go and add extra sriracha and vegan mayo to it as their mayonnaise (which is optional and not an automatic part of the sandwich) is dairy/egg based. Great service, great value.  At $5.25 the vegetarian sandwich is the most expensive one on the menu.",4.0
"I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this cute neighborhood joint. Not only was the food good, the entire atmosphere was so cozy that one can't help but sit down and just enjoy the coffee.

OMFG... 5 mins in the oven and it's just as crispy and fresh as the day before. i just finished one sandwich and I still want another one....Might I also add, the host and staff are very friendly. They are not ""in your face what do you hover hover hover"" (you know what mean?)

"This is a quaint, low-key place that has good food and good bubble tea. I've only had the noodles and not the sandwiches, but the noodles are de-lish. The bubble tea is cheaper than I've seen it at other places, and made very well (the tapioca balls aren't dry in the middle like at some other places). Staff is friendly and food/drinks are always prepared quickly.",4.0
"Finding good cheap eats in my neighborhood that aren't mexican food is difficult, so Nam Nam is a extra-welcome addition. Nice staff, amazing deal, delicious sandwiches that are some of the best I've have in New York. I recommend the chicken bahn-mi as a good one to start with. Everything is fresh and in the perfect portions. A real winner.",5.0
"The decor is nothing special, kind of lacking to be honest. But- of the very limited menu, I always get the same thing- the chicken banh mi (xtra spicy). Not technically a true banh mi because there is no pork or pate, but it is hands down the best banh mi sandwich I have ever had in my life. I would give five stars, but I took one away because of the limited menu. I wish they would deep fry the spring rolls.",4.0
"I'm Vietnamese and I love their banh mis, especially the classic cold-cut sandwich. It tastes just like the ones my family makes!I strongly recommend you go there if you're in the area or you live in the neighborhood!",5.0
"When my neighbor told my boyfriend and I there was a GOOD Vietnamese sandwich place that opened 2 blocks from our building I was ecstatic!  We're from Southern California and grew up in an area with a huge Vietnamese population who spoiled us with amaaaaazing restaurants.  Since moving to New York we have really missed GOOD Mexican and Vietnamese meals, but ""Nam Nam"" has answered one of those cravings with their delicious selection of sandwiches and bubble tea.  The owners are really cool and have their sh*t together.   The food is very well priced, FRESH, and sooo tasty.  It doesn't hurt that the actual store has wifi, seating, and a vibe that reminds me of Boba shops back in Garden Grove.  My bf have gone back numerous times already   :)Great spot, Great food.",5.0
"Deeeeelish. Don't know what else to say. Small joint, quick service, outstanding sandwiches. The pork was great. My brother said the Veggie was quite good, although he wasn't quite as ecstatic as I was. Cravable sandwich! Mm, I want one now.",5.0
"worth the hype... much better than any banh mi I have had in NY.   They actually have GOOD bread, which is a crazy thing not to do well but is usually neglected.   Had the classic and the pork, and the pork won by a margin but both were excellent; great proportions, great ingredients, great texture throughout.",5.0
"Their vegetarian (vegan, actually) banh mi sandwich is awesome.   It has lightly fried seasoned soft tofu with a little bit of mushrooms, plus carrots, daikon, cucumber and fresh cilantro on a perfectly toasted baguette.  A nice balance of sweet, salty, spicy, soft, chewy, crispy. I prefer to get the sandwich to go and add extra sriracha and vegan mayo to it as their mayonnaise (which is optional and not an automatic part of the sandwich) is dairy/egg based. Great service, great value.  At $5.25 the vegetarian sandwich is the most expensive one on the menu.",4.0
"I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this cute neighborhood joint. Not only was the food good, the entire atmosphere was so cozy that one can't help but sit down and just enjoy the coffee. This place so far offers the best vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had. The bread was perfectly toasted. just crispy on the outside and very soft in the inside. The meats were very well marinated and full of flavor. (I had the grilled pork sandwich and they use real pork chop not like the hard dried ground pork concoctions from other places).I took home a couple of sandwiches for the next day. OMFG... 5 mins in the oven and it's just as crispy and fresh as the day before. i just finished one sandwich and I still want another one....Might I also add, the host and staff are very friendly. They are not ""in your face what do you hover hover hover"" (you know what mean?) They try to get to know their customers and genuinely make you feel as if you were a good friend of many years.The prices here are very economically friendly. Appx $5 per sandwich. Awesome deal! I came out of this joint with a huge smile and a satisfied stomach!",5.0
"They put the Bam in Banh Mi.

"I'm sticking with my original score... this time it was totally different though.  The meat was saucier and more meaty, there were more veggies, but something about it just isn't as good as the upper echelon of banh mi.  Really not sure what it is.  Maybe the bread which I like is a bit too flavorless?  Ahhh I dunno.  But don't get me wrong... its good.  Definitely worth getting and definitely worth getting delivered.  Meh... hate the winter.",4.0

"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend in our attempt to taste test and compare bahn mi sandwiches at spots in Brooklyn. This was our third and last stop. The place was a empty we ordered 1 classic sandwich, spicy, and a chai bubble tea and sat down to eat it. The variety of meats was ok. There wasn't really any pate. My boyfriend complained that there was too many veggies. I think the problem was that the meat sat in one corner of the bread and the veggies in the center so it was difficult to get both in each bite. I think the biggest downfall was that the bread was a bit too thick. The chai bubble tea, however, was so yummy (a bit too much ice but the flavor was great!)

The taro bubble tea was pretty good.Overall, a pretty unenjoyable experience. Maybe I'll try the chicken or veggie some day, but I won't go out of my way to go there.",2.0

But for the squeamish people out there: this is a no frills hole in the wall and the meat can be a bit chewy and/or fatty.

"oh, thank the lord!!!is it real? is it a mirage?! YES... it's bubble tea in my muthaf*ckin hood!!!honestly, i was weary living in East Williamsburg without a place to get my boba fix. besides the Saint Alps Teahouse on Bedford... that's just too far of a walk for me to just get bubble tea. there's also Banh Mi on Grand St, but only their banh mi sandwiches are worth the trip. thank goodness for Mabel S. and yosub k. to guide me in the right direction! so- let's just start with the basics: why the hell do some people call it boba? what's the story behind bubble tea? why should i try it? what the heck is this doing in our neighborhood? first of all, in the Westcoast and some Southern areas- we are familiar with the term ""boba"". in other regions like the Eastcoast... folks often call it ""bubble tea"". either way, both terms refer to the same thing: TEA + MILK + FLAVOR + TAPIOCA BALLS (which is what boba and bubble means). you can get this type of tea in many variations, but many people stick to what they like and order the same thing. i have an affinity to Taro flavored Boba Tea, myself. let's move onto the actual taste + quality of their coffee+ bubble teas, shall we? it is FANTASTIKAL. yes, i used a ""k"" instead of a ""c""... because that's how awesome it is. they don't water it down or have too much ice cubes in the cup. the boba balls are cooked to perfection and not too hard and mushy/gross like most places i've sampled. their Taro is perfect. the vietnamese ice coffee is like crack! the right amount of condensed milk and fine brew of coffee makes that of a perfect 10 refreshment. i am very impressed by their iced coffee as well. if you are a coffee lover- i urge you to try this out. the rest of the menu at Nam Nam consists of banh mi sandwiches. my verdict? the Veggie Banh Mi blows my mind. mushrooms and tofu are flavored well- and the overall freshness and execution of the sandwich is quite well managed. i've also tried the Classic Banh Mi- as though that is not my favorite sandwich in general, Nam Nam does a good job at constructing the banh mi as well. overall- it's uplifting to see a Banh Mi/Bubble Tea shop literally steps away from my crib. the staff here are always so sweet and can speakuh engrish well. while as other establishments- i feel as though i have to perfectly affirm and enunciate everything i am trying to convey  when making a simple order. no bueno.i LOVE it here.  i come here every lazy sunday with my lil crew. =)",5.0

YES... it's bubble tea in my muthaf*ckin hood!!!honestly, i was weary living in East Williamsburg without a place to get my boba fix. besides the Saint Alps Teahouse on Bedford... that's just too far of a walk for me to just get bubble tea. there's also Banh Mi on Grand St, but only their banh mi sandwiches are worth the trip. thank goodness for Mabel S. and yosub k. to guide me in the right direction! so- let's just start with the basics: why the hell do some people call it boba? what's the story behind bubble tea? why should i try it? what the heck is this doing in our neighborhood? first of all, in the Westcoast and some Southern areas- we are familiar with the term ""boba"". in other regions like the Eastcoast... folks often call it ""bubble tea"". either way, both terms refer to the same thing: TEA + MILK + FLAVOR + TAPIOCA BALLS (which is what boba and bubble means). you can get this type of tea in many variations, but many people stick to what they like and order the same thing. i have an affinity to Taro flavored Boba Tea, myself. let's move onto the actual taste + quality of their coffee+ bubble teas, shall we? it is FANTASTIKAL. yes, i used a ""k"" instead of a ""c""... because that's how awesome it is. they don't water it down or have too much ice cubes in the cup. the boba balls are cooked to perfection and not too hard and mushy/gross like most places i've sampled. their Taro is perfect. the vietnamese ice coffee is like crack! the right amount of condensed milk and fine brew of coffee makes that of a perfect 10 refreshment. i am very impressed by their iced coffee as well. if you are a coffee lover- i urge you to try this out. the rest of the menu at Nam Nam consists of banh mi sandwiches. my verdict? the Veggie Banh Mi blows my mind. mushrooms and tofu are flavored well- and the overall freshness and execution of the sandwich is quite well managed. i've also tried the Classic Banh Mi- as though that is not my favorite sandwich in general, Nam Nam does a good job at constructing the banh mi as well. overall- it's uplifting to see a Banh Mi/Bubble Tea shop literally steps away from my crib. the staff here are always so sweet and can speakuh engrish well. while as other establishments- i feel as though i have to perfectly affirm and enunciate everything i am trying to convey  when making a simple order. no bueno.i LOVE it here.  i come here every lazy sunday with my lil crew. =)",5.0

"I recently moved to the neighborhood and I have a feeling I will soon become a regular here. The vegetarian sandwich is delicious and all of the vegetables were extremely fresh and crisp.

"There are no bare-bones Vietnamese take-out joints like this one anywhere near me in CT.  So, it is nice to have a place like this to grab a sandwich from after enjoying a beer in Brooklyn.  The menu is simple and to the point and I concur with many other Yelpers that ordering the pork banh mi is a solid bet.  Again, as noted in the first line, this is a no frills place, but if you are cool with that, you will be in for a treat.",4.0
"We roll up here yesterday, and ordered some Pork Banh Mi. Simply awesome. Made with real pork, not that processed stuff you get at other Banh Mi places. The  crispy bread, fresh veggies and great spice made this a winner for me. Paid 5 bucks and went home happy.",4.0

"Really solid neighborhood spot, and one of few places to get bubble tea around the area (really like their original flavor which is black tea-based). Haven't tried much food except the pork banh mi (not spicy) and it's a great value for the price. $5.50 or something like that, super fresh baguette, flavorful pork, pickled veggies...will continue to go here since I live nearby, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it",4.0

"Had no idea this place existed until the hubs and I randomly walked down Montrose and came across it.  After living on the west coast for many years, we have been hard pressed to find an good Vietnamese sandwich on par with our old favorites.  While not quite 100% there, Nam Nam is the closest thing we have found in our hood- nice crusty bread, delicious spicy mayo and pickled veggies..... the pork was quite tasty.   The iced coffee is also delicious.  Super nice people working there.  Went back the next day for more, but unfortunately they were closed due to plumbing issues, so hopefully they get that resolved soon!!

"Sooo good. I live very closeby and have been meaning and meaning to stop by and try this place since it opened about 6 months ago. I've been there twice in the past 3 days and am thinking I may continue at that pace. I got the same thing both times - boring, I know - pork sandwich - spicy, and a lychee tea. From the looks of this place: no awning, no sign, second-hand furniture, and top 40 music playing from a radio in the corner, I wasn't expecting much. But the ingredients are sooo fresh and amazing. The service is superb, and free wifi is always a plus. And the cute little seating area for to-go customers waiting for their food to be done is adorable, with a copy of A Tale of Two Cities sitting out in case you ordered a REALLY complicated sandwich and have a wait time of...forever. Oh, and $7.75 was my order total in case you were wondering. Cheap and friendly and delicious.Will definitely be going back!",5.0

"This place is fantastic. I much prefer it to Bahn Mi on Grand. I first tried their traditional but quickly found their grilled pork. The traditional may have been a bit...too traditional for me, being a round-eye, I didn't quite like the thicker cut of vietnamese bologna which was chewier than I'm used to but the grilled pork is delicious, very flavorful. I also agree with the rest of the reviewers about the bread, very fresh, nice and crusty on the outside with a perfectly soft interior. I also recently tried a new addition to the menu which is their Bún noodle dish. This is phenomenal. I like to mix it up now and I'm glad they added it to the menu. My only regret, which I share with the owners is that their kitchen isn't big enough to do serious Pho. I hope that they are successful enough to branch out and acquire a space with a bigger kitchen so that they can start making some. This is authentic Vietnamese food and really good and I'm very glad they're in the neighborhood.",5.0
