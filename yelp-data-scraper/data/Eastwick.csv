"It's not often that I'm in Bushwick, but now that I've been to Eastwick, I'll be sure to venture out for some more great lunch options such as this.  My first time experience was definitely a successful one.  The bartender/waitress was super sweet and we talked the whole time about the menu, the drinks and the changing neighborhood.  I was taking mu lunch to go so she told me to definitely try the mac and cheese as well as the lamb tacos.  I opted out of the tacos because everybody knows tacos taste their freshest on the fly.  I went for the BGT (bacon, greens tomato) sandwich, side salad with housemade lemon vinaigrette and the award winning mac and cheese.As soon as the bell dinged, I shrieked with excitement and hot-tailed it to work.  That mac and cheese was THE TRUTH!  Man, I'm still thinking about it and I will have to have it again and again and again.  Full of flavor, herbs and I believe bread crumbs wrapped in elbows and ooey gooey cheese.  The sandwich was awesome and far from flimsy.  The salad was a nice ending with just enough acid in the dressing to cut through the sandwich and mac.  By the way, the parking ticket I got along with my lunch....totally worth it.",5.0
"Eastwick is an idea that works and carries itself farther than any other restaurant in its 1 mile radius. To some that's not a large comparison, but remember it's in Brooklyn and there are over fifty restaurants that can't even come close to what Eastwick can deliver. Each borough represents another culture, a different type of living and status, and ultimately caterers the different tastes of its locals. Eastwick took risk in its placement, hiding out in an area filled with cheap Chinese and deli counters to cater to people who want hospitality and atmosphere. Greeted by a rustic door, good tunes, and big windows, a patron will find themselves lifted out of the bruised streets of Brooklyn and instantly placed in the fine dining offered in Manhattan. Communal tables, an open bar, and the occasional individual table create a nice balance that let you soak in the city and get comfortable. Eastwick has a simple menu divided between comfort food and elegance that would make any occasion special. Their signature burger is the best with its light garlic flavor, pricing, and toppings. The hangar steak is underpriced and delicious.  Every time I have tried it, it has been cooked and sliced to perfection, with hints of chives and sea salt that leave the side of homemade fries and arugula salad an extra bonus to an already full plate. When I'm in the mood for cheese, I order their Mac and Cheese which could go into a competition and win. Light, creamy, baked, and wholesome, a small dish will set you back only a few dollars. Compared to a few local shops in the area this recipe and value is a steal. Grab a salad if meat doesn't hit the spot. Their house salad dressing is to die for. Drinks. In the last month I have been dining there, a new bartender has appeared and recreated their cocktail menu. The care, ingredients, patience, and pallet, make these drinks not only worth their price, but will be sure to provide anyone with a good time. What they don't have in stock, they make up for in taste and uniqueness. Granted their tap selection is not the greatest in size, they still have variety. Any local would be please to enjoy the locally brewed red, dark, winter, or ipa they keep on tap. May I suggest a Froggy Parker or the Topanga? In the end, like the big windows that look out into Graham Ave, one could look into the window in the kitchen behind the bar and see passion. The cooks look like they work hard, keep things clean, and work in unison. It pays off bite after bite. The owner has worked hard to keep his staff upbeat, his food current, and his restaurant clean. In a culture that's bread to piss on each other and give no cares to its neighbors, Eastwick has done something the trendy hipster restaurants couldn't do down the street. It established itself as a staple. Instead of saying ""look, we are in New York, guess that means we're cool now!"" They understood the steps necessary to make people explore the menu it offered and give it a chance in a neighborhood that doesn't take kindly to sit down establishments. It's waiting for the masses to try it out. Light the wick, make this place explode in popularity!",5.0
"Used to love this place. My boyfriend and I have gone to Eastwick every New Year's Eve for the past three years. We came back the 2nd time because the first was so great. The 2nd time was not as good but still, good deal for NYE. But this most recent experience was just plain bad. The restaurant was empty yet they still managed to get our order wrong. We both ordered the steak (one of three entree options for the prix fixe) but they only brought one out and were confused about what happened. We preferred to have both meals at once, but instead of offering to take it back and keep it warm in the back, they just sort of shrugged and suggested we both share it... then share the other when it comes out. The waiter also begrudgingly offered an extra glass of wine for our troubles. His attitude was basically, ""sorry dude what do you want me to do,"" instead of trying to be accommodating. So, my boyfriend sat there with his steak while we waited for mine to come out 15 minutes later. And the steaks were not great. Appetizers were also so-so.We think there must be new management or something as this was also the first year we experienced blaring shitty top 40 music on Pandora.We don't plan to come back again.",2.0
"Update: came back here for their Mac n cheese but sadly they don't serve it when they have their brunch promotion going on. Ordered the short rib and hanger steak burger. Both were cook to perfection. The food was great! Hanger Steak burger and cup of Mac n cheese pairs well. Everything was so flavorful. Then why am I giving it only 4 stars?The service is questionable. Came here on a relatively slow Monday for lunch. The two people manning the floor seemed very unenthusiastic to say the least. Getting seated wasn't much of an issue but waiting for them to come around to pour water, take your order, get you the check were just mind numbingly frustrating. What really irked me was the way they treated an elderly gentleman who came in after us. The elderly man was clearly looking for a little help but the staff at this restaurant were only giving him dirty looks. One of the core tenants of the restaurant industry is customer service. Please learn to be more understanding of those especially the elderly. They're paying the same amount as everyone else and should not be getting the short end of the stick. Summary: food is good but service is horrendous. Whether I come back here or not is a very good question. At this point, a toss up.",4.0

"I do love Eastwick - it's the perfect place to go when you want a bite out and a guarantee to enjoy yourself. The food isn't extravagant or jaw-dropping but it's always tasty; the drinks are fun and the happy hour is decent. My boyfriend particularly likes the burger and I've enjoyed both the veggie burger and mussels many a time.Our only real qualm with the place is that the service is a bit lacking. Don't get me wrong, they are always welcoming, polite and happy to help - that being said, on multiple occasions we have had mix-ups. We've ordered things only to be told 10 minutes later that they've run out and dishes sometimes just don't make it to the table. I believe we've ordered the shishito peppers 3 or 4 times and have NEVER gotten them (even when it's dead quiet)... I cook blistered shishitos all the time at home and it takes 2 minutes with minimal effort - in fact, I am eating shishito peppers right now which is what inspired me to write this review.So, in sum, my only issue with Eastwick is that the staff needs to work on running things a bit more smoothly. Other than that, the food is delicious, the prices are good and the place itself is warm and welcoming! Though, note to Yelp, I'm not sure I would consider this place ""Middle Eastern"" as they carry about 3 Middle Eastern dishes and the rest is classic American bistro food.",4.0
"Eastwick has been a savior since I've been spending my summer in the area. It's just down the street, it's got a light menu for brunch, and the indoor space is a small square room with 6-8 bar seats, a farm style table in the middle, and booths that line two of the walls. Although the space is just a small square, they do a good job of not making it feel like it's a cramped space. The food is pretty average. I'll come here if I don't want anything fancy - and I mean this because they don't allow many substitutions or additions. I got the ""three eggs your way"" and I asked to add a single ingredient and I was turned down. So I got my plate of three eggs (which was definitely MORE than three eggs) and they were a bit bland and too chewy and fluffy. With no other ingredients, it was lackluster. If you're going here - get the shakshuka. That's probably their best item, although like I stated earlier, there aren't a lot of options. I haven't seen their menu change much in the past year either. The service is a bit strange too - hit or miss. We've gotten great service some days, and when we went this past weekend there was a girl who looked a bit confused when being asked questions.",3.0
"I came to Eastwick to meet a friend from out of town and I really really liked it. It's in a cute and cozy spot not too far from buses or trains. I got there early and there was several places to sit, at the bar or side high table near windows, as I waited alone on my laptop.     Once our party arrived, they were very accommodating to the large group with several options for us to sit although it was a tiny place. Tables aren't squished together which I really liked although it didn't matter to us that day cause it wasn't busy. The drinks were good, the food was so damn good and there wasn't a long wait for anything. This was a perfect place to meet up with an old friend cause the enviro wasn't too loud or busy. I would def go back and recommend to anyone looking for a chill place to eat with good food at a good price.",4.0
"Visited Eastwick on a fluke. The food was amazing!!  The lamb tacos were to die for. The mussels were delicious, as was the lamb soup and turkey burger. Good drinks also-the Van Pelt, I think (I had two). As a good home cook, I am difficult to impress-wow. Good, friendly service also.",5.0
"They're awesome for delivery. The salmon, chicken, market greens salad with chicken, deviled eggs and lamb soup are my go-to. One minor complaint though: I went out on a limb and deviated from my usual market greens salad with chicken order and went for the shrimp instead. When you order the chicken they give you so much of this awesome crispy salty grilled chicken but with the shrimp it was 5 little shrimp in there. So I was disappointed when they usually have enough for two portions. And albeit, it's tasty, it's just very little shrimp for $4 and in comparison to what you get when you order chicken.",4.0

"Eastwick has come to the rescue for me on multiple occasions. Firstly, it was the only place I could get my parents to agree to when they were visiting me from upstate. Not only did they find dishes they could enjoy, but it was the perfect setting for brunch with the family. Great pre fix brunch prices, fast and kind service, and delicious food. Incredible french fries and the bloody mary was fantastic.I happy to move close by and somehow drag myself out of bed on the 4th of July, Eastwick seemed like the best possible option. I wish I could remember who was working the bar in the afternoon/early evening on the 4th, but he was absolutely the best. Really great craft cocktails, and every dish was super quick and very very delicious. There's a fried mozzerella appetizer that blew my mind. The lamb tacos, chicken and ribs entrees were all above and beyond great food. His service was impeccable, and he was great to talk to.I'm only knocking my review down one star because whomever the owner is really should re think his business practices with his staff. For over an hour there was only one other table in the entire place, with no signs of foot traffic picking up. At least they should have closed early that evening, so the staff could enjoy the holiday.

"This place is beautiful. It's probably the most beautiful place to eat on Graham avenue. I came here while waiting for a friend, to kill time.

"I've  been here three time since I moved to Brooklyn.   I have only been here for brunch. I love the grand prix concept for brunch.  I'm a huge yogurt & granola person, and these guys take it to another level with their fresh fruit on top.  Lots of places are pretty skimpy on the fruit, but not here.  The fruit is fresh and isn't just a couple pieces of cantaloup. Their eggs/pancake dishes are awesome too.  This is my go to for brunch because it's  well priced - never too crowded for goo conversation - and the service is friendly and  upbeat.I think if I go here for lunch/dinner and still love it, I'll update my review to 5 stars.

"In a neighborhood where there aren't a bunch of new and exciting restaurants, East Wick has set up shop in between East Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn. The restaurant itself is simply designed, but filled with grand, custom-made wooden benches by a local artist. And since it's located on the corner, during the day, the natural light cheerfully floods in from the wrap-around windows. I visited for brunch, and at a more than affordable $14, you get your entree, coffee or tea, and a brunch cocktail. I ordered their Green Omelette (spinach, chives, feta cheese, with roasted potatoes, market greens). The food was delicious. The greens were perfectly dressed with a wonderfully sweet vinaigrette, and the potatoes had a nice crispness to the skin and tender on the inside. The omelette was generous in size and the ingredients were liberally filled inside the eggs, making this a healthy and substantial meal.",4.0

I initially thought the beer was pretty cheap at $5 a glass, until my IPA arrived in a small NON-pint glass. The service was okay..there was only one guy serving all of the tables. He did his job, just didn't seem very friendly. On account of the prices , I probably wouldn't go back. A bit overpriced for my taste.",3.0
"Brunch is $15 for an entree, a drink and coffee or tea. The portions are gi-normous!I love their mixed greens - their dressing is just perfect. The drink portion is good as well. My mimosa was in a wine glass instead of the standard champagne flute, which is a better bang for your buck.I had the short ribs w/ scrambled eggs and I have to say it is top notch. The short ribs were so tender and flavorful and the eggs were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Only downside of the dish was the under cooked potatoes, otherwise good flavor. I've also had the Three Your Way dish and the eggs are just killer. I never thought of throwing chives in my scrambled eggs.I only wish they had maybe 2-3 more options on the brunch menu - maybe their mac n' cheese, which I heard is great. They also have a lot of open space which can hold a good 2-3 more 2 person tables. This will alleviate the brunch wait time. Think about it Eastwick! However, I've never waited more than 20 mins - which is good? *shrugs*Love this place!",4.0

"One of my favorite places in the city.Food: LOVE THIS PLACE. Lots of great items in their dinner menu.My boyfriend and I have been going to Eastwick since it open 2 years ago. We had a love-at-first-bite with their Mac and Cheese and since then we haven't been able to live without it. Their dinner menu is great, but we are not the biggest fans of the brunch menu. Eastwick is the kind of place that we plan to go with a week in advance, building the excitement during this time that always culminates on a great culinary experience. They have great items in their dinner menu apart from the amazing blend of parmesan, gruyere and cheddar mac and cheese. The lamb tacos with feta cheese and salsa verde are to die for, the slow braised short ribs with mash potatoes melts in your mouth, and the steam mussels in butter, garlic, Japanese chili, and white wine sauce are soooo good. There are some items I will not recommend to get like the hanger steak, the 1/2 pound hamburger or the grilled Canadian salmon. There are nothing special and they are definitely not worth the price.Service: Average I love the services that David, one of the owners, always gives us. Although the rest of the staff is kind of sloppy and have that I-am-too-good-to-be-a-server hipster attitude, too cool or too unexperienced to give detailed and attentive service. I wish they will put more attention on this. My boyfriend and I have work in the hospitality business for quite some time and really appreciate good servers.Atmosphere: Sunny and light during the day, intimate during the nightThe restaurant is really clean looking, with a great windows in the front and side of the space. Shinny wooden 2 tops, 4 tops and communal tables in a concrete floor and nicely decorated bar. During the day you get great light from the huge windows, and during the night they use candle light to create a more intimate atmosphere. They often play indie and jazz music which goes well with the ambient. Price: Great price on the good itemsThere are some items that are a bit overpriced for the area that the restaurant is located in, but overall they have a great pricing policy. An enormous and most delicious mac and cheese bowl will cost you $11, 2 lamb tacos are $9 (it is lamb, not a cheap meat), and the slow braised short is $22 but given that is an elaborated dish and that the serve a pretty good piece I think it is a fair price. For some items like the hanger steak, I feel the meet might be good quality, but they way its cooked doesn't really show it, so paying $19 for a piece of meat I didn't really enjoyed made me sad.Other details: They improved their desserts!When the place first open, Eastwick's desserts where not so great. Last time we were there we ordered the espresso shot with hazelnut gelato and it was delicious!I give Eastwick 4 starts because I think there are some things they could improve, the service being one of them. It is not about giving super attentive service, but having people that have the right attitude and demeanor is important. Other thing to improve will be their brunch menu which I think doesn't show how great their chef is. Also, a better selection of teas and taller mugs that will keep the liquid hotter for longer will improve the whole brunch experience from my point of view. The last thing to considered will be their Mains like the steak and salmon and their burgers. There is such great places in NYC for burgers and steak and I don't think they really give it any new twist to what they call ""new American meets Middle East.As I said, overall this is a great place and one of my favorites in the city. I know that if you don't live around the area is not the most convenient place to go. But believe me, once you are there you will be happy to have made the effort to go! ENJOY!",4.0

"I've  been here three time since I moved to Brooklyn.   I have only been here for brunch. I love the grand prix concept for brunch.  I'm a huge yogurt & granola person, and these guys take it to another level with their fresh fruit on top.  Lots of places are pretty skimpy on the fruit, but not here.  The fruit is fresh and isn't just a couple pieces of cantaloup. Their eggs/pancake dishes are awesome too.  This is my go to for brunch because it's  well priced - never too crowded for goo conversation - and the service is friendly and  upbeat.I think if I go here for lunch/dinner and still love it, I'll update my review to 5 stars. So hang tight for the update!Tip: Go here with friends.  The price for brunch is one fixed price so splitting bills down the middle is an easy option.",4.0
"In a neighborhood where there aren't a bunch of new and exciting restaurants, East Wick has set up shop in between East Williamsburg and Bushwick in Brooklyn. The restaurant itself is simply designed, but filled with grand, custom-made wooden benches by a local artist. And since it's located on the corner, during the day, the natural light cheerfully floods in from the wrap-around windows. I visited for brunch, and at a more than affordable $14, you get your entree, coffee or tea, and a brunch cocktail. I ordered their Green Omelette (spinach, chives, feta cheese, with roasted potatoes, market greens). The food was delicious. The greens were perfectly dressed with a wonderfully sweet vinaigrette, and the potatoes had a nice crispness to the skin and tender on the inside. The omelette was generous in size and the ingredients were liberally filled inside the eggs, making this a healthy and substantial meal.",4.0
"Came here after much debate over where to go for dinner on a Wednesday evening. It was pretty slow when I arrived at 8:30, but business definitely picked up by the time I left. I was a little surprised by the prices- I ordered the vegetarian tagine, which was super tasty...for $18, it damn well better be. It filled me up pretty good too, and I had leftovers. I initially thought the beer was pretty cheap at $5 a glass, until my IPA arrived in a small NON-pint glass. The service was okay..there was only one guy serving all of the tables. He did his job, just didn't seem very friendly. On account of the prices , I probably wouldn't go back. A bit overpriced for my taste.",3.0
"Brunch is $15 for an entree, a drink and coffee or tea. The portions are gi-normous!I love their mixed greens - their dressing is just perfect. The drink portion is good as well. My mimosa was in a wine glass instead of the standard champagne flute, which is a better bang for your buck.I had the short ribs w/ scrambled eggs and I have to say it is top notch. The short ribs were so tender and flavorful and the eggs were seasoned and cooked perfectly. Only downside of the dish was the under cooked potatoes, otherwise good flavor. I've also had the Three Your Way dish and the eggs are just killer. I never thought of throwing chives in my scrambled eggs.I only wish they had maybe 2-3 more options on the brunch menu - maybe their mac n' cheese, which I heard is great. They also have a lot of open space which can hold a good 2-3 more 2 person tables. This will alleviate the brunch wait time. Think about it Eastwick! However, I've never waited more than 20 mins - which is good? *shrugs*Love this place!",4.0
"I always order form this place, and came in for brunch once... Loved it and left happy, all about that braised short rib ""hush"". Great friendly service too, and Sandra the bartender I would return just for her! so friendly and happy just plain adorable -good job guys!",4.0
"One of my favorite places in the city.Food: LOVE THIS PLACE. Lots of great items in their dinner menu.My boyfriend and I have been going to Eastwick since it open 2 years ago. We had a love-at-first-bite with their Mac and Cheese and since then we haven't been able to live without it. Their dinner menu is great, but we are not the biggest fans of the brunch menu. Eastwick is the kind of place that we plan to go with a week in advance, building the excitement during this time that always culminates on a great culinary experience. They have great items in their dinner menu apart from the amazing blend of parmesan, gruyere and cheddar mac and cheese. The lamb tacos with feta cheese and salsa verde are to die for, the slow braised short ribs with mash potatoes melts in your mouth, and the steam mussels in butter, garlic, Japanese chili, and white wine sauce are soooo good. There are some items I will not recommend to get like the hanger steak, the 1/2 pound hamburger or the grilled Canadian salmon. There are nothing special and they are definitely not worth the price.Service: Average I love the services that David, one of the owners, always gives us. Although the rest of the staff is kind of sloppy and have that I-am-too-good-to-be-a-server hipster attitude, too cool or too unexperienced to give detailed and attentive service. I wish they will put more attention on this. My boyfriend and I have work in the hospitality business for quite some time and really appreciate good servers.Atmosphere: Sunny and light during the day, intimate during the nightThe restaurant is really clean looking, with a great windows in the front and side of the space. Shinny wooden 2 tops, 4 tops and communal tables in a concrete floor and nicely decorated bar. During the day you get great light from the huge windows, and during the night they use candle light to create a more intimate atmosphere. They often play indie and jazz music which goes well with the ambient. Price: Great price on the good itemsThere are some items that are a bit overpriced for the area that the restaurant is located in, but overall they have a great pricing policy. An enormous and most delicious mac and cheese bowl will cost you $11, 2 lamb tacos are $9 (it is lamb, not a cheap meat), and the slow braised short is $22 but given that is an elaborated dish and that the serve a pretty good piece I think it is a fair price. For some items like the hanger steak, I feel the meet might be good quality, but they way its cooked doesn't really show it, so paying $19 for a piece of meat I didn't really enjoyed made me sad.Other details: They improved their desserts!When the place first open, Eastwick's desserts where not so great. Last time we were there we ordered the espresso shot with hazelnut gelato and it was delicious!I give Eastwick 4 starts because I think there are some things they could improve, the service being one of them. It is not about giving super attentive service, but having people that have the right attitude and demeanor is important. Other thing to improve will be their brunch menu which I think doesn't show how great their chef is. Also, a better selection of teas and taller mugs that will keep the liquid hotter for longer will improve the whole brunch experience from my point of view. The last thing to considered will be their Mains like the steak and salmon and their burgers. There is such great places in NYC for burgers and steak and I don't think they really give it any new twist to what they call ""new American meets Middle East.As I said, overall this is a great place and one of my favorites in the city. I know that if you don't live around the area is not the most convenient place to go. But believe me, once you are there you will be happy to have made the effort to go! ENJOY!",4.0

"Looking for a burger for a late lunch, I found this place and decided to check it out. Burger was average, not good, not bad. They only have one style of burger on the menu which is fine I just wanted a burger. Huge portion of thin fries and a giant pickle. I added cheese for one dollar. Atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant. Huge windows in this corner restaurant. Great natural light and people watching, which was nice since I was dining alone. Service was prompt and friendly but I had a hard time hearing my server over the ""bar volume"" music. Seems like they could have had it a little quieter for the afternoon crowd. But it was good classic rock so that was just fine.Good meal, nice digs efficient staff.",4.0

"I'm really having a difficult time writing a review for Eastwick. I've been a good number of times because it is so close to my apartment and every once in a while I get tired of going to the same few places over and over again (see: Sweet Science and The Graham). Having gone many times now, I can honestly say that this place is 50/50 with me.When I had the braised short ribs for brunch, I loved them. The veggie burger? Merely OK. Their marinated grilled chicken sandwich? Pretty good, actually, but the side salad was over-dressed to the point that I really couldn't eat it, and I also ended up taking off the top bun of the sandwich because the bread-to-filling ratio just wasn't quite right. I also wasn't overly impressed with the shakshuka, either. But when I got the scramble on brioche? It was delicious. The Bloody Mary? Eh, not so much.So what I'm getting at here is that I come back here time and time again because I really never know whether I'll really enjoy my meal or really dislike it, or fall somewhere in between. But the location is convenient, the pre-fixe prices are good, and usually there will be at least one thing about the meal that is worth it for me. The space is also really nice, there's usually plenty of seating, and I just plain like the way it's set up and decorated.I don't know. I just can't say that this place is either good or bad. I just know that I'll keep going back either way.",3.0
"My boyfriend and I came Sun Sept 8.  He's been a few times and always orders the veggie burger.  It was my first time, I ordered the New England Fish Sandwich, which was tasty - it was a breaded fried tilapia with french fries and arugula on ciabatta bread, with a side of field greens, cherry tomatoes and red onions. I also had a glass of their hard cider.  The entire experience was nice and I'd return.",3.0

Our waitress was very friendly, but not very attentive at all. The restaurant had all but 10 people in it tops, and it was impossible to get her attention. A friend had joined us mid-burger because he was going to show us an apartment. He had wanted to get a drink, but the service didn't return until we stared hard enough (post-burger) for her to bring us the check. The burger was so good though, that this review gets four stars.

"When the liquor petition first appeared in my apartment building a year ago for this place, then going under the thankfully temporary moniker ""Art Burger,"" it promises to plant an innovative and inviting restaurant in an underserved part of East Williamsburg and Bushwick. Now well into the project, I can say the owners here have succeed at their somewhat pretentious sounding mission. The all glass windows stretch around the corner, showing passers by that gentrification is in full swing on the Avenue of Puerto Rico. The smart interiors, with reclaimed schoolhouse benches and a long bar facing the kitchen, of a theme with many other nearby places but with enough personality to not be seen as simple copies. The menu and beer selection isn't large, but both are well edited. The Shipyard is a particular favorite pint and there's a nice selection of seasonal cocktails. The burger is best nearby, impressively juicy and served a mountain of fresh-made and well seasoned fries. The entire sized portion of the mac and cheese is a filling amount of food for $10. If you live in the neighborhood, it's worth liking the restaurant on Facebook for the continually shifting offering of specials. The chef here stretches to Middle eastern, Turkish and even Continental cuisine, with fresh fish and seasonal creations that vary from very good to excellent. A great and no longer particularly new addition to the area, it's a testament to its success that it's hard to imagine the area now without it.",5.0

The only bummer was that they didn't have any dessert.,5.0
"Cute place, nice space, but warning no HH :'( The shishito peppers were excellent. A few drafts available, some bottles and select liquor. The menu looks good but we just popped in for a drink before dinner.",3.0
"Heard about this place from friends so we went to try it out. No wait for a table, $14 for unlimited coffee, a Bloody Mary or mimosa and a meal. Food was excellent.. Would go back just to eat the short ribs! Places like Eastwick make me wonder why I wait 2.5 hours for a table at other brunch places, and pay 3x the cost for a meal which isn't as good. Will definitely return!",4.0
"I love brunch. I'm not a big day-drinker but brunch somehow makes that feel like a great idea.Eastwick makes day-drinking an ever BETTER idea because their mimosas are obscenely good - my god, there are little strawberry pieces in there!!?! I don't know what coffee they serve but it is delicious and the exceedingly friendly staff never neglect your coffee needs, which, as I become a surly old woman, is of great importance to me. And on the ""exceedingly friendly staff"" tip, damn, are these people nice. And accommodating! I hate being that person who has to ask annoying questions because of my stupid food allergy, but our waitress made me feel like it was sooooo not annoying or inconvenient.I want to come back here a lot and bask in the glory of their scramble on brioche and the shining majesty of their waitstaff.",5.0
New to the neighborhood. Not bad eats. Came a few times and the food is always consistent. Good chicken,4.0

"When the liquor petition first appeared in my apartment building a year ago for this place, then going under the thankfully temporary moniker ""Art Burger,"" it promises to plant an innovative and inviting restaurant in an underserved part of East Williamsburg and Bushwick. Now well into the project, I can say the owners here have succeed at their somewhat pretentious sounding mission. The all glass windows stretch around the corner, showing passers by that gentrification is in full swing on the Avenue of Puerto Rico. The smart interiors, with reclaimed schoolhouse benches and a long bar facing the kitchen, of a theme with many other nearby places but with enough personality to not be seen as simple copies. The menu and beer selection isn't large, but both are well edited. The Shipyard is a particular favorite pint and there's a nice selection of seasonal cocktails. The burger is best nearby, impressively juicy and served a mountain of fresh-made and well seasoned fries. The entire sized portion of the mac and cheese is a filling amount of food for $10. If you live in the neighborhood, it's worth liking the restaurant on Facebook for the continually shifting offering of specials. The chef here stretches to Middle eastern, Turkish and even Continental cuisine, with fresh fish and seasonal creations that vary from very good to excellent. A great and no longer particularly new addition to the area, it's a testament to its success that it's hard to imagine the area now without it.",5.0
Eastwick is my new favorite place to order delivery. The food is delicious and is very fresh. I can truly tell they put a lot of love in the food. The grilled chicken with yogurt app and the salsa verde hummus with homemade tortilla chips were great and I find myself craving them. The reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because I thought the portions were very small. Give it a try!,4.0
We were looking for a burger spot and dropped into one of the best spots in east Williamsburg ! Their burgers are amazing but the mac and cheese is absolutely HEAVENLY  Literally the most delicious mac & cheese ive ever had.

"I used to order from Eastwick all the time and dine in frequently--it was my favorite spot in the neighborhood! But the last two times I went the food was so disappointing. Not sure if the kitchen staff recently changed or something, but my boyfriend and I went for brunch the other day and got every basic Three Eggs (scrambled and over easy) and they came out soapy and flavorless, alongside very watered down coffee. What is worse is the large quantity of chives they would throw in, which is not in the descriptions on the menu. So sad and we will likely not return.",1.0
"East Wick is actually actually a pormanteau. The name is derived from the combination of East Williamsburg and Bushwick.

The food tastes good and is done well. I had the new england style fried fish sandwich, which was solid though I wish they would throw a slice of cheese on it just to add a bit more flavor. The white fish was a bit bland and definitely needed the tartar sauce to give it a little more umph. The chicken sandwich that the SO ordered was quite good, with the chicken being moist and the aioli being a really good partner. The shakshuka off the $14 prix fixe brunch a few weeks after was also done well. The eggs that sat on top were poached perfectly and broke to add creaminess to the garlic tomato sauce.

"I came to Eastwick for lunch on a referral, and it was a mediocre experience. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Salmon and the salmon was extremely salty. I like salt, but this was too much and made it inedible. I also switched the home fries to the French fries because my referral told me the spicy mayo was awesome. Indeed the spicy mayo was good, but my fries were mostly crumbs so I had to eat them with a fork. When the guy at the bar asked me how it was I told him nicely exactly what I thought. He said that salmon is cured that way. I understand that salmon is cured with salt, but not so much that it overpowers the other flavors. I love eggs Benedict w salmon. If it is on any menu 9 times out of 10 I will order it. This was the worst I had. I couldn't even eat the other half. He took my plate and gave me a 10% discount.

"Welcome to the Neighborhood!I moved to this neighborhood around the this same time last year. I've seen a lot of changes going on in the area and this is one good one. Eastwick was something the neighborhood was kinda missing. A place where you can sit down, eat some good food and a drink. This side of Graham Ave is totally different from how it is towards Grand St. We have a couple of Spanish restos and a Chinese food joint. This place is literally underneath us. We went in and got a booth right by the window. The place is very well lit with the big windows which brings in natural sunlight. The set up is very cool as well. Park benches, tables and even a picnic table for groups lines the restaurant. They designed the space very well and I've seen it when it's a full house. You can still go in and grab a drink with ease. It was the first day of Brunch and we skimmed through the menu. The menu has the basics. From eggs served your way with roasted potatoes and some greens. Omelettes to short ribs and even a juicy burger. For $14 you can choose any brunch item and it comes with a Mimosa, Bloody Mary, or Michelada, and coffee or tea of your choice. Since it was Sunday I decided to go traditional and get a Bloody Mary. They serve these in beer mugs topped off with a full celery stick and a dill pickle spear. Size isn't a problem. Once you finish it you can see another prize at the bottom, a green olive. My only drawback is that the Bloody Mary wasn't spicy enough. We had to ask for some hot sauce for a little more heat. I decided to get the Eastwick Burger. This came with Horseradish Aiolo and Handcut Fries. This was a nice juicy burger that I really needed to treat my hangover. The only drawback I had was that I wasn't told that it would come with cheese. I didn't send it back, but I would have liked to know that it did or if I had the option to not have it. Other than that, the meal was very good.This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. I would definitely come back to try the other things on the lunch and dinner menu.",4.0

Whatever, all the more attention for us!His mom and I both ordered the lox bagel, he got the shakshuka.All were delicious. The bergen bagel was so soft, it really sealed the deal.The shakshuka was definitely an adventurous choice for Rusbra (basically eggs in a tomato sauce), but after sneaking a bite...it was definitely a good one. The tomato sauce is almost sweet. Beware. The mimosas were also very good. Who knew that just adding a bit of strawberry would help so much? The $14 prix fixe is such a great deal here.

"$14 brunch that includes a Bloody Mary or mimosa, awesome! I won't hold it against the host that he sat his friends that arrived after us before us because three tables opened up after... But just kinda shitty hospitality practice in my mind (coming from someone who's been in the service for 10 years, I know you wanna sit your friends but your patrons are a tad more important). The food made me completely forget about that. Their eggs and short ribs are the f*cking JAM! So good- I'm a harsh critic of brunch bc I feel like everyone does the same sh*t. This was absolutely amazing. Also had the shaksuka (spelling might be wrong) - it was very, very good - very rich, I thought the short ribs were better- but it was still a great dish- great for winter - just a tad bit too rich for me. All in all, I'll come back. Definitely want to try the dinner!",4.0
"Eastwick pleasantly surprised me with value and good food to boot. Be prepared for an extreme hipster vibe but food to back it up. I had the braised short ribs over potatoes, which also came with 2 over easy eggs. For $14 and a complimentary mimosa, it's a pretty good deal!",4.0
"we came here for brunch at 12pm. it wasnt that busy when we came, the waitresses greeted us and have us seated. servers are good, attentive and fast. while we were waiting for our order, people started coming in. we waited for our food for a while about an hour, the people who came after us got their food served already and we were still waiting, the servers noticed us and came to apologize for the long wait. when we asked for the check, the manager or thats the owner i think, personally brought our check,  talked to us, apologized and took half off the bill. i would give them 5 stars because  it's not that often i encountered businesses like this who really give effort to satisfy costumers even when there could be problems. we didnt mind the bill actually but they know how to deal with situations like this. and the food is good too.",5.0

Go crazy and order off menu even though it's brunch prix fixe... They don't even care they are so nice! Salmon on bagel becomes salmon on toast with side of poached eggs. Want some extra BBQ aoili for the fries? No problem. Eastwick has got you. I'm glad to see this once-quiet new neighborhood spot pick up, they deserve it.

"Eastwick is reliably good. I've never had a disappointing experience and have dined there 5-6 times since we moved into the neighborhood. Bottom line, if you're down to spend 10-20$/person for a meal, this place is notably good all around. Food is particularly tasty, service is always friendly, sometimes a little slow, but mostly very good. I only wish they had a larger menu, or changed it up more often. Brunch: Prix Fixe for 14$, including drink of your choice. Sides not included, bacon 2$ extra, fries 2$, etc. Everything I've tried was great but particularly the Shakhusa - savory, tomato-y, delicious with poached eggs. Essentially a tomato stew with loads of garlic and greens with poached eggs in the middle. Lunch/Dinner:Smoked eggplant dip is a wonderful appetizer, great for sharing with your party. Burgers are great. Brioche buns hold up to the juicy patties. Mac and cheese comes highly recommended, as do the mussels.",4.0
"Great service, great burger, great ambience. Though the music was a tad loud to hear the person sittin a foot across from me. Also, the fries were super fried and totally crispy, not how I like them most, but I did eat most of them- and they serve a pretty healthy portion. Whoops... The service was fantastic; seems like they they have good moral amongst their staff. Also gotta mention they have wonderful lighting.",4.0
"$14 brunch that includes a Bloody Mary or mimosa, awesome! I won't hold it against the host that he sat his friends that arrived after us before us because three tables opened up after... But just kinda shitty hospitality practice in my mind (coming from someone who's been in the service for 10 years, I know you wanna sit your friends but your patrons are a tad more important). The food made me completely forget about that. Their eggs and short ribs are the f*cking JAM! So good- I'm a harsh critic of brunch bc I feel like everyone does the same sh*t. This was absolutely amazing. Also had the shaksuka (spelling might be wrong) - it was very, very good - very rich, I thought the short ribs were better- but it was still a great dish- great for winter - just a tad bit too rich for me. All in all, I'll come back. Definitely want to try the dinner!",4.0
"Eastwick pleasantly surprised me with value and good food to boot. Be prepared for an extreme hipster vibe but food to back it up. I had the braised short ribs over potatoes, which also came with 2 over easy eggs. For $14 and a complimentary mimosa, it's a pretty good deal!",4.0
"we came here for brunch at 12pm. it wasnt that busy when we came, the waitresses greeted us and have us seated. servers are good, attentive and fast. while we were waiting for our order, people started coming in. we waited for our food for a while about an hour, the people who came after us got their food served already and we were still waiting, the servers noticed us and came to apologize for the long wait. when we asked for the check, the manager or thats the owner i think, personally brought our check,  talked to us, apologized and took half off the bill. i would give them 5 stars because  it's not that often i encountered businesses like this who really give effort to satisfy costumers even when there could be problems. we didnt mind the bill actually but they know how to deal with situations like this. and the food is good too.",5.0
"Before I moved to Flushing Ave. The girl moving into my old apartment told me I was probably going to eat here all the time.  I waited a good month until I tried it and now it's one of the places we regularly order from on Seamless.  Winter makes you lazy.Eastwick is awesome and pretty much the perfect brunch/dinner place.  They deliver simple, good food, in good portions for the right price.Love it here for brunch, awesome bloody mary (not just gross ass bloody mary mix thank god) and it's a steal for $14 for a drink and a BIG ASS entree.Dinner likes: Burger, chimichurri steak, MAC N CHEESE (must get).  Fries are good too.",5.0
"I paid the toll and it was worth every penny. At first I was skeptical, because they forgot to give us menus, so for a minute there I thought we would all die in eastwick among the hubbub of Sunday brunch, starving, cold and invisible. We finally got some menus (and they apologized) and we are now eating the most delicious meal ever!! Georgie recommends the brioche scramble. No extra charge for egg whites. Side of bacon is 2 bucks. Go crazy and order off menu even though it's brunch prix fixe... They don't even care they are so nice! Salmon on bagel becomes salmon on toast with side of poached eggs. Want some extra BBQ aoili for the fries? No problem. Eastwick has got you. I'm glad to see this once-quiet new neighborhood spot pick up, they deserve it. Dear god I hope you're reading this so you can see I'm making up for yesterday's reviews of Schiller's.",5.0
"Where did my other 1/2 of the deviled egg appetizer go (we received 3 halves)?!  Lol, it was really good though.No complaints about customer service, staff was excellent and cool.  The place itself is made for the hipster crowd.  Really interesting decor, I liked the environment a lot.My best friend and I both had a burger with fries.  Burger was huge, fries were excellent.  The food was excellent.  Where they lost a star was dessert.  I had the special of the night which our waiter recommended to me and it was just not for me.  He looked so excited about it, I just told him it was great, but lied I did!  It was some sort of custard-pudding type vanilla thingy topped with graham crackers and raspberries, I think?  I don't remember the dessert well but it really wasn't for me.I'd go back though and order something else for dessert.  Easy to gain weight coming here...lol, so worth the weight gain!",3.0
"EastWick has to be one of the worst places to go get food from. I work at Rent-A-Center not to far from the restaurant and I was highly disappointed with the service and especially the food. I ordered a burger to go and inside the burger bun was a fried roach, if I had not opened the bun to put ketchup I would of most likely ate the roach. I definitely do not recommend no one to eat at this restaurant. I immediately threw the food away and ordered Chinese from apollos.",1.0
I've never been in but I've ordered a few times. Everything is always fresh and incredibly tasty. The deviled eggs and Mac and cheese are amazing and the beet salad is really tasty. The delivery is fast and friendly. Highly recommended.,5.0
"Eastwick is reliably good. I've never had a disappointing experience and have dined there 5-6 times since we moved into the neighborhood. Bottom line, if you're down to spend 10-20$/person for a meal, this place is notably good all around. Food is particularly tasty, service is always friendly, sometimes a little slow, but mostly very good. I only wish they had a larger menu, or changed it up more often. Brunch: Prix Fixe for 14$, including drink of your choice. Sides not included, bacon 2$ extra, fries 2$, etc. Everything I've tried was great but particularly the Shakhusa - savory, tomato-y, delicious with poached eggs. Essentially a tomato stew with loads of garlic and greens with poached eggs in the middle. Lunch/Dinner:Smoked eggplant dip is a wonderful appetizer, great for sharing with your party. Burgers are great. Brioche buns hold up to the juicy patties. Mac and cheese comes highly recommended, as do the mussels.",4.0

We went there for brunch. $14 includes entree and Bloody Mary or mimosa. I ordered the burger with a fried egg and a side salad. The side salad was simple but the salad dressing was delicious. The burger was tasty too. The mimosa had fresh strawberry purée. My husband ordered the short rib entree with a fried egg. He said it was great but more like a dinner then brunch meal. Very cute place. Waiter was ok. Bartender was super nice.,4.0
"I love everything about Eastwick:-the BRUNCH (amazing eggs shakshuka and delicious bloodies)-happy hour (badass cocktails for $5, get the Witch)-the staff (introduced me to the Mighty Boosh, which is a little embarrassing on my end for not knowing it already)-and the clincher: the most delicious veggie burger I've ever had (hand-made and extremely fresh)It's objectively cheap, but I still tend to go here only when I have some extra cash on me. It's also three blocks from my apartment. I'm lazy.The only reason I'm giving Eastwick four stars and not five is because I know it's the beginning of the end of this neighborhood.

"This gem of a restaurant didn't just breathe new life into the neighborhood I live in, it also provided it with a new nickname. Situated on the border of East Williamsburg and Bushwick, Eastwick serves up tasty dishes inspired by Isreali and modern American cuisines. I've been to Eastwick a few times - for dinner, lunch and brunch and also stopped by for an occasional afternoon coffee/drink. My wife and I love the interior design, the bright open space makes for a chill ambience that reminds us of European restaurants. Their brunch is stellar, the french toast is hands down the best I've ever had. They make the bread and the apple jam themselves and top it all off with a generous amount of fresh fruit. My wife had the braised short ribs at brunch and they were tender and delicious. At dinnertime, their burger is one of the staples that I often get delivered on seamless. The quality of the food is simply excellent, remarkable given their affordable prices. Our favorite meals are the deviled eggs, beet salad, cheeseburger, french toast and braised ribs. Great portions, I've always left feeling satisfied and sated. We love this place!",5.0

"I really wanted to like this place because I live right around the corner but it is what it is. The food was just meh. First off, we ordered an app and we sat a very long time before we got any food. Instead of an app, we got our entrees and were told they forgot about our appetizer. Ok, fine. I got the beef short ribs ($22) they where just meh not really that good. My lady ordered the burger and we asked for medium. It was definitely well done. Also the burger is $12, then they charge you 1.5$ for cheese?? and 2$ for Bacon. I mean charging $1.50 for cheese on a burger, that's stupid and an obvious way to squeeze more cash out of you. My dad got the fish sandwich it was just bleh.  Our server was nice, the environment was pretty cool but I'd much rather spend my time and money at Sweet Science right across the street. The prices are much better and the food is in my opinion much MUCH better. I won't be coming back, this place is just a rip off for mediocre food.

"The Harefield Road brunch model: serve simple entrees and force a combined bottomless coffee with a single cocktail and charge $14.I guess that's fine, but I usually just do coffee with brunch, so since the food was just good, nothing special, so I'm not going to run back. I don't know that I need coffee AND a drink?

"It was Sunday afternoon and we were looking for a new place to grab some grub.  We happened to be driving down Graham Ave and decided to stop at Eastwick.  There were a total of three people in my party so we decided to order our drinks and food at the same time.  I ordered orange juice, another person order water with lemon and the other a mimosa.  I ordered eggs, and the other two ordered burgers.  We were sitting directly to the left of the entrance/exit so we one person in our party was able to see the cooks making our brunch.  We happen to see the cook (wearing an orange bandana) eating chicken and fries while making our food.  One person from my party walked to the back to see if there was a sink where the cook was washing their hands.....guess what no sink in the vicinity.  We decided to inform the manager/owner and he went to the back to inform the cook.  His first excuse was that the cook was tasting the food.  That was the dumbest excuse I ever heard in my life b/c no one orderd chicken wings and french fries....and who tastes an entire chicken or french fries.  The manage decided  to go to the back again and came back out and told us that they were tossing the food and making new dishes for us.  I waited like 3-5 min and decided that I cannot trust this place so I walked to the bar to let them know not to make the food and requested the check.  I was able to see the counter in the kitchen and guess what was still on the counter to be served to us......the original order.  The manager wanted to comp the drinks but I decided to pay for it.  To Eastwick .....if you're going to have a view to the kitchen please make sure your cooks are clean and not nasty pigs.  That is the point to let the public know that hey....we're clean and on point with everything.So if you want to eat a meal where the cook is touching your food with his dirty hands come to Eastwick!!!I would give this place NEGATIVE 5 stars if possible b/c this was completely unacceptable!",1.0

Good spot like the layout of the inside food good they have happy hour until 7:30 great spot to bring a bunch of friends BBQ mayo is soo good,5.0
"The best thing about this establishment is how much everyone truly cares about your dining experience. The food is consistent, delicious and affordable. The service is warm and accommodating. The decor is beautiful and the mood is always just right. I love Eastwick with all of my heart, and not just because of their Lamb Burger.",5.0
"i've never had anything bad here, and it's right across the street. can't really ask for much more than that. burger is great, short ribs are great, the braised pork ribs at brunch are amazing.i think i'll go tonight...",5.0
Great entrees for a prix fix menu price! Awesome bloody mary and great fries. I loved the ambience of the restaurant and the service. Would definitely go back for dinner!,5.0
"The food here is fabulous, we went with a large group and had several starters to share along with mains.  The mac and cheese is unreal and the lamb tacos were really flavorful!  Drinks were good and strong and the overall ambiance is airy and comfortable.  This is a great gem to have in the neighborhood.",4.0
"veggie burger, order the veggie burger!",4.0
"I have eaten at Eastwick numerous times and the quality of my dining experience is always great (and I'm picky)---leaving me happily sated till the next time.  The food is fresh and consistently delicious!  The service is warm and friendly.  There is a lot of love and attention put into the preparation of the dishes...something I can distinctly taste and feel that makes it extra special.:)  I am a vegetarian and I LOVE all of their veg options.  Best Mac and cheese, Smoked Eggplant (Baba ghanoush) and veggie burger ever!  The Winter Beet and Endive salad is DIVINE and has the most incredible homemade vinaigrette dressing.  The Vegetable Tagine is also an exotic favorite of mine.  I am excited to try their brunch options.  So far, I've had the Green Omelette, which was very flavorful, yet light and nourishing.  They also have a wonderful selection of wine, beer and cocktails.  Enjoy!",5.0
"Stopped by here yesterday for mother's day with my family and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  First of all, the spacious and bright floor plan is the perfect vibe for weekend brunch.  The blood mary is light, if you're looking for something more on the refreshing side, post-hangover. The pickle in the blood mary was awesome! The food was simple, yet done right.  I had the burger and my sister had the shortrib ""hush""  and both were delicious and satisfying. They could really benefit from a cocktail menu, but I'm sure it will come in time.  I'm so happy this place opened in my neighborhood, where a good brunch spot is seriously lacking!",5.0
"This place is in my hood and seriously an incredible addition. The decor is light and hip, yet not hipster. The staff are welcoming and nice, seem to actually enjoy their jobs, and are a huge reason to come back. I will be back for the food though, I had the smoked eggplant, which is their take on babganoush and it was perfect, delicate and flavorful, exactly what you want with a cocktail. I also had the chicken liver pate, I have had many pate dishes in my life and loved many of them, but this may be my favorite. It was rich without being overwhelmingly so and the pickled radish and apple chutney (almost like charoset) were perfect companions.The cocktails are well thought out and perfectly composed. I can't wait to come back and try their whole menu, they deserve to have a crowd every night, but I hope, selfishly, that I get to experience it as I did tonight a few more times before they blow up. Good job guys.",5.0
"Ok. Brunch drinks were not so great. Food was mediocre. French Toast was good, short-rib not good, veggie burger just ok. We wanted to like it more.",3.0
"i LOVE it here. i've been in the neighborhood for about a year and good local places have been hard to come by. eastwick has totally changed that.  their veggie burger is beyond, service is great and ambiance is total perfection (like, minimalist chic).  so into this place! :)",5.0
"Wow.  What a find.  You don't expect to find such a fabulous dining spot on Graham St.  We were pleasantly stunned.  A selective menu - tried a little bit of this and a little bit of that- salads, eggplant dishes, fish, ribs, mac and cheese, dessert.  Chef Meny knows how to infuse flavor in all his food.  And to top it off, the prices were so reasonable.  Service was wonderful.  Come here before you have to start calling a week in advance for reservations.",5.0
