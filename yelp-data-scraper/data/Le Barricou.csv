"I've been coming here since I moved to Williamsburg in 2007 and as time has gone on the prices have steadily risen while the food and service has fallen. It's still a cute place to go for brunch or dinner but it's SO FAR from where it was even just a couple of years ago. And today's experience and terrible service was the last straw.After waiting the standard 35-40 minutes for brunch on Sunday (which is totally fine for a popular spot like this), we get seated and proceed to wait another 10 minutes for any wait staff to come by and check on us. Once we eventually get asked for our drink and food orders we never see our waitress again. A different server came with our food, which was cold, and we had to stop ask that server for a salt shaker and a bus boy for our check. It was only at that point that our waitress re-appeared and hastily took my credit card so she could turn the table over. No thank you, no smile, nothing. The service was absolute GARBAGE. Yes, it was busy, but not THAT busy. And no place is ever so busy where that kind of service is acceptable.And the sad thing is it's becoming the standard operating procedure here. It's gotten to the point where I've had more bad experiences than good and I've been visiting for 8+ years. And as this rate I don't know if I want to go back. So disappointing.",2.0
"If you're in search of a truly decadent French meal look no further than the trendy Le Barricou. We had brunch here this past weekend, and although the wait was a bit of a pain the food was absolutely worth it...perhaps some of the best French brunch I've had in the five boroughs. I ordered the steak and eggs, my partner had the croque madam, both were insanely delicious. The steak was pounded thin yet still cooked perfectly, the bread in the madam was unbelievable (toasted with a very generous pat of butter). Our table ordered the baked pancakes, which are a must if it's your first go at Le Barricou. They take 40 minutes to prepare, so if you'd like to have them as your entree with the rest of your party, place your order as you sit. By the time they were done baking we essentially had them as a dessert, an entirely unreal experience. The strawberry butter on top is to die for. As for the service, they seemed severely understaffed for an early Sunday afternoon. Our waitress was lovely, but not very present. The atmosphere is marvelously curated but of course a bit hipster as it's located in the newly-changing east side of Williamsburg.Conclusively, Le Barricou is worth your time, money, and entire-day calories. I highly recommend brunch service and will definitely return again someday.",4.0
"This is my FAVORITE brunch spot in Brooklyn (maybe even in NY). Service is great, food is greater and its not too loud!  There's always a wait when I go but the wait is pretty short.I make it my duty to go here for every single occasion...and i do mean every occasion.New job, let's celebrate- Le Barricou!graduation, woohoo!-Le Barricou!my credit score went up, YASSS!!-Le Barricou! You pretty much get the picture, lol.Tip: do not put your name down and wander off! Even though they say 40 mins, wait time is sometimes really 20 minutes because patrons tend to wander off and miss their slot!",5.0
"Great brunch. I tried the duck confit hash and I'm not even really into duck but I thought it was superb. Of course, I had to try the famous cake-like perfectly fluffy pancakes with strawberry butter and fruit. They are really good but super filling even with a few bites. The four of us could barely finish one, let alone two. I almost wish they were a little bit thinner. Definitely something to share among the table. I wonder if anyone has finished a whole set of those decadent pancakes on their own? We also all enjoyed our bellinis, bloodys, and mimosas. Really cute brunch place in the Burg, I would return!",4.0
"I think I had some unrealistic expectations for this spot just because of how much a few friends of mine rave about it -- don't get me wrong, it was okay but not great.The restaurant itself is super cute ! They have adorable tiny flower vases, candles and rustic decor. The simple decorative touches really give it a lovely feel. The escargot appetizer was okay. The snails were a little over cooked, tough and chewy. The bread they serve with it was delicious -- toasted and a slight hit of herbs made it great to soak up the extra sauce on the plate. For about $10, they serve a generous amount, nice to share. Eggs Norwegian served with smoked salmon was on the extra fishy side. The eggs were cooked perfectly, but the fish killed it for me. Served with light greens and fries were a nice touch.Overall, I won't go out of my way to come back.",2.0
"I came back on a Sunday! Although the restaurant was very crowded since it was a three day weekend, a table for 2 only took about 20 minutes, which wasn't bad.However, I think their food really suffered since it was so busy.I shared both of the dishes with my friend.Norwegian Benedicts ($14):This was actually my first time having salmon in my benedicts. I didn't particularly enjoy this dish. The poached egg wasn't runny enough. Secondly, the salmon was way too fishy. I love salmon (raw & cooked), but I really didn't enjoy how fishy it was.Pancakes ($10): ~40 minute wait!!!I forgot how dense and filling these pancakes are. I'd only recommend ordering this if you're a party of 3+ unless you're planning on packing this to go. It's waayyy too much & I felt bad for leaving so much behind. The pancakes were still good. But, you could tell how the cooks struggled to take them out bc parts of the pancake kind of broke off.The service is really good. They gave us extra plates and even gave us new plates when we got the pancakes. But, I would have really appreciated it if the waitress would have told me that butter was extra. I asked the waitress for extra butter since they only put it on the top pancake & not the bottom. But we didn't know about the extra charge ($1.50) until we got our check.",3.0
"Deep pancake-disappointment. Place is very nice, though a bit too crowded during Sunday's brunch, warm atmosphere, nice music selection, great service, (French) food is delicious. But...how about those famous pancakes? Pancakes MUST be pancakes, not a sort of heavy-weird-double-pillow-shaped pastry with two pieces of fruits on top... It's like if an American bakery would sell rainbow-bagel-shaped bread with shredded coconut and Alfredo sauce on top and call it French Baguette! No joke!",3.0
"It was a pleasant evening at Le Barricou. We came here on Wednesday night and the restaurant was completely empty until approximately 8 PM. Once it hit 8, the restaurant was packed. Ambiance was intimate with dim candles along with endless playlist of baby-making music.Roasted Bone Marrow $16 - Lots of fatty, buttery meat that melts in your mouth! The texture was very smooth and went well with the toast. I'd recommend this. It's good to share between two.Escargots $9 - VERY generous amount of escargot. Each slot had 2-3 pieces. It was buttery and delicious. The seasoning was a tad salty but the toast made it manageable. Cote de Boeuf (24oz bone-in dry aged rib eye for two) $60 - 24oz may sound intimidating, but the bone takes up a good chunk of weight. The rib eye came sliced, tender, and cooked perfectly. The aroma was very appetizing and the taste was fantastic. Neither of us enjoyed the brandy peppercorn sauce. It was too overpowering and had a strong taste of brandy. The steak was better off alone.Brussels Sprouts $7 - Looks were really deceiving on this one. What looked like a messy plate of burnt veggies turned out to be flavorful roasted Brussels sprouts. The onions and herbs brought out savory flavor and aroma. Crème Brulee $6 - It was soft, creamy and rich in flavor. The hard caramel stuck to my teeth but that didn't matter because it was so good. I've had brunch here before and it was exceptional. I'll definitely be back for brunch/dinner!",4.0
"We went here for brunch. I wasn't feeling so hot so I opted for a simple market green salad. And holy cow, I don't know if I've ever been so satisfied by a salad before. I let this draft sit too long. Now I've forgotten the details of the meal. But let it suffice to say that it was exceptional.",5.0
"I came here for brunch with a friend on one of the most hungover days of my entire life. We sat at the bar to avoid a long wait time for tables. Bartender was friendly, attentive, adorable and overall just really nice to me as I was dying inside his establishment. We ended up taking our food to go because I couldn't hang (embarrassing haha). I'm a savory breakfast person so I ordered the goat cheese croissant and would recommend it to anyone. A couple sitting next to us at the bar got the pancakes and I was having order envy... Next time I come, I'll have to convince someone to split them with me.",4.0
"Came here last night with my partner for dinner.  The food was delicious. We had oysters on the half shell, escargot, the steak for 2 and a Crème brûlée.  I have never had escargot before but I felt that the sauce it was in was too oily and would have benefited from a bit of acid. They were also a bit bitter- I don't know if that was the snail itself or an herb they used. It does come with thick slices of crispy bread to dip in the sauce which was good.  The rib eye steak for 2 was well seasoned with a nice seared crust on it. The peppercorn sauce was aromatic and rich without being spicy. It was cooked perfectly to the temperature requested and was very lean for a rib eye. It came with 3 small potatoes and a very tiny arugula salad. Althought it was a big steak I think it should be either a bit less expensive or had side dishes that were bigger. The steak is at market price - $65. Our server got us really excited for the salted caramel apple tart but didn't realize they had sold out( I work as a server too and I know how often this happens so I wasn't mad) so we got  a Crème brûlée instead. It was very creamy and light with a good burnt sugar crust. We ate it before we could take a picture. The rest of the menu is very reasonable priced with main dishes ranging from $15-$25. I will be back to try the other things on their menu including their homemade pasta de jour.BTW it's super cute inside with rustic touches and a fire place but it was hot! Getrinf sweaty on a date isnt fun. Unless they have AC it must be brutal in there in the summer.",4.0
"PROS:::::Duck Confit Hash - I really like this but duck meat was shredded and just a tad dry. The salad it came with was a little oily but still good.

This is lamb with an extra twist.::::Bloody Mary - I felt like I was drinking cocktail sauce and it has a slight spicy kick to it.

"INCREDIBLE brunch. Definitely worth the trip from Manhattan. This place has AMAZING food, great value, and a charismatic ambience. I shared the duck hash confit - which you cannot miss - and the goat cheese croissant with my friend. Each dish came with two delicious fried eggs and we couldn't even finish everything...though that could be due to the fact that we also shared a side of pommes frites. Who can resist, though?! Her croissant was incredible and stuffed with fresh cheese and spinach. To die for.

It was pretty good though.I also had the lemon tart with ice cream for dessert and blue and black berries, that was excellent.",4.0
"So I came to this place because I heard a lot of wonderful things about it thus we decided to venture out here... Got there came up to the hostess and inquired about how long it would be for a table for two, the hostess informed my friend and I that it would be around 15-20 min wait... 25 min later we came up to her inquiring about our table... The response we got was ""15 min""... 20 min later we came up to her again and asked about our table... She sat someone else ahead of us and stated ""10 mins""... At this point we were 45min in hungry, thirsty and pissed... So we went back up to the waitress and told her that we were leaving and wished that if we would be waiting for 45 min she would tell us ahead of time instead of saying ""15 min"" every time we would come up to her...The hostess apologized and stated that she did not know what else she could do so we requested to speak to the manager... And then it happened!!! it was a miracle!!! A light had shone upon us and magically a table appeared!!! All of a sudden there was no longer a 10min wait!!! There was a table available!!! How? you might wonder!! I d really like to know too!!! Must be magic or maybe just maybe we were being lied to... As the manager approached us she apologized and offered us some drinks on the house... We sat down and decided to give them another shot. So we placed our order... 10 min...20 min... 30 min... 45 min later we finally got our food... I ordered Eggs Benedict and my friend had the burger... Hard to believe that this takes 45 mins to make.  We ate the average food got the pancakes which we were not bad and asked for the check... The check took 2 seconds to arrive...

"This place came highly recommended to me for brunch by a friend who lives in Williamsburg. Seeing as how I only had one Sunday in the city I knew I had to make it count, and there's a MILLION options. Well, if you choose just one brunch, choose this one. I went with my friend and a fiancé last Sunday around 12:30, we were placed on a 30 minute wait. Everywhere in the city is busy so it wasn't even a big deal, it didn't feel like a half hour at all. When we were seated I ordered a mimosa and a shrimp Bloody Mary. The shrimp Bloody Mary was unreal! It's got two jumbo shrimp, a lemon, and an olive, with a cayenne (I think) rim. It was really hard to figure out what to order for brunch but I decided on a spinach and goat cheese croissant. It was served with sunny side up eggs, market greens, and I ordered a side of merguez sausage because I needed meat. I had never tried merguez (lamb) sausage but it was so good! I think I might even prefer it to traditional sausage. The croissant was light and flaky, perfectly baked. The goat cheese just melted in my mouth and went with the spinach perfectly. I dipped it in the yolk of my eggs and was in heaven.It's well priced, has a cute atmosphere, and everything tasted amazing. I can't say anything negative about the place, not to mention Williamsburg is such a cute part of Brooklyn to explore after you eat.",5.0
"Would have given this a five star review if it weren't for service.  The food was great!  However, service was very slow.  We were there on a Saturday morning for brunch so we expected a wait, but it was frustrating to see people who had arrived 15-20 minutes after us get seated and receive their food 15-20 minutes before us.  It took our waitress over 20 minutes just to take our order.The food was worth the wait, though.  The Croque Madame was delicious!",4.0

"My low review is not for the food, but the service. Last time my girlfriend and I went to Le Barricou, she found a broken shard of glass in her omelet the size of an olive pit. I calmly and politely told our server about this the next time he checked on us, and he gave a very perfunctory apology and offered a free coffee as recompense. I thought this was a pretty lame response - he should have taken the omelet off our bill at the very least.During the same visit, we could hear loud yelling and violent crashing sounds coming from the kitchen, which was right behind our table. Not exactly a pleasant ambiance. Meanwhile, the woman seated next to us ordered a virgin bloody mary, and was brought one with vodka in it! This is a pretty serious error, particularly for an alcoholic customer.We've enjoyed the food at this place, but after the broken glass omelet (and lame nonpology from the waiter), we won't be returning.",1.0
"THEY USE AUNT JAMINA FOR THEIR PANCAKES! !! What tom foolery is this! No wonder we think it's good, it's freaking aunt jamina! A childhood favorite from most of our childhoods.

I actually wouldn't be surprised if it was. Since finding out about the aunt jamina.",1.0
"meh. I've had better brunches. The food here is really hit or miss. I've been here twice & both times had an okay experience. The first time, I got the bacon benedict and they burnt my english muffin. The egg was cooked fine but the fact that my English muffin was burnt and the bacon was dry as hell didn't make my meal enjoyable. The home fries are not well seasoned and straight up taste like overcooked chunks of potato. You need a lot of salt & pepper and ketchup in order  for them to taste good. We also got the pancakes to share. At first glance, one will be amazed by how big they are. They're nothing like traditional pancakes. It only comes with two pancakes but it was the size of a cake when stacked. The strawberry butter it comes with is good, but waaay too little for those two ginormous pancakes. they also give you like 10 pieces of assorted berries. Really? Its only enough to accommodate the top pancake. The pancakes were okay. They're so thick that you could probably get full off of one pancake. I didn't like it because of how thick they are. It was so floury/starchy tasting, that after awhile, you just get sick of eating it. I came back a second time because my bf wanted to try this place (mostly because of the pancakes). I got the norwegian benedict this time & it was slightly better than the bacon one, but still didnt really stand out.My bf got the merquez & eggs and he thought it wasnt worth the $15. You literally get 2 eggs any style, 2 sausages & like a shit ton of fries. Legit 3/4 of his plate was fries. The sausages (which are lamb btw) had a really strong taste to it. He said that he still tasted it in his mouth hours later. As for the pancakes, he also thought they were okay.  It was not worth the 45 min wait for them. We also had to get the bottom pancake to go. We asked if we could get extra strawberry butter on it b/c as i mentioned, there are no toppings left for it, and the waiter said that they charge extra for it. They only really give you the size of a quarter amount of butter to begin with, so I was not about to pay like an extra $2 for that little amount of butter. All in all, I would probably not come back a third time. I've personally had a lot better brunches compared to this place, especially in the Williamsburg area.",2.0
"Le Barricou is the first place I bring anyone visiting the city for a beautiful twist on the standard city brunch. Obviously the pancakes are a must (but be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes while they bake), but everything on their bunch menu is amazing. Skip the standard mimosa and try one of their other cocktails- like the Green Beast (absinthe, lime, sugar, soda, & cucumber) or the Châtelaine (gin, elderflower liqueur, white wine, & pomegranate juice). With cooler weather approaching ask to be seated in the back near the fireplace!",5.0
"My $23 lamb ragout had 3 frugal, pieces of fatty lamb while the rest (90%) was filler (bread pieces?, greens and mushrooms)... if you're not going to put enough lamb in the dish to actually call it lamb ragout, then call it bread, greens, mushroom ragout with a hint of lamb. The red wine glass selection was very limited and tasted much cheaper than the price point it was set at. Lastly, the waitress was spacey and took forever to bring our horrible food out. One star for at least trying with the atmosphere/decor. No stars for food or service.",1.0
"My friends and I were really disappointed by the quality of the food. We went for dinner on Saturday evening. We started with escargot and the beet salad as appetizers. Both were under seasoned and the escargot didn't have the traditional butter and garlic sauce. My lamb ragout was a total miss. The meat was not braised and was fatty and so skimpy, there were literally just 4 pieces surrounded by a mound of mushrooms and fried dough(?) and under seasoned also. My friends coq au vin was also not good, no rich wine sauce and again no flavor. The chef doesn't understand how to season food!The service was shoddy, inexperienced and nothing special.

"This place came highly recommended to me for brunch by a friend who lives in Williamsburg. Seeing as how I only had one Sunday in the city I knew I had to make it count, and there's a MILLION options. Well, if you choose just one brunch, choose this one. I went with my friend and a fiancé last Sunday around 12:30, we were placed on a 30 minute wait. Everywhere in the city is busy so it wasn't even a big deal, it didn't feel like a half hour at all. When we were seated I ordered a mimosa and a shrimp Bloody Mary. The shrimp Bloody Mary was unreal! It's got two jumbo shrimp, a lemon, and an olive, with a cayenne (I think) rim. It was really hard to figure out what to order for brunch but I decided on a spinach and goat cheese croissant. It was served with sunny side up eggs, market greens, and I ordered a side of merguez sausage because I needed meat. I had never tried merguez (lamb) sausage but it was so good! I think I might even prefer it to traditional sausage. The croissant was light and flaky, perfectly baked. The goat cheese just melted in my mouth and went with the spinach perfectly. I dipped it in the yolk of my eggs and was in heaven.It's well priced, has a cute atmosphere, and everything tasted amazing. I can't say anything negative about the place, not to mention Williamsburg is such a cute part of Brooklyn to explore after you eat.",5.0
"Would have given this a five star review if it weren't for service.  The food was great!  However, service was very slow.  We were there on a Saturday morning for brunch so we expected a wait, but it was frustrating to see people who had arrived 15-20 minutes after us get seated and receive their food 15-20 minutes before us.  It took our waitress over 20 minutes just to take our order.The food was worth the wait, though.  The Croque Madame was delicious!",4.0
These pancakes are huge! It's a cake not a pancake. But trust me I could find a place to put them. Although next time this is a meal to be shared. It way too big for one person,5.0
"My low review is not for the food, but the service. Last time my girlfriend and I went to Le Barricou, she found a broken shard of glass in her omelet the size of an olive pit. I calmly and politely told our server about this the next time he checked on us, and he gave a very perfunctory apology and offered a free coffee as recompense. I thought this was a pretty lame response - he should have taken the omelet off our bill at the very least.During the same visit, we could hear loud yelling and violent crashing sounds coming from the kitchen, which was right behind our table. Not exactly a pleasant ambiance. Meanwhile, the woman seated next to us ordered a virgin bloody mary, and was brought one with vodka in it! This is a pretty serious error, particularly for an alcoholic customer.We've enjoyed the food at this place, but after the broken glass omelet (and lame nonpology from the waiter), we won't be returning.",1.0
"THEY USE AUNT JAMINA FOR THEIR PANCAKES! !! What tom foolery is this! No wonder we think it's good, it's freaking aunt jamina! A childhood favorite from most of our childhoods. And on their steak frites dish the quality of it has gone way down the drain!! (I get mash potatoes instead of fries). The mash potatoes taste like it came out of a box. I actually wouldn't be surprised if it was. Since finding out about the aunt jamina.",1.0
"meh. I've had better brunches. The food here is really hit or miss. I've been here twice & both times had an okay experience. The first time, I got the bacon benedict and they burnt my english muffin. The egg was cooked fine but the fact that my English muffin was burnt and the bacon was dry as hell didn't make my meal enjoyable. The home fries are not well seasoned and straight up taste like overcooked chunks of potato. You need a lot of salt & pepper and ketchup in order  for them to taste good. We also got the pancakes to share. At first glance, one will be amazed by how big they are. They're nothing like traditional pancakes. It only comes with two pancakes but it was the size of a cake when stacked. The strawberry butter it comes with is good, but waaay too little for those two ginormous pancakes. they also give you like 10 pieces of assorted berries. Really? Its only enough to accommodate the top pancake. The pancakes were okay. They're so thick that you could probably get full off of one pancake. I didn't like it because of how thick they are. It was so floury/starchy tasting, that after awhile, you just get sick of eating it. I came back a second time because my bf wanted to try this place (mostly because of the pancakes). I got the norwegian benedict this time & it was slightly better than the bacon one, but still didnt really stand out.My bf got the merquez & eggs and he thought it wasnt worth the $15. You literally get 2 eggs any style, 2 sausages & like a shit ton of fries. Legit 3/4 of his plate was fries. The sausages (which are lamb btw) had a really strong taste to it. He said that he still tasted it in his mouth hours later. As for the pancakes, he also thought they were okay.  It was not worth the 45 min wait for them. We also had to get the bottom pancake to go. We asked if we could get extra strawberry butter on it b/c as i mentioned, there are no toppings left for it, and the waiter said that they charge extra for it. They only really give you the size of a quarter amount of butter to begin with, so I was not about to pay like an extra $2 for that little amount of butter. All in all, I would probably not come back a third time. I've personally had a lot better brunches compared to this place, especially in the Williamsburg area.",2.0
"Le Barricou is the first place I bring anyone visiting the city for a beautiful twist on the standard city brunch. Obviously the pancakes are a must (but be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes while they bake), but everything on their bunch menu is amazing. Skip the standard mimosa and try one of their other cocktails- like the Green Beast (absinthe, lime, sugar, soda, & cucumber) or the Châtelaine (gin, elderflower liqueur, white wine, & pomegranate juice). With cooler weather approaching ask to be seated in the back near the fireplace!",5.0
"My $23 lamb ragout had 3 frugal, pieces of fatty lamb while the rest (90%) was filler (bread pieces?, greens and mushrooms)... if you're not going to put enough lamb in the dish to actually call it lamb ragout, then call it bread, greens, mushroom ragout with a hint of lamb. The red wine glass selection was very limited and tasted much cheaper than the price point it was set at. Lastly, the waitress was spacey and took forever to bring our horrible food out. One star for at least trying with the atmosphere/decor. No stars for food or service.",1.0
"My friends and I were really disappointed by the quality of the food. We went for dinner on Saturday evening. We started with escargot and the beet salad as appetizers. Both were under seasoned and the escargot didn't have the traditional butter and garlic sauce. My lamb ragout was a total miss. The meat was not braised and was fatty and so skimpy, there were literally just 4 pieces surrounded by a mound of mushrooms and fried dough(?) and under seasoned also. My friends coq au vin was also not good, no rich wine sauce and again no flavor. The chef doesn't understand how to season food!The service was shoddy, inexperienced and nothing special.

"I have been to brunch in Williamsburg quite a few times, but brunch at Le Barricou has been my favorite one so far. I came here with my boyfriend and our friends for brunch a few months back and we all really enjoyed everything about Le Barricou. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so my boyfriend and I arrived a little early and put our name down. The hostess said the wait would be approximately 30-40 minutes, but it was definitely a lot shorter than that.I really like the ambiance and decor at Le Barricou. It's got a warm, homey, cozy feeling and I especially love how in the back of the restaurant has a cozy couch by a warm fireplace. It's truly a unique and lovely waiting area. I also like that there's a roof above the dining area where the natural light just comes shining down.For drinks, my boyfriend had the Bellini and I had the Mimosa. Our daring and adventurous friends had the Shrimp Cocktail Bloody Mary. It looked really interesting and neat.Duck Confit Hash - I typically order Eggs Benedict when I am out for brunch. However, I read about the Duck Confit Hash on Yelp and it sounded really tempting so I ordered it. This was an excellent dish! The duck was really moist and delicious! I really liked the field greens too. This whole dish was very rustic and delightful.Steak & Eggs - My boyfriend ordered this. The black Angus hanger steak was cooked to perfection. Although, my boyfriend asked for medium well - the texture felt like medium rare which I liked. The texture was perfection.The pommes frites were decent, but I wished there was a crunch to it.Pate Sandwich - One of our friends ordered this. The sandwich was filled with house-made duck liver mousse on a toasted baguette with grainy mustard, cranberries, and cornichons. It was served in a bed of market greens. Our friend also ordered lamb meatballs which I thought were decent, but nothing too exciting.French Toast with fresh berries - Our friend's boyfriend ordered this and man, this was the best, best, best french toast ever!!! I had a small piece of it and it was amazing.It had a nice crunch to it that I haven't experienced in other French toasts that I have had before. Next time I return to Le Barricou, I will most definitely order the French toast.Bread Pudding - I'm not a fan of bread pudding, but this was really, really good. The bread pudding was moist, warm, and on point and just the combination of it with the ice cream was fantastic. We were all very happy with everything at Le Barricou. The food was phenomenal as well as the ambiance and service. This is definitely a restaurant worth returning back to.",4.0
"Sunday afternoon brunch:The host will tell you 20-45 min wait, if you are starving ask if there is seating at the bar, most likely there is. My father was too fancy to eat at the bar so we ordered some drinks, waited the 25 mins and looked at the menu. I was starving so I ordered the French toast, although I would have ordered the pancakes, however they took 45 minutes to cook. The French Toast: absolutely amazing loved it. It was delicious and wasn't too sweet and soggy like most. It had a glaze of sugar and came with fresh berries. If you are hungry order some eggs too. Steak and eggs: amazing and delicious.The atmosphere: waiters have the cutest outfits and are super friendly. It is extremely busy in there. I'm sure there are dull hours or certain hours that you can just walk in and get a seat, but haven't seen that yet. The restaurant has a vintage look. I love the small touch of small flowers on the table, adorbs.  If you have the time this place is definitely worth going to. Loved it :)",4.0
"Took my bf here for a birthday brunch the first time and already we loved this place. We've never been here for dinner, only during brunch/lunch and it has never disappointed us. I tried the burger, the chicken club sandwich, the duck confit, and the eggs Benedict. All were pretty good. A must try is the French Toast, they use a different kind of bread for it and it's just so good and I'm not a French toast person but I get this every time I go. They also have this really fluffy pancake, but if I were to choose, I'd get the French toast over the pancake.Overall, great place for lunch, not so sure about the weekends but hey, anywhere is crowded on weekends.",4.0
I've only been here for brunch and have yet to try the pancake but only because I'm stuck on the French toast. I don't know how they make it but it comes dusted with powdered sugar and a few berries. It's nearly carmelized so syrup isn't even necessary. Great coffee and mimosas as well.,5.0

Less is a good thing people.I've had dinner here twice.

"Had a lovely Tuesday evening dinner here. The front windows were open and a cool breeze wafted in. The Parisian music was whimsical as we sat and ate. You really couldn't ask for a better setting for mid-week meal. There were 4 of us, starting with a round of drinks, the artichoke appetizer which was amazing and then our main courses. My girlfriend and I had the burger, a staple and simply delicious. The pickled onions and beautiful brioche bun, just melt in your mouth. The fries were delicious as always, but a little on the salty side. My vodka martini was phenomenal. I often only come for brunch, but the past 3 times I've tried, it's been slammed by 11am. So I may just need to readjust towards dinner time. Our waitress was lovely, attentive but not hovering. Clearly a professional. I think Barricou is a great place to come for a lovely evening meal, especially mid-week when it is a little less crowded.

At one point, we were left waiting over half an hour for our one slice of cake to appear (though its sweet flavour helped to partly offset the bitter aftertaste of the service), and there was no explanation.Not sure if I'll return.

There was a huge room in the back. I ordered the duck hash, and it was quite good. The only complaint was that the potatoes were a bit soggy and not as crispy as I wanted them to be. However, there was a lot of duck in the dish, and I loved the pickled shallots on top of the fried egg. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their entree, though the lamb sausage dish was definitely lacking. Also, they have these huge fluffy pancakes that a lot of people seemed to order.

If I had to plan a quintessential brooklyn brunch for out-of-towners... it would be this. Yelp reviews don't disappoint, this place is worth the foodie praise. The plating was superb and the menu was creative and diverse but not overwhelming. I had the sunday brunch special: shrimp & grits (with creole spices and maplely bacon and eggs fried to perfection.

"I just moved to this neighborhood and we spent the first weekend looking for places that could potentially become our ""regulars."" I think Le Barricou might fit that bill! We walked in and instantly fell in love with the decor and ambiance. It's definitely got that hipster vibe, but more than that, it's incredibly delicate details and amazing service makes Le Barricou feel like home. The menu has plenty of great basic brunch items with a French twist. The duck confit hash is delicious - I can't really see duck confit on a menu and not order it. My boyf got the merguez and eggs - I really didn't think this would be a winner because it seemed a little plain for a brunch dish. However, the sausages were incredibly flavorful and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I think next we'll try the burger and croque madame. Also those pancakes looked ridonk so even though I'm not a sweets-in-the-morning person, I'd make an exception for those pillowy thangs.",4.0
"Bring lots of buddies to conquer the french pancakes! They're big enough to feed four people generously. And they taste pretty much like giant pancakes, with deliciously cripsy edges.

The back of the restaurant is really cute, with an upright piano, a little wood burning stove, and a shotgun and old portraits hanging on the walls.",4.0
"I'm definitely a fan of their pancakes! That item seems to be their main attraction. It takes about 30-40 min to make 2 so don't be surprised about the wait tiime. Ordered the benedict, it was yummy as well. The duck confit hash was a tad salty for me, but nonetheless good. Both came with salad & fries. The pancakes were the best thing we ordered. It comes with two, enough for 4! It was thick and so, so delicious! Came with fresh fruits on top and pink butter which made it even better. Best pancake I've had, hands down. Hear that  Hash House?! BEST pancake ever! The edges were crispy which made it drool-worthy! The best thing about these pancakes besides their taste was their price... they were only $10. Not each, but for the one order which came with 2 big & thick portions! Made it that much better! Craving these now. A must for brunch in Brooklyn!Regarding the service: We were the second customers in the restaurant. Seated promptly by the one waiter that was there. He wasn't welcoming, although he did bring us water right away. He took our order and seemed to be in a rush, not acknowledging that he heard the last order we said. Also, the menu does state the pancakes take long to make, but an update would've been nice. I mean he wasn't too busy to take a second to give us an update. I had to ask him to check on our order. Overall a good experience with this restaurant because of the food and their cute decor. Their bar area is well presented along with other cute decors around the clean restaurant",4.0

There was a huge room in the back. I ordered the duck hash, and it was quite good. The only complaint was that the potatoes were a bit soggy and not as crispy as I wanted them to be. However, there was a lot of duck in the dish, and I loved the pickled shallots on top of the fried egg. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their entree, though the lamb sausage dish was definitely lacking. Also, they have these huge fluffy pancakes that a lot of people seemed to order. Overall, a solid brunch experience.Servers were friendly, and prices were good. The interior is cute, and I definitely recommend checking this place out.",4.0
"I think during off hours, this place would be best to visit for a slow & relaxing meal. From a series of miscommunication with the staff, we waited 1.5 hours. But! I have to applaud the hostess Lela and our server Maya for going above and beyond to hear our feedback graciously and warmly.The food was fantastic. The atmosphere was perfect. If I had to plan a quintessential brooklyn brunch for out-of-towners... it would be this. Yelp reviews don't disappoint, this place is worth the foodie praise. The plating was superb and the menu was creative and diverse but not overwhelming. I had the sunday brunch special: shrimp & grits (with creole spices and maplely bacon and eggs fried to perfection. It was heavenly.Another thing worth mentioning is the half grapefruit with savory seasoning... weird but worth it (and good for your heart health!) Probably the best food, and shockingly so, was the fresh berry french toast. Good god this thing had the decadent delicious crunch of a creme brûlée!",5.0
"For a nice brunch this is a good place. Nice aesthetic, good service, and food that is more interesting than the standard brunch menu.The duck confit hash was delicious but is $16. The goat cheese and spinach croissant is also good if you're not trying to eat meat and the French toast is thick and comes with actual fruit.The coffee is worthwhile because it is bottomless for $2.50 though it still tasted burnt. Overall, a really pleasant place for brunch if you're trying to have a nice meal in Williamsburg. I was told they do not take  reservations for brunch",4.0
"I just moved to this neighborhood and we spent the first weekend looking for places that could potentially become our ""regulars."" I think Le Barricou might fit that bill! We walked in and instantly fell in love with the decor and ambiance. It's definitely got that hipster vibe, but more than that, it's incredibly delicate details and amazing service makes Le Barricou feel like home. The menu has plenty of great basic brunch items with a French twist. The duck confit hash is delicious - I can't really see duck confit on a menu and not order it. My boyf got the merguez and eggs - I really didn't think this would be a winner because it seemed a little plain for a brunch dish. However, the sausages were incredibly flavorful and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I think next we'll try the burger and croque madame. Also those pancakes looked ridonk so even though I'm not a sweets-in-the-morning person, I'd make an exception for those pillowy thangs.",4.0
"Bring lots of buddies to conquer the french pancakes! They're big enough to feed four people generously. And they taste pretty much like giant pancakes, with deliciously cripsy edges. The hand cut pommes frites were a good appetizer for the 45 minute wait for the pancakes to be cooked. The back of the restaurant is really cute, with an upright piano, a little wood burning stove, and a shotgun and old portraits hanging on the walls.",4.0
"I'm definitely a fan of their pancakes! That item seems to be their main attraction. It takes about 30-40 min to make 2 so don't be surprised about the wait tiime. Ordered the benedict, it was yummy as well. The duck confit hash was a tad salty for me, but nonetheless good. Both came with salad & fries. The pancakes were the best thing we ordered. It comes with two, enough for 4! It was thick and so, so delicious! Came with fresh fruits on top and pink butter which made it even better. Best pancake I've had, hands down. Hear that  Hash House?! BEST pancake ever! The edges were crispy which made it drool-worthy! The best thing about these pancakes besides their taste was their price... they were only $10. Not each, but for the one order which came with 2 big & thick portions! Made it that much better! Craving these now. A must for brunch in Brooklyn!Regarding the service: We were the second customers in the restaurant. Seated promptly by the one waiter that was there. He wasn't welcoming, although he did bring us water right away. He took our order and seemed to be in a rush, not acknowledging that he heard the last order we said. Also, the menu does state the pancakes take long to make, but an update would've been nice. I mean he wasn't too busy to take a second to give us an update. I had to ask him to check on our order. Overall a good experience with this restaurant because of the food and their cute decor. Their bar area is well presented along with other cute decors around the clean restaurant",4.0

"Splendid place for brunch with reasonably price food and portions. Hands down on the pancakes! Crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The pancakes can fill up two people and it takes 45 minutes to bake so be prepared for the wait! Aside from the pancakes, I ordered a pate sandwich made out of duck liver and I was not a big fan of it. It did not taste so fresh but the pancakes made up for the loss.On the side note, I was looking at the drinks menu and found out they have the old school way of drinking absinthe with the sugar cubes and water. I thought that was pretty interesting since you do not get to see it at a lot of places nowadays or at least the bars/restaurants I've been too.",4.0

"On Saturday morning, my boyfriend and I found ourselves looking a bit disheveled (I was still wearing my PJs a.k.a a sweatsuit) and desperately needing breakfast. And coffee. We wandered around East Williamsburg (where there are not a ton of brunch options) for a while before stumbling upon Le Barricou, which ended up being the perfect brunch spot. I was initially wary of walking into a nice restaurant like Le Barricou in my sweatsuit, but was quickly put at ease when I saw the mixed crowd - young people in similar attire, as well as casually-dressed families with babies and well-dressed hipsters. When we arrived at around 10:30, we were seated immediately, as only half the restaurant was full. My latte came quickly and was superb. We also ordered the Croque Madame and Grilled Chicken Club, which both came with a generous portion of pommes frites. The Croque Madame was the thickest that I've ever had and so filling. The chicken sandwich was great too, with the perfect combination of flavors and textures. We were very pleased.The restaurant is charming and elegant with rustic touches. The ambiance is relaxed and suitable for families, groups, and dates. The service was the only iffy part of the meal; our water glasses were replenished many times throughout the meal, but our waitress was not particularly friendly or attentive.When we left at around 11:30, the restaurant was full and there were people waiting outside for tables. Get here early to avoid the wait. Highly recommend!",4.0
"I had one of the best brunch experiences of my life here. The food, the service, and even the wait time was on point.We arrived around 11:30AM on Saturday.

We got the Croque Madame, Pancakes, and Eggs Norwegian. The fries that came with the Croque Madame were soooooo good.

"What happened to this place?! This used to be one of my go to Sunday brunch spots. The last time I went here (about a month ago) I ordered my typical stake and eggs.

By the time I was done with my meal I didn't want it anymore.Now, for my steak and eggs...wow...lets just say that my piece of steak was literally 4 small cut up pieces of steak. That was it. It seems like the restaurant is catering more to the malnourished hipsters in the area. When I used to order this same dish, I got a nice piece of steak, but it seems like those days are over.In the end, my meal didn't fill me up at all.

There's a distinctive taste in the homefries that was very enjoyable. I'm not too crazy about their vegetables omelettes; lack of flavor and textures.

"I LOVE the decor here.  It's a very laid-back large bistro, very charming.  There's a back room with a wood-burning fire and leather couches to warm up to in the fall.  In the winter that back room is frigid and I wish they'd close the door from that room to the dining area because of the frosty winds coming through. Anyways, on to the food.  The food is a solid 3-4 stars; nothing blew me away in terms of flavor, but the portion sizes and presentation were nice.  I'd ordered pan-roasted quail on a bed of brown-butter spinach and mashed potatoes, and I'd honestly never seen quail so small in my whole life.  It was also overcooked and a bit dry, which was disappointing.  They have nice beers and absinthe drips on the menu as well.  All good things.  Nice place for a date.",4.0
"4.5 starsIf Le Barricou was in Manhattan, I'd probably come here for brunch once a month. The eggs Benedict were the best eggs Benedict I've had in recent memory. Sometimes you get ones where the English muffin is tough or the hollandaise sauce tastes weird, but these were perfect. The potatoes that came on the side were yummy and not too salty/dry.I also split the pancakes, which could be more accurately described as fluffy pieces of bread with a crisp crust and berries on top. They were the complete opposite of the cloyingly sweet, soggy pancakes you get elsewhere and worth waiting until almost the end of our meal to come out.Between the three of us, one entree per person plus the pancakes to share was too much food for us to finish. Le Barricou is easily one of my favorite brunch spots in NYC and one that actually lives up to the hype.",4.0

We were told that pancake will take about 30min to bake and literally took around that time so was a bit long wait.

They did forget to move one plate of the salmon tartare over to our table and instead had thrown it out. We were bummed but it wasn't a big deal for us.

"I don't know how else to start with this review without first explaining that I love this place. I love the vibe at Le Barricou, the lighting, the furniture, the way it's packed for Sunday Brunch and filled with conversation. I love the way it gives me a lazy-Sunday feel, even though it's my least preferred day of the week. Notably, I love their pancackes and they way they make my tummy feel like it's being awarded with a noble prize. These pancackes are huge and the perfect mix of spongey and fluffy. They come with a delicious Strawberry butter that seems like it's home-made. I also enjoy their fries; salted, thin and crunchy. So much love and could you believe I've only come here for brunch? Next time, I'll try the dinner and let you know how it goes.",4.0
"I had a hard time deciding whether I tilted towards four or five stars on this one, but every tiny gripe I had was blown away in the face of a phenomenal croque madame, so here I am.With news of a 15-20 minute wait for brunch, my date and I had a seat at the bar. I picked the ""Blood and Sand"" cocktail, she went with a mimosa. My cocktail was strange, but enjoyable - I wasn't sure what to expect from the combination, but I liked it well enough. That said, it wasn't quite good enough to get again with a menu of such variety. The mimosa was heavy on the champagne and light on the orange juice - this was no complaint.As we sat and contemplated (just about everything on the menu looked good, choosing was hard!) we noticed that the space was really very nice - a bit of natural light from the skylight was a nice touch to an otherwise rustic-decorated space.On to the croque madame. I haven't had many, but out of what I've had, this has been the best. Cooked perfectly, balanced flawlessly, and the fries were a well-chosen (if slightly over-salted) compliment. A salad is also an option, but I'll leave the healthy eating to someone else. I'm told that of the norwegian eggs, one was perfectly poached while one strayed into soft-boiled territory, but both were delicious, with generous helpings of salmon. (I stole some home fries - I liked them even better than my french fries!)A few last notes: Service was courteous without being intrusive, which I always appreciate. Prices are beyond reasonable for the dishes we ordered and the quality of ingredients. And despite the vestigial ATM in the back, all major credit cards are now accepted.",5.0
"I went to Le Barricou for brunch on a Saturday around 12:30pm.  There was a bit of a wait, but totally worth it.  I had the Croque Madame which I HIGHLY recommend.  The bloody marys were delicious with just the right amount of horseradish for that signature ""kick.""  The space is tight and the bathroom is very dim, but I despite that I demand that you go for brunch.  Excellent - I'll be going again soon.",5.0
"This place was awesomely good and inexpensive for brunch here. I had gotten one of the round omelettes and an order of the french pancake. The pancakes are huge!

"I am so impressed by this restaurant.  They have everything that a francophobe would want on a menu.   Pate, Escargot, Bone Marrow, Steak Tartare, Tarts (Goat Cheese), Coq au Vin, Cote de Bouef, Mussels... good wine list... their dinner menu is amazing.  I was there for Brunch most recently, and will tell you:Whats good:- The apple omelette is so interesting and tasty.   - Their coffee is very good (the cafe latte was nice)- Their pate baguette is delicious, with pickles and beatiful, vibrant mustard tossed salad- Their poached eggs are cooked to perfection - I was so happy with their service- I love the ambiance of the place, and the cozy fireplace and couches as you wait for a table.Just one thing..- Their bloody mary is OK... I can sense its fresh, and its got the right 'pieces' in there... but I was underwhelmedIf you like classic staples of french cooking, coupled with a nice street in East Williamsburg, you will LOVE Le Barricou.  This place is a new favorite of mine in the area, and certainly one of my favorite french spots in the entire city.",4.0
"This place has the most fluffy pancake I've ever had in my life!! The portion of their pancake is huge, so make sure you guys have enough people to share it! It will not taste as good if you bring it home. The pancake and Norwegian Egg Benedict was delicious (especially the potato in the benedict!) Also, their homemade fresh squeezed grapefruit juice is highly recommended! Very fresh! We ordered a Bloody Mary because we saw almost every table  has it. Unfortunately, we weren't a fan of it.Overall, a great place for brunch and pancake lovers in Brooklyn! (Expect at least 30 mins wait time if you are going for a brunch on Saturday). We went in the afternoon (2 PM) and there was no wait time! Woohoo!",5.0

"The atmosphere is adorable, love the decor, the way the waiters are dressed and the music! Came here on a Sunday around 10:30 and got seated right away.. Ordered the eggs Norwegian and my friend got the eggs with spinach and a side of pancakes. I think I preferred my friends egg Benny with spinach more than my salmon because I'm used to smoked salmon instead of fresh salmon with my eggs.. (Fresh salmon with eggs Benny leaves a fishy taste in your mouth) The pancakes were cripsy on the outside and fluffy on the inside I really liked it but we couldn't finish it cause it's huge. Overall a solid place with friendly staff",4.0
"I don't know how else to start with this review without first explaining that I love this place. I love the vibe at Le Barricou, the lighting, the furniture, the way it's packed for Sunday Brunch and filled with conversation. I love the way it gives me a lazy-Sunday feel, even though it's my least preferred day of the week. Notably, I love their pancackes and they way they make my tummy feel like it's being awarded with a noble prize. These pancackes are huge and the perfect mix of spongey and fluffy. They come with a delicious Strawberry butter that seems like it's home-made. I also enjoy their fries; salted, thin and crunchy. So much love and could you believe I've only come here for brunch? Next time, I'll try the dinner and let you know how it goes.",4.0
"I had a hard time deciding whether I tilted towards four or five stars on this one, but every tiny gripe I had was blown away in the face of a phenomenal croque madame, so here I am.With news of a 15-20 minute wait for brunch, my date and I had a seat at the bar. I picked the ""Blood and Sand"" cocktail, she went with a mimosa. My cocktail was strange, but enjoyable - I wasn't sure what to expect from the combination, but I liked it well enough. That said, it wasn't quite good enough to get again with a menu of such variety. The mimosa was heavy on the champagne and light on the orange juice - this was no complaint.As we sat and contemplated (just about everything on the menu looked good, choosing was hard!) we noticed that the space was really very nice - a bit of natural light from the skylight was a nice touch to an otherwise rustic-decorated space.On to the croque madame. I haven't had many, but out of what I've had, this has been the best. Cooked perfectly, balanced flawlessly, and the fries were a well-chosen (if slightly over-salted) compliment. A salad is also an option, but I'll leave the healthy eating to someone else. I'm told that of the norwegian eggs, one was perfectly poached while one strayed into soft-boiled territory, but both were delicious, with generous helpings of salmon. (I stole some home fries - I liked them even better than my french fries!)A few last notes: Service was courteous without being intrusive, which I always appreciate. Prices are beyond reasonable for the dishes we ordered and the quality of ingredients. And despite the vestigial ATM in the back, all major credit cards are now accepted.",5.0
"I went to Le Barricou for brunch on a Saturday around 12:30pm.  There was a bit of a wait, but totally worth it.  I had the Croque Madame which I HIGHLY recommend.  The bloody marys were delicious with just the right amount of horseradish for that signature ""kick.""  The space is tight and the bathroom is very dim, but I despite that I demand that you go for brunch.  Excellent - I'll be going again soon.",5.0
"This place was awesomely good and inexpensive for brunch here. I had gotten one of the round omelettes and an order of the french pancake. The pancakes are huge!

"This is one of my favourite brunch spots in Williamsburg. It's always packed on Sundays and you might need to wait for a table, but not more than 10-15 minutes.

"Dined here for Grand Street Restaurant Week. Hit or miss. Great space with tall ceilings, rustic interiors and a welcoming bar.

The soup du jour of Cauliflower Bisque was bland and needed seasoning (no salt and pepper anywhere to be found) but the French Onion Soup was damn near perfect. The Mac & Cheese way buttery and not enough cheese. But the Coq Au Vin one of the best things I have had in awhile. The dessert tart to finish was dreadful.

But I bit into the fries and my mouth was full of whatever oil it was.  After eating few, I felt sick with oil.  The oil was so excessive, it soaked my burger bun and it wouldn't even dip in ketchup. Okay fries, I can frog vie but what have me give two stars is this girl waitress in her brown hair.  Came to the bar and took out plastic container with shrimp in them and just grabbed two with bare hand and ate them ""discretely"" when bartender was gone. I think he was the manager or something, but I also saw a guy who was dressed up a little and maybe he is the manager.  She wasn't mean or anything, but I just couldn't believe that she thinks it's okay to put her hand in the container where majority of the shrimp is going to be served to customers.  If that whole container full of shrimp was hers, then I apologize, but that was disgusting.  She touched bills, computer screen, and brought my food out, and now she's going to slip two shrimps into her mouth....

"Never again, I'm giving this place one star primarily for the awful service. My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night and we were seated right away. We placed our order for drinks - beer and a glass of wine - and these didn't arrive at the table for 15 minutes. The food took over an hour to arrive. After about an hour my boyfriend asked the waitress if it was coming, she said she would need to check on it. Fifteen minutes later we got our food. The waitress was unapologetic.I ordered the lamb ragout. The portion was very small and there were five tiny pieces of lamb in the entire dish - absurd for a $23 price tag. Flavor overall was very good though. My boyfriend ordered the coq au vin and everything except the chicken was lukewarm. The waitress never came to our table to ask how the food was.After all of this the waitress took two drinks off of the bill but never mentioned the service or apologized.

"My family and I visited Le Barricou last winter for a private event. It takes a lot for me to come to Brooklyn, so I was mentally prepared for the worst - despite the glowing Yelp reviews for the restaurant.First of all, it was shockingly easy to find parking on Grand Street ... though that may have had more to do with the blizzard outside than anything else. But we found a metered spot right in front of the restaurant, so I can't really complain.We were ushered into the back room, where our small ceremony space was all set up & ready to go. The room was ours for the evening, with one caveat: the only bathroom in the restaurant was in the back of the ""private"" room. So, for having a reserved room for a private event, it was very inconvenient to have guests walking through our group & opening the swinging door to get to the bathroom every few minutes.When my cousins were reserving the room, we were asked to give our menu choices a week or two in advance, so they would have enough time to prepare the meals and have them available after the short ceremony. Yet, strangely enough, they didn't begin to prepare the food until AFTER the ceremony was over. The waiters came in and asked, ""So we should start the food now?"" Umm, shouldn't you have started it an hour ago when we all arrived? So, we waited in our seats for an hour while the kitchen began to cook our meals.The food - when it did eventually come - was amazing. And I guess this would be where the glowing reviews are coming from. I ordered the Le Barricou Salad, the Skate Meuniere, and the Apple Tart for dessert. Someone at our table ordered the Brussels Sprouts as a side dish, so we all tried that as well. The salad was a very generous portion - probably enough for a meal in itself if I wasn't already so hungry! I loved the fresh green beans & the bacon. Even the croutons were exceptional. I ended up sharing my salad with my cousin, because I knew I had two more dishes coming.The Skate Meuniere was outstanding. It was light & buttery, with more fresh green beans & capers, and the white wine & lemon sauce was unbelievable. The fish filet itself was bigger than I thought it would be, but it was so delicious that it disappeared in an embarrassingly short amount of time. And the Brussels Sprouts were exactly how I like them - roasted & slightly crunchy. Really tasty.The Apple Tart was perfect. I think it was more ... constructed? ... than I thought it would be. It arrived as a little masterpiece: a flaky tart shell filled with tiny sweet cubes of apple, drizzled with a light caramel sauce. It was warm & sweet, and the ice cream was a perfect addition. Like an organized, yummy apple pie.All in all, I have mixed emotions about our experience. I really enjoyed the meal we had at Le Barricou, but I wasn't too pleased with the service or the organization/coordination of our ""private"" event. The food is fantastic, and I'd consider coming again for the meal alone, but I would probably look elsewhere if I was planning something bigger. À la prochaine, Le Barricou ...",3.0

"Great Brunch spot delicious food attentive service really the only complaint I had today I had lipstick on my glass but it was cool they got me another one and it was all good.     We order the Caramelize French Toast: wow how they make bread taste so good sweet crispy a little hard to cut but out of this world.    The Eggs Benedict were fantastic, spot on hollandaise perfect pouch eggs I had them with French Fries instead cause they look good on the next table.     The Pancakes were okay but that's because I already had the best french pancakes in the USA so in comparison this came out lacking but they were good but not the best I sample.      Overall I had an amazing meal @ Le Barricou is worth the trip to Brooklyn...",5.0
"Never again, I'm giving this place one star primarily for the awful service. My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night and we were seated right away. We placed our order for drinks - beer and a glass of wine - and these didn't arrive at the table for 15 minutes. The food took over an hour to arrive. After about an hour my boyfriend asked the waitress if it was coming, she said she would need to check on it. Fifteen minutes later we got our food. The waitress was unapologetic.I ordered the lamb ragout. The portion was very small and there were five tiny pieces of lamb in the entire dish - absurd for a $23 price tag. Flavor overall was very good though. My boyfriend ordered the coq au vin and everything except the chicken was lukewarm. The waitress never came to our table to ask how the food was.After all of this the waitress took two drinks off of the bill but never mentioned the service or apologized. Needless to say we won't be going back.",1.0
"One of my favorite french places in the neighborhood! Very adorable atmosphere. Perfect for either a late night bite, a cute date spot, or a sunday girls brunch.The service is great and everyone is super nice. As for the food..omg what a treat. Their escargo is like butter, melts in your mouth. The bone marrow delicious, as well as the liver pate. Their steak tartare was decent but I'm not really a big fan of steak tartare anyway. As for main course, I have had the porterhouse, and it was cooked to perfection. Just the in past 2 months I've been to this place 3 times. That says a lot ! Definitely recommended!",5.0

"I've come here for a few times for brunch. Just beware: if you come anytime after 11am there will DEFINITELY be a wait, as this place is incredibly popular. I'm a big fan of their French Toast, if you are skeptical on what to get, but really their entire brunch menu is fantastic. The decor is really homey, and it actually gets pretty big towards the back of the restaurant, with a faux fireplace and a small couch located in the back by the bathrooms. It gets a bit tight on space in the middle of the restaurant, but they do their best.",4.0
"My family and I visited Le Barricou last winter for a private event. It takes a lot for me to come to Brooklyn, so I was mentally prepared for the worst - despite the glowing Yelp reviews for the restaurant.First of all, it was shockingly easy to find parking on Grand Street ... though that may have had more to do with the blizzard outside than anything else. But we found a metered spot right in front of the restaurant, so I can't really complain.We were ushered into the back room, where our small ceremony space was all set up & ready to go. The room was ours for the evening, with one caveat: the only bathroom in the restaurant was in the back of the ""private"" room. So, for having a reserved room for a private event, it was very inconvenient to have guests walking through our group & opening the swinging door to get to the bathroom every few minutes.When my cousins were reserving the room, we were asked to give our menu choices a week or two in advance, so they would have enough time to prepare the meals and have them available after the short ceremony. Yet, strangely enough, they didn't begin to prepare the food until AFTER the ceremony was over. The waiters came in and asked, ""So we should start the food now?"" Umm, shouldn't you have started it an hour ago when we all arrived? So, we waited in our seats for an hour while the kitchen began to cook our meals.The food - when it did eventually come - was amazing. And I guess this would be where the glowing reviews are coming from. I ordered the Le Barricou Salad, the Skate Meuniere, and the Apple Tart for dessert.

"Le Barricou has two different types of bloody Mary's, one is a shrimp cocktail which had two deveined shrimp, green olive, sweet pickled style green bean and the other is a classic which has everything except the shrimp. They were delicious (not too spicy, which I would have preferred), would def recommend the shrimp one.I ordered a Duck Confit Hash w/ two sunny side eggs overtop and substituted the salad for crunchy potatoes. Was what you'd expect for this type of dish and of an average taste. They didn't do anything special with it but had good proportions.As a second dish, I was going to have the Pancakes, but it takes 45 mins to prep since they bake them in the oven. Instead I tasted the French Toast, and it was unlike any I've ever had before. Was very crunchy on the outside yet soft within. They supplied a minimal amount of strawberries and blueberries but was definitely a dish I would have again.",4.0

"BRUNCH:1. Yaaas. I love this place! They have a great brunch menu and I've never waited for longer than approx 20 mins for a table. Full discretion: I've only come here with my boyfriend so we always only wait for a table for 2, which is infinitely easier to seat than a larger party. 2. If you like to have a ginormous brunch (no judgment here!) go for the Croque Madame. It's huge, has carbs, ham (a step away from bacon!) and you can even choose to get your starches in there if you opt for the fries on the side. The fries here, if you've never had, you MUST. They're airy, crispy, and not overwhelming. I usually can't eat a whole side serving of fries, but I finish everything on my plate whenever I'm in the mood to just dig into a huge whooping meal. If you're looking for something lighter, I'd recommend the benedict, which is your typical fare, nothing extremely great, but their salad is also fresh, crispy and delicious, highly recommend!! They also have really good coffee, I don't know why, it just always feel good to have a cup of cold brew or even hot, and the hot coffee is constantly being refilled, yay!DINNER:So, to be fair, the only time I've ever gone to dinner here is for Valentine's Day, which was pretty good, but...interesting. We had an amusee` that was oyster--I'm not a huge fan of it but it was pretty good, according to my boyfriend. I thought it was O-K. I had lamb for my entree, and it came with a side of creamy mashed potatoes. It was delicious and also tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny. Sorry, not enough 'tiny' in the world to describe how hungry I still was after the meal. There was definitely more bone than meat. I'm also completely aware that lamb is usually small, meat-to-bone ratio wise, but damn. The dessert, in my opinion was the most delicious part of that Valentine's Day meal. It was this wondrous maple-bourbon(? not completely 100% on the bourbon) cupcake with icing, and a cute bacon wheel as garnish. The salty bacon with the sweet icing + cake combo is something I still dream about.",4.0

"Delightful brunch spot! I came here with a friend on a Sunday morning. We had a short wait. I think the best thing about this restaurant is the ambiance - it's the perfect little Brooklyn brunch spot. Tiny details in the decor make it incredibly pleasant. For example, the drinking water is served in tiny mason jars. That may sound obnoxious, but trust me this place is charming.I had their Eggs Florentine. I love poached eggs on English muffins, and this one was a solid entry in the category. The hollandaise was buttery but not oily, and the eggs were just right. The prices aren't cheap (I paid about $14 for my Florentine, which is comparable for the area but a lot considering what you're getting). That said, I would totally come here again with a friend if I were in the area. I'm giving it four stars because although the food was good, it wasn't earth-shattering.The only thing I'd note is that it was pretty crowded. If you're looking to do a long, lazy, 3-hour brunch with multiple cocktails, I don't know if this would be your best bet. But then again, many places are crowded, so...",4.0

Standard eggs benedict or norwegian, a couple of good omelets and eggs bakes, and more importantly the most délicieux breakfast sandwich (spinach, egg, goat cheese on a croissant) that I've ever had. THIS THING BUMPS IT TO 5 STARS. I would pay $15 but it's only $9.50. The place has a nice vibe and great service with no attitude. Cocktail menu is a perfect fit and they actually know how to make a good bloody mary.

"It's very Brooklyn meets Par-ri.  Ambiance is on point, good french grub.  I love all the little details, the antique stuff, the bar itself, the field flowers on the tables.  They attained perfect ""champagne"" lighting almost every time I've been there.  Good portions.  Chef loves his salt sometimes... all around sound spot.   Date night honorable mention.",4.0
"Very cute place. Decor and vibe are cool. I've been a few times, for brunch and also for dinner, and always had good experiences. They make excellent drinks at the bar, especially very nice lemonade if you're not a drinker, and the food is very good, if overpriced. I love the burger and the artichoke appetizer on the dinner menu. Only drawback is the waitstaff, not the most friendly bunch but they're efficient.

My two friends got there a few minutes before we did but we were seated right away.We ordered the steak and eggs, eggs norwegian, croque madame, duck confit hash, and pancakes to share.

"Went here for brunch today -- SO cute! Arrived around 1pm, expected a gnarly wait, but was told that we'd have a table available for 3 within 20 min. Not bad! Had a delicious bellini at the bar while we waited. Even before finishing our cocktails we were whisked away to the cute little ""outdoor/patio"" area which was adorned with vintage knick knacks. Very homey. I had the duck confit hash. Fairly bomb. My friends had the lamb sausage and the special shrimp and grits. Also pretty good. I did love the menu though -- there were tons of great options. I'll be back mostly because I live in the area, it's walking distance, and it's cute -- but not because the food was life-alteringly good. Overall cute place to take friends from out of town.",4.0

"Awesome French brunch place in Williamsburg with lots of different options. We came here for brunch on a Wednesday, so there was no wait at all and we were able to sit wherever we wanted. My friends got the goat cheese crossaints and I opted for the sausage, eggs, and frites. The portions were generous, and my plate was full with salad, eggs, frites, and sausages! The sausages were delicous and the frites were great - probably some of the best frites I've had for lunch. I tried the goat cheese crossaints, which were rather tasty too, but a little too healthy for me.We had to wait a really long time for our food even though the place was empty. The waitress apologized and said it was because the health inspectors came while they were making our orders (I guess that's what happens when you try to go to brunch on a weekday...). We were on vacation and nothing better to do anyways, so it wasn't a big deal. I'm not sure how busy it is on the weekends for brunch, but I would definitely come back for brunch again!",4.0
"Came here Saturday for brunch around 12pm with a group of 10 and they were able to set up a table in a decent amount of time. I had the croque Madame $13, coffee $2.50, and shared pancakes with 4 other people $10. The portions are huge!!!!  Croque Madame was ok/good. It comes with fries or salad so I chose fries. Fries are pretty good. Coffee was coffee. Nothing special just free refills. The pancakes are massive. It's basically a giant 2 layer cake with fruit and syrup. It's very thick and dense. I thought it was ok, not as good as everyone says it to be. It also takes an extremely long time to make so while everyone else is eating you'll be waiting for it to come out if that's all you order.  There's street parking all around the area.",4.0

"One of my favorite brunch places in brooklyn. Although I only ever tried about 3 dishes here ( duck confit, florentine benedict and a sandwich from their in between menu). But my ultimate favorite is the duck confit hash! Loads of duck meat mixed with potatoes. A side salad and a fried egg. So yum and filling. We also always order a side of their home fries that are deliciously cooked in butter and garlic. So fattening and delicious! And their fries are nice and crispy too!Another reason why i like this place so much is because there's always a parking spot available with a half a block. Where can you even get that in Brooklyn nowadays!?Also, during the colder temps, they have a fireplace all the way in the back that you can sit around in ( if seats are available) while you wait for your table.",4.0

"Came here with the family for brunch. I had the vegetarian omelette w/ home fries & small salad on the side. Delicious. The mushrooms, caramelized onions, and cheese was a great mix. Bro had the steak & eggs w/ fries. Eggs came over easy which at 1st bro didn't want but I told him to try it and he liked it. There wasn't much steak on the plate though. Fries were good but could be better. Mommy had the salad. One thing that stood out about the salad was the pickled onion. That was surprisingly good. The pancakes were very good & I WILL be coming back here for them. They had fruits & a strawberry butter on it. There were 3 of us & we still ended up taking 1/4 of it home. Bloody Mary was very good but they ran out of shrimp so that sucked. Coffee was decent. The wait to be seated took a while & the wait for the food took even longer.",4.0
A friend highly recommended this place for brunch. Well let me tell ya - it's tha bombdiggity! I had the eggs benedict and my friend had the duck confit.. we literally licked our plates clean!

"To be quite honest, I don't think I'll ever come back to the restaurant again. There are quite a few pros of going to this restaurant. They include:- Location is nice. Quick access from the trains (less than a 5 minute walk)- Food is served in a timely manner- The decor of this restaurant is so pretty- The price is reasonable- The pomme frites are tasty. They have maple syrup on them.So why does Gabi A. only give two stars for this seemingly charming brunch spot?- I felt SO sick after eating the food here. They put WAY too much butter when they cook. Don't get me wrong, I am a strong believer and lover of this much scorned dairy product (I cook with butter all the time...SHHH!! Don't let anybody know...) they don't use butter, they ABUSE it. Beyond Paula Deen use of butter. My croque madame was a beautiful sandwich of gruyere and ham topped with an egg. It was delicious upon first bite but that was about it. The combo of excess gruyere + untasty ham + my bread dripping in butter was just too heavy for me. The food has so much fat content here that I had stomach upset for the next 2 days. Thanks Le Barricou.- My significant other ordered the duck confit hash that almost had a medicinal taste and quality to it. I would pass on this.- The waitress was a snob-ka-bob. She had this strange accent that I think she was using on purpose and got offended when I asked her if the food was French-Canadian. ***Insert weird faux-French accent here*** ""No. No. No. The food we serve here is French! It is not Canadian."" Well lady, I've been to France, and I've been to Canada and I must say your portions size and flavors are more Canadian than anything.",2.0

"To be quite honest, I don't think I'll ever come back to the restaurant again. There are quite a few pros of going to this restaurant. They include:- Location is nice. Quick access from the trains (less than a 5 minute walk)- Food is served in a timely manner- The decor of this restaurant is so pretty- The price is reasonable- The pomme frites are tasty. They have maple syrup on them.So why does Gabi A. only give two stars for this seemingly charming brunch spot?- I felt SO sick after eating the food here. They put WAY too much butter when they cook. Don't get me wrong, I am a strong believer and lover of this much scorned dairy product (I cook with butter all the time...SHHH!! Don't let anybody know...) they don't use butter, they ABUSE it. Beyond Paula Deen use of butter. My croque madame was a beautiful sandwich of gruyere and ham topped with an egg. It was delicious upon first bite but that was about it. The combo of excess gruyere + untasty ham + my bread dripping in butter was just too heavy for me. The food has so much fat content here that I had stomach upset for the next 2 days. Thanks Le Barricou.- My significant other ordered the duck confit hash that almost had a medicinal taste and quality to it. I would pass on this.- The waitress was a snob-ka-bob. She had this strange accent that I think she was using on purpose and got offended when I asked her if the food was French-Canadian. ***Insert weird faux-French accent here*** ""No. No. No. The food we serve here is French! It is not Canadian."" Well lady, I've been to France, and I've been to Canada and I must say your portions size and flavors are more Canadian than anything.",2.0
You come for the atmosphere.  Unfortunately the chicken was mushy and the steak was a bit dry.It is a date place but I am sure you will find a love connection here.  There is a small space in the back for private parties.,3.0
"Tried the Croque Madame and ordered a side of grapefruit juice. They gave a lot of food. Can't complain about the portion. I wish they would give more juice though. My friend ordered the omelette auvergnate and a bellini. She said the omelette was too cheesy, but it was good aside from that. More than friendly with the portion. Fries was awesome. French onion soup was also good, but Café Triskell honestly makes it better.",3.0
"Came here on a Sunday around midday and were seated after a 30 minutes wait for a table for 2, ""standard for most brunch places in NY,"" we thought. We were seated in the middle of 2 empty tables, and therein lies the problem- these tables were left empty for a good 30 minutes before they seated couples who we crossed outside, which leads me to believe that they 1) create their own wait/hype; 2) do not have enough kitchen space/staff to accommodate full capacity; or, 3) they are extremely slow at seating people. Nevertheless, the restaurant itself has a quaint vintage feel, and I appreciated the wallpaper collage of French newspapers, as well as the mini digestif glass with flowers on each table. Service was okay, save for our waiter's mumbling; although the restaurant was not particularly loud, we couldn't make out a word he said and assumed he asked for our order.I ordered the spinach and goat cheese croissant, and the BF got the duck confit hash, both of which came with sunny side up eggs and greens. Both dishes were good and we welcomed the variety from the brunch items you typically get in NY. I would definitely order the croissant again, and although delicious, the duck hash was a tad bit too savory and got sickening halfway in. BF also tried the bloody mary but wasn't inclined to drink more than half, too, but that was probably more to do with our palate than the drink itself; other patrons seemed to really enjoy theirs! I'm curious to try Le Barricou for dinner, and I would probably return for brunch- more for the space and trip to Williamsburg, than for the food.",3.0

"This place got ranked recently as ""Best brunch"" in Brooklyn and now it's hard to get a table.  Having said that our wait was only around 20 minutes on a Saturday brunch hour so you never know.The theme is French but they make a mean Bloody Mary that includes chunks of veggies, green olives and fresh shrimp in a Mason jar.  It was sooooo good.I had their duck confit (duck confit is slow cooked using the leg of a duck) and it was excellent.  I heard the lamb sausage is also great.The inside really does feel like an old French cafe that you would see in Paris.  It is a very old Brooklyn building.",5.0

The special salad with beets and a yogurt creamy sauce was delicious. He loved the Steak Frites and my grilled shrimp special was delicious. Amazing bread. Service is pretty good, maybe a little slow, but nothing that deterred from the experience. We brought my parents back with us a week later and they are still raving about the Coq Au Vin!

"Beautiful restaurant! Big points to whoever the designer was. Have been here 3-4 times. The burger is delicious, the fois gras is okay. I would not recommend the tartare, it is not prepared in a traditional manner and I think they put either parmesan cheese or mayonnaise in mine. The rest of the menu is actually very good though.Only complaint: The service. The waitstaff here is extremely uptight and they come to your table too much, killing the mood.

"Cozy little place located in Williamsburg. I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon, but we were still able to order from the breakfast menu (so pretty much brunch on a weekday). Love the vintage/classy/old-fashioned decor inside. There's metered parking right outside, but you can find free street parking on the neighboring streets.I ordered the merquez and eggs. They give you 4 small lamb sausages and 2 sunny side-up eggs. The sausages weren't spicy at all, contrary to what the menu says. The fries on the side were pretty addictive. A bunch of my friends ordered the eggs benedict with ham. It looked scrumptious and I'll be sure to try it next time!Their french toast is really awesome. It's kind of fried and glazed/caramelized all around. It comes with fresh blueberries and strawberries. It's definitely worth trying (and sharing because it's pretty big). Our server, Felicia, was super friendly and perky. Ask about their specials!",4.0

"Amazing brunch place. We had egg florentines, french toast and spinach & goat cheese croissant, each dish was equally good.

"I would say it's a 3 1/2.  My usual short and sweet. I had dinner last night and it was nice.

The service was nice (really just nice). At one point the server seemed a little gloomy but it was probably a tough day. No judgement here. To be given a  4 stars the restaurant had to at least exceeded some of my expectations in more than one element. The ambiance was nice but when do you find a restaurant in Williamsburg that's not. I haven't found one yet. Any who, the decorum was very warm and cozy. I liked it.",3.0

I by stroke of luck looked at the fries as they came out and asked ""are these fried in peanut oil"" while my son reached for one. The server who delivered the food not our waitress replied ""yes they are"". Needless to say I will not be back. Note to this establishment, put a notice on your menu before you kill someone!",2.0

They BETTER be amazing if they take that long and 2. ""Ain't nobody got time for that"" on the one Sunday when our schedule was jammed pack! The ambiance of the restaurant was really great! It had an old time but hip feel to it with all the wood chairs, tables, floors and walls. I had such a great time and I cannot wait to return...shall we say tomorrow...*hmmmmm* *twiddles thumbs*",5.0
"Beautiful restaurant! Big points to whoever the designer was. Have been here 3-4 times. The burger is delicious, the fois gras is okay. I would not recommend the tartare, it is not prepared in a traditional manner and I think they put either parmesan cheese or mayonnaise in mine. The rest of the menu is actually very good though.Only complaint: The service. The waitstaff here is extremely uptight and they come to your table too much, killing the mood. It would be nice if they would just back off a little. It feels like you are more with the waiters than your date.",3.0
"Cozy little place located in Williamsburg. I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon, but we were still able to order from the breakfast menu (so pretty much brunch on a weekday). Love the vintage/classy/old-fashioned decor inside. There's metered parking right outside, but you can find free street parking on the neighboring streets.I ordered the merquez and eggs. They give you 4 small lamb sausages and 2 sunny side-up eggs. The sausages weren't spicy at all, contrary to what the menu says. The fries on the side were pretty addictive. A bunch of my friends ordered the eggs benedict with ham. It looked scrumptious and I'll be sure to try it next time!Their french toast is really awesome. It's kind of fried and glazed/caramelized all around. It comes with fresh blueberries and strawberries. It's definitely worth trying (and sharing because it's pretty big). Our server, Felicia, was super friendly and perky. Ask about their specials!",4.0
This place gets rammed on the weekend for brunch so arrive early! Had a great experience here. I went for the apple fritatta that was usual and delicious! Would recommend the spinach and goats cheese croissant as well!,4.0
"The best breakfast/brunch my husband and I had in a hole week of visiting new places every day. The food is delicious, the people is nice and are effective even with a full place going. The BEST PANCAKES EVER! The coffee is delicious. You won't regret going :)",5.0
"Amazing brunch place. We had egg florentines, french toast and spinach & goat cheese croissant, each dish was equally good. Home fries were delicious, we were tempted enough to order them on the side also. Deducting one star for the cocktails, I had a Mexican Firing Squad which turned out to be very strong. All in all a highly recommended brunch place.",4.0
"I would say it's a 3 1/2.  My usual short and sweet. I had dinner last night and it was nice. We had the risotto and the coq au vin( I hope I spelled it right) it was tasty but since I'm a big eater it may have not been enough for me. It was surely close enough. The service was nice (really just nice). At one point the server seemed a little gloomy but it was probably a tough day. No judgement here. To be given a  4 stars the restaurant had to at least exceeded some of my expectations in more than one element. The ambiance was nice but when do you find a restaurant in Williamsburg that's not. I haven't found one yet. Any who, the decorum was very warm and cozy. I liked it.",3.0
"The decor was nice and the food was good but if you have a peanut allergy stay away from this place. The fries and God only knows what else is fried in peanut oil. The waitress never told us and it's not on the menu. My son and I have anaphylaxis to peanuts and this place was 2 seconds from killing us! I by stroke of luck looked at the fries as they came out and asked ""are these fried in peanut oil"" while my son reached for one. The server who delivered the food not our waitress replied ""yes they are"". Needless to say I will not be back. Note to this establishment, put a notice on your menu before you kill someone!",2.0
Thr only reason I don't give them 5 stars are due to the waiting list and tables are very small.. chairs are uncomfortable but the 3 stars all goes to the pancake!! The only reason why we go here is just for the pancakes!!!! Don't try anything else.,3.0
"Another great dinner: Duck sausage is a savory song on the tongue, like a yummy wonton making love to your taste buds, so good! Then the escargot always a winner, beet salad & cuttlefish special very good. Skate meuniere (sp?) was a little bland. Service a little off but forgivable very busy tonight. On a Monday no less! Drinks were tasty & strong.",4.0
"Comment dit-on perfect en francais?Le Barricou, bien sur!Excellent venue for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Definitely brought out my inner francophile! The menu has your favorites (pancakes, steak, eggs benedict)...but then it also has some slight twists on your plats favorits: the spinach and goat cheese croissant, the dock confit hash...I of course ordered the spinach and goat cheese croissant (also came with a small side salad and two sunny side up eggs) and an  Iced Coffee. Sir Rus ordered the hash and a side of toast with yummy jam.I loved my dish! The spinach tasted so freakin fresh. Do they grow it out back?It was sauteed very lightly, which somehow amplified it's flavor.My iced coffee was served in a mason jar, so how could I not like it?Rus' dish also looked terrific, but he ate is so fast that I didn't have a chance to try it. Womp womp.The air of this place is awesome. I wonder if places en Paris are really like this?I'll find out one day. Until then, Le Barricou...you dah beez neez.Oh, just some quick FYIs:Be prepared to sit community style.Also, the wait might seem long, but we got in pretty quickly.Staff is attentive and very nice.",4.0
This review is about two different occasions.. All in one week! I have been coming to this place for some time now but I kind of forgot about my baby and have been very distant (I'm sorry) .. I dined in last Sunday 7/26 and on Saturday 8/3.. Both times and both great experiences.. On the 26th we decided to eat at the bar since there was a little bit of a wait.. I have never eaten at a bar and was very weary of it but I was so hungry I decided to give it a shot.. Peter was very helpful and made this experience enjoyable for me.. Great addition to the establishment! .. The food and service was so amazing I decided to bring my mom and sister the following week.. Our server was named Gregory! A gentleman and a scholar I might say. Very helpful and catered to all my picky needs.. Great experience!,5.0

"I have been to Le Barricou 5-10 times all for brunch. The menu is simple and very manageable to navigate.  I have not had a dish yet that I wouldn't order again. The omlets, goat cheese and spinach croissant, french toast, and oversized pancakes are all favorites. The duck confit hash and the occasional special salmon hash are really different & hearty must trys but the croque madame is amazing but not for the health conscious. The Bloody Marys are the best this side of New Orleans. BUT...for some strange reason the hostesses are always LOST. There has not been a time where they aren't looking at the at the wait list like a Sudoku puzzle. Mad confused.  The wait is always longer than it should be. After waiting for 30-60 minutes don't be surprised to see empty tables everywhere as you're finally ushered to your table. Its a shame because the service is otherwise pretty good and the bar staff is amazing.",4.0

"Brunch at a popular hangout in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long for a table but when we went in, there were still many free tables. I think their strategy is to make you sit at the bar first, even if there is tables ready so it will force you to order a drink to increase the bill! I caved and ordered a mimosa. Anyways, after about 5 minutes, we got a table.We got a few recommends: Croque Madame - French country bread with melted gruyere cheese, Black Forest ham & topped with sunny side egg. Served with hand cut pommes frites. French pancakes - Berries, strawberry butter, pure maple syrup. Le Barricou sandwich - chicken with pickled red onions, radishes, feta-caper mayonnaise.The pancake was the most amazing plate, had another one of my food organism. It was freshly baked instead of pan cooked, so it is like a freshly baked cake... soft and fluffy. The portion was huge, the 3 of us could not finish it.",4.0
"Been here twice now, and it's better each time. We had the eggs Norwegian and it was quality. But the winner was their French toast!

"Another delicious, super cute French restaurant in Williamsburg. Went there last night for dinner with a group of 10 (including a baby) for a friend's birthday. The food was excellent.

Chicken fell off the bone (and I normally don't order chicken dishes). The pork belly was also fabulous and tangy.

"Delicious as f---!! For a cute French brunch place, the wait around prime brunch time (12 - 2pm) for a group of 3 was not too terrible. We were seated by the hostess in about 25 minutes and our server was really prompt about refilling the water and taking our order. They had a couple of brunch specials that were a spin off of their traditional menu items. They had a Cajun version of one of their omelets, but quite frankly, I was distracted by the Eggs Benedict as I always am. :)My friend ordered the apple frittata, which was really delicious. It was both savory and sweet. Unfortunately, his entree didn't come with the AMAZING home fries that came with our eggs Benedict. They were possibly the best home fries I've ever had - really well-seasoned and just the right texture. Crispy, golden on the outside and soft on the inside. I'm having a hard time coping with these home fries withdrawals. The eggs and salad were pretty good - standard of a typical brunch spot in the area.

"Arrived at 9:30 p.m. on a Saturday and there was a ~15 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar, so no wait.

But after that 10 minutes, the service was pretty good. Unfortunately...all the things that we wanted on the menu were ""out"", which included the bone marrow, IPA, and one of the oyster options. We decided on the baby beet salad and the ""other"" oysters. The oysters were really fresh and the baby beet salad had an interesting twist in the cumin, yogurt sauce combination. For entrees we had the lamb ragout and the skate. Both were very heavy, the skate drowned in brown butter sauce and the lamb ragout was chock full of mushrooms. The flavors were fantastic. My first drink, the chatelaine, was very light but not too sweet. It was more of a mimosa than a good cocktail. My bf got the singapore sling, and kept drinking them because those were GOOD.

"I wish I could give 10 stars! I love this place! My husband and I came in to start of our anniversary weekend with our favorite meal of the day....brunch! Let me tell you we could not have made a better choice! First off the French toast is everything other reviewers have said it is and more. Seriously did not need syrup at all, could eat it as is. It was just perfect! Crunchy, carmelized outside- firm yet tender inside. I cant decide if the pancakes were better than the French toast or not because they were simply out of this world as well!! Fluffy, warm, tender, and just enough sweetness. I was so in love with these pancakes!! They are thick and cakey, but in the best way! We also had the duck hash and croque madam- they were just great!!! Even the dressing on the side of greens with my hash was so delicious!! The pickled onions on the hash were such a good accompaniment. The restaurant itself is so intimate and beautifully set. Wait staff is excellent and very attentive! They were working hard for the customer. We left with a happy, full belly and feeling our business was appreciated. Not like the staff was there doing us a favor...like you feel at some places with mediocre service. To top it off we were treated to two mimosas on the house for our anniversary. I have no complaints whatsoever about this place. You should definitely make it your business to go!",5.0

We decided to share a dessert and got the bread pudding. Best bread pudding EVER. It was perfect. There was a further happy ending to the night, when the waiter comped us two drinks for our ""wait"".",4.0
"Good food! Great service! French rustic decor with a typical atmosphere and grub.the by the glass selection limited and they were out of the one glass i was actually interested in. I settled for another that was blah. Packed at brunch,so expect either a little wait, a bar seat (i prefer anyway) our a squished seat in a corner no one would want. A Williamsburgish crowd. Chill and served the purpose for sustenance and a bit of vino.",3.0

"I wish I could give 10 stars! I love this place! My husband and I came in to start of our anniversary weekend with our favorite meal of the day....brunch! Let me tell you we could not have made a better choice! First off the French toast is everything other reviewers have said it is and more. Seriously did not need syrup at all, could eat it as is. It was just perfect! Crunchy, carmelized outside- firm yet tender inside. I cant decide if the pancakes were better than the French toast or not because they were simply out of this world as well!! Fluffy, warm, tender, and just enough sweetness. I was so in love with these pancakes!! They are thick and cakey, but in the best way! We also had the duck hash and croque madam- they were just great!!! Even the dressing on the side of greens with my hash was so delicious!! The pickled onions on the hash were such a good accompaniment. The restaurant itself is so intimate and beautifully set. Wait staff is excellent and very attentive! They were working hard for the customer. We left with a happy, full belly and feeling our business was appreciated. Not like the staff was there doing us a favor...like you feel at some places with mediocre service. To top it off we were treated to two mimosas on the house for our anniversary. I have no complaints whatsoever about this place. You should definitely make it your business to go!",5.0

"I came in here with my girlfriend last week and had an absolutely amazing dinner  that seriously exceeded my expectations. To start, we got a carafe of wine. The waitress brought us both a taste of the Cote Du Rhone (white). Though I'm normally partial to big Italian reds, like Barolo, or very full bodied whites, this wine was excellent and went perfectly with our meal.Appetizers: My girlfriend ordered the beef tartare and the oysters. She said the oysters were the best she has had, and the sauce accompaniments were fantastic. We also shared two of the salads: the Black Garlic Brutus and the Baby Beets salads. These were two of the most creative and memorable salads i've had. I'm not usually a fan of anchovies or Caesar for that matter, but I especially loved the brutus. There were so many flavors and textures at play and it was just so much fun to eat. The beet salad was also fantastic, and the cumin flavored dressing was delicious. Both of these salads could be a meal in their own; they were not lacking in anything! Entrees: For our mains, I got the fish special of the day: a striped bass. The presentation was beautiful (see photo), and the fish was amazingly fresh. My girlfriend had the sea food pasta (linguini?) special which I tried a bite of. I have never really been into mussels or clams, yet they tasted so fresh and were so delicately prepared that I was actually a fan. Dessert: We got the flour-less chocolate cake with coffee ice cream (the waitress mentioned the ice cream was house made). The cake was so dark, so rich, so chocolatey. Such gluttony :) One of the best chocolate desserts i've had.Our whole experience here was amazing; like live food porn. Definitely not light, this is exactly the kind of meal you'd want for a decadent romantic dinner, your birthday, or any special occasion for that matter.",5.0
"We came here for Labor Day Brunch. The restaurant was just open for half an hour, but there was already a line waiting outside it. My boyfriend and I got seated after 30 min wait.

"Dangg, there are some good looking waiters here. But other than that, it was okay.There were lots of people waiting for tables in the beginning. We had a 45 minute wait for a party of five and we were actually about to leave. The hostess was really nice and tried to seat us as soon as possible. She told us it would be about 10 to 15 so we decided to wait since the menu and pictures looked awesome. When we were finally seated, it took a bit of time for us to get waters and our orders in, but it wasn't a big deal. It was just one of those days when it was just packed. And then every time our waiter came over, I would admire his scruffy jaw line. So yea, worth the wait.  I ordered the steak and eggs. It just came with two sunnyside eggs (which were good, but nothing spectacular) and the steak, which was super chewy and bleh. My friends had the eggs benedict and the duck hash confit, which they applauded. I think I just ordered the wrong thing. The fries that came with the entrees were pretty crispy and hot so that is good. Overall, I had an okay experience. I would probably come back to try other stuff. I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for it though.",3.0

"3.5 stars...Came here from breakfast on Saturday and had a decent meal. It's a rustic yet classy atmosphere. The kind of place where there's a good chance you'll be squeezing into a two seater inches away from someone else. Everything is a little pricey than ideal. There was an apple frittata/omelette I had seen on their menu online when I bookmarked the place last year that was $8.50 that's now $10. I ordered the apple and gruyere frittata (more like an omelet) which was topped with some pickled onions. It was more greasy than cheesy but overall I enjoyed it. It came with some greens, maybe if it came with some potatoes I would have been full but the dish kept me wanting more. My friend ordered the duck hash which they screwed up so to make up for it they gave us an order of home fries on the house (normally $4), this was actually the best thing I ate here, the potatoes were crispy and perfectly seasoned with rosemary and just the right amount of salt and pepper. I sat watching my meal get cold while we were waiting for them to bring the meal they had to redo. I couldn't wait any longer so ate my meal solo. Eventually my friend's meal came out and I watched her eat solo as well. The dish was well presented but poorly executed. Hash should be mostly meat or at the very least 50/50. Her duck ""hash"" was basically potatoes (almost to a mashed consistency) with a tiny bit of duck meat. I liked how they crisped up the top of the potatoes and topped it with a couple eggs. The flavor was good but for $15 I'd expect a proper meaty hash. The place is cash only but they do have an ATM on premises. Service overall was decent but I think I'll continue my search for a better value/meal elsewhere.",3.0
Wow I'm glad I finally discovered this spot! This is great for brunch! I love it. I can't wait to bring all my friends and family back here. My gf Ashley introduced this to me and she's been coming here years. Now I feel so left out!! Glad she brought me though. The cafe inside is really cozy and I just love everything about it. More so the food. She got the french toast which look really freaking delicious and I got the croque madame - OMG!! Simply divine in my mouth! Yes I can't wait to go back and eat there.

"I was really excited about dining here after a few recommendations from my friends, but in the end it was a let down. I came for dinner service with a friend and ultimately the food was great but the service was sub-par, especially for a french restaurant.Our table was mainly ignored over larger groups and it took a long time before the waitress asked for our first drink orders. I got the Applejack Old Fashioned which was a nice twist on the classic cocktail.For an appetizer we got the bone marrow which came out very warm and was absolutely delicious when spread over the crusty bread and lemon parsley salad served alongside it. For an entree I ordered the Coq au Vin which also was very well prepared and tasted well.There were two main incidents that made this a two-star for me. First, the waitress spilled the entire bottle of tap water on me and after asking a rushed ""Was anyone hurt?"" she brought a few napkins even though I was completely soaked. I had to ask for a few more and we surprisingly didn't get much help afterwards. After the incident, our entrees were brought out but without our drink order or another bottle of water. We figured our drink orders or water would come soon to accompany our meal and make up for the lack of water, but by the time they remembered we had ordered a glass of wine each we had practically finished our meal. The food was very tasty but without water or wine to help accompany it, the dinner experience was lost.My hats off to the chef for the great food they cooked, but due to the sub-par service my friend and I received here (especially for the price point) I won't be coming back again.",2.0

"Went there few weeks ago with my family for brunch. Had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated but wait was well worth it. They have a fireplace in the back where you can lounge until your table is ready. We ordered pancakes, steak & eggs, eggs florentine, french toast and an omellete for the table and I got to taste all of the dishes. Every dish was delicious. Their french toast, eggs florentine and pancakes are out of this world. Pancakes were massive and very different from what you would normally expect when you order pancakes. Steak & eggs were also delicious. Steak was cooked very well, it was tender and juicy. Their steaks are from Creekstone farms  and I know there are people out there specifically looking for Creekstone steaks. This place is great. I can't come up with a single complaint and for that reason they get 5 stars.",5.0
"So I went here with friends for brunch and I must say that this place did not disappoint!  The food was excellent.  It was so good I could not decide on what I wanted so I got two things:  the mussels are to die for. The broth was full of flavor and the mussels was cooked perfectly.  The only thing I wished was that they added a piece of bread with your order. It's does come with fries (which are also very good) and j did dunk a few in the sauce but I think that a slice of bread would put this over the top. I also had the madame croquet (sp? ) and that was soooooooooooo good. The bread was perfectly buttered and toasted, the egg was cooked to perfection.  Go to this place you Wil not be disappointed",4.0

"Found Another great brunch eatery in Brooklyn. The service was fast and friendly.  The burger was definitely the best I've had in Brooklyn. The goat cheese was amazing and their home made pickles will make your mouth water. The pancakes are the size of a small birthday cake. My family of three shared one order and we were stuffed. We'll definitely be back for dinner. Things to be aware of:1) the location is more Bushwick than Williamsburg. That's not a bad thing at all. Just needed to clarify for folks like me who were traveling from another borough to get here. 2) CASH ONLY. That was a bit of a surprise. However, there is an ATM on location. 3) While the pancakes are amazing, they take 40 minutes to prepare.",4.0
"Love the ambiance. Feels like old French cafe. The bar is classic, mirrors, tons of booze. The tables are narrow. The back room is large with more tables and some benches around the stove.Good service. They were very kind to bring me vinegar, lemon, honey and hot water for my sore throat. Our party ordered the apple gruyere omelette, spinach mushroom omelette, Benedict, and spinach goat cheese croissant. All were excellent. The fruit bowl side was also very nice. Crispy potatoes were perfect and the side salad fresh (ps. I really like East coast bunch serves a small salad with the entree; makes the meal so balanced and I feel healthier for it). Oh yeah, coffee so excellent I could drink it black. I would return for more delicious things on the menu. Pâté sandwich, I'll get you next time.",4.0
"How quaint. How cute. How adorable. And how tasty.The wait is LONG, but when we were walked in, there were so many open tables in the back. And not that many people left before we came in. Odd.The french toast, french onion soup, and croque madame were amazing. My favorite was the french toast with the caramelized sugar. It gave the french toast a nice crunch and, with the confectioner sugar, it is enough sweetness without the need for maple syrup. I could have done for more fruit though. Like 3x more fruit. The egg on the croque madame was perfect with just a little bit of runniness to provide for a clean meal. The french fries were amazing! They're so skinny, I devoured them all without feeling weighed down by the carbs. I'm feeling it now though...I must return for the pancakes. We were told that they had run out of pans so any order of pancakes would have taken at least an hour. We noticed it was more like 30 minutes as the couple beside us decided to take the plunge. Gosh darn it, if only we had! Oh well, another time.",5.0
"Service was questionable; the food was okay. I know this is a popular brunch spot, but we arrived pretty early, at about 10:30 on a Sunday. They first tried to seat us right by the door (it was cold that day), so we asked to be seated further back, and they squeezed us into a corner with a tiny table. I got the duck confit hash, which was okay. The sunny-side up eggs on top of it were pretty overcooked. The potatoes in the hash could have been a little crispier, and I felt there could have been more duck (after all, that's why I'm paying $15 for this entree instead of the $10 for the rest of the entrees, right?). My friend got the spinach and goat cheese croissant, which she enjoyed, but her sunny-side up eggs were pretty undercooked. The whites hadn't set. She asked to get them more cooked, and the waiter stuck the eggs under a broiler-- but then brought them back warm and with the whites still runny! Our waitress then got an attitude with us-- ""Well, this comes with sunny-side up eggs, which are supposed to be runny."" Okay lady, we know what a sunny-side up egg is, but we're not trying to get salmonella, so please don't get an attitude. They finally just replaced the eggs, but it was more complicated than it should have been.",2.0

The goat cheese was amazing and their home made pickles will make your mouth water. The pancakes are the size of a small birthday cake. My family of three shared one order and we were stuffed. We'll definitely be back for dinner. Things to be aware of:1) the location is more Bushwick than Williamsburg. That's not a bad thing at all. Just needed to clarify for folks like me who were traveling from another borough to get here. 2) CASH ONLY. That was a bit of a surprise. However, there is an ATM on location. 3) While the pancakes are amazing, they take 40 minutes to prepare.",4.0
"Love the ambiance. Feels like old French cafe. The bar is classic, mirrors, tons of booze. The tables are narrow. The back room is large with more tables and some benches around the stove.Good service. They were very kind to bring me vinegar, lemon, honey and hot water for my sore throat. Our party ordered the apple gruyere omelette, spinach mushroom omelette, Benedict, and spinach goat cheese croissant. All were excellent. The fruit bowl side was also very nice. Crispy potatoes were perfect and the side salad fresh (ps. I really like East coast bunch serves a small salad with the entree; makes the meal so balanced and I feel healthier for it). Oh yeah, coffee so excellent I could drink it black. I would return for more delicious things on the menu. Pâté sandwich, I'll get you next time.",4.0
"How quaint. How cute. How adorable. And how tasty.The wait is LONG, but when we were walked in, there were so many open tables in the back. And not that many people left before we came in. Odd.The french toast, french onion soup, and croque madame were amazing. My favorite was the french toast with the caramelized sugar. It gave the french toast a nice crunch and, with the confectioner sugar, it is enough sweetness without the need for maple syrup. I could have done for more fruit though. Like 3x more fruit. The egg on the croque madame was perfect with just a little bit of runniness to provide for a clean meal. The french fries were amazing! They're so skinny, I devoured them all without feeling weighed down by the carbs. I'm feeling it now though...I must return for the pancakes. We were told that they had run out of pans so any order of pancakes would have taken at least an hour. We noticed it was more like 30 minutes as the couple beside us decided to take the plunge. Gosh darn it, if only we had! Oh well, another time.",5.0
"Service was questionable; the food was okay. I know this is a popular brunch spot, but we arrived pretty early, at about 10:30 on a Sunday. They first tried to seat us right by the door (it was cold that day), so we asked to be seated further back, and they squeezed us into a corner with a tiny table. I got the duck confit hash, which was okay. The sunny-side up eggs on top of it were pretty overcooked. The potatoes in the hash could have been a little crispier, and I felt there could have been more duck (after all, that's why I'm paying $15 for this entree instead of the $10 for the rest of the entrees, right?). My friend got the spinach and goat cheese croissant, which she enjoyed, but her sunny-side up eggs were pretty undercooked. The whites hadn't set. She asked to get them more cooked, and the waiter stuck the eggs under a broiler-- but then brought them back warm and with the whites still runny! Our waitress then got an attitude with us-- ""Well, this comes with sunny-side up eggs, which are supposed to be runny."" Okay lady, we know what a sunny-side up egg is, but we're not trying to get salmonella, so please don't get an attitude. They finally just replaced the eggs, but it was more complicated than it should have been.",2.0
"I've never written a review before but after eating here decided this had to be my first. Waited in line for about 5 min (would have happily waited much longer). The food, service, and atmosphere could not have been better. Steak and Eggs and Eggs Florentine were cooked to perfection. A plug for our server John: entertaining AND quality service is hard to come by.  He and the rest of the team were up to the task.",5.0
"Cash only! ATM in the back.Food - 5 stars for sureBrunch Service - 2-3 stars, sadlyMy sister and boyfriend consider this restaurant one of their favorite restaurants ever. ""We've loved everything we have ordered."" After our experience, they were disappointed that this restaurant didn't live up to their OWN expectations since they've been there multiple times. Considering NYC is filled with restaurants and options, repeat customers are always a sign that this restaurant is doing something right.We arrived for Sunday for brunch around noon and the place was packed. The hostess gave us a 15-20 minute wait which we thought was amazing only to realize the hostess has NO idea. I overheard what she told the group after us and it was also 15-20 minutes. When we waited around 15 minutes, we were told ""sorry....it might be another 15-20 minutes. I understand if you want to leave."" I really think this restaurant knows how popular it is so it doesn't matter how they treat their customers. They know if we walk out the door, another group will be more than happy to take our place.After we waited, we were seated in probably the worst seats in the house. The table right in the front of the restaurant to the left of the door. Every time a door opened, we felt a draft. The crowd built up right between us and the hostess so there was a barricade of bodies between us and our server. We were directly below the speakers blasting music the entire time we were seated. My sister asked at least three people during our visit to turn down the music slightly because we had to shout at each other only to be told, ""I'll see what i can do"" then they disappeared and we were forgotten. At least come back and explain that it can't be done due to whatever reason instead of blowing us off. Between the music from the speakers and the groups trying to get to the hostess, we were flanked on both sides. It was difficult to carry on a good conversation. Our server chewed a piece of gum the entire time we were there. It was extremely distracting talking to someone doing that. Food was delicious. I ordered the pancakes because I saw them coming out of the kitchen heading toward another table and was amazed at the size of them. Definitely too much for one person but I find that my tablemates were very willing to share their savory dishes with me when I gave them a slice of the cake-like pancake. My brother ordered the eggs benedict. I only tasted the Hollandaise sauce and I liked theirs. I'm normally not a fan. My brother cleaned off his entire plate :)My sister had the spinach and goat cheese croissant and it was great. I loved the buttery croissant with the tang of the cheese. I didn't try the Croque Madame which is what was also ordered but the person who ordered it raved about it. Apparently, it was the last item on their brunch menu he had yet to try that he'd been meaning to. I stole a fry though and it was good. Perfectly crisp but not over-fried.When I used their restroom in the back, I was amazed at how spacious the back room was with a couch,  a fireplace and piano. Compared to the front of the house that was getting rapidly congested from people waiting to be seated. I'm wondering if they could rearrange the backroom during brunch just to be more space efficient?I'd go back for the food but have zero expectations for service.",3.0
"Arrived on a snowy evening (yes, in October) and when I walked through the doors, literally felt like I was transfered into some small house in the woods with a fresh fire and delicious smells. I felt like this place was only lit by candle light so your vision isn't the best in here but wow does it set the mood. We were seated in the middle room (the front room has the bar and the back room is this adorable living room type with some tables and couches and a fireplace) and it was extremely romantic. Our hostess and food runner were fabulous, our server was a bit lackadaisical but it's okay, once you sit down, you really feel like you are in no hurry. I had a fabulous cocktail and the name is escaping me, something with hibiscus, yum! I highly recommend getting the house salad, the greens are deliciously refreshing and sets your pallet for a lovely meal. The bread was delicious as well, we kept requesting refills. For my main course I have the mushroom ravioli and I literally could have licked the plate clean. Everything was so fresh and bursting with flavor. I am pretty sure I would eat here at least once a week if I lived here.",4.0
"I really wanted to like this place when I first went in, but the food just wasn't that great. The ambiance is really cute and service is decent, but the food was just.. average. It seemed fresh, just wasn't very tasty.Two of my friends ordered the Norwegian benedict which, IMO, was probably the worst Norwegian benedict I've ever tasted.. I felt bad for them. Not that it was bad, just very bland with lackluster flavor, and I LOVE smoked salmon... pretty disappointing.My other friend ordered the croque madame, which she said was just okay. I went with the special of the day--fried oysters benedict (I love fried oysters, even more than I love smoked salmon). It was pretty good, albeit not the tastiest thing I've ever eaten--but you can't go wrong with fried oysters, although there were maybe only 5 total. Come to think of it, it should have been way tastier considering there were fried oysters! Greens and home fries were pretty good, but I mean, if the main part of the dish isn't good, there's really no point. The best thing about my meal was probably the latte. My meal was comped but I still feel a little ripped off, so...Pricing was average, ranging from $9-14 a plate for brunch. We were able to find street parking fairly easily on a Saturday afternoon. You won't REGRET eating here, but there are definitely better options out there.",3.0
"Super awesome amazing restaurant ! My boyfriend and I just left this place and we couldn't be happier !  The food was great , the price affordable and the service amazing ! Our waitress was so nice , and the manager is such a doll ! We will definitely go back and you should try it too !!!",5.0
"Food is good - traditional American food with a French spin.  Rich, salty and very sweet when appropriate.  Ambiance is nice as well.Our major problem was with the seating process and table service.  We were told it would be a 20 minute wait and then were continually delayed.  After waiting 90 minutes we started to get a little agitated.  Then we were sat at a dirty table, which wasn't cleaned for 10 minutes.  Drinks took another 15 minutes.  We spoke with a manager who couldn't have cared less and our server would walk away from our table while we were mid-sentence.  It was so strange and might have been funny if it hadn't been so frustrating.  We did stay for brunch but the whole experience took about three hours.  It was our fault in that we were obviously way too patient for far too long, but we were expecting a leisurely Sunday and were ready to go-with-the-flow until the situation just became ridiculous.  Like I said earlier, the food was good but not spectacular.  If you have a lot of time and don't mind sitting around and chatting with your friends for over an hour while waiting for a table then this might be the place for you.",1.0
"When I go to a restaurant I like to forget where I'm at. The restaurant should make me feel like I've been transported to another location where time is not an issue. It should make me feel like I can relax, kick-back, and chillax with friends while enjoying good food!With that said, Le Barricos is the perfect place for brunch! With a swanky, hipsterish vibe, we came here on Sunday noon and despite how cold it was outside, the restaurant was completely packed inside. After 30 min wait at the bar, we were seated in the back area and it felt like we were invited into someone's living room. With a rustic homey feel and a sun-roof for natural lighting, we were greeted with friendly service and very good food. I ended up ordering their omelet with crispy bacon, roasted grapes and spinach over guerrie cheese and damn was it good! With a side of greens and perfectly fried potatoes that came along with my dish, I was able to thoroughly enjoy my meal while catching up with friends. We ended up staying there for nearly 3 hours and not once did we feel rushed. With such a pleasant experience, I highly recommend this brunch hot-spot to anyone who is looking for good food, good service and a good time!_________________-Cash only",5.0
Great place for brunch. Make sure to go all the way to the back if you have to wait for a table. There is a fire place and seating in a cozy back room that has a skylight window. I had the pancakes when I was there and they were HUGE. It's like you're getting a personal 2 layer cake. With everyone helping out I still had one whole pancake left. It was delicious and the group I was with enjoyed their food as well. The service could have been better..,4.0
"As someone who lives down the street and has been eating here for the past 5 years, the brunch is great (but crowded) and the dinner is hit-and-miss. However, the real delight is the stunning decor.The brunch is consistently excellent. The french toast, apple omelet, and burger are great. Unfortunately, I've stopped going for brunch if I'm only eating along side my boyfriend. The wait staff seems to favor large groups most of the time. Couples get rather ignored, put into uncomfortable tables in the corners, or sat together with other couples at the ""communal"" table ( which is really just a small table you have to sit at with 2 other strangers. It's awkward). I wouldn't bother with dinner on the week nights, the menu items are just too inconsistent. I'd be very weary of their specials. I've gotten things that tasted like they were about to go off. But like I mentioned, it's a beautiful restaurant and it's worth trying just for that.",3.0

"I love French cuisine and had high hopes for Le Barricou but I was sadly disappointed with my NYE dinner here. Upon entering and being seated we were asked for our drink order about 1 minute after being given the wine and cocktail menu. That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the dinner. We had a late reservation/ there was no need for the table once we were done, so I'm not sure what the rush was for.Once we ordered our food the appetizer literally came out in less than 2 minutes. It was a prix fix menu and it was terribly transparent that they had an assembly line of lobster bisques in the back just waiting to go out. That being said, it was a good bisque. As soon as we were done the bowls were whisked away. There is a difference between good service and rushed service and this was the latter.Come entrée. I ordered a salmon dish that came out cold. I let the server know who brought it back out a few mins later- the fish was now warm however the vegetables/everything else on the plate was still cold. They clearly grabbed the fish and either seared or microwaved it for a minute but forgot the rest of the dish. Reheating it this way dried it out a bit. My bf ordered chicken which came out hot and was very good. The dessert was a cake with some syrup on top that I took one bite of. I'm a huge dessert person but I thought the syrup was terrible and ruined it, although the whipped cream on top was great/tasted homemade. The second we put our forks down we were asked if we needed anything else. After being annoyed at being so rushed the entire time we ordered another bottle of wine so they'd leave us alone for the rest of the night. In all I would NEVER go back here for any special event. From all of the fantastic reviews NYE clearly was a miss, however there are plenty of other restaurants I'd like to try before giving this one another shot.",2.0
"It would've been a fine place! Except, my friend and I got food poisoning.This morning, we went there for brunch and got the goat cheese and spinach croissante with fried eggs, and the apple frittata.

We told the bus boy who gave her a new cup of coffee. Towards the end of brunch, my stomach felt funny and I started feeling tired and just all around not so great. My friend hadn't felt sick, so I wrote it off as a stomache-ache. I continued feeling like crap, while going directly to a shift at work-- a couple hours later, my friend messages me and tells me that she thinks we got food poisoning.Pretty upset about it, but I guess what can you do?

They clearly grabbed the fish and either seared or microwaved it for a minute but forgot the rest of the dish. Reheating it this way dried it out a bit. My bf ordered chicken which came out hot and was very good. The dessert was a cake with some syrup on top that I took one bite of. I'm a huge dessert person but I thought the syrup was terrible and ruined it, although the whipped cream on top was great/tasted homemade. The second we put our forks down we were asked if we needed anything else. After being annoyed at being so rushed the entire time we ordered another bottle of wine so they'd leave us alone for the rest of the night. In all I would NEVER go back here for any special event. From all of the fantastic reviews NYE clearly was a miss, however there are plenty of other restaurants I'd like to try before giving this one another shot.",2.0
"It would've been a fine place! Except, my friend and I got food poisoning.This morning, we went there for brunch and got the goat cheese and spinach croissante with fried eggs, and the apple frittata. My friend noticed that her coffee tasted a little sweet without adding sugar, and realized that the coffee cup had been used (there were lip marks on the rim). We told the bus boy who gave her a new cup of coffee. Towards the end of brunch, my stomach felt funny and I started feeling tired and just all around not so great. My friend hadn't felt sick, so I wrote it off as a stomache-ache. I continued feeling like crap, while going directly to a shift at work-- a couple hours later, my friend messages me and tells me that she thinks we got food poisoning.Pretty upset about it, but I guess what can you do? Surprised that we didn't get at least a free cup of coffee when given a used cup...",1.0
"I absolutely love this place.  It's so cozy (pot belly wood-burning stove anyone?) and the food is tasty town USA.  Try the fluke, steak frites, barricou salad and for drinks the blood and sand.",5.0
Literally the best food of your life. The BEST brunch. The croque madam is where it's at. If you have anything HAVE THAT. yes the wait is sometimes long but totally worth it.,5.0
"This French bistro is a happening spot for both brunch and dinner and offers classics like Escargot and Coq Au Vin, which is a chicken dish stewed in red wine. While the food is great, your mission is to head towards the back where you'll find lounge furniture and a vintage cast-iron stove. Grab a seat by the fireplace and peruse the all-French wine list featuring nine selections  by the glass and 60 by the bottle.",4.0
"Went for brunch and the space is beautiful and the food was excellent! I practically licked my plate to get every last bit of my duck confit, side salad and sunny side eggs. However as great as everything else was, the service was just so spotty it can't warrant more stars. Our server (and everyone's) talked so fast we had to keep having her repeat herself, she was rushing our menu choices and it took 20-minutes for her to realize that she had swapped out check with other patrons.",3.0

"Orgasmic French Toast!!!  Just WOW!!!  The bread they use is just perfect.  Carbs Overload and damn worth it!  The flavor of the batter and the toast alone is perfect.  It doesn't even need the syrup that is accompanied on the side.  I also had the Croque Madame (more of that fabulous bread) with gruyere cheese, ham and a sunny side egg with a side of pommes frites.  The pommes frites were delicious!  Nice and crispy and seasoned perfectly!  The gruyere cheese was amazing in this open sandwich!  Brunch is done so well here and is a MUST if you're in the area.  They serve a full brunch menu 10am - 4pm.  Cash only.",5.0

"This place rocks. Came in for dinner a couple weeks ago with 5 friends. It has a romantic vibe so it was pretty funny having dinner with my crazy friends here.

Once we all got our orders in the food took foreverrrrr to come out, I mean forever. When the food finally arrived I was so hungry I could eat my arm. Luckily the coq au vin tasted a lot better than my arm would have. It was delicious and really the saving grace for this review. The chicken was succulent and there was the beautiful sauce coating everything. YUMMMM. I would go back and order it again any day.

"Entranced in to Le Barricou after an astounding recommendation from my cousin. Went here last saturday for sunday brunch. There was a 30 minute wait so me and my beau decided to take our chances and wait at the bar. After enjoying the comfortability and warmness from our bartender we decided to eat at the bar. It was a delicious treat. We had their special ""shrimp bloody marry"" 2 huge succulent shrimps topple out of the glass with rusted spicy seasoning along the rim. Truly a masterpiece. We had the eggs benedict (obviously superb coming from a french place) and the Croque Madame (French country bread with black forest ham and gruyere cheese) DELECTABLE !

Gooey egg, fresh salmon, crunchy bread- key to my heart. My bf usually orders the egg white veggie omelet. Also delicious. The home fries are bomb so don't even think about shuffling them around on your plate- it won't happen. Great drinks too! Also duck confit hash. I've been saving this for last.

"I had been trying to visit Le Barricou for brunch, but I have always been deterred by the long wait times on weekends. Places with French names tend to put me off to begin with - I guess they convey some sorta schmanciness I lack. Heh. In any event, I happened by yesterday and saw some empty tables, so we went on in. Best decision I made all day!The look: Le Barricou mixes a country home decor with Parisian cafe accents. There's a back room with a fireplace, bookshelves, and old comfy looking couches. The place is simply adorable! The food: I ordered the veggie omelet, and my boyfriend got the spinach omelet. Both came with breakfast potatoes and mixed greens, and both were SUPAH-DELICIOUS. Like, so good you eat slower so you can savor it. Well done!The service: We were greeted with a friendly smile and seated promptly. Our server was super attentive and very friendly. The bottom line: Good food, good vibe - seems like the perfect place for a date, or to take visiting friends or relatives. Def worth braving the long wait next time.",5.0
"Apparently this place is popular for brunch. However, the dinner we had tonight was not too hot, literally and figuratively. Two people in the party had to return their steaks for being too cold.

The servers were very quick and polite about fixing these problems. I ordered a burger (sorry, I was in the mood) medium rare, but received a bland and fully fully fully cooked patty of beef (though the vegetables were very tasty). I also ordered brussels sprouts with a cream topping. The cream was very rich and excellent, but the texture of the sprouts suggested that it had been sitting out for some time.

"A good brunch spot, but could be a true gem if they tweak some things.  Their ""oven-baked"" pancake was definitely the highlight and saved what could have turned out to be a forgetful / disastrous brunch.  The pancakes here are definitely some of the best in NYC - so it is worth the trip here to try it at least once.   Sadly, that's probably the only thing I can recommend.  For $10, you get two giant 10-inch ""cakes"" with strawberry butter and fresh fruits.  The outside is slightly crunchy, enveloping a very moist and fluffy cake.  If you're here for two, you can probably just share this and get a side and you're set. Unfortunately, it seems like the service varies depending on who you get.  For one, I think the servers should warn patrons here that the pancakes require a 30-40 minute wait right when they sit down, so no precious time is wasted.  In my instance, my partner's food came out lukewarm and ""dried"" (she ordered their lamb sausage with eggs breakfast).  Definitely looks like it sat out under a heat lamp since the sausage was slightly shriveled and the eggs were not runny at all even though they were sunnyside up.  The table next to us had a disastrous chicken sandwich (apparently, the waitress acknowledged they ""over-brined"" the chicken... ?!?!) and an over-cooked burger along with a missing side salad - so I guess the kitchen doesn't handle the other foods quite as well.  In the end, our waitress even gave us the incorrect check.So basically, the pancakes were probably the only saving grace to this brunch joint.",3.0

This was the most amazing French toast I've ever had it was perfectly sweet and buttery, not need to add anything but the fresh berries that come on the side.

"A good brunch spot, but could be a true gem if they tweak some things.  Their ""oven-baked"" pancake was definitely the highlight and saved what could have turned out to be a forgetful / disastrous brunch.  The pancakes here are definitely some of the best in NYC - so it is worth the trip here to try it at least once.   Sadly, that's probably the only thing I can recommend.  For $10, you get two giant 10-inch ""cakes"" with strawberry butter and fresh fruits.  The outside is slightly crunchy, enveloping a very moist and fluffy cake.  If you're here for two, you can probably just share this and get a side and you're set. Unfortunately, it seems like the service varies depending on who you get.  For one, I think the servers should warn patrons here that the pancakes require a 30-40 minute wait right when they sit down, so no precious time is wasted.  In my instance, my partner's food came out lukewarm and ""dried"" (she ordered their lamb sausage with eggs breakfast).  Definitely looks like it sat out under a heat lamp since the sausage was slightly shriveled and the eggs were not runny at all even though they were sunnyside up.  The table next to us had a disastrous chicken sandwich (apparently, the waitress acknowledged they ""over-brined"" the chicken... ?!?!) and an over-cooked burger along with a missing side salad - so I guess the kitchen doesn't handle the other foods quite as well.  In the end, our waitress even gave us the incorrect check.So basically, the pancakes were probably the only saving grace to this brunch joint.",3.0
"Blown away. When my GF suggested this place for brunch I had no idea what I was in for. My GF was set on having the pancakes and I quickly decided on the duck confit hash. We were seated quickly and the waiter brought water promptly. When we ordered my GF decided to ask which was better, the pancakes or French toast, the toast was recommended and that's what she got. This was the most amazing French toast I've ever had it was perfectly sweet and buttery, not need to add anything but the fresh berries that come on the side. And the size of these slices were astounding. My duck confit hash was also delicious but but the meal was really made by the French toast.",5.0
"Over the weekend, my boyfriend and I decided to allow Yelp to dictate where we'd have brunch. One of the brunch places I had bookmarked was Le Barricou so this is where we ended up eating. We took the B62 from LIC to Driggs and Grand and walked the rest of the way which proved to be quite a walk (considering we lost our way sometime during the trek). But once we realized that we were headed the right way, it was easy as cake. The restaurant is located along a row of other eateries. There are 2 tables by the front. A bar greeted us to our left and happy diners were situated to our right. We were seated further in, right by the wall with the mirror. The service was excellent right from the get go. If you don't mind paying for cocktails separately, then this is as good as it gets. I was quick to observe that the brunch menu is categorized into two groups: savory and sweet and each dish is priced differently. We started our meal with coffee (free refills). My boyfriend had their Duck Hash and I decided to take on their famous giant pancake. When my plate arrived, it was served with two enormous and heavy pancakes, topped with fresh strawberries and blueberries and I believe strawberry butter. I didn't know what to expect with the pancake. When I took my first bite, it was pleasantly soft with just a touch of sweetness. It was definitely a challenge finishing it- I couldn't.My boyfriend and I decided to split our food, therefore I also got to try the duck hash. I really liked it- it was so good! It had lots of flavors and it was very hearty and made me warm. The duck was tender and the potatoes were almost mashed, I loved it. The space and decor gives a very cozy atmosphere. It also opens up the farther you go into the back. I will definitely be going back to Le Barricou soon to try their savory brunch dishes and their cocktails.Things to keep in mind:- Cash only (there's an ATM by the bathrooms at the back) - Bathrooms are single use",5.0

"This was one of the best restaurant meals I've had in a long time.  The service was excellent: exactly attentive and responsive enough.  Our server was knowledgeable and very helpful on every way: from offering sound advice when asked to finding out details about the different cheeses offered to letting my friends and me feel at home lingering and chatting after dinner (for quite a long time).All the food was satisfying.  My crispy artichokes and my risotto were delicious.  (I did ask for a dash more ground pepper, which made the risotto perfect for my taste buds.)  The lemon tart for dessert seemed to the two if us who split it to be just the right balance of tart and sweet, with a firm crust that seemed just right.Only one small caveat: the room does get a bit loud, due to the lack of acoustic tile in the ceiling and the young staff's and clientele's propensity for music turned up a notch or two higher than I would choose, but it certainly did not stop us oldies from talking and enjoying ourselves thoroughly.Well worth the price.  I'd gladly go back anytime!",5.0

"Except for the fact that it's as loud as a chicken coop in here and packed to the gills with hipsters young and old (endemic to the area and proud of it), Le Barricou is a rather charming, cozy spot with a fine specimen of a country wood stove and piano in a naturally lit back room on the way to two clean bathrooms with li'l doors. And of course, this type of urban woodsy ambience wouldn't be complete without stacks of old books, rifles, and taxidermied creatures speckling the decor.A friend I hadn't seen in nine years suggested the spot so we could eat something and have a moment of silence for a friend who'd died in a car accident just a few days beforehand. Considering the circumstances, it was especially lucky that we go a cushy corner seat (a spot in which both of us could sit on the cushioned side of the little table). Had we not had that modicum of privacy, the traffic and general noise in the corridor between the front and back rooms would have prompted me to walk out.The $8 Bloody Mary was decent, but the best part about it was that it was served in a mason jar. Taking a sip, I felt self righteous over not having given into the temptation of going for the $14 special drink with two gulf shrimp sticking out of it. The mix was strong, spicy, and earnest, but seemed slightly on the watery side and just lacked that maddening somethin' somethin' that makes you go for round two, Lord's day be damned.I chose the $13 Croque Madame, which I had been salivating over since reading in on the online menu (lebarricouny.com/menus). My friend went for her usual, the $11 Eggs Norwegian, exclaiming how the salmon, poached eggs, and Hollandaise with market greens beat the tar out of the dinner here, which in her modest opinion ""just SUUUUUUCKS.""And in MY opinion, a Croque Madame is like pizza, beer, or, as some say, sex: even when it's bad, it's pretty damn good. The Le Barricou edition was just fine, but didn't knock my socks off like the first one I ever had in Paris (the only part of the city I liked) or the one that can be had at Belleville in Park Slope (separate review). But it did just fine.In all honesty, I don't anticipate craving a return to Le Barricou, but neither would I avoid going back. I'll just remember to bring about 40 bucks of cash, because that's the toll at this cash-only joint, plus the ATM fee if your sin dinero efectivo.",3.0

"I moved from Brooklyn to Harlem about 8 months ago, and the #1 thing - HANDS DOWN - that I miss about this area is Le Barricou. I have only been here for brunch, but BOY HAVE I BEEN HERE. I honestly can't even remember how many times I came here. Why did I keep coming back, you ask?One. The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious.Two. The prices are completely and almost unreasonably reasonable. Three. THE FOOD. The food is really just amazing, both for what you pay and just in general. The fries are PERFECT. The french toast is amazing. I love the vegetarian egg white omlette as well. The pancakes are melt-in-your-mouth good - but be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes for them, and be hungry because they are HUGE. I don't want to ramble on and on about how great this place is but let me just finish by saying that since I've left Brooklyn, I haven't been able to fill the hole in my heart.

Everything everyone ordered was yummy,beverages were good, and the service was friendly. Love!",4.0
"Brunch gets a little crazy, but it's soo delicious. Beware, cash only. But you definitely HAVE to go check this place out. I went around 11/1130a and got a table almost right away.I got the eggs benedict with bacon. It was so delicious and filling, but just so. I tried some croque monsieur. It was all so delicious. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.The atmosphere is quaint and brunch busy, but in a good way where you can just sit with whoever and enjoy your meal. The table comes with 1 plain croissant and 1 chocolate croissant.The iced tea was delicious as was the bloody mary. It's a little pricey (a brunch entree being $10-$16, but totally worth it.TLDR: go for brunch, bring cash, order anything.",5.0
"Except for the fact that it's as loud as a chicken coop in here and packed to the gills with hipsters young and old (endemic to the area and proud of it), Le Barricou is a rather charming, cozy spot with a fine specimen of a country wood stove and piano in a naturally lit back room on the way to two clean bathrooms with li'l doors. And of course, this type of urban woodsy ambience wouldn't be complete without stacks of old books, rifles, and taxidermied creatures speckling the decor.A friend I hadn't seen in nine years suggested the spot so we could eat something and have a moment of silence for a friend who'd died in a car accident just a few days beforehand. Considering the circumstances, it was especially lucky that we go a cushy corner seat (a spot in which both of us could sit on the cushioned side of the little table). Had we not had that modicum of privacy, the traffic and general noise in the corridor between the front and back rooms would have prompted me to walk out.The $8 Bloody Mary was decent, but the best part about it was that it was served in a mason jar. Taking a sip, I felt self righteous over not having given into the temptation of going for the $14 special drink with two gulf shrimp sticking out of it. The mix was strong, spicy, and earnest, but seemed slightly on the watery side and just lacked that maddening somethin' somethin' that makes you go for round two, Lord's day be damned.I chose the $13 Croque Madame, which I had been salivating over since reading in on the online menu (lebarricouny.com/menus). My friend went for her usual, the $11 Eggs Norwegian, exclaiming how the salmon, poached eggs, and Hollandaise with market greens beat the tar out of the dinner here, which in her modest opinion ""just SUUUUUUCKS.""And in MY opinion, a Croque Madame is like pizza, beer, or, as some say, sex: even when it's bad, it's pretty damn good. The Le Barricou edition was just fine, but didn't knock my socks off like the first one I ever had in Paris (the only part of the city I liked) or the one that can be had at Belleville in Park Slope (separate review). But it did just fine.In all honesty, I don't anticipate craving a return to Le Barricou, but neither would I avoid going back. I'll just remember to bring about 40 bucks of cash, because that's the toll at this cash-only joint, plus the ATM fee if your sin dinero efectivo.",3.0

"I moved from Brooklyn to Harlem about 8 months ago, and the #1 thing - HANDS DOWN - that I miss about this area is Le Barricou. I have only been here for brunch, but BOY HAVE I BEEN HERE. I honestly can't even remember how many times I came here. Why did I keep coming back, you ask?One. The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious.Two. The prices are completely and almost unreasonably reasonable. Three. THE FOOD. The food is really just amazing, both for what you pay and just in general. The fries are PERFECT. The french toast is amazing. I love the vegetarian egg white omlette as well. The pancakes are melt-in-your-mouth good - but be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes for them, and be hungry because they are HUGE. I don't want to ramble on and on about how great this place is but let me just finish by saying that since I've left Brooklyn, I haven't been able to fill the hole in my heart. Le Barricou, you are my one true brunch love.",5.0

"Mother's Day was busy, with a long line outside waiting. We got on the list and made our way to the back of the restaurant where there is a little known area with comfy sofas and chairs to wait and order a drink.Before long we were seated and enjoying Duck Confit Hash, Eggs Benedict and other divine offerings. I can attest to enjoying every morsel of the hash alongside an extremely good Bloody Mary. Happy Mom's Day to me!Our server was excellent. She exhibited grace under fire; polite, personable and efficient as she waited on us and many other tables in this packed house.My son earned 5 stars for treating his mom to a lovely brunch here. Next trip I'll convince him that we need to visit once again, perhaps for dinner.",5.0
"Waited over an hour for Sunday brunch which was expected.Food was EXCELLENT, AMAZING, PERFECTION. I got the duck confit. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the waiter was so rude. No enthusiasm, not even a smile. Didn't ask us if we wanted drinks, didn't apologize for how long the food took to come out (about 30 minutes), didn't check in on us to make sure the food was okay. So we thought ok maybe he's having a bad day, we will give him standard 15% tip. My aunt hands the waiter $100 in cash to pay for the $60 bill and to add insult to injury he asks if we want the change. UHHH...you really think you deserve such a fat tip? After that we ended up leaving him a poor tip. Sucks for you since my aunt is usually a very generous tipper.",3.0
"Went for Brunch yesterday with two friends. We arrived quite soon after they opened at 10 AM, so the restaurant was empty at first, but filled up quite quickly after we were seated.I had a fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and the spinach and goat cheese croissant, which comes with two sunny side up eggs and greens. When our food came and I went to take a bite of my eggs, I had a layer of raw egg white come off on my fork. No big deal, it happens, I thought, and told the waitress, who had me slide my eggs on to a small plate for the kitchen to pop under the broiler for a bit.  The eggs came back a couple minutes later, with an instruction that the plate was hot-- and they STILL had raw egg white. I can appreciate a runny egg yolk, but raw egg whites have no place in cooked eggs for me!  I flagged down the waiter (not ours) who had delivered my re-cooked eggs and told him they were still uncooked.  I saw him hand them off to our waiter, who came over and tried to explain to me what sunny side up eggs are.  I (as politely as I could) told her that I understood, but that the egg white was still raw; she kind of rolled her eyes and I watched her take them to the kitchen and say, ""they want the whites cooked all the way"", and shoot a look back at me.  A few minutes later she delivered a fresh set of eggs; these were a bit more cooked than is my preference (yolks were rather solid), but if forced to choose I'd rather have cooked whites and overcooked yolks than perfect yolks and raw whites. But they could easily solve this problem by just doming the eggs while they cook them.In all, I found the food tasty (though not as mind blowing as some other reviews suggest).  My friends enjoyed their duck confit hash (served with two sunny side up eggs and greens; her eggs were overcooked) and vegetable egg white omelette (served with greens and home fries). In sum: the food was quite tasty, but the service left a significant amount to be desired.  If not for the waitress trying to chastise me for sending the uncooked eggs back again, this would easily have been a 3- or 4- star review.Note: this place is cash-only; they have an ATM in the back that charges a 1.75 fee (less than most ATM fees), but if you are averse to paying ATM fees, make sure you bring enough cash with you.",2.0
"We recently changed neighborhoods and on our first day available we wandered in search of a weekday late breakfast, with adult beverages, of course.  Le Barricou was charming.

"Le Barricou is awesome.I visited with two other folks for brunch on President's Day. The decor and service were good, but the food blew everything away.

Another friend also ordered a lamb sausage dish, and the sausage was loaded with flavor.As for drinks, my bloody mary was tasty; not too strong, extra spicy, and served with loads of veggies in a mason jar.I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area.",5.0
"Your basic charming French bistro in Williamsburg. Dark wood, subtle lighting, surprisingly large space with a big back room.

"Saturday brunch with the girls is always a good time, but it's an even better time with great food.  The wait was about 30-40 minutes (looks very deceiving from the outside, you would think there was no one waiting), but we didn't mind.  We sat at the bar and waited while watching the bartender make the hell out of some drinks.  He invited us to check out the menu while we waited, which didn't help in the least.  So many goodies to choose from, and as plates came out of the kitchen, it was hard not to stare.* Once we were seated, we finally decided.  Everyone got something savory and we would split the french toast to satisfy our sweet.  I got duck confit hash, my girls got eggs benedict and the spinach and goat cheese omelette.  Everything was delicious!  When I tell you moans were coming from our table, I am not lying.  The accompanied mixed greens were well dressed with a honey vinaigrette and the duck confit was so silky and went so well with the potatoes and eggs.  The eggs benedict were sprinkled with paprika and perfectly poached.  Le Barricou itself is a cool spot.  Further in the back is a lounge area if you just want drinks and there is also an ATM for your convenience.  I want to try dinner here for sure.  And now I'm in the mood for a Bloody Mary.*For the record, every table that ordered the pancakes did not finish them.  They're that huge.",5.0
Great brunch spot with a delicious menu. *The croque Madame was huge!*The pancakes were possibly the most amazing I've ever had. Humongous. Literally like a double layer cake.

"I feel really sad about giving Le Barricou such a low updated rating, but my recent dinner experience was very lack luster. I came here for a nice Steak Frites dinner, and it was just kind of a mess. Restaurant is still beautiful, but from the start service was slow. When we did get our bread basket it only had two slices for the two of us. That's totally sufficient but seems cheap really. When our steak frites came it was just no good. My steak was cooked properly, however the sauce on it was way, way too sweet. I understood that it had a demi glace, but it was like taking a steak and dousing it in sweet bbq sauce. To their credit, when we brought up that it was just too much they very politely had us reorder, but once again we waited a long time for our replacement dinners. The risotto that came out, but it still was just a bit of a disappointment after looking forward to one of my favorite dishes.",2.0
"We came here for a random lunch on a Wednesday. It's great because one can still order off the brunch menu. The only problem with showing up early is that the tables still smell of cleaning supplies. The glasses were kind of dirty as well (This is what hindered them from being 5 stars)I ordered the spinach and cheese on a croissant. the croissant was perfectly toasted and perfectly tasty. MY only gripe is its small size. Unfortunately, the experience was over rather quickly. The Mrs ordered duck confit has, she seemed to like it. I was a fan, although it was not very hash-like. It was more like shredded meat on top of potatoes.For an appetizer, we got mac n cheese. It did not disappoint, although it didn't exactly excite either. The bartender did excite, she invented two special drinks which suited our tasteful needs.I can't wait to go back and try that pancake. It looks to be delicious. I have to remember to bring my cash. The nearest Chase ATM is 6 blocks away.",4.0

"Le Barricou must be the place to be for weekend brunch in Williamsburg.  I came with a party of three at around 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and we faced a half hour wait.  The restaurant was small and pretty busy, and the hostess seemed a bit overwhelmed.After a few minutes of standing around, we were able to snag seats at the bar, where we eased our hunger pangs with a round of cocktails.  We were helped by a handsome bartender with a handsome European accent, who looked like a less ambiguously ethnic Keanu.  He was friendly, and he made good drinks.  I had a house Bloody Mary, and it was excellent, spicy and strong with a hearty, thick texture.  It was garnished with olives and lime and a pickled green bean, and it went down beautifully on an empty stomach.  I also tried some of my friends' drinks, the Applejack Old Fashioned and the Chatelaine.  The Applejack Old Fashioned was great, a boozy aromatic cocktail of Laird's Straight Apple Brandy with maple syrup and Angostura bitters, garnished with a Maraschino cherry.  I was less enamored of the Chatelaine.  It was a bit too sweet, a mix of gin and elderflower liqueur with white wine and pomegranate juice, garnished with a sprig of thyme.  I bought our round of drinks, and it cost an even $25 before tip.  I thought this was more than fair, and if I lived in Brooklyn, I'd go back to drink again.We were led to our table before we'd even finished our drinks.  Service was good, and I liked the cozy little back room.  It didn't feel overly busy, and it emptied out even more as we ate.  The food was solid.  I had the croque madame, and it was an excellent version of the classic sandwich, with Black Forest ham and melted gruyere between thick slices of French country bread, all topped with a sunny side egg.  It was a large, decadent sandwich, with very good ham and cheese.  I wanted the egg to run a little more, but otherwise, no complaints.  The sandwich came with a big portion of pommes frites on the side, and these were thin and crispy and well browned.  I also liked Le Barricou's French toast.  It was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle, served with butter and syrup and fresh, juicy blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries.Our late brunch at Le Barricou was immensely satisfying, and if I lived nearby I would make a point of eating here again.  My only real complaint is that the place is too expensive to be cash only, but that wouldn't stop me from going back.  The food and drink were lovely, and I'd be happy to have this restaurant in my neighborhood.",4.0
"Great food and barely a wait. Was impressed because our servers shift ended in the middle of our meal and she went out of her way to introduce the colleague who was taking over. Those pancakes! I mean, they are delicious but our table of four couldn't finish even one platter - they are more like cakes baked in a pan...definitely not something to eat if watching your figure, but really impressively moist and great crumb. The barricou salad was also a pleasant surprise...I didn't love the shrimp BM though, a bit too salty and not smoky enough for me. All in all a great place and would def come again.",4.0
"Why didn't someone warn me of those gigantic pancakes?  It's one thing to be flat and gigantic but this was like ordering a two-layer birthday cake all for myself, except our table had 3.  Three of these suckers can easily feed 20 people, ESPECIALLY if each of those people already had their own dish.As delightful as the strawberry butter was, I wouldn't get this again.  It veers away too much from a traditional pancake to bear enough resemblance for me to like it.  As for the duck confit hash, this was great!  Not too much duck but delicately put together.  This place is totally hip with their free range food and slow service.  People in my party loved the bloody mary.",4.0
"Le Barricou was one of the first places I ever had brunch at upon moving to New York, and remains one of my favorites. The fact that it's located less than two blocks away from where I live helps too. Since it was during the week when we were the only patrons there when we arrived. The waitress who reminded me a lot of Kathy Bates from the movie Misery was accommodating, but I kept expecting her to throw a typewriter in my lap and make me write for my brunch. If I wasn't such an asshole myself, I would've mistook her for having rude service, but she was actually very accommodating and just playful ... I think.It really didn't matter though, because the food was AMAZING. She could've made me go to the back to pick it up myself and I wouldn't have cared. We ordered the spinach and goat cheese croissant, the french toast and mac and cheese, which me and my best friend split family style. The croissantwich was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. The mac and cheese was deelish, but then again you gotta suck pretty bad if you f*ck up mac n cheese ESP if it has bacon in it. The serving was huge too. But what made me give Le Barricou 4 stars, was their french toast.Matter of fact, let me give the french toast its own paragraph. The french toast is definitely on my Top 3 list of the best french toast I've ever tasted in my life. When I went there, the menu said it was on sweet sour dough. Now, the menu says french country bread. At any rate, I'm sure it's still amazing nevertheless. I LOVE sugar. I'm on that diabetes diet, so when my bff said it didn't even need syrup I thought she needed more people. Sure enough, it was delicious just by itself. The toast had a crispy outer layer, but was light and fluffy on the inside. And the fruit that accompanied it, though standard, made for a nice texture and added flavor. I would definitely go back here again and recommend it to anyone in the Williamsburg area. Just don't piss off old Annie Wilkes, she might bash your ankles in.",4.0

They didn't even need syrup bc they were so tasty. *The service was just ok. Kind of pretentious hipster crowd. But whatever the food is good and prices are fair.,4.0
"I feel really sad about giving Le Barricou such a low updated rating, but my recent dinner experience was very lack luster. I came here for a nice Steak Frites dinner, and it was just kind of a mess. Restaurant is still beautiful, but from the start service was slow. When we did get our bread basket it only had two slices for the two of us. That's totally sufficient but seems cheap really. When our steak frites came it was just no good. My steak was cooked properly, however the sauce on it was way, way too sweet. I understood that it had a demi glace, but it was like taking a steak and dousing it in sweet bbq sauce. To their credit, when we brought up that it was just too much they very politely had us reorder, but once again we waited a long time for our replacement dinners. The risotto that came out, but it still was just a bit of a disappointment after looking forward to one of my favorite dishes.",2.0
"We came here for a random lunch on a Wednesday. It's great because one can still order off the brunch menu. The only problem with showing up early is that the tables still smell of cleaning supplies. The glasses were kind of dirty as well (This is what hindered them from being 5 stars)I ordered the spinach and cheese on a croissant. the croissant was perfectly toasted and perfectly tasty. MY only gripe is its small size. Unfortunately, the experience was over rather quickly. The Mrs ordered duck confit has, she seemed to like it. I was a fan, although it was not very hash-like. It was more like shredded meat on top of potatoes.For an appetizer, we got mac n cheese. It did not disappoint, although it didn't exactly excite either. The bartender did excite, she invented two special drinks which suited our tasteful needs.I can't wait to go back and try that pancake. It looks to be delicious. I have to remember to bring my cash. The nearest Chase ATM is 6 blocks away.",4.0
"Cozy atmospheric gem we found on yelp after venturing blindly into Williamsburg. The portions are small so be prepared to order a full course meal to satiate. But ah so deliciously crafted to satisfy your senses! For the main I had the sea bass, crisp, soft, grilled anis and the sauce!",5.0
"Le Barricou must be the place to be for weekend brunch in Williamsburg.  I came with a party of three at around 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and we faced a half hour wait.  The restaurant was small and pretty busy, and the hostess seemed a bit overwhelmed.After a few minutes of standing around, we were able to snag seats at the bar, where we eased our hunger pangs with a round of cocktails.  We were helped by a handsome bartender with a handsome European accent, who looked like a less ambiguously ethnic Keanu.  He was friendly, and he made good drinks.  I had a house Bloody Mary, and it was excellent, spicy and strong with a hearty, thick texture.  It was garnished with olives and lime and a pickled green bean, and it went down beautifully on an empty stomach.  I also tried some of my friends' drinks, the Applejack Old Fashioned and the Chatelaine.  The Applejack Old Fashioned was great, a boozy aromatic cocktail of Laird's Straight Apple Brandy with maple syrup and Angostura bitters, garnished with a Maraschino cherry.  I was less enamored of the Chatelaine.  It was a bit too sweet, a mix of gin and elderflower liqueur with white wine and pomegranate juice, garnished with a sprig of thyme.  I bought our round of drinks, and it cost an even $25 before tip.  I thought this was more than fair, and if I lived in Brooklyn, I'd go back to drink again.We were led to our table before we'd even finished our drinks.  Service was good, and I liked the cozy little back room.  It didn't feel overly busy, and it emptied out even more as we ate.  The food was solid.  I had the croque madame, and it was an excellent version of the classic sandwich, with Black Forest ham and melted gruyere between thick slices of French country bread, all topped with a sunny side egg.  It was a large, decadent sandwich, with very good ham and cheese.  I wanted the egg to run a little more, but otherwise, no complaints.  The sandwich came with a big portion of pommes frites on the side, and these were thin and crispy and well browned.  I also liked Le Barricou's French toast.  It was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle, served with butter and syrup and fresh, juicy blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries.Our late brunch at Le Barricou was immensely satisfying, and if I lived nearby I would make a point of eating here again.  My only real complaint is that the place is too expensive to be cash only, but that wouldn't stop me from going back.  The food and drink were lovely, and I'd be happy to have this restaurant in my neighborhood.",4.0
"Great food and barely a wait. Was impressed because our servers shift ended in the middle of our meal and she went out of her way to introduce the colleague who was taking over. Those pancakes! I mean, they are delicious but our table of four couldn't finish even one platter - they are more like cakes baked in a pan...definitely not something to eat if watching your figure, but really impressively moist and great crumb. The barricou salad was also a pleasant surprise...I didn't love the shrimp BM though, a bit too salty and not smoky enough for me. All in all a great place and would def come again.",4.0
"Why didn't someone warn me of those gigantic pancakes?  It's one thing to be flat and gigantic but this was like ordering a two-layer birthday cake all for myself, except our table had 3.  Three of these suckers can easily feed 20 people, ESPECIALLY if each of those people already had their own dish.As delightful as the strawberry butter was, I wouldn't get this again.  It veers away too much from a traditional pancake to bear enough resemblance for me to like it.  As for the duck confit hash, this was great!  Not too much duck but delicately put together.  This place is totally hip with their free range food and slow service.  People in my party loved the bloody mary.",4.0
"Le Barricou was one of the first places I ever had brunch at upon moving to New York, and remains one of my favorites. The fact that it's located less than two blocks away from where I live helps too. Since it was during the week when we were the only patrons there when we arrived. The waitress who reminded me a lot of Kathy Bates from the movie Misery was accommodating, but I kept expecting her to throw a typewriter in my lap and make me write for my brunch. If I wasn't such an asshole myself, I would've mistook her for having rude service, but she was actually very accommodating and just playful ... I think.It really didn't matter though, because the food was AMAZING. She could've made me go to the back to pick it up myself and I wouldn't have cared. We ordered the spinach and goat cheese croissant, the french toast and mac and cheese, which me and my best friend split family style. The croissantwich was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. The mac and cheese was deelish, but then again you gotta suck pretty bad if you f*ck up mac n cheese ESP if it has bacon in it. The serving was huge too. But what made me give Le Barricou 4 stars, was their french toast.Matter of fact, let me give the french toast its own paragraph. The french toast is definitely on my Top 3 list of the best french toast I've ever tasted in my life. When I went there, the menu said it was on sweet sour dough. Now, the menu says french country bread. At any rate, I'm sure it's still amazing nevertheless. I LOVE sugar. I'm on that diabetes diet, so when my bff said it didn't even need syrup I thought she needed more people. Sure enough, it was delicious just by itself. The toast had a crispy outer layer, but was light and fluffy on the inside. And the fruit that accompanied it, though standard, made for a nice texture and added flavor. I would definitely go back here again and recommend it to anyone in the Williamsburg area. Just don't piss off old Annie Wilkes, she might bash your ankles in.",4.0
"I look forward to visits to Brooklyn so I can get brunch here at Le Barricou! It's so delicious. I'm a huge fan of the duck hash, as well as the goat cheese and spinach croissant. Also, they have amazing Bloody Mary's, and the space itself is incredibly adorable. Go!",5.0
"We made the mistake of coming here on Mother's Day and ended up having to wait for quite a while for a table, and then again for our food... BUT IT WAS WORTH IT! I had the egg with spinach and goat cheese croissant, and my friend had the croque madame. Both were phenomenal.",5.0
"If you want to impress your date and not break bank, bring your date here. I've been here for both brunch and dinner and while I favor my dinner experience, brunch also has a lot to offer.For most restaurants, the wait area is either non existent or very small. Le Barricou has couches in the back room that surround a brick fireplace along with miscellaneous chairs sprawled around. You can either chat with your date/small group of friends or just relax and sip on some coffee.For brunch, the prices are typical and range from $8-14. I ordered the Merguez and Eggs (Spicy lamb sausage & two sunny side up eggs served with hand-cut pommes frites & mixed greens) which didn't wow me but left me satisfied. I would like to try other items on the menu like the Grilled Burger or French Toast. If you're feeling extra fancy pants, you can order the Duck Confit Hash. Their bloody mary is big (16 oz) and tastes great but will run you $8...the same amount or almost the same amount as an entree. Tough decision as a bloody mary is a meal in itself for some aka me.For dinner, we shared the Moules Mariniere (Mussels with white wine, garlic, & shallot with hand-cut pommes frites) which was really garlic-y but I love garlic so it was great for me. You really taste all elements of the ingredients. There was not one item too overpowering. As an entree, I went beyond my usual pickens and ordered the Coq Au Vin (Chicken stewed in red wine & served with mashed potatoes). The chicken had good flavor and the mash potatoes were creamy, thick but not heavy and had a solid consistency. However, the chicken was a bit dry. I was totally bummed out as this is why I don't usually order chicken* at restaurants unless it's fried chicken. Darn. My friend ordered the Duck which was a special for the night and it was AMAZING. It was cooked perfectly, had a soft texture and wasn't too chewy. There was just enough salt to bring out the natural flavors of the duck and herbs it was cooked in without committing sodium overkill. I would go back just for the duck, it was that good.They also have a rather large cocktail list which includes Absinthe Drip, Beer, Cocktails, Aperitifs, Pastis & Anise, Gin, Rye, Scotch, Whisky, Bourbon, Rum and Tequila...all within an affordable price range.*Raises eyebrowWatch out Le Barricou, I'm coming for the Dutchess Crown.***CASH ONLY*** (but there's an ATM in the back near the wash closets)-----------------------*Apiary's free range chicken was cooked perfectly and is one of the main reasons why I love and recommend the restaurant to others.",4.0

"What better way to spend a day with someone you care a lot about than perusing Williamsburg for food and entertainment?My cousin and I have always been very close because we have so many things in common - one of which, is our love of food. When she suggested Le Barricou for Sunday brunch, I was eager to try it, having read many glowing Yelp reviews. Off we went, to Williamsburg, to eat, drink, and catch up. I am a sucker for quaint little towns. Le Barricou is situated on your quintessential old-Brooklyn-type block - many of the storefronts still look a bit old-fashioned. Yuppies galore. Street parking was ample.The wait was about an hour, but well worth it. The restaurant was bustling with people having drinks and conversations. Yuppies and hipsters crowded the storefront, waiting for a table inside. The bar inside and the decor on the walls was beautiful and indicative of the old-world vibe. The tables and chairs were simple. My only complaint is that the seating was a bit cramped, but, promotes conversation with perfect strangers, some of which are very nice. To our left, two girls from the area who complimented my spiked flats from Bakers. To our right, a father and daughter who seemed to be arguing the entire meal (you can't win them all, right?) He told the waitress to lower the music on three separate occasions - yes, that kind of annoying.The meal was great - spinach and goat cheese croissant. The croissant was tasty, the goat cheese was high quality, and the side of fries complimented well. Iced coffee in mason jars was a nice touch. My one complaint - if you have to use their bathroom, it's in the back through the doors. There was a crowd by the bathroom when we got there because it's a one-room deal, no communal bathrooms. A plus: at one point, it got so crazy, that no one really cared if you used the men's or women's bathroom. Adjacent to the bathrooms is an ATM - always convenient. It also looked like they had an outdoor patio area, but it was very small. I can't wait to go back.",4.0

We asked her if we could order coffee while waiting, and she looks at us uncertainly, saying, ""Umm... maybe with the bartender?"" And then we wait and wait and wait.Finally after an hour or so, I went up to her to ask whether our table was ready. She looks at the list, and then said, oh yes, we have a table ready for you.

Definitely puts the CAKE back in pancake. They serve up two of these big dense babies, but strawberry butter only comes on the top of one. They really should give you more on the side considering the huge plate of cake you are confronted with. The boy got the duck confit because it was recommended by our server. He loved!

Here our waitress was smiling, friendly and helpful :) Pancakes = Big, fluffy, fatty cornbread cakes baked in the oven. Not my favorite pancakes, but pretty darn good. Definitely puts the CAKE back in pancake. They serve up two of these big dense babies, but strawberry butter only comes on the top of one. They really should give you more on the side considering the huge plate of cake you are confronted with. The boy got the duck confit because it was recommended by our server. He loved! Home fries were good but unexpectedly very large pieces of potato. Different, but good. When we saw our neighbors with the regular fries we were glad we went with the home fries because the regular ones did not look appealing.",4.0
nice brunch sitting outside.... a pleasant experience! duck confetti came out great and very delicious. latte was so so though...... a long queue for saturday brunch! but seems an enjoyable time.,4.0
"I see why this restaurant has tons of great reviews.  It's a gem in this side of Williamsburg.  There was a wait for my friend and I to get seated.  Everyone had amazing and delicious looking dishes.  The restaurant is quite large and goes pretty deep inside.  I actually just ate the yogurt which is pretty damn good yogurt.  All the other dishes do look heavy, but sure looks good. Not being from BK it does seem like the restaurant is located in the middle of nowhere, though it's still Williamsburg (just not the hipster side).  I would come back here again :-)",5.0

"My friends and I went here on Sat afternoon for brunch. The food was delicious and I personally ordered the eggs benedict which was very well crafted and done. The problem lies in this story. We arrived for brunch and were told we would have to wait a half hour (not a problem). A few minutes later I went in and asked if we could see a menu so we would know what we wanted when we were seated. The hostess obliged and also said that there was a couch in the back where we could wait, and that the bar was open. We found the couch and it was full. We decided to sit at one of the 5 empty, yet prepared tables to which no one was being seated. We waited patiently and then the waitress came up which we were surprised at (because we hadn't been officially seated yet). However, she took our orders and when the food came one friend still had not been served his Bloody Mary and the other had received hers, but not her espresso. They both asked again and by the end of the meal neither drink had arrived. When the check came the 3rd ordered, by unreceived Bloody Mary wasn't even on there, but the espresso was. After we told the waitress that my friend had never received hers, it was removed and we then paid and departed. The three of us that received our Bloody Marys loved them and the bartender was very pleasant and kind.",3.0

I'd give this place zero if I could. Some miserable old hag with no sense of customer service opened not only 15minutes late but then gave us major attitude as if we were inconveniencing her. Keep in mind there was no one but ourselves in the restaurant. Waited patiently for about 20 minutes for menus until I finally gave up and got them myself only for her to give us more attitude at which point we left. .

"Brooklyn is Big on Brunch.Le Barricou is one of its stars. The food was very good.  One of the best egg benedict's we have had.  The hollandaise sauce is parfait.  The pancakes are amazing although they apparently take 40 minutes to make.  We may have waited an hour for our food because of it.  They are huge baked pancakes.  Be sure to share them.  They are giant! I always finish my food and I definitely could not.  The fries are also perfect french bistro crispy fries.  The coffee however is not great.  Service was impeccable, busers are always on point with more water.  However as we were waiting so long my little one was starving so we asked for bread.  They said they didnt do bread for brunch.  But I know  they have toast so it would not be a tall order for someone waiting so long.  They should also give a warning about how long the pancakes will take.  Also to note it is cash only, but they have an atm there.  We did not wait at all for a party of four sat. 11 am.  Did not seem too crowded, most the time we were there.  The decor is cool: a piano, fireplace, bookshelves line the walls in the back.  We will definitely return this was our second trip.  Although it is French it does not remind me of France.  In Paris we could not find anywhere for Brunch.  They only give you little tarts, croissants and good coffee for breakfast no gianormous pancakes in Paris!",4.0

"I welcomed myself back to Brooklyn with a brunch at a place that didnt exist when i last lived in Billy burg. Based on the reviews and the location, i decided to pop in. The one thing about brunching in NY is knowing the average time people wake up. Factor in that they might have been drinking the previous night and their need for bacon and eggs will make for a serious Brunch crowd. Once you nail down the right time for you to go out, you can have the most plesant of brunch experiences. My friend and I arrived at around 11 am on a Sunday. It was busy but there were still empty seats. The decor is rustic with antique mirrored door frames hanging on the walls. The tables are adorned with mini vases and fresh flowers. The prices here are fantastic. A brunch for two with 2 iced coffees came out to less than $30. I had the special of the day which was the Quiche Lorraine and a side salad. For $8, they gave a HUGE slab of quiche but, as someone who LOVES Quiche Lorraine, i was a little disappointed they used ham instead of bacon. The side salad had a fresh tasting mustard vinaigrette. The Croque Madame was covered in cheese and topped with a fried egg. It came with a side of ""pomme frites"" but more like shoe string fries. The croque madame was very tasty and had a homemade mustard spread that gave it a tangy bite. Our iced coffees were served in mason jars. The coffee was nice and strong. Overall, a great welcome back brunch. Cant wait to scour the hood for more tasty finds!",4.0
"I trekked all the way over to Brooklyn from Queens because I had seen the Eggs Norwegian (smoked salmon w/ hollandaise) on the menu, by the time I got there, they were out of it.

The potatoes were delicious and the Benedict itself was good, nothing spectacular to note, just your normal average Benedict.",3.0
"This is my go-to brunch spot when I have visitors in Brooklyn. It's a quaint little French oasis not too far off of the Lorimer stop. If you get there around 11:30 or noon, you won't have to wait.

Many of my friends had recommended this place for brunch, so after my first week at a grown up job, my best friend and I came here on Sunday to eat bacon and get day wasted.The menu has everything you could want on a brunch menu from huge fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit to steak and eggs. I had the spinach goat cheese croissant, with their special ""shrimp cocktail"" bloody mary that included two rock shrimp. AMAZING! I can't wait to try their duck confit hash! The best part though was how accommodating they were. We were seated quickly, even though it was crowded and weren't rushed even when we stayed long after the food was done to drink more. Better yet, the waitress had no problem putting bailey's in our coffee and even asked if we wanted it hot or iced. Overall, wonderful food, great staff and amazing drinks.",5.0
"If the service at Le Barricou weren't so terrible, this would be a five-star review because the food is fantastic.I arrived around 1:15pm on the 4th of July, so it was pretty crowded. The hostess said there'd be a 30-40 minute wait, which was fine since I was still waiting for a friend. I took a seat at the bar, asked for a menu (one wasn't offered), and ordered a cocktail (which never came). 'No worries,' I thought, since my friend arrived and we were seated shortly after. I should have known what we were in for service-wise, when one of the people at the table next to us flagged down a waitress, practically demanded the check, and said, ""Let's get the hell out of here.""It took about 10 minutes for someone to come to our table to place our order. My friend and I decided to order food and drinks at the same time since we suspected things might be going slowly.45 minutes later (I'd know--I checked to see when I checked in on foursquare--sorry, Yelp), still no food and not a Kir Royale in sight. Sure, the place was busy, but no one came to check on us, apologize for the wait--or even explain why it was taking so long--until I asked what was up. I'm not an asshole to waitstaff and I hate it when others are, but I wouldn't have cared us much if our server seemed to care at all.We waited another 15 - 20 minutes for the food, which was absolutely delicious. I had the Eggs Benedict with bacon (the home fries were so good--not your basic salt and pepper, but had rosemary and other great spices), my friend had the steak and eggs (which got a rave review), and we split the ENORMOUS pancakes with fruit, which came a touch overdone (read: burned) but were so good it didn't matter too much. The portions are more than enough and it was a ton of food; it was so good (and we were so hungry...) that we almost finished it all.To sum things up, I have nary a complaint food-wise--even the cocktails were great--but service was super negligent/lacking/awful. I definitely plan to come back--it could just have been an off/shortstaffed/especially busy day, but mostly because the food makes it hard to write this place off.",3.0

"I had been to this place a few times for dinner before, and always like the legit French atmosphere. I went for brunch with my boyfriend the other weekend and was a bit disappointed. It was on the latter end of brunch (2 pm) so I understand they are prob tired, but I'm not here to make excuses for you if you are accepting tables.Basically the prob was the service. I am used to bad service, it is WB. I'm beginning to think it's my quiet demeanor that invites it, but regardless, it's inexcusable. We both ordered an entree with a cocktail, one bloody mary, one bellini. It was 2 o'clock, 90 degrees and I hadn't eaten, I WANTED that drink! but we didn't get it. and we didn't get it. and other tables got them. and the bartend was washing glasses. and I got upset. Finally (20 minutes!) the server stopped by our table (after a stare-down) to say our food would be up shortly, I asked for the drinks, and she clearly had forgotten about them and gave an excuse about them being dropped and lost and said she'd get 'em right up. by which she meant 10 min. They were strong though, which was I guess a nice apology. BUT a bell jar glass is not the same as a pint glass so keep in that in mind for those who are economizing.BUT the French Toast was beautifully caramelized and tasty. My chicken sandwich was somewhat forgettable but not bad by any standards (maybe more sauce?). Fries are McDonald's size/cut, a bit thin for me, but nicely seasoned with salt and herbs.",3.0

"Visited Le Barricou after searching for a Sunday Brunch spot.  This place did not disappoint.  The surrounding neighborhood is on the come up, so disregard the bikers and the closed store fronts.  The food is awesome at this place. My wife, daughter and I all had a burger w/ fries and of course we had to try the Pancake, which of course we did not finish because its huge.  The burgers were incredible, cooked to perfection (as per your request). Fries were not greasey or overly salty (The Smith). Gotta get there early before it gets croweded.",5.0
"The place looks great, warm (i love the room in the back, with the fire place), music is not too loud, and the decor is very well ""french-ised"", actually. But let's talk about the FOOD! We went there for dinner, 6 of us. French, some living in New York, some visiting from France. We took advantage of being 6 to order a lot of dishes of the (long) menu : appetizers, main courses and desserts, passing forks and spoons to one another. And everything was very, very good!Appetizers were wonderful and originally paired (the duck and barley moved some of us), the steak tartare was very delicate (quail eggs, horseradish...) and obviously made with a very good meat. And so on.When the main courses came, our eyes wide opened : meat like coq au vin was delicious with an unctuous and rich and super tasty sauce (and as French people living in New York,  believe us, we taste a lot of mediocre coq au vin), the lamb ragout was stunning, the kind of dish that you finish with your bread to wipe every drop of sauce (yes, we kept ordering bread all night). And then the FISH... We tried the skate, the tuna and a salmon as a special. Being a little nervous since it was white tuna, and white tuna is easily dry. It was for me the best surprise of the night. These pieces of fish were incredibly well cooked, seared, etc! Soft, moist, tender, TASTY!... Honestly, we really felt that our plates were exceptional that night. Not to mention the garnishing, very nice and modestly complex (purple potatoes, shaved fennel, pattypan squash...).The desserts were great : a place where the ice creams are made onsite always has my favors!For me, le Barricou is a hidden wonderful bistrot, honoring the new ""bistronomy"" movement, where simple food and high and technical gastronomy are associated on the table. Bravo!ps : one last thing! Wine is very reasonably priced.",5.0

For the 3 of us we shared escargot, it came with grilled bread and we also ordered muscles in white wine with fennel, they were plump and the sauce was so good that we  could not stop eating it and soaked it all up with bread.  For the main course we had a burger with Gruyere and fries, burger was perfectly medium and crunchy crispy well season fries, skate wing with  haricot verde, and Scottish salmon, asked for and got it on the rare side, it came with roasted vegetables.

We were kinda expecting a soft texture :(On to main entrees: I had the coq au vin. don't remember what my other friends dishes are called, but they were happy with it. Portion was good, flavor was right on. One of my friend studied abroad in Paris and he said it was very much Southern French cooking (duh, that's what the restaurant is about). Decor was really nice. COuld have been a perfect place for a date wo breaking the bank.",5.0
"I love everything about this place. My boyfriend and I have been going here for almost 2 years. The food is great, the drinks are good and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic. It's great for Lunch, Brunch and Dinner!!",5.0
"I had been to this place a few times for dinner before, and always like the legit French atmosphere. I went for brunch with my boyfriend the other weekend and was a bit disappointed. It was on the latter end of brunch (2 pm) so I understand they are prob tired, but I'm not here to make excuses for you if you are accepting tables.Basically the prob was the service. I am used to bad service, it is WB. I'm beginning to think it's my quiet demeanor that invites it, but regardless, it's inexcusable. We both ordered an entree with a cocktail, one bloody mary, one bellini. It was 2 o'clock, 90 degrees and I hadn't eaten, I WANTED that drink! but we didn't get it. and we didn't get it. and other tables got them. and the bartend was washing glasses. and I got upset. Finally (20 minutes!) the server stopped by our table (after a stare-down) to say our food would be up shortly, I asked for the drinks, and she clearly had forgotten about them and gave an excuse about them being dropped and lost and said she'd get 'em right up. by which she meant 10 min. They were strong though, which was I guess a nice apology. BUT a bell jar glass is not the same as a pint glass so keep in that in mind for those who are economizing.BUT the French Toast was beautifully caramelized and tasty. My chicken sandwich was somewhat forgettable but not bad by any standards (maybe more sauce?). Fries are McDonald's size/cut, a bit thin for me, but nicely seasoned with salt and herbs.",3.0
"For $10 you get 2 giant pancakes that are large enough to feed an entire restaurant full of hungry customers. Very affordable prices and great atmosphere, just expect to wait around a bit for brunch but that is to be expected at a place like this.Service was nice. Host was very friendly. Also, did I mention that they play 70s Turkish Psychedelic music? Best soundtrack to eating maple syrup drenched pancakes.",4.0
"Visited Le Barricou after searching for a Sunday Brunch spot.  This place did not disappoint.  The surrounding neighborhood is on the come up, so disregard the bikers and the closed store fronts.  The food is awesome at this place. My wife, daughter and I all had a burger w/ fries and of course we had to try the Pancake, which of course we did not finish because its huge.  The burgers were incredible, cooked to perfection (as per your request). Fries were not greasey or overly salty (The Smith). Gotta get there early before it gets croweded.",5.0
"The place looks great, warm (i love the room in the back, with the fire place), music is not too loud, and the decor is very well ""french-ised"", actually. But let's talk about the FOOD! We went there for dinner, 6 of us. French, some living in New York, some visiting from France. We took advantage of being 6 to order a lot of dishes of the (long) menu : appetizers, main courses and desserts, passing forks and spoons to one another. And everything was very, very good!Appetizers were wonderful and originally paired (the duck and barley moved some of us), the steak tartare was very delicate (quail eggs, horseradish...) and obviously made with a very good meat. And so on.When the main courses came, our eyes wide opened : meat like coq au vin was delicious with an unctuous and rich and super tasty sauce (and as French people living in New York,  believe us, we taste a lot of mediocre coq au vin), the lamb ragout was stunning, the kind of dish that you finish with your bread to wipe every drop of sauce (yes, we kept ordering bread all night). And then the FISH... We tried the skate, the tuna and a salmon as a special. Being a little nervous since it was white tuna, and white tuna is easily dry. It was for me the best surprise of the night. These pieces of fish were incredibly well cooked, seared, etc! Soft, moist, tender, TASTY!... Honestly, we really felt that our plates were exceptional that night. Not to mention the garnishing, very nice and modestly complex (purple potatoes, shaved fennel, pattypan squash...).The desserts were great : a place where the ice creams are made onsite always has my favors!For me, le Barricou is a hidden wonderful bistrot, honoring the new ""bistronomy"" movement, where simple food and high and technical gastronomy are associated on the table. Bravo!ps : one last thing! Wine is very reasonably priced.",5.0

"Just came back from Le Barricou this Monday night. As always, the service and the food were great! For the 3 of us we shared escargot, it came with grilled bread and we also ordered muscles in white wine with fennel, they were plump and the sauce was so good that we  could not stop eating it and soaked it all up with bread.  For the main course we had a burger with Gruyere and fries, burger was perfectly medium and crunchy crispy well season fries, skate wing with  haricot verde, and Scottish salmon, asked for and got it on the rare side, it came with roasted vegetables. As for the service, it  was friendly and efficient as always.",5.0

"le barricou is quite simply awesome! ive been there twice so far and each time has been nothing short of great...my first time was on a friday night and it was quite packed. For an appetizer we had escargot...it was quite good. As for dinner my boyfriend and i had an entree on special...which was homemade linguine with rabbit and grapes. i was really skeptical about the grapes, but i decided to give it a try. it was AMAZING! one of the best things ive ever eaten. On my second visit here i wondered if the food would be just as good as the first....and of course it was. My boyfriend and i had the mussels with fries as an appetizer...it was delish! wonderful creamy sauce, and the fries were amazingly crispy. I had the coq au vin and my boyfriend got the pork steak....everything was quite honestly delicious and hearty. you really cant go wrong with le barricou. great food, great ambiance, and great price! enjoy!",5.0

"I came here today for a brunch/lunch and was extremely happy.I got the house (Barricou) sandwich and my date got the vegetarian frittata from the special menu.Both were excellent.  The chicken sandwich was almost too big, but not too heavy.  I ate up--as I was dreading my shift meal and willing to risk some lethargy--but I never felt sluggish.The fries were great.The frittata was perfect--not too much egg, not skimping on the veggies, the cheese stringy enough to not be heavy but actually interesting.The coffee was good, too.  It tasted like french press, but the waitress came out to freshen our cups and didn't charge for a second....so maybe it was just a good drip.And-regarding the waitress--me and my date are both servers and saw that she was busy (maybe ""swamped""), but she did an excellent job of greeting new guests, running food, bussing tables, and keeping on top of her customers.  We pretty much decided that this is our new go-to spot for weekday lunch and brunch.  The server did a great job and the food was impeccable.  I always liked this place for dinner, but this is an extremely solid midday option...possibly the best in North Brooklyn.",4.0
"This restaurant came highly recommended by multiple friends, but we had the worst experience here!  We went early for brunch on a Saturday morning in January.  We ordered VERY simple foods of granola and two orders of eggs and toast.  After placing our order, we waited 60 minutes for the granola with yogurt to come (even this took three pleads to our waitress that we had been waiting a long time and needed some food).  An hour and forty-five minutes after ordering, we still hadn't received our eggs and toast.  We asked our waitress after a while to please deliver our toast because we were starving at that point, but after 30 minutes, decided to give up.  We left very unhappy customers and never even got to try the food.  I'm willing to put up with some bad service and long wait times for great food, but 2 hours for eggs and toast is really beyond reasonability!",1.0
"Great brunch! I had the duck confit hash which was, simply put, damn good.My girl had the pancakes -- big and fluffy, almost cake-like.

"Hate to admit this but I am Manhattan snob and find any excuse to stay in the city and avoid the commute to Brooklyn. However, I dined at Le Barricou this past Saturday night and I will willingly drag my ass from UES and hop on the L train just to get my Le Barricou fix.The food is amazing and they don't skimp on portions either. (I had two escargots in each ramekin hole when usually people just plop in one and smother it with butter and garlic sauce). I got the special which was a whole chicken roasted in a citrus glaze, served on top of wild mushrooms and greens. It's the most moist chicken I've had in awhile. Cooked to perfection. Cannot rave enough about it.Get the escargots. As I mentioned above, they give you the double amount you usually get at other restaurants serving these lovely little morsels. One of my friends has never had escargots and she was hesitant in trying it. Once she did, though, I had to fight her off my plate just so I could salvage some for myself!If you're not a heavy drinker (like me) but want to try a cocktail, order the Chantelaine! It's gin + white wine + elderflower liquer + pomegranate juice served with a spring of rosemary in the glass. It was so good! If I didn't get Asian glow, I would've ordered a second glass. The atmosphere and the service is very nice. The people there are super friendly and give you so many helpful recommendations.

The sandwhich was tasty, but nothing I couldn't make at home with a lil chicken, red wine vinegar, capers and mayo... my french-y elderberry cocktail was tasty.  Overall fine experience at Le Barricou... i'd come here for brunch if I lived in the hood, but def not a destination restaurant for me.",3.0
"This place came highly recommended so I was excited to have my birthday brunch here. Perhaps it was a one time-fluke, because the food was excellent, but the service was so bad that it ruined our experience.We arrived with an incomplete party so we sat at the bar to have drinks while we waited for our stragglers. The hostess was friendly & prompt about getting us seated right away once they arrived. After that, we sat unattended at a table for about 10 minutes, only half of us with drinks, before our server dropped a water bottle and glasses and walked away without speaking to us. 10 minutes later he returned and asked ""do you guys know what you want?"" Our table had a chalkboard with oyster specials written on it so we asked if we could start with those. His reply was ""no."" We asked if there was another type of oyster available and he said ""no, only at lunch not at brunch."" It was noon so we asked when lunch started he said ""we don't have lunch today, you'd have to come back at 6."" If you're not offering an item, why would you have it on the table? Anyway, we finally gave up on oysters and each ordered various egg dishes with a french toast to share. Two of our dishes came out wrong, and the french toast was forgotten. We tracked it down through another server who stopped to check on us, and one of the dishes was able to be remade correctly. We weren't given any refills on coffee or water, despite asking our server twice. He did not, however, hesitate to drop the bill once the card was on the table.Again, the food really was excellent despite our challenges with ordering, but we definitely didn't feel welcome enough to return.",2.0

"Brunch Review. 4.5 stars. Decided to cross over the bridge before the holidays for some brunch with girlfriends. Glad we decided to make the trip out. Places like this are so scarce in the city yet there seems to be a surplus in Williamsburg. Loved the ambiance and food. Everything's wooden so it's very homey and comfortable. The very back section also has a fireplace and couch. The front had very warm lighting and even though it was only 11 AM in the morning when I walked in the lighting made it feel like it was early evening (which I liked). What we got:Omelette Auvergnate- I shared this with my friend and wasn't sure how the potatoes would taste with it but it was good! The potatoes still had a nice texture, not too mushy and not too crispy. Pancakes- These were ginormous. You're basically getting two giant cakes that are about an inch thick and fill up almost the entire plate. They're not super dense and just the right amount of fluffiness,  and they put strawberry butter on top with fruit. You must get this, but guarantee you probably won't be able to finish. Bloody Mary- I'm actually not the biggest bloody mary fan as they're still growing on me, but my dining companions were so we decided to just order one try and share since we were all recovering from the week's shennanigans. I honestly don't know what constitutes a good bloody mary yet but apparently the bloody mary was pretty good. Plus, they came in mason jars! Service was very good. Our waiter was very attentive, but by the end they were a bit too attentive. We just wanted to sit and chat for a bit and we got asked about clearing our plates literally every 5 min. Eventually we got the hint and decided we should clear out. I understand it's a busy time, but sometimes it would be nice if restaurants would just let you be and sit for a bit. You are after all paying for the experience. Often times it's like you're cattle being herded in and out as quickly as possible. Anyway I'd only dock half a star for this.

"The service & beverage options were deserving of a 4 star review, as one of the few dining establishments that I have encountered to have on tap the superb Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale. Alas, while the Steak Frites was relatively flavorfull, the portion size and presentation left much to be desired as more than 3/4 of the plate consisted of Frites, with a few scraps of Hanger Steak left to sample.

"Overall, both the food and atmosphere are very good. The menu is a bit limited. This place is relaxing due to the decor, but usually a buzz. due to the customers. Prices are fair.Food - 5I would say the only negative is that the dinner menu is kind of limited. One fish, one chicken, one duck. They do have specials, which unfortunately we did not take. The food we had was delicious. I recommend the fish (trout), skirt steak was tender, burgers were flavorful. Salads were tasty (love the beets salad) and steak tartaire was good. We enjoyed all of the food and my fish was actually amazing (other dishes were very good, but not wow).Atmosphere - 5This place has an amazing decor. First it's perfectly lit to create a cozy atmosphere in an otherwise buzzing place. The music is not too loud and is actually pretty enjoyable. The bar is nice the, kitchen is uniquely situated in the middle. When you go to the bathroom (all the way in the end) you get to see how your food is prepared. I like that. The back room is super. It looks like it's someone's old library with a fire place, leather chairs, wooden table, book cases, and a piano. It's extremely cozy and relaxing. I can't imagine a better place to have dinner.Service - 4Our service was pretty good. Desserts took a while to arrive, but otherwise it was timely and they didn't bother us at all. Our waiter was probably new because he didn't seem to know the specials very well. As a result, we didn't get any ,but he was good overall. Price/Value - 4This place is not cheap, but not overly expensive either. I believe for the food and atmosphere it is fairly priced and i would come here again.

"Incredible food, delicious drinks, and a great ambience.Le Barricou was definitely doing some business on Sunday morning (1:30 pm) and the 45 minute wait to be seated reflected that. The meal was well worth that wait, though. The space is bustling and the walkways are tight, but there was a great vibe and some good tunes playing--all combining for an upbeat and warm atmosphere. The customers were a range of total hipsters, young families, and people who had just stumbled out of their caves to find some grub to fill them up while they re-hashed the previous evening's dance party. The Bloody Mary arrived in a mason jar, which was an auspicious start to our meal. The drink itself was fantastic--great consistency, lots of kick, and a nice balance of booze & mixer. The eggs benedict that followed were some of the best I've ever had. I chose bacon instead of ham and pomme frites instead of home fries, and the entire dish was an expert combination of flavors. The eggs were beautifully poached, with a runny yet velvety yolk. The bacon was fried to perfection, and the frites were full of flavor. The hollandaise sauce was killer. The small side of mixed greens was also a nice touch. The prices are totally reasonable, with most entrees costing $10-$14, though a Bloody Mary will run you about $8. My only gripes are the teensie-tiny water glasses they give you and that it's a cash-only establishment. Over all, though, I'm a big fan.",5.0

"Came here on Memorial Day looking for some brunch adventures.  We strolled on in at a leisurely 1pm or so.  Such a hot day and my sister and I were super hungry and ready for some awesome food!  It was bustling as was expected inside.  But thankfully we were seated within a few minutes.  We were expecting to have to wait forever for our food to come but it came in about 10-15 minutes after ordering.  So I have to give them props for being so efficient!  I ordered the duck confit hash with a side of salad as per the suggestion of our waitress.  That was my first experience with duck confit so I didn't know what to expect.  I found the duck to be under seasoned and lacking in any deep flavor.  It's never too good a sign when you have to use ketchup to remedy that problem.  I love potato hash though so that saved my meal.  My sister order the Eggs Norwegian, which was two sunny side eggs over salmon on top of an english muffin topped with Hollandaise sauce with a side of homefries and green salad.  It looks like a great dish and she really liked it too.Overall a pleasant brunch experience but not quite the wow I was hoping for!",3.0

"I've been coming here since summer of 2009, and for quite some time I considered it my favorite restaurant.  It had great food at reasonable prices, an awesome playlist of music, and wonderful service.Sadly, things have changed.  For one, the menu keeps changing, and the prices keep going up.  The coq au vin used to be $12, and now it's $15.  But the worst part is that the food has not improved, and if anything the portions are now smaller than before.However, the most disappointing new change is the service.  It's straight-up awful.  We sat at the bar on a recent weekday evening, and the bartender seriously looked like he wanted to murder every guest in the restaurant.  He was rude and unhelpful, and in between scowls he stood in the corner drinking a glass of wine.  On another occasion, our server was completely indifferent and could care less about our order, our drinks, or even pretending to be pleasant.  Finally, when we were sitting at the bar recently a small roach appeared from behind the condiments.  A worker noticed it and apologized, then gave us a free round of drinks.  Still, that's just gross.So, LB, get your shit together, fire the workers who are unhappy, and call the exterminator.  Otherwise I'll just go to Lighthouse from now on.",2.0
"The music at Le Barricou was the best I've heard at any restaurant in a minute. I asked the waitress and she told me that it was the manager's iPod.

While they do have outdoor seating in front, they can't serve alcohol outside because the liquor license doesn't extend itself outdoors. Since alcohol and brunch goes hand and hand for me (along with those in my group) we opted to eat inside towards the back.

While I wouldn't be able to eat this all the time it did provide me my sweet and salty fix in one dish sans accouterments. The bloody maria was pretty spicy and I enjoyed it was pretty good.They charged $1 extra because I opted for tequila instead of vodka for a bloody mary, on top of that drinks aren't included in brunch so the substitution charge made no sense.

SO why 1 star?We ordered the mussels. When we asked for some bread so we could dip it into the sauce (like everyone does with Mussels) we were told they were out of french bread and only had rolls. We said that's fine rolls are not a problem. That is when our waitress told us that the chef told her that we could not have any rolls because rolls shouldn't be dipped in the mussels. Instead we should just have no bread at all.Really? No bread for Mussels.....Our waitress told us that if she brought it to us the chef would scream at her after the restaurant was closed. based on that Ill never be back....unless they change chefs.",1.0
Absolutely delicious. We were a group of five and came in on a Sunday morning with hangovers after Santacon. Best way to fix a hangover? Drink some more!

"I went here for brunch on Sunday and was not disappointed! I ordered the Apple Omelette without the gruyere. Oh my god. It was amazing... just the right combination of sweet and savory. Normally I love cheese, but I think the omelette was perfect without it. I also tried bites of the duck confit hash and the steak & eggs. They were also delicious, but I think the apple omelette was the best. The ONLY thing I wasn't crazy about was the merguez.

The floor was clearly dirty, but so were the apron on the waitress, so may be they get clean only once a week?Anyway fter a long wait of 27 minutes, listening to really bad pop,, I finally got my eggs benedict, but the guy who served me was so sweaty, it was all over his face, that I wonder if some end up on my plate or not. So no, it wasn't a great experience. I tried to forget about the sloppiness and focus on my plate, but it was kind of hard.",2.0

"An amazing little spot!   This was my first meal of 2012, and if it was any indication of the year in food to come, I will be totally satisfied.  There was a bit of a wait, but we just walked around the block (see if you can find Steve from Blue's Clues' house...hint:  it's blue.)  and came back and our table was ready.  The hostess was very good about making sure she knew who everyone waiting was and letting us know how long it would be.  I ordered the spinach and goat cheese croissant, which also comes with 2 sunnyside eggs and a little salad.  It was unbelievably amazing.  So simple, so delicious.  Everything got dipped into the egg yolk, of course, and everything was GONE from the plate in less than 10 minutes.  Usually during brunch or any meal out with friends, it takes me forever to finish because I'm too busy gabbing away.  Not so this time, I let my friends talk and focused on the unbelievably buttery, garlicky, tangy, creamy plate in front of me.  Definitely recommend this place.  Take a walk.  Take a bus.  Take a train.  Take a plane!  Also, try the absinthe drip and let me know how it is.",5.0

You won't be sorry.Everything about this place was comfortable, and that made the food that much more enjoyable. Also, brunch until 6pm on Sat/Sun? I'm sold.Oh, and this place is cash only.

I had a mimosa and if you're into bloody Mary's I heard they're pretty tasty. My friend and I shared the pancakes and the mushroom/spinach omelette which was plenty of food! Both were yummy and the side salad on the plate was excellent as well. Will def go again!,5.0
"I went here for brunch on Sunday and was not disappointed! I ordered the Apple Omelette without the gruyere. Oh my god. It was amazing... just the right combination of sweet and savory. Normally I love cheese, but I think the omelette was perfect without it. I also tried bites of the duck confit hash and the steak & eggs. They were also delicious, but I think the apple omelette was the best. The ONLY thing I wasn't crazy about was the merguez. I ordered a side of it as per the suggestion of others, but was severely underwhelmed. It was too greasy for my taste - the others at my table agreed.I'll be coming back here again... I've got my eye on those pancakes..",4.0
"I went there today for brunch because of all the great reviews.Food is average and full of garlic, so quite hard to digest, there is a lot of employees but there isn't really anyone taking care of you. The main turn down is the cleanest of the place. I went there at 11am ( the opening), yet there were still food and one dirty fork under my chair. The floor was clearly dirty, but so were the apron on the waitress, so may be they get clean only once a week?Anyway fter a long wait of 27 minutes, listening to really bad pop,, I finally got my eggs benedict, but the guy who served me was so sweaty, it was all over his face, that I wonder if some end up on my plate or not. So no, it wasn't a great experience. I tried to forget about the sloppiness and focus on my plate, but it was kind of hard.",2.0

"An amazing little spot!   This was my first meal of 2012, and if it was any indication of the year in food to come, I will be totally satisfied.  There was a bit of a wait, but we just walked around the block (see if you can find Steve from Blue's Clues' house...hint:  it's blue.)  and came back and our table was ready.  The hostess was very good about making sure she knew who everyone waiting was and letting us know how long it would be.  I ordered the spinach and goat cheese croissant, which also comes with 2 sunnyside eggs and a little salad.  It was unbelievably amazing.  So simple, so delicious.  Everything got dipped into the egg yolk, of course, and everything was GONE from the plate in less than 10 minutes.  Usually during brunch or any meal out with friends, it takes me forever to finish because I'm too busy gabbing away.  Not so this time, I let my friends talk and focused on the unbelievably buttery, garlicky, tangy, creamy plate in front of me.  Definitely recommend this place.  Take a walk.  Take a bus.  Take a train.  Take a plane!  Also, try the absinthe drip and let me know how it is.",5.0

"Great service from the door to picking up the check! Fast service as far as ordering drinks & food considering how busy they were. I ordered the Croque Madame which was phenomenal!! Its two slices of French Toast, thin slices of ham & smothered in Gruyere cheese. My sister had the  Croissant with Ham & Gruyere cheese which she loved! We brought out appetites so between us we also shared an order of French Pancakes. These are a MUST!! They resemble oversized old fashioned or glazed donuts. They serve it with a scoop of strawberry flavored butter & fresh fruit. YUM!!",4.0
"I love this place. The decor is charming, and there's a lot of natural light. The staff is pretty nice and accommodating.I usually go on about small nuances and then get to the food, but this isn't necessary here. Go with friends, go on a date, just go and have the croque madame. That dish is so incredible. The sunny side up egg, the pommes frites, the greens, THAT BREAD. You won't be sorry.Everything about this place was comfortable, and that made the food that much more enjoyable. Also, brunch until 6pm on Sat/Sun? I'm sold.Oh, and this place is cash only. ATM in the rear. Bonus points for having an ATM; there's nothing worse than being in a cash-only spot without cash and having to leave the restaurant to find a machine.",5.0

We did get plenty of refills on our coffee though, which was delicious!As for the food, my friend got the pancakes and I got the spinach and mushroom omelet. The portions were enormous! The pancakes were not normal pancakes -- it was like a pancake souffle. They were sooo amazing. My friend, who can normally eat an entire pizza himself, couldn't even finish the pancakes! The omelet was really tasty as well, but the thing I remembered most was the pancakes...

It was worth it.I was a little apprehensive that I had only dreamed about the deliciousness of the pancakes. Nope, they were the same mouth-watering deliciousness... Fluffy on the inside and crispy and chewy on the sides. And just as enormous! Even with my friend's help, I couldn't finish them. What can I say?

"[ Part 9 of Sophie's April Weekend in New York series ]After an exquisite happy many hours at Peter's, most of us headed to Le Barricou for a much needed meal. I don't know why I thought this place was close; we ended up walking quite a bit. Or maybe it just seemed really long because I was hungry and tired and possibly had to pee.On the way there we called to check if they would have a table for us upon our arrival; the estimate they gave us was about ten minutes, which was on point.Le Barricou is an aesthetically pleasing restaurant that, although a bit too dark, delivers a nice ambiance. Also, they have awesome hand soap.I wasn't terribly impressed by the dinner menu but, with such glowing reviews, I figured the food had to be excellent. We shared the escargots and a plate of three cheeses.The escargots had a great texture. They were out of their shells and drowned in butter, which was all I could taste. The cheeses were good; they came with delicious crackers, apple slices, and candied walnuts.Boyfriend had the burger, which didn't have much going for it aside from the meat being cooked medium-rare as requested and the blue cheese (extra) not being overpowering. The beef, he said, tasted like any other run-of-the-mill beef. Additionally, he could taste more char than anything else. The bun was okay but dry; what's more, the only condiments offered were yellow mustard and ketchup.Yellow mustard and ketchup are fine at McDonald's -- and don't get me wrong, I like Mickey D's for what it is: a cheap fast food joint. I don't mean to get all snobby and shit, but I'd expect a bit more for a $13 burger ($14.50 with cheese).I had a better experience with my croque-monsieur. It tasted exactly like a croque-monsieur should taste, down to the the grilled flavor of the bread; this was a large improvement over the last croque-monsieur I had at a restaurant. Still, I wasn't blown away. Perhaps I fell out of love with croque-monsieurs?The frites at Le Barricou are crazy good. They were perfectly fried and seasoned; I could eat that for dinner every day.I recall that our dining companions enjoyed their respective meals. We shared a bottle of white wine (which a couple of us prefer over red wine); although I don't know much about wine, I will say that this one tasted great and went down smoothly.

"Regularly go to L B for brunch and occasionally for dinner. In my opinion it's the best brunch in Williamsburg. Usual wait time is 20-40 minutes but totally worth it. Great environment and decor, friendly wait staff, nice fireplace waiting area in back dining room.Recommended dishes for brunch include the GIGANTIC pancake with fresh fruit, the duck confit hash or my favorite, the Le Barricou sandwich which is a grilled chicken breast with pickled onions and herb mayo on a charred baguette for $11. Dinner options include a wonderful selection of moules ( mussels) prepared in a variety of ways. I prefer the moules provincial. The French fries could be better as they are the shoe string cut but still delicious.Great beer and wine selection and an amazing Bloody Mary...best in the city in my humble opinion.

My date had the coq a vin i think.  The rooster in wine sauce.  it was good, not as good as the duck but it was good.  Her portion was pretty big and had some tasty mashed potatoes.  She said the meat was a little dry.  Also we had some drinks there (i forgot what we drank but the drinks were interesting and well made)  Definitely deserves a revisit!",4.0

Faux-French that fails to impress. Hostess is rude. Food is slow (arrived 1 hour after we ordered) and over salted. Found hard bits of plastic in the burger and our server came out and offered us a free side. Management didn't care about the whole thing. There are so many options in the area. Skip Le Barricou and head somewhere else.,2.0
BEST French Toast EVER! I die for it. Duck Confit Hash is also ridiculously tasty!,5.0
"Regularly go to L B for brunch and occasionally for dinner. In my opinion it's the best brunch in Williamsburg. Usual wait time is 20-40 minutes but totally worth it. Great environment and decor, friendly wait staff, nice fireplace waiting area in back dining room.Recommended dishes for brunch include the GIGANTIC pancake with fresh fruit, the duck confit hash or my favorite, the Le Barricou sandwich which is a grilled chicken breast with pickled onions and herb mayo on a charred baguette for $11. Dinner options include a wonderful selection of moules ( mussels) prepared in a variety of ways. I prefer the moules provincial. The French fries could be better as they are the shoe string cut but still delicious.Great beer and wine selection and an amazing Bloody Mary...best in the city in my humble opinion. If you find yourself in williamsburg and looking for a quaint affordable brunch or dinner and like French food, L B is the place to go.",5.0

I had the omelette with apple, bacon, and gruyere cheese served with letttuce with a light balsamic tasting glaze. The taste of the sweet tart like apples matched the gooey gruyere and salty bacon very well. My cafe latte was also delightful, served in a mason jar for full effect. My parents enjoyed the bloody marys very much even though I would say they are not big cocktail/hangover drinkers. The Eggs Benedict served with home fries was probably the best I've ever seen as far as presenttion and the home fries were by far the tastiest I'v ever tried, probably because they were drenched in duck fat or something not so good but oh soooo French.The duck confit hash is a true orgasmic experience, with the crispy duck so tasty you feel like a dickhead for swallowing too fast.Cap it off with no wait at 10 am on a Sunday and the fact you're leaving Brooklyn for Paris when you step through Le Barricou's doors and this is a must stop on the Williamsburg restaurant express.",5.0

On one occasion, there was a guy using a laptop not ten feet away from me (it was early, the place was mostly empty) and his screen was directly in my field of vision. Very distracting in a dark environment like this. The server said there was nothing she could do about it. Brunch here is a train wreck. There are a lot of tables. And a tiny kitchen. That is just not a winning equation. The dishes are generic W-burg brunch fare, nothing special. You want french toast? Go to Jimmy's Diner and let's have a discussion about french toast. My food took close to an hour on my first trip, and almost as long on my 'second chance' trip. No complimentary drink or even an apology either time -- just cold eggs. It's ironic to read a review where the owner vehemently defended this place against using heat lamps -- might not be a bad idea.

I had some of the best pancakes in Brooklyn as well as a really amazing lobster omelette...the place is packed and has a healthy wait time, but it is well worth it.My only complaint with the french inspired fare at Le Barricou is that the menu rarely changes. I would be more impressed with a seasonally crafted menu. Also, the vegetable risotto has corn in it. Who puts corn in a risotto?There is plenty of seating at Le Barricou (though it does get crowded at peak hours) and this makes it an ideal place to bring a group of friends. It's not overly expensive and it's rather approachable.

"I just went to Le Barricou for the 3rd time.  I figure, try it 3 times, maybe somewhere in there they can redeem the last experience but, maybe it was the fact that I was already skeptical on arrival but, it was less than impressive again.We were 6 people which can be annoying yes, also our waitress was on her first night working there (which she promptly told us) so mistakes were to be expected.  The app's didn't take forever which was a plus up from the last time I was there when our food took over an hour.  Our drinks came pretty quickly too which is also a step up.  We were missing an app, no big deal - happens.Then, we were missing a main.  A main that takes a long time to cook, a main that was told ""the printer must not have printed that particular order"".Come on lady, don't lie to us.  We get it, you're stressed out, its your first night but really?  Apologies go a long way.Our table was then taken over by a lady who knew what she was doing which was nice but, our initial server refused to look any of us in the eye for the rest of the night.Thanks for comping desert...  Maybe the printer that didn't print our duck con fit for the kitchen should have accidentally not printed our ""duck comme free""?3 stars because i actually really enjoyed the mac n' cheese gratin but, all in all - its a bit pricey for the overall experience.",3.0
"Dear Le Barricou,          You drive me crazy. You depress & confuse me. You convinced me that upon leaving I'd be staring up at the Ta Tour Eiffel or maybe a few steps away from the Champs-Élysées. But no. I was merely in Williamsburg across the street from my dirty car which was surrounded by even dirtier snow. It was cold.The Onion Soup which was top notch. Best I've ever had. I also had the salmon which was one of the daily specials.  It was heavenly.  My boyfriend had the risotto which I tried and was actually very tasty.  I tend to have very high standards for risotto and theirs exceeded all expectations. but the highlight of my night came with the creme brulée. It was JUST like the best I had in Paris. It explains my delusions.Congratulations Le Barricou. You have that je ne sais quoi. You missed a 5th star because your service wasn't on par with your deliciousness.",4.0
"I'm a fan of any place with solid brunch offerings and a killer cocktail list that I can drink at noon, so they pretty much had me at Chartreuse. Loved the ""Final Word"" which is a Rye Whiskey variation on a Last Word. Great overall brunch experience and value, and a cool vibe that I'd be happy to come back to pretty much anytime.",4.0
"I have returned to Le Barricou many times since my review, and I'm still in love. It remains my favorite restaurant. Every dish I've ordered has been impeccable. Every friend I have brought there  has raved about it. What can I say? It's my spot. The service is always attentive. The atmosphere is always laid back. And the food is always a mouthgasm.If they have the grilled octopus appetizer, do yourself a favor and order it. It is superb. Another standout special was the seared salmon, which I still dream about.If ordering from the regular menu, you cannot fail with the beef bourguignon, escargot, skate or cabecou. These are my standbys, and they only get better each time I order them. Do order yourself some wine when you go. I love their wine list ...",5.0
"this place was about an hour wait for two people on a saturday (around 1pm).we finally got seated around 2.the place is kind of snug as we had to sit at a 6 person table with 2 other people sitting at the other end of the table. conversations didn't overlap but it was inconvenient getting in and out of the table because i had to bother the people sitting next to me. we ordered the duck confit and the steak and eggs. i also go the apple cider (virgin).the waiter kindly came back to tell us that the kitchen was backed up and that the food would be a few more minutes. my bf liked that the waiter was kind enough to tell us that instead of making us wait (which most places do). however, i already waited an hour and was waiting an extra 20-30 minutes to eat--at least hook up with some free bread to nibble on.the portions were on the smaller end and i was initially worried that my bf and i would get hungry.the duck was pretty dry.my hangar steak was tiny but cooked well and flavorful (maybe a tad bit salty).overall the food was more of a 3.5 stars for me.the apple cider was good (they had a real cinnamon stick in there).since there is no such thing as .5 stars, i will round up and give 4 stars.",4.0
"Very good, but not as good as I thought it'd be. As for brunch, skip the hamburger and get something with more bread on it. The prices are way decent, and that's a reason for you to get a drink. I've resolved to stop ordering drinks, so sometimes I wonder if I am taking advantage of inexpensive food at seemingly expensive places. I prefer Anella in Greenpoint, but I'll go back if you want to go.",3.0
"I've been here a couple times. It just doesn't do anything for me. It's not great, it's not cheap, it's not relaxing, I just walk out thinking wow, what a terrible idea that was. On one occasion, there was a guy using a laptop not ten feet away from me (it was early, the place was mostly empty) and his screen was directly in my field of vision. Very distracting in a dark environment like this. The server said there was nothing she could do about it. Brunch here is a train wreck. There are a lot of tables. And a tiny kitchen. That is just not a winning equation. The dishes are generic W-burg brunch fare, nothing special. You want french toast? Go to Jimmy's Diner and let's have a discussion about french toast. My food took close to an hour on my first trip, and almost as long on my 'second chance' trip. No complimentary drink or even an apology either time -- just cold eggs. It's ironic to read a review where the owner vehemently defended this place against using heat lamps -- might not be a bad idea. Williamsburg has a lot of restaurants, and specifically a lot of great French restaurants. Pates Et Traditions, Juliette (to an extent), Fanny, etc. All of those places are more enjoyable, more reasonably priced, and of higher quality than this place. Don't bother.",1.0
"The brunch here is even better than the dinner. I had some of the best pancakes in Brooklyn as well as a really amazing lobster omelette...the place is packed and has a healthy wait time, but it is well worth it.My only complaint with the french inspired fare at Le Barricou is that the menu rarely changes. I would be more impressed with a seasonally crafted menu. Also, the vegetable risotto has corn in it. Who puts corn in a risotto?There is plenty of seating at Le Barricou (though it does get crowded at peak hours) and this makes it an ideal place to bring a group of friends. It's not overly expensive and it's rather approachable. A wood burning stove in the far back room is situated amongst bookshelves and other antique knick-knacks creating a warm space perfect for lingering over a glass of inexpensive house wine. There are some creative cocktails on the menu as well.",4.0
"i would come here every brunch if i could. I'm in love with their food. if you're ordering the pancakes (most amazing you'll ever have), just know that they take 30ish minutes to cook. it's usually packed at brunch, so go early or late. their service is on the nicer side, for brooklyn.

"This review is a long time coming, but Le Barricou is probably my favorite restaurant ever.  Like, so much we got married here.  We rented out the place on a Sunday night, and the service and food were absolutely amazing.  My family will not stop talking about coming back for the coq au vin- and they live thousands of miles away.The wedding happened last September, and we have been back several times in the interim.  Never have I been disappointed- the food is always delicious, and the service always accommodating and congenial.The bartender mixes a mean cocktail, and the liquor selection is excellent.  Brunch is a fun and cheerful event, and dinner is low-lit and romantic.  The only thing to keep in mind is the joint is now cash only- so be prepared, although there is an ATM in the back.Really just fabulous, I couldn't recommend something more highly.",5.0
"I've only had brunch here, but the food I've tried is excellent. The Benedict has real Hollandaise-- not that packaged glop lots of places love to use.

I can understand how people can say the service is a bit inattentive, but if you've been to any good brunch place in the area on a nice day, good luck getting waited on hand and foot. The servers here are at least nice to you, unlike some places in the East Village I've been.  Just chill out, have a couple of drinks and you'll be even more stoked when you get your food.",4.0
"I did it, so finally. I brunched at Le Barricou. For six solid hours. It was a rainy Saturday (Sunday?) afternoon when I met a fellow Yelper at Le Barricou. I was slightly fuzzy as we ordered coffee at the bar. The decor felt like my grandmother's house, only nothing like my actual grandmother's house. But it was cozy and nostalgic nonetheless.When we were finally seated in the front of the restaurant (not an absurdly long wait at all) we immediately got to the drinking. I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered, but you bet your bum that over the span of six hours I tasted many a-cocktail from the old cocktail menu....all superbly delicious. The ambiance - wet, rainy day, fellow Yelp company, perfectly mixed cocktails - was enough to warrant satisfaction out of even the driest of prudes, so naturally, I was quite content. But the nail in the coffin was that apple omelet. Lord, have mercy. I don't even remember what else was on the menu, or if I ate anything else during the six hours that I dined there, but that apple omelet....Lord, have mercy. Le Barricou, may we meet again.",4.0

"What makes a great date place? I thought about this question before sitting down to review Le Barricou and I think i can safely say that this restaurant is one great place for a date. How, you ask, can you know such a thing when there are so many factors to consider, like ambience, taste, footsie-under-the-table potential? Simply ask yourself this:If someone took me to Le Barricou for our first date, would I put out? Hell yeah, I would put out. I would put ALL THE WAY out because damn, this place is just that good.After arriving at the restaurant with my female companion (she asked me out), we were immediately greeted by the waitress as M'siuer and Madamoiselle and directed towards a table. The place was very quiet and we were only one of two parties at 9pm on a Saturday. In terms of decor, it was ideal. Dimmed lighting, rustic decorations, lit candles and fresh flowers on every table, daily soup and fish specials written on mini chalkboards against the wall. My first thoughts: This date of mine is pulling out all the stops to get in my pants... points for effort, but I'll reserve judgment for when the food arrives.Between us, we ordered the soup du jour, a chilled roasted red pepper soup ($8), which was absolutely delicious and a perfect appetizer with a kick; the slice of avocado in the soup provided a great balance. And we got the escargots in garlic and parsley butter, which was out of this world. Our waitress was happy to provide us with 2 extra bread baskets to wipe up the delicious sauce with. Amazing and a half. Given the way our appetizers turned out, my date was well on her way to the Promised Land.For our entrees, I got moules provencale ($14) and she the coq au vin ($12.5). Coq? Really? Not very subtle, missy, but I'll let you slide on that one because this dish of chicken stewed in red wine was impressively cooked. The chicken fell right off the bones and tasted superb. My mussels came in a stew of tomatoes, white wine, garlic and chipotle peppers and were, again, flawless. Every mussel was juicy and flavor-packed. The pommes frites that came with it were nice and crunchy, but I ended up dumping them into the remaining mussel stew and letting them soak up that deliciousness before devouring them. Aren't mussels aphrodisiacs? Well-played.I should also mention that the cocktail selection looked pretty solid and very well-priced ($8-11). My date got the Chatelaine ($8), a mixture of gin, elderflower liquor, white wine and pomegranate juice. I took a sip and it was really tasty and interesting, though I was more tempted to order the Penicillin cocktail for its chamomile-infused scotch. I settled for just a Kronnenburg ($5) though. I'm not THAT easy.So let's get to the bottom line. How good is Le Barricou? Just know this. After our dinner, we went to see the 3rd Twilight movie aka the worst movie ever made, with the ugliest and most boring female lead to ever be on a big screen. But because of the amazing dinner we had, I sat through it. And I let her take me home. Oh yeah, this definitely calls for a high-five.",5.0

"The light of my life, Ariel Y, came to town so we decided to go on a search for one of our favorite dishes... MUSSELS. Le Barricou is right by my job and has five different kinds. We, clearly, had to go there and try them all. Unfortunately, when we arrived we realized that was a ridiculous aspiration and settled on an app to share and two orders of mussels. I had no intention of embarrassing myself in front of some snot nosed server so i tried to avoid saying anything in french. Instead of asking our waitress what she thought of the Moules au Pernod, i asked her which of the mussels were her favorites (i was certain she was going to mention the ones i had in mind, that way i would hear her pronunciation of the dish). Sneaky. I know. She didn't. However, she was so helpful and didnt laugh when i finally attempted pronounce something myself that we went with one of her recommendations.The bestie and I shared the grilled asparagus and crispy poached egg appetizer. Delicious! Ive been dreaming about that fried poached egg since our dinner. The app was on the small side but im not complaining cause it left lots of room for the big showThese mussels have also made their way into my dreams. We ordered the more traditional Provencale and the little more adventurous A la Danoise (the waitress' suggestion). The Provencale mussels came with tomatoes, white wine, garlic and chipotle peppers. A la Danoise was served in blue cheese, sage, shaved red onion, basil, and white wine. To my delight our bread basket was refilled a number of times, letting me get the very last bits of sauce. This place is adorable: cozy atmosphere, nice staff, and unbelievably delicious mussels. I would like to say i'll be back to try other things on the menu but i might be lying. I just want mussels. Just kidding.Not really.",5.0

"Met up with a friend here on a Thursday night around 7pm, and the place was completely empty. I liked this place a lot though - the coziness and decor was a nice escape from the overcast skies and empty streets outside. I""ve been to many French restaurants, so I give this place about 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4) because of the value of the food.Ambiance:Cute cozy interiors w/ dark wood, skylight, and a big back room for private parties. Nice environment for a date.Service:Good service (maybe because it was empty??) but the waitress described their food and specials very well, and suggested a great rose for me.Food/Drink:The menu was varied and served breakfast + dinner items. Nothing was out of the ordinary - just comfortable French cuisine you're used to. I started w/ the Rose, which was a strawberry grenache syrah. Nice and light, not too dry, not too sweet. A free dish of olives + bread was provided, normal stuff. I got the cauliflower soup w/ encrusted pieces of asparagus and parsley. The soup was pureed w/ some cream and so so so tasty. I also ordered an Endive + Arugula salad w/ apples, walnuts, and fried balls of ricotta (or some kind of soft cheese). The dressing was a lemon vinagraitte, which i loved. My friend ordered the Croque a Vin (chicken) and he said his was very tasty as well.The food was good and not too salty or overseasoned. The prices were very decent for French fare, which is why I bumped this place from 3.5 to 4 stars. I'd recommend this place, especially for the Williamsburg area. It's a find.",4.0

"Just went there for lunch on a Monday. This place has great ambiance and wonderful food. We ordered chilled soup, moules provencale, and homemade linguine.

"The light of my life, Ariel Y, came to town so we decided to go on a search for one of our favorite dishes... MUSSELS. Le Barricou is right by my job and has five different kinds. We, clearly, had to go there and try them all. Unfortunately, when we arrived we realized that was a ridiculous aspiration and settled on an app to share and two orders of mussels. I had no intention of embarrassing myself in front of some snot nosed server so i tried to avoid saying anything in french. Instead of asking our waitress what she thought of the Moules au Pernod, i asked her which of the mussels were her favorites (i was certain she was going to mention the ones i had in mind, that way i would hear her pronunciation of the dish). Sneaky. I know. She didn't. However, she was so helpful and didnt laugh when i finally attempted pronounce something myself that we went with one of her recommendations.The bestie and I shared the grilled asparagus and crispy poached egg appetizer. Delicious! Ive been dreaming about that fried poached egg since our dinner. The app was on the small side but im not complaining cause it left lots of room for the big showThese mussels have also made their way into my dreams. We ordered the more traditional Provencale and the little more adventurous A la Danoise (the waitress' suggestion). The Provencale mussels came with tomatoes, white wine, garlic and chipotle peppers. A la Danoise was served in blue cheese, sage, shaved red onion, basil, and white wine. To my delight our bread basket was refilled a number of times, letting me get the very last bits of sauce. This place is adorable: cozy atmosphere, nice staff, and unbelievably delicious mussels. I would like to say i'll be back to try other things on the menu but i might be lying. I just want mussels. Just kidding.Not really.",5.0
"Le Barricou is one of my favorite brunch places in Brooklyn. The food is delicious, especially the spinach and goat cheese croissant and the eggs florentine. And the french fries are yummy, too :)  Quick tip: try to go around Noon or 3 to beat the brunch crowd.",5.0
"Met up with a friend here on a Thursday night around 7pm, and the place was completely empty. I liked this place a lot though - the coziness and decor was a nice escape from the overcast skies and empty streets outside. I""ve been to many French restaurants, so I give this place about 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4) because of the value of the food.Ambiance:Cute cozy interiors w/ dark wood, skylight, and a big back room for private parties. Nice environment for a date.Service:Good service (maybe because it was empty??) but the waitress described their food and specials very well, and suggested a great rose for me.Food/Drink:The menu was varied and served breakfast + dinner items. Nothing was out of the ordinary - just comfortable French cuisine you're used to. I started w/ the Rose, which was a strawberry grenache syrah. Nice and light, not too dry, not too sweet. A free dish of olives + bread was provided, normal stuff. I got the cauliflower soup w/ encrusted pieces of asparagus and parsley. The soup was pureed w/ some cream and so so so tasty. I also ordered an Endive + Arugula salad w/ apples, walnuts, and fried balls of ricotta (or some kind of soft cheese). The dressing was a lemon vinagraitte, which i loved. My friend ordered the Croque a Vin (chicken) and he said his was very tasty as well.The food was good and not too salty or overseasoned. The prices were very decent for French fare, which is why I bumped this place from 3.5 to 4 stars. I'd recommend this place, especially for the Williamsburg area. It's a find.",4.0

"I would have given this place 4 stars if the service wasn't as horrible as it was.  It seemed that we were completely invisible to our waitress the entire night.  We wanted another round of drinks, but gave up on waiting for someone to take our order.  I had to hail down the bus boy to ask our waitress to give us the check.  Besides the inattentive service, the food here was surprisingly good.  I was here for the late brunch service on a Saturday and ordered the chicken sandwich.  The sandwich and potatoes it came with were fabulous!The house wine tastes like Trader Joe's.This place has great ambiance here is very chic and comforting.  I like the fireplace in the back where you can sit and relax with a few cocktails.Overall, if I'm strolling around Williamsburg I would probably stop back in here again.  But hopefully next time my waitress won't ignore me.",3.0
"This place is gorgeous inside.  There is a gorgeous fire place in the back and a wooden ledges and adorable water closets.  Also, I noticed a huge line for the brunch when I went on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm--almost half an hour to 40 minute wait, but really worth it.   It was packed filled with people.  There are huge portions for their brunch.  My friend's pancakes looked like a 3 layered cake.",4.0

"Went here last night, looking for a great French place to try in Brooklyn.

Coq au vin is very good. Chicken is not dry but juicy and tender. Mashed potato is excellent. So buttery and creamy. Tastes like risotto. Serving portions are large. I didnt have room for desert.   (^) Candle lit and romantic.  Waitress was super attentive and nice.,5.0
"Food was ok.  Service was absent.  Their supposedly ""amazing"" fries were SO oily, overcooked and just gross.  The place was near empty and the service was still somehow really slow.  The employees just stood at the end of the bar chatting, meanwhile when we got our food, it was obvious that it had been sitting for a few minutes.  Soggy and no good.  I'm sure their food can be good when they care, but that's not what we experienced.It should also be noted that it stinks like mold inside.  Gross.",2.0
"Le Barricou is adorable and one of my favorite places to bring visitors for a nice, delicious meal. I usually get the mussels and frites, no ketchup needed! Just dip those yummy suckers in the mussel sauce, UGH SO GOOD. I went there for brunch for the first time this weekend and was surprised to see it much busier then any dinner I've had there. GET THE APPLE OMELETTE. The waitstaff is always friendly, I love the decor, and the drinks are awesome (although the bartender is almost TOO good, and he definitely knows it)",4.0
"brunch here was worth the 45 minute wait! the place is huge: tables that could fit parties of 6-8 up front, followed by a long banquette, and then the sunlit back room with that awesome wood-burning fireplace, complete with comfy couch and chairs. we happily bided our time there.i had the spinach and mushroom omelette -- didn't skimp on ingredients, cheese was oozey, but eggs weren't that fluffy. the home fries more than made up for that tho -- that savory tantalizing smell pervading the entire restaurant? that's the home fries. you must try them. pan-seared skin and deliciously soft on the inside. friends had the duck hash confit, and the spicy lamb sausage. the merguez was particularly gamey and a bit on the sweet side -- definitely had better. both dishes had perfectly cooked eggs... over easy with yolks still runny.the three of us shared the pancakes... which i can't stop raving about! a stack of two the size of dinner plates, each about an inch thick, with a slightly crispy edges (from all that butter on the griddle, naturally), and covered with fruit and strawberry butter. they were like a soft spongy supermoist cake. i want some more NOW. other notes: la colombe coffee w/free refills, heard about complimentary pastry baskets but we didn't see one, bloody mary has a kick to it!",4.0
"Had a really lovely brunch experience. This place is exactly what I'd hoped a French bistro in Williamsburg would be - very solid and satisfying food (particularly enjoyed the namesake sandwich), perfect drinks (both alcoholic and coffee options), and a cute without being too kitschy environs. Particular plus: we stayed for a very long time (2 and a half seatings), and were never made to feel rushed or unwelcome, as many similar brunch places on a Saturday understandably tend to do.",4.0

"I brought 2 extreme Manhattanites here for their first trip to ""seedy"" Brooklyn (their words not mine).  They have notoriously high expectations and are not afraid to voice their opinions to waiters, managers, basically anyone who will listen, which sometimes proves to be a bit embarrassing.  Tension was high as we sat down for brunch, but subsided once we got our bloody marys.  Now, I'm not a huge fan of bloody marys but I was in dire need of a hair of the dog cure and it was SO GOOD.  Honestly, one of the best I've had in NYC.  I had the merguez sausage with 2 poached eggs and a side salad.  The salad was great and the sausage was really, really tasty.  Not sure if it's house made but it seemed like it.  One of my eggs was super watery, which I hate about poached eggs.  I make them for myself all the time and I'm really careful about drying them off before I plate them.  It's a shame because they were cooked perfectly, the water just ruined the yolk (the best part!).  A friend had the duck confit hash which was delicious.  Really psyched I live nearby-- this seems like a solid choice for brunch and I'll definitely give it a try for dinner.",4.0

"My friends and I came here for Sunday brunch. Le Barricou is French country style bistro. A couple of things that make this place distinctive are the big ceiling fan, wood burning fireplace, piano, and Spanish songs playing in the background (hmm?). We waited quite a while to sit but our hostess was very attentive giving us mini updates about our table. I ordered the duck confit hash - confit duck (pieces here and there), caramelized onions, potatoes, two sunny side up eggs, and a side salad. The gooey eggs covered the sautéed duck meat, onions and potatoes. I love brunch yet I find the menu everywhere repetitive with its eggs, sausages, home fries, and toast. I was ecstatic to find duck on the brunch menu. Simple, yes. Delicious, yes. I do wish it came with bread or I should've ordered the toast - I left a bit hungry. The boyfriend ordered the Le Barricou Sandiwich - we didn't taste the watermelon radish or the feta. The rest of the components: grilled chicken, red onions and creamy caper mayonnaise was mild to my taste. The bread was delicious... I wish I knew what kind it was (I'm bread illiterate). The hand-cut pommes frites were super good too.  I didn't get to try my friends steak and eggs but he liked it. One thing I did not like was the Bloody Mary. I usually do not order BMs...

"Note:  this review is for Sunday BrunchFirst off:  I have zero complaints here.  Brunch here was about as perfect as it gets.  I had the Merguez + Eggs, and my girlfriend had the Spinach egg white omelet.  Both were delicious, with plenty of flavor.  The most notable, standout part of the food was the texture, however--everything was crisp and crunchy where appropriate, and smooth and soft where appropriate.  Honestly, this is one of those things you don't realize you're missing until you find a place that does it right.The staff was busy, but still polite.  Everything came quickly and exactly as ordered.  The prices are also reasonable, falling in line with the other places nearby.The one negative is that you WILL have to wait for a table, sometimes longer than you would like.  However, I count this to be a symptom of how successful this little restaurant is.  It's a small price to pay for delicious food.In terms of brunch, Le Barricou is the real deal.  There are no brunch gimmicks here, only great food and good service.",5.0

I went for brunch this morning for the first time with my boyfriend. We both ordered the eggs Norwegian...both of our eggs were cold. I don't think I've ever had cold eggs before? But there was no way I could finish my food! Now as we sit here we both find ourselves with stomach aches so I don't think we will be going back. Plus the hostess and waiters were a little too pretentious for my taste. That being said there were plenty of other people waiting in line for a seat so there are people who have better experiences.,2.0
"Le Barricou is great.Their food is consistently tasty from brunch to dinner.Croissants at brunch are delicious. The skirt steak was juicy and flavorful. Hot chocolate, yum.Nice decor, dim lighting, and amazing music. I've asked what music was playing every time I have eaten there.Friendly service, except once when my girlfriend asked for some coffee, wanted to use the mug from her hot chocolate, and the waiter thought we were trying to cheat them out of the $2 or however much for coffee.Craft paper and golf pencils at the table make for fun doodles.",4.0
"A great find!   The spicy lamb sausage and eggs with fries and a green salad was outstanding.  The staff was friendly, attentive, and played great music.   The atmosphere was charming, the room is very nicely done with a piano and fireplace in the back.  I would definitely recommend.",4.0
"So overall this place was pretty awesome.We waited 40 minutes for a table on a busy Sunday and it was totally worth it. It was cute and calm inside, lovely music and had pretty good service.The hostess was awesome, so nice and really concerned with getting us a seat especially after the insane downpour of rain. Our server was okay, she forgot butter and syrup and cream, etc. But the busboy in our section was superb!! He basically took better care of us than she did. Thankfully we found out that the tips were pooled or else I would have just given him the tip!The Eggs Benedict w/Bacon was outstanding! And the pancakes (which look hugely overwhelming) were so delicious...with strawberry butter - whoa! The home fries were cooked to perfection and someday I'll go back and have their bloody mary, which also looked amazing...Definitely a treat. Good place for friends or a cute date. Interested to try their other food. Will of course go back!",4.0
"GREAT breakfast.  I have only gone to Le Barricou at primetime on Sundays and have not waited for more than 10 minutes.  The alcoholic breakfast drinks are delectable, but it seemed like the bar was bit understaffed, so it took a little while to get them.  That's the only gripe and it was minimal.  Eat brunch here.",4.0
"I love this place! The food is so yum yum..from the Croque Madame which is to die for , to the yummy caramelized french toast to the Mergueze sausage.

"If your heart aches for the ultimate Parisian experience but you don't have the time (or cash) to front for a flight, just head to Le Barricou for the ultimate faux French fête.

"Piping hot escargot, I wish you came with a warning label - the roof of my mouth - burnt for days!That being said (and ""that"" not being a criticism, but perhaps a remark on my carelessness) - I liked it here. Not often does one find French food of reasonable prices, and still good quality. Portions are indeed on the smaller side, but still doable. I liked the escargot, despite their burning me, and they were a bit salty (perhaps this is true of all escargot? The only other time I had them, they were also salty). Loved the cheese plate. Loved my drink, the hot toddie.The bf got Coq au Vin, which I thought was fine butnot great (I make it better myself, mes chers...)Cute atmosphere, very nonchalant and relaxing. Good for smaller groups as well as larger - there is a big space in the back area (the place is much longer than it looks) with room for larger parties.",4.0
"We have lived and been eating out in NYC since 1995. I  personally have worked in the food industry on and off from 1993-2006 in MA, New York and London...and never in my entire experience of serving food or being served food have I ever had the experience we had last night at Le Barricou.With all the availability to good dinning, especially French in the city, one would think that a manager and their waitstaff would strive to provide competent and at least civil and respectable service to a party of four out for a nice dinner with some wine (a good tip sure to follow). We have never had such bad service as we did last night at Le Barricou on Grand Street in Williamsburg. So bad it was that we left and took our business right out the door before we could even put an order in!My recommendation, never go there! There are way too many restaurants in the city to waste your time at a place where the service is not friendly, our server kept touching her nose and face  while dictating the specials to us, and the language was the pits! If we heard one more time in a sentence the utterance of \""um\"" we were going to kill ourselves or her!To top that off the offense the manager and server took when we asked where their beef was sourced and whether it was sustainable farm or not was the most defensive I have ever seen, like we were suppose to have first hand knowledge of the farm mentioned in the menu?!It read \""all natural beef\"", well... so does Perdue! On their packages it reads \""All Natural Chicken\""!!! As we all know \""all natural\"" does tells us nothing about our food!Ces't la vie Le Barricou!!!!",1.0
"Underrated: the inclusion of fruit in savory foods. A feminine sweet-tooth inclines my palate towards the tart and toothsome; when perusing a menu, I'll inevitably cave at comfits and candied-reductions. This review is dedicated to the apple-and Gruyere-omelet at demure, unbranded Le Barricou (you'll have to find the name of the restaurant printed atop the menu hanging in their window). A gratifying reprieve from that brow-furrowing fork in the road - sweet brunch? or savory?, paired with bottomless coffee and set against an unpretentious and bustling backdrop = heaven. ~$10pp is the nail in the coffin; against many a moral fiber, I've actually found reason to frequent Brooklyn.",4.0
"I visit Le Barricou so often, I almost feel weird writing this review. Over the last few years I have gotten to know the owner and his mother, in addition to some of the servers, quite well. They have an outstanding menu that never gets boring and they make it a point to take care of their regulars. I LOVE this place so much that I decided to throw my 30th birthday party in their back room/wine lounge last June.I had family and friends traveling from all over the East coast for my party. The staff was super accommodating and aimed to please. The bill was large, but I knew how much it would be ahead of time, as I worked closely with the owner, Josh, to design a buffet menu and wine selection for my 50+ guests that would be within my budget. Everyone raved about the place! Most of my friends are artists or musicians, so we ended up closing the place down with a sing along on their upright piano. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday gathering!Great for a date, brunch with friends, or even alone (I used to go there a lot to write and drink wine by the fireplace in the winter time).Love you, Le Barricou! I've been out of town for five months, but will be back shortly! Can't wait!PS- Cash only, but there's an ATM in the back of the restaurant.

Based on several visits: this place is solid.  Good to bring the 'rents to when they visit your tiny apartment and you need to impress/decompress/assure them you do not live in total squaller...Great place to nurse a hangover at brunch.  Excellent place to celebrate with a few extra dollars (be sure to bring cash); emphasis on the food.,4.0
"This little restaurant is a gem in the middle of nowhere land.  I only say nowhere land, as I got off at Hewes station and was suddenly in suburbia, walking down Hooper to Grand.  It was a dismal experience ~ sorry to those who live there.But this restaurant is by far one of the best I have come across in my travels.  It is wonderfully understated, meticulous in their presentation with a hint of provincial warmth.  The food is delicious and well-portioned.  My friends had a heaping dish of mac n' cheese, while I was able to snack on a light bibb lettuce, pommes frites and such.  They have speciality drinks that delight and oysters.  I suppose what I appreciated was the attention to detail.  And the young male owner is hands on, serving tables.  And, I think it one of the most attractive men I have seen in New York.",4.0
"Overall a really solid brunch place. My spinach and goat cheese croissant was delicious and a very good proportion for only $9.50.

"Piping hot escargot, I wish you came with a warning label - the roof of my mouth - burnt for days!That being said (and ""that"" not being a criticism, but perhaps a remark on my carelessness) - I liked it here. Not often does one find French food of reasonable prices, and still good quality. Portions are indeed on the smaller side, but still doable. I liked the escargot, despite their burning me, and they were a bit salty (perhaps this is true of all escargot? The only other time I had them, they were also salty). Loved the cheese plate. Loved my drink, the hot toddie.The bf got Coq au Vin, which I thought was fine butnot great (I make it better myself, mes chers...)Cute atmosphere, very nonchalant and relaxing. Good for smaller groups as well as larger - there is a big space in the back area (the place is much longer than it looks) with room for larger parties.",4.0
"We have lived and been eating out in NYC since 1995. I  personally have worked in the food industry on and off from 1993-2006 in MA, New York and London...and never in my entire experience of serving food or being served food have I ever had the experience we had last night at Le Barricou.With all the availability to good dinning, especially French in the city, one would think that a manager and their waitstaff would strive to provide competent and at least civil and respectable service to a party of four out for a nice dinner with some wine (a good tip sure to follow). We have never had such bad service as we did last night at Le Barricou on Grand Street in Williamsburg. So bad it was that we left and took our business right out the door before we could even put an order in!My recommendation, never go there! There are way too many restaurants in the city to waste your time at a place where the service is not friendly, our server kept touching her nose and face  while dictating the specials to us, and the language was the pits! If we heard one more time in a sentence the utterance of \""um\"" we were going to kill ourselves or her!To top that off the offense the manager and server took when we asked where their beef was sourced and whether it was sustainable farm or not was the most defensive I have ever seen, like we were suppose to have first hand knowledge of the farm mentioned in the menu?!It read \""all natural beef\"", well... so does Perdue! On their packages it reads \""All Natural Chicken\""!!! As we all know \""all natural\"" does tells us nothing about our food!Ces't la vie Le Barricou!!!!",1.0
"Underrated: the inclusion of fruit in savory foods. A feminine sweet-tooth inclines my palate towards the tart and toothsome; when perusing a menu, I'll inevitably cave at comfits and candied-reductions. This review is dedicated to the apple-and Gruyere-omelet at demure, unbranded Le Barricou (you'll have to find the name of the restaurant printed atop the menu hanging in their window). A gratifying reprieve from that brow-furrowing fork in the road - sweet brunch? or savory?, paired with bottomless coffee and set against an unpretentious and bustling backdrop = heaven. ~$10pp is the nail in the coffin; against many a moral fiber, I've actually found reason to frequent Brooklyn.",4.0
"I visit Le Barricou so often, I almost feel weird writing this review. Over the last few years I have gotten to know the owner and his mother, in addition to some of the servers, quite well. They have an outstanding menu that never gets boring and they make it a point to take care of their regulars. I LOVE this place so much that I decided to throw my 30th birthday party in their back room/wine lounge last June.I had family and friends traveling from all over the East coast for my party. The staff was super accommodating and aimed to please. The bill was large, but I knew how much it would be ahead of time, as I worked closely with the owner, Josh, to design a buffet menu and wine selection for my 50+ guests that would be within my budget. Everyone raved about the place! Most of my friends are artists or musicians, so we ended up closing the place down with a sing along on their upright piano. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday gathering!Great for a date, brunch with friends, or even alone (I used to go there a lot to write and drink wine by the fireplace in the winter time).Love you, Le Barricou! I've been out of town for five months, but will be back shortly! Can't wait!PS- Cash only, but there's an ATM in the back of the restaurant.

"Le Barricou did not disappoint for our brunch experience! Hostess claimed a 30 minute wait but we were in the back in the ""lounge"" and time flew. It was crowded but well worth the wait (not bad because Alice's Teacup was like longer and there was no place to wait). It's a very laid back sort of place and you are never rushed to make your order, or rushed to leave. It's very kid friendly which never was a concern for me before but is now one of the things I notice about a place since becoming an aunt. Also the wait staff is efficient and friendly as is the hostess.We ordered the pancakes for me, egg scramble and the spinach mushroom omelette for my partners in crime.We got the drink special but it was so chunky, it was hard to drink. :) Tasted yummy though.Ok...the pancakes when they came were ginormous inch thick fluffy rounds topped with fruit. I am so glad I didn't eat the complimentary croissants. :) I think that would have meant I'd only eat a quarter of the top pancake because this plate held two of these crazy slabs.And yes, I'm sad because I just ate half of a pancake.

Everything on the menu is so incredibly reasonably priced for the quality of food they deliver - I have no idea how they do it.  The bar steak is of incredible value and quality that it blows every other bistro in the 5 boroughs out of the water.  BEST escargots i've EVER had.They stack each French imported shell with two escargots and pack each tight with garlic, parsley and butter - AND IT'S HIS MOTHER, SHARON'S RECIPE WHO YOU CAN FIND HELPING OUT IN THE RESTAURANT ALL THE TIME.The burger is awesome.  Though maybe not the best in town, it's perfect for what it is.  Fries are the perfect thickness, crispness, and well seasoned.And now.  My favorite dish - The Moules Provencale.Steamed mussels in a white wine, tomato, and chipotle broth served with a side of those delicious fries.The mussels are done just right, and the broth is amazing.  It's just the right mixture of French provencal tradition with a heat and spice that's so well suited to the modern American palate.I love slurping the broth like it's a soup and soaking it up with the fries.Their wine list is also incredibly well versed.  The Bordeaux that they offer by the glass is the same that is offered at Balthazar if you actually have any questions about the menu's integrity.  I've also ordered many great bottles of wine here from Grenache to Gamay.  But, every single bottle that I've ordered here has been beyond satisfactory, and I will say again, at an incredibly reasonable price.Some of the other reviews on this site have made me twitch in frustration in regards to the overwhelming population of people who are too goddamn lazy to go to a restaurant to order something like a Bouillebaisse, and instead have it delivered to their apartment - only to complain about it.  To you I say:Spare the universe your bullshit opinion of a restaurant's fine quality food that you're too goddamn lazy to go taste for yourself in person.  Reviewing a restaurant in this way is like watching the trailer of a movie on youtube without actually seeing the movie and proclaiming that it sucks to your bullshit pack of idiot friends.Get a brain, a palate, and a sense of decency for God's sake.Finally, they've got a great selection of digestifs - wonderful ports, grappas, and calvados - not to mention the same high quality boutique coffee that is served in places like Daniel and Jean-Georges.  My girlfriend and I have made a vow to return to this restaurant once a month, and we'll be there on Valentine's Day for the prix-fixe menu to celebrate our anniversary.We love you guys.  We really do.",4.0

"duck, duck, duck......GOOSED!this sunday morning, i gathered a few friends for a great sunday brunch! i came here 2 times, memorized by the ""duck confit hash"". weeks over weeks has passed by and my girlfriend finally has time off from work! she also was anticipating what all the rant and rage is about, me speaking of this ""duck confit hash"" le barricou has to offer!when we arrived to the place, our party was seated promptly when i (the last one) arrived. that is of course, them (my party) waiting for an hour...the waitress came over and took the order for coffee... by the time the milk came by, our coffee was cold! by the time the brown sugars came, the cold coffee needed to be reheated!! ahhhh! the coffee blows!!! screw it! WE CAME FOR DUCK!!!the wait begins again...watching her happily chant with her co -workers...three our of six of us ordered the ""duck confit hash"", because i told them how great it was! we waited for a good 50/55 minutes for the food, which turned out to be cold! WTF?! COLD!!! well, we were all starved by then we didn't care! as i started digging into my plate to served my girlfriend a fork of DUCK, i felt like i got GOOSED! i scrambled my food around looking for DUCK! i asked my other guests, they told me they have very little duck but a WHOLE LOT OF BURNED POTATOES!!! hahaha.. i got it, the joke was on us... whatever... i waited for some eye contact with our waitress, and there was none. i PERSONALLY got up, approached the waitress and she told me that she will see that issue will be told to the manager. she said she'd get back to us with an answer to this matter. we waited and waited and waited...i had to get up AGAIN! and approach the waitress to ASK, ""WHAT THE FUCK?! WHERE'S MY DUCK?!"" (jk!)... i asked her, ""so, umm...what's going on with our dishes?"" she replied, the manager will attend to you, she is fully aware of the problem."" THIS MEANS - if i didn't get up, the wait would be longer?!?!? blah!as i sat watching the host wearing a blue top and black jeans that day approach the guests as they come in, she comes to me saying that SHE IS ALSO THE MANAGER. i guess they were short of staff that day, totally understandable. i explained the mishap on how the dish came out a few weeks ago till now. she didn't offer to add duck to it, she offered us another dish NOT KNOWING we came for DUCK! instead she resolved this matter by taking ""THE DUCK"" off the bill and slapping us...THE FUCKING SIX OF US!!! ONE PIECE OF PIE and 6 SPOONS! HAHAHAAA...AA...WOW!! the manager now told us that she would take the ""duck confit hash"" off the bill. i was somewhat satisfied... when the bill came, FUCK!!! SHE OUT SMARTED ME!!!! she only took off ONE ""duck confit hash""!! we had to pay for the other two DUCK FLAVORED BURNED POTATOES!!do you know how much potatoes you can buy with $32?! that's a lot of potatoes! sure enough, i thought i was hungry, but due to the great service and complimentary dessert for the group, i was turned off.so all in said, BEWARE of the DUCK! you will get GOOSED!!!(is yelp serious?! i just tried posting this w/o any stars, bc i forgot to put the stars, like they forgot how to put duck in  my plate!!!)",1.0

Sister-in-law and I both had the Eggs Norwegian which was also quite good. The shining star of the brunch menu, which is a must have, are the pancakes. Mum ordered them, and I thought they were going to be ordinary pancakes with some strawberry butter, and berries. Oh no, these are GIANT cakes that have been baked in a pan so they get all browned and crispy on the outside, but are so fluffy and tender on the inside.

"My friend, his gf and I roll up to Le Barricou this past Sunday, and I'm ready to get my eat on. However it's 3:30pm and even though I have breakfast on the brain, my stomach doesn't want eggs. I order the spinach and goat cheese croissant, a side of bacon, a double Bloody Mary and replaced the eggs with homefries. I'm not ignorant to well prepared food, nor am I a food snob and nit picky to the enth degree, but WOW. Homefries = Perfection.Bacon = Perfection, a little greasy, but I can't/won't complain.Croissant = Great and tasty. I wish the croissant didn't taste like they were frozen at one point :(Side Salad: GREAT dressing, what is it LB?Bloody Mary = Missing the celery stalk it was BLOODY AMAZING, the right amount of spicy, the right amount of everything really. Maybe I hit it on the right day or right hour of the day, but the ambiance was laid back and unpretentious. While everyone from past reviewers to my roommate have complained about the service, I didn't have that at all.

Attentive, came by to check on us.

"I must have arrived too late to brunch (my friends were already sipping on bloody marys when I got there) to partake in these ""free croissants"" everyone else is yelping about. The adorably welcoming waitress promptly came over to see if I needed anything as I joined the table ($5 mimosa please!). Now I love mimosas, and I am hardly a mimosa snob, but theirs is sooo good I can't imagine ever wanting to drink them anywhere else.I ordered the ordinary sounding Spinach and Goat Cheese Croissant ($8.5), and was presented with a rich buttery croissant filled with sautéed spinach and crumbled goat cheese with 2 sunny side up eggs and a salad.

"duck, duck, duck......GOOSED!this sunday morning, i gathered a few friends for a great sunday brunch! i came here 2 times, memorized by the ""duck confit hash"". weeks over weeks has passed by and my girlfriend finally has time off from work! she also was anticipating what all the rant and rage is about, me speaking of this ""duck confit hash"" le barricou has to offer!when we arrived to the place, our party was seated promptly when i (the last one) arrived. that is of course, them (my party) waiting for an hour...the waitress came over and took the order for coffee... by the time the milk came by, our coffee was cold! by the time the brown sugars came, the cold coffee needed to be reheated!! ahhhh! the coffee blows!!! screw it! WE CAME FOR DUCK!!!the wait begins again...watching her happily chant with her co -workers...three our of six of us ordered the ""duck confit hash"", because i told them how great it was! we waited for a good 50/55 minutes for the food, which turned out to be cold! WTF?! COLD!!! well, we were all starved by then we didn't care! as i started digging into my plate to served my girlfriend a fork of DUCK, i felt like i got GOOSED! i scrambled my food around looking for DUCK! i asked my other guests, they told me they have very little duck but a WHOLE LOT OF BURNED POTATOES!!! hahaha.. i got it, the joke was on us... whatever... i waited for some eye contact with our waitress, and there was none. i PERSONALLY got up, approached the waitress and she told me that she will see that issue will be told to the manager. she said she'd get back to us with an answer to this matter. we waited and waited and waited...i had to get up AGAIN! and approach the waitress to ASK, ""WHAT THE FUCK?! WHERE'S MY DUCK?!"" (jk!)... i asked her, ""so, umm...what's going on with our dishes?"" she replied, the manager will attend to you, she is fully aware of the problem."" THIS MEANS - if i didn't get up, the wait would be longer?!?!? blah!as i sat watching the host wearing a blue top and black jeans that day approach the guests as they come in, she comes to me saying that SHE IS ALSO THE MANAGER. i guess they were short of staff that day, totally understandable. i explained the mishap on how the dish came out a few weeks ago till now. she didn't offer to add duck to it, she offered us another dish NOT KNOWING we came for DUCK! instead she resolved this matter by taking ""THE DUCK"" off the bill and slapping us...THE FUCKING SIX OF US!!! ONE PIECE OF PIE and 6 SPOONS! HAHAHAAA...AA...WOW!! the manager now told us that she would take the ""duck confit hash"" off the bill. i was somewhat satisfied... when the bill came, FUCK!!! SHE OUT SMARTED ME!!!! she only took off ONE ""duck confit hash""!! we had to pay for the other two DUCK FLAVORED BURNED POTATOES!!do you know how much potatoes you can buy with $32?! that's a lot of potatoes! sure enough, i thought i was hungry, but due to the great service and complimentary dessert for the group, i was turned off.so all in said, BEWARE of the DUCK! you will get GOOSED!!!(is yelp serious?! i just tried posting this w/o any stars, bc i forgot to put the stars, like they forgot how to put duck in  my plate!!!)",1.0
"This place makes a great first impression.  And the food is even better!!I went for brunch on Saturday.  Kind of off the beaten track (and in a seed-y area), but it maintains the Williamsburg hipster-vibe.  I had an omelet and brunch cocktail.  Both were very good.  The eggs were light and fluffy and the cocktail was well mixed.  Further, it was rather inexpensive (compared to Manhattan's brunch prices.)I would like to return for their live music and wine sessions.If you are in the area (say vintage shopping next door??) then stop in for some good grub.",4.0

If you do order the lamb sausage, know that they are beyond well seasoned, as in, to the point you might not like them. But from sampling all of the other items (from friend's plates), the food is very well done, and scrumptious. Your taste buds will definitely thank you for the flavors and textures when you come here.They do get busy on good days, so expect a wait at times.Definitely coming back here every now and then, for the food that is.",5.0
"Have only been here for brunch, so can only vouch for that - but definitely definitely come here for brunch. I came early to beat the brunch rush, but I would wait all day just to eat here if I had to. Fiance had the apple frittata, which I tried and was delish! Sister-in-law and I both had the Eggs Norwegian which was also quite good. The shining star of the brunch menu, which is a must have, are the pancakes. Mum ordered them, and I thought they were going to be ordinary pancakes with some strawberry butter, and berries. Oh no, these are GIANT cakes that have been baked in a pan so they get all browned and crispy on the outside, but are so fluffy and tender on the inside. Loved these so much, I went home and tried to make them myself (including the strawberry butter). If you're in the neighborhood, or looking to try a new brunch place, definitely do not miss out on these pancakes!",4.0
"My friend, his gf and I roll up to Le Barricou this past Sunday, and I'm ready to get my eat on. However it's 3:30pm and even though I have breakfast on the brain, my stomach doesn't want eggs. I order the spinach and goat cheese croissant, a side of bacon, a double Bloody Mary and replaced the eggs with homefries. I'm not ignorant to well prepared food, nor am I a food snob and nit picky to the enth degree, but WOW. Homefries = Perfection.Bacon = Perfection, a little greasy, but I can't/won't complain.Croissant = Great and tasty. I wish the croissant didn't taste like they were frozen at one point :(Side Salad: GREAT dressing, what is it LB?Bloody Mary = Missing the celery stalk it was BLOODY AMAZING, the right amount of spicy, the right amount of everything really. Maybe I hit it on the right day or right hour of the day, but the ambiance was laid back and unpretentious. While everyone from past reviewers to my roommate have complained about the service, I didn't have that at all. Our server (I forgot her name, but she was a redhead) was prompt, and even gave into my silly request for the wireless code, so I could access the wi-fi on my phone. Attentive, came by to check on us. She did her thing.Now by the time I was finished my meal, I was stuffed and swear I was drunk off the FOOD, not the drink (I pounded my Bloody Mary, way after I mentioned my Drunk off the Foodness).

Now I love mimosas, and I am hardly a mimosa snob, but theirs is sooo good I can't imagine ever wanting to drink them anywhere else.I ordered the ordinary sounding Spinach and Goat Cheese Croissant ($8.5), and was presented with a rich buttery croissant filled with sautéed spinach and crumbled goat cheese with 2 sunny side up eggs and a salad.

"Let me get this out of the way first: The food here is above average.This past weekend I went to Sunday brunch with a group of friends. After placing our order, we waited for our food to come out. And waited. And waited. People at other tables were seated, served, and left. Our waitress never came to our table during that time to check on our water, see if we needed anything, or let us know the status of our order. Eventually, one of our party members went to the waitress and asked her where our food was. Within 30 seconds all our food was brought out. It seemed apparent that our food had been sitting in the kitchen forgotten. We were bothered by this, and even more so by the fact that nobody acknowledged that it had happened or apologized. We decided to say something about it when we were finished, particularly since we were going to be billed an automatic gratuity.After we had finished eating, I approached the manager, and explained to him what had happened. I said something to the effect of ""...so our food must have been sitting under heat lamps in the kitchen, and we'd like to be able to determine our own gratuity"". The manager proceeded to go absolutely berserk. He started screaming about how there were no heat lamps in his restaurant, and practically pushed me in to the kitchen to prove it was so after I had already told him ""fine, the heat lamps are not what I'm concerned about"". He went on and on about how high quality his food is (again, not my complaint) and that he built the restaurant himself (I don't care), and that he's been in the restaurant industry for 25 years (which I highly doubt given that he looked 30), and that I don't know anything about the restaurant industry (which I do). Throughout his tirade I repeatedly said ""sir, your aggressive tone really isn't necessary"", but he would ignore that and keep going. Eventually he told me that if I didn't like the service, I should never come back to his restaurant, and that I should just go eat at McDonalds! He said I would be very pleased with the speed of service at McDonalds. Honestly! I have never in my life experienced or even heard of someone in the service industry being so awful to a customer with one fairly minor and run-of-the-mill complaint. And as somebody who has worked in restaurants, I know that the proper course of action is to apologize and see if you can do something to make it up to the customers, not scold them, tell them to never come back, and to go eat at McDonalds. This guy clearly has no concept of what the service industry is about, despite working in it since he was 5 years old.A few minutes later, the waitress came over with our check and apologized to us herself about the service time. We told her that we didn't care about that anymore because we were too taken aback by the the way the owner treated us to think of anything else. He had completely ruined our brunch. Since that wasn't her fault, we gave her a tip (but not a big one) and left. This whole thing has absolutely turned me off to Le Barricou, which is no huge loss for me, but I really hope this manager can figure out why he's so unhappy with his life that he takes it out on customers, and he learns to leave it at home. Also, he has ridiculous hair.As an addendum, this is from the NYC Restaurant Health Ratings:Sanitary Violations1) Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.2) Nuisance created or allowed to exist.

I was walking around with my boyfriend on Grand last night and we were in search of a new place to try for dinner. I looked for restaurants nearby where we were on my iPhone's Yelp application and found Le Barricou. We walked over, and I discovered that it was a restaurant I'd been admiring from the outside for months but never knew what it was called. I was so excited to try it!The atmosphere of the place is adorable. So quaint. I wouldn't say it feels authentically French-feeling, but it is très adorable! Beer comes in glass jars and there's lots of French bread with butter to go around. For my entree I had the homemade spinach and goat cheese ravioli which was to...die...for! It was practically the only vegetarian entree on the menu though, so it's not the kind of place I will come to every week because then it wouldn't be that special of a meal anymore!All things considered this is a lovely little romantic spot with great food, amazing music selection, and friendly service.

"Just the best Bistro fare in Williamsburg, definitely worth getting on the train for though. The menu is great and I've never had a dish that wasn't worth ordering again.

The free croissants they serve in the beginning can't be beat.  Love the music they play, service is always great, we get seated right away and one of the male waiters always remembers us. I have pretty much tried every single brunch entree on the menu and my favorite would be the ham and cheese croissant plus free coffee refills.",4.0
"stumbled upon this in the neighborhood we were staying in on a recent stay there...one of my favorite finds ever!  cute, Frenchy little bar/cafe with one fairly efficient and genuine bartender/waitress.  we had the chilled goat cheese/dill/cucumber soup (a daily special) that was incredible- light and flavorful, a great summer soup.the breakfast dish i had with the 2 eggs sunny side up, spicy lamb sausage links, pommes frittes (cooked perfectly), and side salad was a perfect amount of food to start your day off delicious.all in all, sweet atmosphere, great food (i also love the limited, but inventive menu), and decent service.  i'd go again!",4.0
"YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMBeen there once last year for valentine's day dinner... I don't remember much about what we ate, but do remember the service and atmosphere was nice and they greeted us (me) with a flower at the doorWent there more recently for brunch, it was delicious, and the service was good.  We expected a wait but we were seated right away.  I had the merguez and eggs.  Date had eggs Norwegian (eggs benedict with salmon instead of ham).  They also had good drinks.  I really liked the bloody mary and he had the penicillin.  I thought the home fries were perfect, perfecting cooked and seasoned (came with the Norwegian).  The fries (came with merguez and eggs) were good but nothing amazing.   Finally we had creme brulee... I don't think I've ever had better creme brulee in my life!",4.0
"Amazing brunch place. Before my boyfriend moved back to Manhattan, we used to go to brunch here at least once a week. The decor is cute (if you're into that sort of thing) and the atmosphere is really great. The food is great and even though they're always busy, there's usually not much of a wait. They give you chocolate croissants for (free) appetizers, and their french toast is amazing (as is their fresh-squeezed orange juice).Absolutely recommend!!!",5.0
"Dark, moody and French - hands down my favorite place to hang out in Williamsburg. The atmosphere is visceral, the menu ranges from moule frites and other bistro-staples to rotating seasonal favorites (plus a great burger), and the bartenders are both insightful and heavy handed.",5.0
"what is ist about the declination of service in the nyc area? why is that so often i'm dining and feel totally ignored by my server? i've literally gotten better service in a waffle house and i'm not exaggerating when i say almost better food. the issues started when our server came to take our order. she took my girlfriends order then i watched her glance at the people entering the restaurant, becoming affixed to them. not until i politly ask her a question did she regain her attention to our ordering process.after that nothing. no coffee refill. nothing. no asking if i needed another mimosa.a busser came out and brought our food and bleh.the oysters on my oyster benedict were so deeply fried into oblivion that they were barely recognizeable as oysters. they could have fed me seitan in the shape of oysters and i'd have believed it. and there were 2 of them.shame.my gfriends omelette was no better than a denny's omelette and she only ate 1/3 of it and we just sat there. alone. frustrated that our server was more concerned about filling ketchup bottles and doing sidework than taking care of us. needless to say we will never come back here. there are too many places in ny and the economy is too shitty right now for us to pay for bad service and food. le barricou???? more like le pile of poo.",1.0
"I love the Yelp iPhone application because it helped me decide on coming to Le Barricou last night! I was walking around with my boyfriend on Grand last night and we were in search of a new place to try for dinner. I looked for restaurants nearby where we were on my iPhone's Yelp application and found Le Barricou. We walked over, and I discovered that it was a restaurant I'd been admiring from the outside for months but never knew what it was called. I was so excited to try it!The atmosphere of the place is adorable. So quaint. I wouldn't say it feels authentically French-feeling, but it is très adorable! Beer comes in glass jars and there's lots of French bread with butter to go around. For my entree I had the homemade spinach and goat cheese ravioli which was to...die...for! It was practically the only vegetarian entree on the menu though, so it's not the kind of place I will come to every week because then it wouldn't be that special of a meal anymore!All things considered this is a lovely little romantic spot with great food, amazing music selection, and friendly service. Can't wait to try their brunch now!Note: AMEX and cash only though folks!",4.0
"I thought this French restaurant had a very slow-paced and European feel.  The meals were not cheap, but they were worth it and well-proportioned.  Next time I go, I'd like to be seated in the room with the fireplace, looks very very cozy.  It made a great Friday night date dinner, there were other couples dining there as well.We ordered a goat-cheese torte for appetizer, hamburger and chicken for meal, and creme brulee for dessert.  Very good.The waitress we had was exceptional.  She saw that the burger was rare, not medium, and quickly returned it to the kitchen without questions or fuss.  Great service on her behalf.",4.0
"Just the best Bistro fare in Williamsburg, definitely worth getting on the train for though. The menu is great and I've never had a dish that wasn't worth ordering again. French staples like Coq a Vin and Moules Frites are Paris quality. The chicken sandwich and the burger are affordable, excellent, and keep me coming back. I wish I had something to complain about so I didn't sound like a shill, but the only thing I can think of is that they don't take credit cards. Great staff, great for dates, great for brunch, great for parents, great for drinks, great for daytime cracking a Times and feeling at home, great for business meetings, great back room for events, great for late night., and great to post up a well deserved and long time coming review for Barricou.",5.0

"Stayed with a friend who lives across the street from Le Barricou and decided to get some grub there after waking up at 2 pm - my body's attempt at recovering from the 6 hour transcontinental flight.  Felt a little sketchy about eating there as the whole place only had one other patron and the woman who took our order looked disheveled (aren't all New Yorkers supposed to be anorexic fashionistas?) and quite frankly a little disinterested about being there.  I was too lazy to go elsewhere and decided to give the place a shot and am super glad I did..I'm a huge croque madame fan (those of you who don't know what the eff I'm talking about, order it the next time you see it on the menu if you love bread and cheese as much as I do) and was so excited to see it on the menu.  It was absolutely delectable, not too greasy, just enough béchamel sauce, perfectly cooked egg and it was served with perfectly fried fries.Bottom: Although croque madames and fries are such simple foods, in my experience it's that very reason that makes it hard to make it damn good.  This place does one of the best jobs I've tasted in awhile - go check it out.",4.0

""we have to go to le barricou. it's my favorite french place"".We arrive and the inside looks very cute. Not french at all but cute.The food was just blah. everything. From appetizer over entree to dessert. Maybe I am spoiled by great french places like La Sirene in Soho and Le Grenouille but come on.

"Yikes.  I wanted to like this place--there's nothing like a good French restaurant in the neighborhood to cheer me up.  But alas, this place is neither good nor knows its French food and aperitifs.  I had the oysters, onion soup and pasta special yesterday evening, and both were bland (edible but nothing to write home about).  The wine service was decent, though.  In general, service by the wait-staff was uneven, with the bus-""boys"" proving to be the most efficient and on top of things.  The place is cosy, but the atmosphere was marred by unreasonably loud music (the kind that drowns conversation, requiring guests to shout at each other) played out of tinny speakers.  The experience (food, service, ambience) was completely not worth the price we forked over (over $300 for 4 people).",1.0
"I'm really glad my friend introduced me to Le Barricou. It's nice to have a less expensive, nearby alternative to Diner or Dumont.

"Would I consider Le Barricou an authentic French restaurant? Probably not. I would say it's more French-inspired. The decor, the cuisine, the leisurely Continental pace without the snobby attitude. In fact, the waitstaff is meticulously friendly and attentive. I've only been here for weekend brunch and I've never experienced more than a five-minute wait to be seated. The food arrival time varied from 10 minutes to 45 minutes though. If you're not really in a rush (and why would you want to rush brunch?!) even the waiting is usually a pleasant experience. They give you a basket with one plain croissant and one chocolate croissant (for a table of two). They are a little stale but free chocolate croissant = awesome no matter what. The tablecloths are paper and they provide pencils so you can draw on the tables while you wait. The kid inside of me loves that.I tend to judge restaurants by their water service. Maybe because I'm part-camel and cannot get through a meal without drinking at least a liter of water. This place gets an A+ on the water service. They place a carafe on your table and then come by and refill your glass for you constantly. There's nothing like not being bothered to pour your own goddamn water to make you truly feel like part of the lazy bourgeoisie.The coffee is delicious. I asked the awesome waitress what kind of coffee they serve and it's Moka d'Oro coffee and they add espresso from Gimme Coffee. Yum! They also offered free refills even after we finished eating.As for the actual food, the croque madame, the chicken sandwich, and the burger were all surprisingly good. I especially loved the french country bread they serve the first two on. Toasted crispy and fluffy inside. All served with mixed greens and pomme frittes. Both delicious. The french toast, unfortunately, was disappointing. I think I'm just biased against all non-challah french toast.Also, they only take AmEx credit cards so my Visa-toting ass had to use the ATM in the back room. The prices aren't exactly cheap but reasonable. I'm bumping up a would-be 4 to a 5 for the level of service I've experienced so far as well as for the little details I loved so much.",5.0

Great environment and decor. Very friendly staff. Delicious food and i'd say decently priced for the package EXCEPT for their syrup.

"We happened to be in Brooklyn on Sunday and decided to have brunch here based on all of the positive Yelp reviews.  Our experience was mixed.  At 2pm, we only waited about 15 minutes for a table near the open front doors so that was better than expected (hostess told us it would be a 25 minute wait).  Hubby ordered the duck confit hash with 2 sunny-side-up eggs which he loved.  Those were the pluses.  Now for the negatives.  I ordered the spinach & mushroom omelet - omelet had a flat, plastic look (sitting under a heat lamp long?) which didn't look very appetizing.  Was surprised to find a few tiny pieces of tomato in it with some strong spice -oregano?- neither of which was in the menu description.  There was supposed to be provolone cheese in the omelet but I didn't find any.  I would have mentioned this to the server but service was so slow and we didn't want to wait any longer than we already had.  The omelet was edible but disappointing.  Drinks took forever and when hubby ordered a second wine from a server other than our own (he was the one who brought our food), he apparently never put in the wine order or alert our server.  Oh, and the other negative - they don't serve decaf coffee!!  Other places in South/East Williamsburg that we'll try the next time we're back in that part of Brooklyn.",3.0
"Went here this past Sunday for brunch. My group of 3 unfortunately couldn't make the full brunch, but we were able to receive the late brunch, which happens from 4-6 and has a much smaller menu. The owner was very friendly when we sat down, but the hipster waitress was pretty horrible. She took our order in a rush even though the place was fairly empty. She brought the food and then we never saw her again. She never checked on us. My friend had to go get more ketchup from the serving window herself.      The food was really good however, and would make me come back. I had the grilled chicken sandwich which had a spicy sauce on it, and my friend got a burger which she said was ""outta this world good"".  Both meals came with fries and were reasonably priced.",3.0
"I feel compelled to write a review becasue I would really like to see this place succeed. The food at Le Barricou is really good, and yet there never seem to be enough people in there for dinner service (they seem to get more of a crowd for weekend brunch).  Restaurants--good or bad--never seem to last more than a year on Grand Street, which is a tough location. I am still mourning the loss of Cafe Mexicano, which used to be on the same block of Grand St.I have been to Le Barricou three times. Once for brunch, and twice for dinner. The prices are reasonable, and reflect a nice mix of lower cost options and more special spluge dishes (they have some very well priced items--burgers, sandwiches, large salads etc.,--though the seafood specials are more expensive, but a good value in terms of quality and portion). It seems possible to eat well here and not spend a lot of money if you don't want to.The brunch menu is great and brunch is served with a basket of warm croissants. The eggs florentine were great, and the potatoes were really nicely spiced, browned and not at all greasy. For dinner, I second the recommendations for bouillabaise. They really do a nice bouillabase. The seafood mix changes based on the fish specials each day, and the night I ordered it the special was cod--and the stew was chock full of large, delicous pieces of cod. We also shared a fantastic beet salad. My second dinner there I ordered one of the specials--a fish sandwich with fries. The portions were generous, and the fish sandwich was fresh and really tasty--served with a very nice small salad and excellent fries.I also find the atmosphere to be really nice--maybe a little too faux  ""distressed"" french country for my taste, but well done. The place is spacious and airy. It is a neighborhood place and still has an off-the-beaten path feel that is becoming rare in Williamsburg. Too bad there is back yard patio! (but they do have outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant).",5.0

"Really cute and romantic spot. Service was great, even got a complimentary dish because we had to wait a long time to get one of the orders (mussels with blue cheese - amazing!). My friend ordered the special (ribs with linguine I think) which was delicious. Pommes frites, onion soup, and ravioli appetizers were awesome too. I had some cocktail with scotch (which I usually hate) but they made it sweet so I could barely taste it. I looooved the atmosphere, when you go in the back they have sofas and fireplace and play old-timey music. One star off cuz it is pretty pricey - but worth the money.",4.0

Nice selection of cocktails. We knew we had to order one of the mussel dishes that come with shoestring fries. The fries were salty and delicious, the mussels were fresh and flavorful. Service was pretty spot on. Sometimes we waited a bit for things, but the environment was so nice and everyone was so friendly that it really didn't matter. We will definitely be back.

"Beautiful decor, wonderful specials, and a charming atmosphere make Le Barricou a wonderful place for an intimate meal in Williamsburg. I'm a huge fan of the menu-- the Moules Frittes (Mussels and Fries) are by far my favorite selection namely the Moules Marinere as it's great to share and delicious.

"This is a good restaurant. Solid tasty dishes a pleasant atmosphere and good service. I come here for brunch often and will continue to do so.They lose one star for not accepting credit. My personal opinion is that a restaurant with an average tab of $20 or so per diner should accept credit as a service to their guests, and would probably see an increase in their gross receipts if they did.  To each their own though.Go eat here and bring cash",4.0
"We happened to be in Brooklyn on Sunday and decided to have brunch here based on all of the positive Yelp reviews.  Our experience was mixed.  At 2pm, we only waited about 15 minutes for a table near the open front doors so that was better than expected (hostess told us it would be a 25 minute wait).  Hubby ordered the duck confit hash with 2 sunny-side-up eggs which he loved.  Those were the pluses.  Now for the negatives.  I ordered the spinach & mushroom omelet - omelet had a flat, plastic look (sitting under a heat lamp long?) which didn't look very appetizing.  Was surprised to find a few tiny pieces of tomato in it with some strong spice -oregano?- neither of which was in the menu description.  There was supposed to be provolone cheese in the omelet but I didn't find any.  I would have mentioned this to the server but service was so slow and we didn't want to wait any longer than we already had.  The omelet was edible but disappointing.  Drinks took forever and when hubby ordered a second wine from a server other than our own (he was the one who brought our food), he apparently never put in the wine order or alert our server.  Oh, and the other negative - they don't serve decaf coffee!!  Other places in South/East Williamsburg that we'll try the next time we're back in that part of Brooklyn.",3.0
"Went here this past Sunday for brunch. My group of 3 unfortunately couldn't make the full brunch, but we were able to receive the late brunch, which happens from 4-6 and has a much smaller menu. The owner was very friendly when we sat down, but the hipster waitress was pretty horrible. She took our order in a rush even though the place was fairly empty. She brought the food and then we never saw her again. She never checked on us. My friend had to go get more ketchup from the serving window herself.      The food was really good however, and would make me come back. I had the grilled chicken sandwich which had a spicy sauce on it, and my friend got a burger which she said was ""outta this world good"".  Both meals came with fries and were reasonably priced.",3.0
"I feel compelled to write a review becasue I would really like to see this place succeed. The food at Le Barricou is really good, and yet there never seem to be enough people in there for dinner service (they seem to get more of a crowd for weekend brunch).  Restaurants--good or bad--never seem to last more than a year on Grand Street, which is a tough location. I am still mourning the loss of Cafe Mexicano, which used to be on the same block of Grand St.I have been to Le Barricou three times. Once for brunch, and twice for dinner. The prices are reasonable, and reflect a nice mix of lower cost options and more special spluge dishes (they have some very well priced items--burgers, sandwiches, large salads etc.,--though the seafood specials are more expensive, but a good value in terms of quality and portion). It seems possible to eat well here and not spend a lot of money if you don't want to.The brunch menu is great and brunch is served with a basket of warm croissants. The eggs florentine were great, and the potatoes were really nicely spiced, browned and not at all greasy. For dinner, I second the recommendations for bouillabaise. They really do a nice bouillabase. The seafood mix changes based on the fish specials each day, and the night I ordered it the special was cod--and the stew was chock full of large, delicous pieces of cod. We also shared a fantastic beet salad. My second dinner there I ordered one of the specials--a fish sandwich with fries. The portions were generous, and the fish sandwich was fresh and really tasty--served with a very nice small salad and excellent fries.I also find the atmosphere to be really nice--maybe a little too faux  ""distressed"" french country for my taste, but well done. The place is spacious and airy. It is a neighborhood place and still has an off-the-beaten path feel that is becoming rare in Williamsburg. Too bad there is back yard patio! (but they do have outdoor seating in the front of the restaurant).",5.0
"Had dinner there a while back, forgot to write something. Food was great. Started off with the escargot and the pasta of the day. Unbelievable. Also had the Flor De Jalisco as my drink of the night. Good times.",4.0
"Really cute and romantic spot. Service was great, even got a complimentary dish because we had to wait a long time to get one of the orders (mussels with blue cheese - amazing!). My friend ordered the special (ribs with linguine I think) which was delicious. Pommes frites, onion soup, and ravioli appetizers were awesome too. I had some cocktail with scotch (which I usually hate) but they made it sweet so I could barely taste it. I looooved the atmosphere, when you go in the back they have sofas and fireplace and play old-timey music. One star off cuz it is pretty pricey - but worth the money.",4.0
"Great service, food's pretty good. We went in around 3 or so and unfortunately the music was pretty loud for me. It felt like I was at a club, except when you sit across the table from each other it's harder to hear the person than if you were huddled together at parties.",3.0
"Just went there for dinner tonight with my good friend who I haven't seen in a few weeks. Perfect ambiance for catching up with a friend, special dinner out or a birthday celebration at one of the long tables in the cozy back room. CASH ONLY was the ONLY surprise. Nice selection of cocktails. We knew we had to order one of the mussel dishes that come with shoestring fries. The fries were salty and delicious, the mussels were fresh and flavorful. Service was pretty spot on. Sometimes we waited a bit for things, but the environment was so nice and everyone was so friendly that it really didn't matter. We will definitely be back. OH and I almost forgot.....the cheapest salad on the menu, the Mesclun Greens, had an out of this world dressing and mint mixed in. It was DELISH.Can't wait to eat there again.

"Beautiful decor, wonderful specials, and a charming atmosphere make Le Barricou a wonderful place for an intimate meal in Williamsburg. I'm a huge fan of the menu-- the Moules Frittes (Mussels and Fries) are by far my favorite selection namely the Moules Marinere as it's great to share and delicious.

"Had a great lunch there today. I ordered merguez sausages (made on premise) and eggs, served with mesclun salad and pomme frites. Everything was absolutely delicious! Even the salad, and I hate vegetables. I had a bite of my friend's grilled chicken sandwich, and that was seriously yummy too. I look forward to going back there for another lunch, dinner, or brunch (pancakes with strawberry butter? I'm there!) Very charming ambiance and good service too.",4.0
"this might be my favorite place to go for brunch. i go at least twice a month. it's getting more and more popular (i spotted adrian grenier of entourage fame there a few weeks ago!), so be prepared to wait during weekend brunch hours. the place is cozy with adorable rustic european decor. always warm, bright, and playing non-offensive music at the perfect volume. the servers are all very sweet and attentive.TRY THE BLOODY MARY. my god, it's epic. and it comes in a mason jar, so you can feel like a cowboy drinking it.i have no bad things to say about the food. it's affordable. it's of good quality. it's delicious. it's plentiful, both in choice and in the size of the portions. i always leave feeling happy and stuffed. i've never ordered something that i didn't like. (oh, except the one time my friend ordered the merguez with eggs and it was delicious, but there were only 4 smallish sausage links). i normally go for the giant mound of french toast with fresh fruit or the eggs norwegian with potatoes and salad.now if only men could be as satisfying in every aspect as le barricou is.p.s. cash or AMEX only! there's an ATM inside though.",5.0
"Very pleased with this restaurant.  Walked in on a Saturday night with the GF.  Very cozy atmosphere.  Ommegang on tap for 5 bucks got me happy.  The toddy was great.  GF had a 3 cheese plate, which she loved.  And some escargot, which she liked, but commented that it was a bit too salty for her.  I got the Coq au Vin.  I liked it and it was priced well -- $12!!!  But, I felt it couldve used another piece of chicken, especially since we're talking about one thigh and a leg.  I loved the sauce too, but wished that there was more of it -- I mean it came with mashed potatoes so logic would dictate that there would be more sauce so the potatoes could soak it up.  Alas, no.  Still liked it though.  Service was good.  I'd come back here.",4.0

I have to update this review and say that I went for dinner on Monday and was much happier than when I went for brunch. The linguine with shrimp was deeeeeeelicious!

"In six visits for brunch, lunch, and dinner, we have never been let down by Le Barricou. The waitstaff is professional and unpretentious.

The first three dishes were exceptional. The escargot was also very good, but I have had better elsewhere. It was perfect in every way except it didn't have that smokey flavor that I enjoy so much.This is a great place to bring a group later at night.

"Been to this new neighborhood bistro twice so far.  Quite pleased.  Their brunch menu offers traditional fare - eggs, omlelettes, pancakes, etc - all with a distinctly French touch.  Stand-out dishes are the chicken and steak sandwiches, and their pancakes.  Warning - The coffee hasn't been very good either time, both the regular coffee and cappuccino.   I would suggest a visit to Gimme Coffee beforehand for any necessary caffeine intake.  The decor is really quite good.  Skylights in the ceiling make the large back room relaxed and sunny, and the yellow, distressed painting technique, in addition to the French comics plastered all over the walls, give it a very old-world feel (despite it being newly decorated).  The service is slow, and the staff is clearly brand new and untrained, but give them time!  Very friendly.Oh and their prices are extremely good.Can't wait to try them out for dinner!  Oh, and don't let the fact that it is directly across the street from the slummiest, most disgusting-looking buildings.  Ah, the confusion of urban development and gentrification....sometimes I just don't get it.",4.0
I love this place and would highly recommend on crisp fall nights.  I am not writing a review but simply correcting another Yelper's review regarding payment at this Le Barricou:  is is NOT cash only but it is Amex and cash only.  Not unlike every Frenchie I've been to in New York...  there is an ATM in the back room.,4.0

"I am so sad. Le Barricou is my neighborhood spot. We used to go here at least a couple times a week - everything on the menu was delicious (salty, but I love that) and brunch was amazing. We had been traveling quite a bit this summer so haven't made it in recently until last week for dinner, only to find they have a new chef and the menu had changed. And not for the better. Beyond the annoying mispellings on the new menu, all of my favorites are gone. The creativity that we felt so special to have down the street like rabbit gnocchi and mussels prepared in various ways are now dumbed down with things like sides of mac & cheese and two burger options (are we Dumont now?). They've successfully turned themselves into every other boring restaurant that I don't feel is worth eating at. Also, the place used to be such good value. Now the entrees are equally expensive if not more and don't come with sides which you need to order separately. I truly hope the owners read this and make changes.

"Last night was my first time here but definitely not my last.  A girl friend and I went for dinner and being new to Williamsburg, I'm looking for some new favorite restaurants.  I have absolutely found one in Le Barricou.  It's a gorgeous, unpretentious, French Bistro.  The mood is warm, inviting and intimate.  Candles and fresh flowers adorn every table, along with a gilded framed chalkboard listing the daily soup specials.  There are 4 community tables up front by the bar and each one sits 6 people.  We were seated at the back one and since it was a slow Tuesday evening, we didn't have to share the space.Our busboy promptly brought out some bread and Greek olives and our waitress came over right away to greet us which was nice.  Unfortunately when we left, we realized we never got her name but did find out that she's the only French employee working there.  Anyway, we ordered a bottle of red wine, it was #428 on the menu if I remember correctly and it's a 2007 Michel Gassier Costieres-de-Nimes Nostre Pais.  An amazing blend of Grenache, Carignan, Mourvèdre, Cinsault and Syrah and reasonably priced at $38.  For an appetizer, we ordered the special of the day which was a white mushroom ravioli with ricotta cheese in a garlic, butter and white wine sauce.  All of their pasta is handmade daily downstairs by ""the Pasta Man"", as we were told by our waitress.  Well, the Pasta Man sure blew us away with this dish.  We actually ordered more bread so we could soak up the sauce once we were finished with the ravioli.  The portion was small, only 3 raviolis, but it was also only $8.For dinner, I ordered the Bar Steak.  It was $18 and the less expensive steak on the menu.  They also had Steak Poivre which was $30 but I didn't want to spend that much.  Normally when you go to a restaurant and get the less expensive steak, it isn't as good as the pricier version, but here, their $18 bar steak is to die for.  It's a black angus hanger steak in a red-wine shallot au jus and accompanied on the plate by arugula salad.  The steak was so tender and juicy, it almost melted in my mouth and the shallot wine sauce was perfect.  Even the arugula salad was amazing, it had fresh apple and carrots ""straws"" mixed in and a very light, barely noticeable dressing.  My friend ordered the Cod which came in a lemony, white wine sauce with gnocchi, asparagus and mushrooms for $22.  The gnocchi (once again made downstairs by the Pasta Man) was out of this world!  So light, with very thin pasta and creamy potato it was delicious.  It also had a flavor we couldn't quite put our fingers on... almost like a lemon zest but then finishing as if there was a touch of orange oil in the potatoes.  It sounds strange, but trust me, it was perfect.  Both of us finished every last morsel on our plates and we rarely do that when we go out to eat, this food was just amazing.We thought about ordering dessert but passed and instead had a few dessert cocktails.  I ordered Le Chocolate for $9 which is Stoli Vanilla with white and dark Godiva liquor.  She ordered the Miele Di Poli for $9 which is a honey flavored grappa.In addition to this incredible meal, they had a great playlist of music spinning on their iPod that included The Black Keys, Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings, Ellison and Serge Gainsbourg.A walk to the toilets in the back shows off the rest of the space and it is beautiful.  The back room has a fireplace, comfy leather chairs and an upright piano just begging to be played.  They even have Mrs. Meyers soap in the bathroom and it's filled with actual Mrs. Meyers soap!It is cash only but there's an ATM in the back by the restrooms that charges a $1.75 fee.I can't wait to go back!",5.0

I had the steak sandwich, which was cheesy and delicious. I liked the atmosphere for dinner. It was quiet for a Saturday night, but it also was during the holidays. They played good music and the server was pretty decent. He described the restaurant as ""french home style country cooking"". Not sure what that means exactly. I had the skate which was served with grilled vegetables and au gratin potatoes. It was really flavorful with lemon and capers. My friend had the seafood caserole, which was interesting. It was basically their crab bisque with more seafood in it and covered with melted cheese. We shared a bottle of wine.

The lukewarm Bouillabaisse was only eatable because of the great bread that came with it, the potatoes were undercooked and I had to throw them out. The green beans were tasty and the free chocolate mouse was fine (the least they could do after that wait), but nothing was spectacular.

There were 4 nice, well cooked pieces of chicken in a kick ass sauce enhanced with chunks of bacon, mushrooms, onions, carrots and a hint of what I think was tarragon. It came with a big mound of creamy mashed potatoes. The mussels provencale was also great. There was a peppery kick to the sauce and was accompanied by a wisely very generous serving of amazing frites. NOTHING was overly salted, something I truly admire.I would like to see a slightly larger offering of red wines by the glass and carafe, however the cote de rhone was pretty good.

"Rolled up in here with a friend at 1:30am. We had found ourselves starving in Brooklyn, and used the Yelp app to find all the hotspots in the area. On cursory glance of the reviews, we expected a diner-type bistro hybrid with a hefty brunch and breakfast selection. No dice. Unsure we were in the right place, we entered an enchanted little restaurant-- dim, with lots of lush plants and candles, but not a drop of maple syrup to be found. With very few other options, I ordered a cheeseburger from the latenight menu. My companion had the bread pudding. Both were good noms, but uncomfortably pricey for the quality. The service left quite a bit to be desired as well, I must admit-- inattentive, slow, distracted, even though we were one of the only tables eating in the whole place. Still, it was a beautiful space, with lovely ambiance , and open when we needed it to be. Probably an effective and romantic spot for a date, if you don't mind shelling out the extra duckets. So much so, that it was almost awkward for a munching on a late snack with a pal. Based on my experience, I probably won't find my way back on this Barricou trail, not even for brunch. Brooklyn isn't the kind of place where a girl needs to settle on so-so grub.",3.0

Because of that-if I had a logical bone in my body-I would not give Le Barricou the greatest review on earth because it just happens to be one of the greatest brunch spots in all of Brooklyn.We were all hungover and after sort of half-heartedly wandering into a few places before seeing that they were ill-equipped to handle the ten of us at noon on a Sunday, my friend suggested Le Barricou, a wonderful little French bistro just a block or so away.We walked in and they immediately sat us. They immediately sat ten people for brunch on a Sunday at noon in Williamsburg. Ten people. At noon. On a Sunday.The nice and friendly waitress immediately came around and took our drink orders, which naturally included a handful of mimosa's ($6) and bloody mary's ($7). I like my mary's hot and fresh with none of the unnecessary olive and mini carrot accoutrements. In my opinion, the bloody mary was close to perfect, thick but not too thick; spicy but not too spicy with the perfect amount of pepper mingling around in the bottom of the glass. The only thing I could have asked for was a bit more vodka.As the waitress set down a mimosa in front of one of my tablemates, one of my other tablemates began to gesticulate wildly-it was his birthday and he gets a little excited-and toppled her tray. She valiantly tried to grab the mimosas, but the tray rocked back and forth until one flew off dousing my friend in Mimosa. To her credit, she succeeded in saving one. I would have paid to see it over and over again. The splash, everyone's surprised looks mixed with a hint of horror followed by raucous laughter. We were all in tears shortly. The waitress-who's fault it obviously was not-was wonderful, apologetic and also had enough personality to laugh along with us.Things went downhill from there but to be honest we were having so much fun none of u really cares. Our order was botched-they still use the archaic pen-to-paper-system-and only about half of us got our food. The waitress was again very apologetic and figured out who was missing food and sent the orders back. Unfortunately she missed two people who still hadn't eaten.But she apologized profusely and then brought out two trays full of mimosas and I can't really say anything other than that we're pretty easily pleased and at happily once all of our food finally arrived.She comped a bunch of things and the restaurant manager even came over and apologized sincerely.But I've glossed over the best part: the food.Maybe I'm a sucker for cheese or a sucker sandwiches or a sucker for crispy cheese or for delectable slices of perfect ham. I'm probably a sucker for all these things combined but despite my preconceived love for the aforementioned ingredients, I have to say this was the best ham and cheese sandwich I've ever had in my life. Oh the gruyere! Oh the country bread! Oh the ham! The crispy layer of cheese surrounding the bread and lastly, that little delicious over-easy egg popped in the middle. It was served with fries-though I suspect largely because the kitchen ran out of home fries for a while-and a salad which could have used a bit of dressing. They called it the Croque-Madame and at $8.75, it was close to the most expensive thing on the menu, most other items rang in at the $7 mark.I love Egg on north S6th for their similar Toad-in-the-Hole sandwich but it could not even come close to comparing to this feat of sandwich-ery. I ate some homefries off a friend's plate and they were tasty too. The French fries were crispy, the hollandaise sauce delicious. With ten of us we pretty nearly tried everything on their extremely economical brunch menu. All the tables are topped with croissants-in both chocolate and the regular variety-and easily helped stave off hunger while we waited for our food.Although some of our food took ages to come, I think it was likely an aberration from the way things normally work at Le Barricou. We all said we'd go back, even my friend who walked out the door, still picking orange flecks out of his hair.",4.0

"The restaurant is cozy and romantic, the staff is attentive and friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and the food is amazing. The cuisine is French Bistro, and done to perfection. You can't go wrong with the Duck Confit, the Coq Au Vin, or the mussels.  There was a Hake special the other night that was out of this world. They also have a room in the back with a fireplace and cozy seating, where you can sip some wine of have a great coffee.  Go. Enjoy.",5.0
"this place is REAL good but not perfect.-first dinner there was amazing. absolutely no complaints. SO GOOD.-second dinner was just okay. we ordered the same things as the first visit, but they were not prepared nor did they taste the same. one of my biggest pet peeves is when a restaurant is not consistent.-first brunch there was good. VERY reasonably priced...well, aside from the orange juice. the juice was listed on the board but no price was given, so when we got the bill and almost HALF of it was attributed to two glasses of OJ at $6 (!!!) a piece, we were feeling very keanu reeves (""woah."").-second brunch was good and we steered clear of the juice this time. however, the table next to us had some people who were clearly friends with the waitress and they received their food a good 10 minutes before us, even though they sat down AFTER we did. tsk tsk!oh and they also have what my boyfriend has declared the Best Dessert Ever: a braised pear on ice cream with chocolate sauce. so good.",4.0
"This is LITERALLY my favorite place to eat in all of Williamsburg and Greenpoint!  The food is delicious with amazing sauces (my all time favorite, Coq Au Vin)  I've had almost everything on the menu and loved it all!  It's got a great atmosphere and the owner is there almost every time I've been there, which shows she really cares.  Big helpings, great prices, cozy atmosphere, and good food!I recommend both dinner and brunch, whichcomes with free coisants, including an amazing chocolate one!",5.0
"Eggcellent brunch.  Been here for dinner which was good, but brunch is truly their specialty.  I had Duck Hash and my girlfriend had a spinach and goat cheese croissant.   Simply marvelous.  Perfect for Sunday morning after a late saturday night.   There is always a 30 minute wait however on weekends.",4.0
"had a late lunch here today. The decor has a Paris neighborhood bistro feel and a great atmosphere. the eclectic background music helps a lot for the experience. The wine list is OK, tried 2 of their reds, nothing to comment about them. I had the steak and frites (excellent!) two glasses of wine and a creme brulee for dessert. The service was good and the food was fantastic.  What a pleasant lunch I had. I'll def. go back and try their brunch...",4.0
"Rolled up in here with a friend at 1:30am. We had found ourselves starving in Brooklyn, and used the Yelp app to find all the hotspots in the area. On cursory glance of the reviews, we expected a diner-type bistro hybrid with a hefty brunch and breakfast selection. No dice. Unsure we were in the right place, we entered an enchanted little restaurant-- dim, with lots of lush plants and candles, but not a drop of maple syrup to be found. With very few other options, I ordered a cheeseburger from the latenight menu. My companion had the bread pudding. Both were good noms, but uncomfortably pricey for the quality. The service left quite a bit to be desired as well, I must admit-- inattentive, slow, distracted, even though we were one of the only tables eating in the whole place. Still, it was a beautiful space, with lovely ambiance , and open when we needed it to be. Probably an effective and romantic spot for a date, if you don't mind shelling out the extra duckets. So much so, that it was almost awkward for a munching on a late snack with a pal. Based on my experience, I probably won't find my way back on this Barricou trail, not even for brunch. Brooklyn isn't the kind of place where a girl needs to settle on so-so grub.",3.0
"I really wanted to like this place, but I have to say that my brunch experience was not that great.  The spinach and goat cheese omelet I ordered came with so much salt on the top that I think it must have been an accident because it rendered the top of the omelet inedible.  The fatal lapse however, was the watered down bloody mary that arrived after my food did.   And with there being so many decent brunch places in the area that include the whole brunch for under $12, I won't be going back.",2.0

It's pretty nice here great place to bring a date.The portions are on the small and pricey side so be warned in advanced. It's a long wait to get a table during dinner rush so be prepared to wait a while. For brunch I didn't think much of my duck confit since I was mostly picking out onions and tasted maybe 4 strips of duck but maybe the chef ran out of duck when my order got placed. I wished I had ordered my bf's steak very very tasty. As for dinner I was disappointed with the mussels in white wine sauce since it seemed kind of bland to me but my bf's coq au vin was awesome. Strangely the couple next to us got served first even though they were seated after us and their orders were taken after us. And the wait for the food was quite long an hour and a half although we could see the place was extremely busy. The waitress noticed us looking puzzled and she very nicely told us dessert was on the house. Neither my bf or I had said anything so that was surprisingly welcome.,4.0

"I can't wait to go back to Le Barricou. The staff is beyond friendly and extremely attentive; our table was never without full glasses of water and wine, and our bread basket was always refilled. If you're looking for great waiter service, this is the place to be. The atmosphere is fantastic, too; great French music playing, cute decor, and lots of interesting pictures on the walls. The food, of course, is the main attraction. We started off with the escargot, which was phenomenal. It was buttery, garlicky, and steaming hot, which is just what you want in escargot. It was only $8 and came with 12 pieces; a bargain, if you ask me. I could have eaten it all on my own. For the main course, we ordered mussels, which were perfectly cooked and swimming in a delicious broth that was perfect for sopping up with the warm, freshly made bread that was served along with dinner. The only problem was that when the waitress came by to describe the house specials for the day, she mentioned a salad which I thought sounded delicious and I ordered it, but when it came, it was very small; it turned out to be meant as an appetizer and not as a main course. I was confused as to why she hadn't mentioned that to me when she explained the house specials, but my husband and friend's food was already at the table and I didn't feel like waiting for them to make something else for me while the other ate. I had some of my husband's dinner and some more bread to make up for where the salad lacked, which was only in size, definitely not in flavor.

"Le Barricou is a delicious yet VERY confused restaurant.  I was expecting a French bistro menu but the menu is filled with things that are more likely to appease neighborhood people looking for american fare.  For instance, the first three items on the menu were:  A hamburger, a chicken sandwich, and a pulled pork sandwich.  The menu rounds out at the end with a pasta dish with basil and parmesan.  I ordered one of the only french things on the menu coq au vin and my date got the lamb shank.  Both were extremely delicious with the lamb shank coming right on the bone with wild mushroom risoto.  Mine was served traditionally with bacon lardons, pearl onions, mashed potatoes and the chicken which was drowining in the delicious red wine sauce.  It wasn't a traditional coq au vin which you could tell was braised for hours.  I think they cheated and pan cooked it, but regardless it was really good and hit the spot with the wine we ordered.  The menu is limited and you basically order by region rather than by what the bottle is, but what do you want from a place on Grand Street on the east side of the neighborhood?I wish they'd go more French, but like Juliette, they really are trying to appease everyone's pallets.",3.0

"my mouth waters just thinking about this place. i use to go for a sit down cup of coffee when i lived around the corner, when it was quiet. oh those days are long gone. now there's a wait for a table at brunch, which unfortunately is the only time i can make it out there since my move to bushwick. i get the eggs Norwegian with a super-delicious bloody mary (and i like to think of myself as a bloody mary connoisseur). the eggs are always perfectly poached and the home-fries are nicely seasoned accompanied with a little side of greens that i always wish were more. i'm always eying another customer's huge plate of pancakes which seem to be pretty popular from the number of plates of them i see at any one sitting. i know one day i'll conquer the mountain of deliciousness!  until next time my french lover on grand st!",5.0
"Great service, delicious meals, and finely crafted cocktails.  This place has them all.  I've been here twice now and have enjoyed myself each time.  The ""den"" in the back of the restaurant is great for a fireside chat, and the music in the main dining area is quiet enough to talk over.  Another great thing about this place is that it is a short walk away from Barcade.",5.0
"Great Food!  I've been here twice and both times were great.  Service is excellent, food selection and specials are plentiful.  Walking distance from my place too.",5.0
"Last time I went it became 'stressful' -- its too crowded for brunch, that's why I avoid LES brunches. Also, a few times before the waitstaff was kinda rude -- I forgave them because hey -- its Le Bar and I love the food. But really, I decided enough was enough in 2009...I would rather make my own brunch and special bloody marys than go back. Sorry Le Bar your food may be good, but you are kinda too busy for me -- our brunch relationship is over :(",3.0
"Only waited 15 min on a Sunday @ noon.  Really good brunch; great Croque Madame, Merguez Sausage, Omelette, well exceuted Bloody Mary(s - had to have two they were so good).  15-month old loved the frites and they had high chairs. Very good value.  Server was pleasant but having trouble keeping up with her tables, but hey it's brunch not Bouley.  Would def go back again.",4.0
"Great atmosphere, great service by a staff who KNOWS their food and drink and very, very yummy food!  Went there on a date night.  My husband had read something about it on ""Edible Brooklyn"" and was really excited about giving absinthe a go (we had never had the absinth experience).  We arrived early in the evening - very lovely space with a warm old worldy sort of ambiance.  We asked the bartender/mixologist what he would recommend as it was our first time.  He was really helpful and knew his stuff.  We had the Duplais Blanche and Veiux Pontarlier.  So very tasty, but we couldn't resist the cocktails off of the menu.  I ventured on to the Stormy Weather (can't say no to anything with jalapeno) and he had the Whisky Smash.  As we were drinking we thought...this would be great with cheese!  So we ordered a cheese plate and went with some suggestions from our very knowledgeable bartender (it is FANTASTIC when the folks at the restaurant know and love food and drink as much as you do).  Cocktails and cheese!  It was so good that I went there for brunch with some friends and once again the service was excellent, the cocktails were amazing and as a bonus, the brunch menu was damn tasty!  Between the 4 of us there were a lot of ooo's, ahhs and oh my gods so yes, we did enjoy our Grilled Burger, Croque Madame and Spinach and Goat Cheese Croissant.  What more do you need?",5.0

"Le Barricou has impressed me although I have only eaten there twice. The first time was a year ago for brunch. I sat in the front section and was wooed by their delicious drinks and most excellent Hollandaise sauce. The second time was last night, for their prix-fixe dinner. For $29 I started with the cauliflower & porccini mushroom soup, which was absolutely out of this world. It was rich and flavorful and had a small zip to it which went great with my Pilsner. For the main course I had fresh Pollock served on a bed of cranberry beans, mushrooms and fennel. The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors were wonderful. My friends ordered the lamb shank, which if I ate lamb, would've been a top choice. It was so perfectly cooked the knife that was provided went unused, as the meat just flaked off the bone in juicy portions. We were given a chocolate layered ""cake"" for dessert, which was divine. And after all the stuffing, with the check we received a plateful of chocolate truffles. The service was impeccable, I never had a glass of water that was less that 3/4 full. The ambiance in the back room is ideal for an intimate dinner. The fireplace was roaring and the jazz and holiday music was at the perfect level. This place was nearly empty one year ago, and last night it was packed. Come here for the most excellent french food at a reasonable price.",4.0

"I've been meaning to big up this place for a long time now.  The food here is fantastic, the staff (especially Connor) is super sweet.  It's my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn right now.  I've only been for dinner so far.  The first time that I went was with a group of 10 for my husband's birthday.  They were super accommodating and my steak was cooked perfectly.  We went back a few weeks later and again amazing service, fantastic food.  I highly recommend this place.",5.0
"Great late night dinner spot- we got there at 9:45, waited 20 mins for a table in the back by the TOASTY fireplace. Met some new people while there- great crowd. Menu was delicious and reasonable, we had the escargots, moules fritte with a spicy tomato sauce, a lovely salad, oysters, carrot soup and mac and cheese. The mussels and mac really stand out as the best things. Later some friends arrived and we lingered for a long time, had lots of drinks and left around 1am. Our waitress was sweet but either exhausted or out of it, made a few mistakes in our order and there was a veerrryyy long wait for our food both courses, strange since the place was emptying out. Maybe their kitchen was short staffed? I want to give them a break since we loved everything once it got there. Also- the Christmas music was ""K-Mart"" horrendous- we complained and they said they could not change it, yet 1 hour later the music was much improved! Will be back for sure, a great spot, cozy and very Williamsburg in decor and clientele. Half the price of a decent French meal in NYC- my new go to....good bye Balthazar and Raouls...at least for a bit.",4.0
"The food was excellent, the waitress was crap! She definitely had problems remembering things. First she forgot my friends drink, didn't get cream for the americano when requested and forgot pastries we ordered. Even after a different server had offered to replace the coffee because it was cold by then, she tried to charge us for the forgotten pastries and drink,  and the replacement americano. She then accused my friend of receiving the drink even though we saw her dilly-dallying with the drink on her tray never serving it, and then went on to say an Americano doesn't come with cream. After editing the bill she slammed it on our table. She also said they are cash only so i think this listing needs to be updated to reflect that if she wasn't mistaken this time!",3.0

More spacious than Dumont, there is nothing lacking in this new addition on Grand Street, East Williamsburg.  Looks like this place would be good for having drinks also with extra space and a an old school foosball table in the back.  They even have a couple of high chairs.",4.0
