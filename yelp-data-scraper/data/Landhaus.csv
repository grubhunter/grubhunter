This place has delicious bacon on a stick! I wasn't sure what I was getting into but was definitely not disappointed! The staff is also super nice and great. Kyala helped us out and was a great experience,5.0
"Bacon lovers... put this on your bucket list. This maple bacon on a stick will change your life and you will have major withdrawals afterwards. They're large slabs of pork on sticks, drizzled with a little maple syrup and a dash of spice. Sweet, savory, salty, and fatty all at once. Don't tell anyone, but I have dreams about this. It's absolute perfection, and it should really win an award..When I take my friends to this booth at Smorgasburg, they are speechless when they take a bite, and one actually started crying out of happiness. I've never seen such emotion before. Unfortunately, I haven't actually been to the restaurant itself... but it's something on my list. I love you Landhaus!",5.0
"Delicious!!! Bacon is always a good idea and these folks get it. Juicy, grilled just right, maple bacon in a stick @ smorgasburg was on point. They add some spices like bbq so it has this sweet savory and spicy kick to it.",5.0
"Maple bacon on a stick? Sign me up! It was good but not delicious enough to be worth the $3 price tag on it for 2 bites. It tastes like pork belly soaked in maple syrup. I'd go for the burgers, they seem more worth it. I just can't fathom paying $9 for 3 pieces of bacon when I can get a lamb burger from them for that price.",3.0
"Fish tacos were delicious, flavorful with the perfect amount of sauce. Hush puppies yummy too, light and slightly crispy with a spicy kick. Laid back atmosphere on open patio, perfect summer place to come have a drink and an appetizer or two.",4.0
"The maple bacon stick was amazing! The bacon is salty and topped with maple syrup and some seasoning. The initial taste is light and sweet. As you bite down, the tenderness of the meat and fat melts in your mouth. As you chew, the salty flavor flows out and mixes with the sweet flavor creating a very balanced taste.",5.0
"Really good maple bacon. I tried them at Smorgasburg, not sure where/if they have a real restaurant in NYC but definitely an amazing experience that time. 3$ a piece, pretty pricy but then its pretty normal compared to the rest of smorg.I also had their pork chop sandwich which was doused in bbq sauce and that was really good as well but slightly too much bbq. Aside from that, the pickled onions they put on it was good flavoring as well.",5.0
"Really amazing sandwiches at a very reasonable price. The lamb burger was delicious, and only $9. Also, their spicy maple bacon sticks are possibly the best thing I've ever eaten. Fried pickles are good, but make sure there's more than 2 of you sharing -- felt kinda sick after.Also, like that you can get a delicious slushy drink at the Woods while you're waiting. My pina colada was delicious.",4.0
"Words fail me. Maple bacon on a stick. Absolute magic. A bit misleading though - see, this isn't some slice of bacon. This is a proper slab of pork, drizzled in some kind of outstanding maple sauce. Cooked to perfection too, it came apart beautifully.I also had their ""Haus Fries"". I was a little wary about spending $6.00 on an order of fries, but then I got it and it was about as big as my head. My friends and I shared them, and the unanimous consensus was ""damn good fries.""Last point, the staff were personable, friendly, and knew what they were recommending. I didn't catch any names, but good job them! And tucked away in the back of The Woods like that, it's such a weirdly charming location. Best of all, that maple bacon pairs really well with whiskey.",5.0
"Man oh man! I went in this weekend so I could get my munch on. I've been here before, but I had to try this new menu that a friend of mine told me about. The crispy confit chicken wings were on point. The sauce they use on those things are one of the best I've ever had, right up there with the teriyaki hot wings at the Candlelight Inn in Scarsdale. They have a solid steak sandwich here as well. My girlfriend had the grilled cheese with Landhaus bacon. She wants to go back next weekend for another one. The staff were friendly and funny as well. Overall, a great experience!",5.0
"Where: Williamsburg Smorgasborg When: Sat, Oct 5, 2013What to eat: PORK BELLY ON A STICK WITH MAPLE SYRUP. MIND BLOWN! So good. So good. So good. I definitely recommend. One of the best things I ate while there, way better than the ramen burger (still disappointed in that).  Oh yea, it wasn't too fatty or too lean. There was a perfect ratio of fat to protein. Sweet and salty.",4.0
"I first experienced Landhaus at South st seaport's Smorgasbord last summer and they made a great impression in. Flash foward a year and change and i come to find out thru the power of Yelp that they have a permanent location in Billsburg BK. They kept their anthem item: Maple bacon on a stick, but also added to my delight a more rounded and substantial menu to their repertoire. This past weekend I had their BLT and their fish tacos. Very impressive in both execution and flavor combo!!Now that the weather allows me to hide in coats and jackets I am sure to come back more often and try the haunting Poutin...",5.0
Get the maple bacon on a stick if you love sweet and savory! You will want more and have to battle with your will to stop!,5.0
"I'm a huge Landhaus fan. They've been around for a while with their tent at Smorgasburg, but this location at the Woods with a larger menu is even better. Their grilled corn is the bomb (seriously, it's my favorite), jalapeno cheddar hush puppies were fluffy and flavorful, great shrimp burger, and crab rangoon...I've loved everything I've tried. A couple weeks ago they had a ramen special that was absolutely delicious - perfect in this chilly weather. I also dig the outdoor seating. It's a nice place to chill in the summer, and in the winter they put up panels and get the heaters going. Cozyyyy. And don't forget the bacon on a stick, y'all. ;) In conclusion: highly recommended and definitely worth checking out. Come for the drinks, stay for the food. Or just come for the food.",5.0
"(Review of Landhaus at Smorgasburg)The $9 lamb burger was totally legit. They also had some of the thickest cut bacon on a stick I've ever seen, but I was too hungover to attempt to stomach it. Smelled really good though.",4.0
"Tried the Maple Bacon on a Stick at the Landhaus stand @ Smorgasburg. Didn't disappoint! 3 sticks for 8 bucks i believe and my friends and I were sold. It's not a meal but a great snack and a quite tasty one. Before they serve it to you, i believe they add some mild spices and spread some maple sauce. They somehow cooked it to perfection where you cannot tell the difference from the layer of fat from the meat. Definitely one of the better things to try at Smorgasburg.",4.0

"OK...let's be honest, people...Is there anything better than a) bacon or b) things on a stick?! Come on: popsicles, corn dogs, lollipops, cake pops, blue cheese stuffed olives, corn on the upright cob...I could go on (don't even play, you know you could too). Well, now you can have the best of both worlds in the blissful marriage of, you guessed it, bacon on a stick.

Big green pastures real; pork belly from the far corners of Pennsylvania outer NY regions real; slow roasting until these slabs of bacon could honestly stand alone and sell out real.And it's not only in one place but several, gaining traction all throughout Brooklyn, thanks to the brilliant minds and seriously talented chefs behind the Landhaus team. This all too portable sinful meaty treat  is just the beginning though as Matthew Lief, owner and veritable mastermind, has taken Landhaus through to great success and ample praise at the Brooklyn Flea/Smorgasburg and has finally made moves to put some legs under this 'farm to sandwich' eatery--expanding to brick and mortar real-deal locations in Park Slope (People's Pops off-season stomping grounds) as well as moving into The Woods in South Williamsburg as a fully operational sandwich and small bites shop that unabashedly brings new flavor profiles and rich unctuous takes to comfort foods no one thought needed a boost at all. The BLT is out of this world and the clam chowder can bring you to tears--the best part though are the small seemingly siomple updates to what seems like the same ole sandwhich staples like chicken salad--Um ya, here that's jerk chicken to you with lip smacking chutney or the even more impressive kick-ass additions of sharp cheddar sauce and pickled peppers to the short rib sammie...Yep, I said it.Whatever you do though, do not, I repeat, DO NOT pass up their house-made fresh mint lemonade--not always available in all of their locals but when and if you see it.
