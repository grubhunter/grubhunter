"First:*The atmosphere: chalkboard menus, old wood, local art, books!*The customer service: the best EVER. I've been in here twice. The first time I was in here I met Kimi who was absolutely lovely, complimented me on my choice of drink, and talked to me while she made it, welcoming me to the neighborhood. Kimi also does this cute art she makes into magnets that you can buy at Roots. The second time I met Amanda, who was cute and bubbly and talkative as well. When I returned to Roots last night for a poetry event, Amanda remembered my name. The drinks were also delicious and made with love, but because of these wonderful people they've gained a new long-term customer!",5.0
"Ate in house one morning around 11. BUSY! The staff handled it well however. It's very much a ""order, pick up"" style - order at the counter, pick up at the counter when they call your name.I ordered a tofu scramble with vegan cheese and vegan chorizo, as well as a house roast coffee with a splash of almond milk. I sat outside in the small but charming courtyard. Very cute! Great place for a low-key, no-frills vegetarian feed in the Slope!",4.0
"Good stuff here for lunch Try the egg and cheese burrito with tomato, avocado, and black bean spreadThey don't take credit cardKinda not obvious until you're standing at the register... Would be nice to have advanced notice There are books and games to keep you occupied if you don't have your own entertainment Staff was very friendly",4.0
"Fantastic place, they're so so nice here. The drinks and food are both amazing, especially the ginger lemonade!",5.0
"The service is by far superb and outstanding. The owner is delightful and engages every single customer like they are the only customer that matters. Service is definitely a solid five stars.The food was plentiful and flavorful! I am drooling just thinking about it. I had the egg and cheese burritos with all the extras I.e beans, tomatoes and guacamole. I also added the vegan sausage. I love that they put the burritos in a panini press it adds an extra layer of flavor and the crunch is good.With all that wonderful stuff said the wait for the food was punishingly long. We waited over 30 minutes for the sandwiches which in my opinion was way too long. During our visit we saw several patrons leave because the long was long and moving slowly.",4.0
"A summer time must visit.This small coffee shop is super fun and trendy.  The staff are awesome.  The large board to the right of the register lists a bunch of home made custom lattes.  For instance they had one which is made with yoohoo.  I have yet to try it but will be back soon to get my hands on it.  They have a petty good breakfast offering which is why I stopped in here.I had the egg and cheese panini but for $1 a topping you can add things like avocado, bacon etc.  One of the foods this place is known for is the Cheesey grits.  Unless you are ravenously hungry the smaller size will likely be enough as these grits can be a bit heavy.  The best part of them is the top layer which is drizzled with a touch of olive oil and dusted with a touch of herbs/spices. I will admit I had thought the dish would be a lot cheesier then it was in reality.  The grits had enough flavor to hold it's own but I would have liked to taste a little cheeyness.The highlight of this place for me is the out door seating area.  It is hard to see from the front of the store but make your way back there if you want to sit back and sip on some java.  It is very quiet and relaxing and the decor is perfect.  This place is an escape from the hustle and bustle I would definitely recommend coming here with a book or some work and just relaxing outback.The coffee I had was the house blend which was very well balanced.  Some places have a tendency to go to extreme either brewing motor oil or coffee tea.  Although I didn't notice anything outstanding about the coffee is was absolutely enjoyable.Make sure you bring cash because they are CASH ONLY.I'll be back.    -Arnold",5.0
"I feel so hipster when I come here but I don't care because bohemians, locals and young families is another vibe I get and that I give... Ethiopian afro with highlights and with toddler in tow and all lol. The food is awesome... it feels like a time warp into simpler times when people actually cooked from scratch with natural ingredients. No matter what you eat or drink they make it so that it is a warming comfort to your soul. I have had peppermint mocha and the grits and left feeling like singing, ""yellow is the color of her energy.""They want you to feel cozy here, so the dim lights of vintage lamps and round Christmas bulb lights does an excellent job of achieving that. You feel like you could be in an old bookstore or antique store. Every single customer in here seemed to be there for the long haul with their laptops and fat books. I bet a lot of study sessions and work gets done here. The workers are personable and welcoming to seal the deal.",5.0
"A solid health-conscious breakfast or lunch choice. The staff is very friendly and helped me customize my sandwich. The iced teas are HUGE! Less than $3 for 24oz. I got a cucumber hummus wrap and added egg whites. They used 2-3 oz of hummus (much more than I expected) and everything was fresh and crispy. The best part was NO OIL! So many deli-type spots love to pile that garbage on, so that was refreshing.Wait time was about 15 minutes, so I do have to knock off a star.",4.0
Cozy place. Warm atmosphere. Friendly people. Awesome sandwiches. Perfect salted caramel latte.,5.0
"Nice cosy coffee spot, not easy to find if you don't know about it. I think they know it because they asked me, being a first time customer, how I found them I just ordered a tea to stay, to feel the ambience for 10-15 minutes. I asked if they have pastries in the morning, they told me they have muffins and cake slices etc. Because I love pastries like turnover, pain au chocolat etc, I took a star off. With (good) pastries, it would be a 4 stars spot.Ps. And If I see that they make an excellent latte, they might even get the 5th star!",3.0

"This reminds me of a few similar places in Orlando (where I'm from) like Drunken Monkey or Stardust Cafe. It's a small cafe with awesome food and cute, quirky decorations. Very laid back and a great place to come on a coffee date or to get some work done on your laptop.We came here for breakfast which is always a challenge when you have a vegan with allergies and an omnivore eating together. Fortunately they had an amazing tofu scramble I got as a bowl and added tomatoes, avocado, black bean spread, and vegan sausage. The employees have great suggestions for what form would work best with your ingredients (bowl, burrito, tacos, etc), and they have some killer options for coffee (I had an iced soy mocha and my husband had an iced maple butter latte). My husband got an egg, cheese, bacon, black bean spread burrito and was in heaven. They are cash only, which was kinda a bummer for us but the bodega next door had an ATM so it was an easy problem to solve.So A+ for friendly service, good food, great coffee, and a cute place with enough space despite seeming so small when you walk in.Next time we are in town, this will be a regular stop for us!",5.0
"This place is so great. We always come for the breakfast burritos, which are the best! We get the ones with fresh eggs, black bean paste, cheese, avocados, and tomatoes, and it's super solid. Wish they gave a little more salsa, which is incredible. The perfect breakfast if you're hungry! Good chai lattes, too. A small, serene outside patio in the back in the spring made our day!

"New York City exemplifies quick service. Anyone who has spent even a brief amount of time here knows that most interactions in cafe's and restaurants are limited to brief pleasantries at most. To be fair, I'm generally one of those types. Let's just do the 'food ordering' thing. But Roots is different. It's personality is shaped around human interaction and genuine love. I know - save the tears for a rerun of the M.A.S.H. finalé mr. soppy pants... I'm sorry, I can't. This place is a little tiny community built around the very stuff that human beings crave. Warmth, genuine good nature, art, excitement, food, acceptance... I've heard people in here treat the counter like a therapists couch while 20 people wait behind them. SOMEHOW that's like 100% cool here, isn't that wild? Oh and their burritos are fucking killer.",5.0

"I always stop by for a coffee whenever I visit from out of town.  My experience has always been pleasant.  Today my sister (who lives nearby) and I decided to order take-out.  She had the City Slicker and I had Borderline. I like that you can easily make several things vegan.  Wait time was average.  I just waited with an almond latte.  Overall I still like everything about this place..the people, the atmosphere, all the cute decorations.  My sister found a short strand of dark hair in her sandwich, and 3 minutes later, I found a longer strand of brown hair in my sandwich within the black bean spread.  It takes a lot to gross me out, so I just picked it off and continued eating.  However, my sister was so disgusted that she couldn't continue eating..as I think most people would.  I'm not sure if she will ever order food from there again.  I would still order from here, because for me one piece of hair doesn't void all the positives I see from this place...but would suggest more careful handling and prepping of the food.",4.0

"Been meaning to jump on the pile here for quite some time. Have lived in the neighborhood since March after living in Portland for a year, which has rendered me a total coffee snob (see my review for nearby Southside Coffee as an example). Anyway, Roots really is, as Yelp allows, ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" You feel like family here even if it's your first time, but you'll get to know all the folks who work here (There are three of them by my count) in no time if you're a regular. I regret that I haven't gotten any of their names yet, but they're all extremely friendly and genuinely enjoy talking to their customers. Now, onto the coffee. Love the beans they get from Forty Weight, which apparently used to be in the neighborhood and has since relocated to Colorado. They offer different roasts, drip is always good, and the pull is always on point. What really got my attention was their cold brew, which is fantastic. Prices are standard for Brooklyn and the food is good, but nothing mindblowing. Tin Cup down the street wins for best pastries in the area cafe contest, but I'd never judge a cafe on its food -- I come here for the coffee, and it's worth it every time.",5.0

"Came here with awesome expectations considering all the great Yelp reviews I read before coming here. The place is warm and welcoming. The people behind the bar were really nice and the food was delicious. I had a soy mocha and a hummus sandwich. I recommend both those things for breakfast. The place is a little smaller than it seems from pictures, but that is okay because I like intimate spaces. The patio sitting is nice, although when I came half of the space was covered with card boxes ( for trash or recycling I guess) but that was a turn down for ambience. Also the prices are a little high. For example to order chocolate flavor or soy or almond milk in your coffee you have to pay extra for each thing. It would be nicer if they had a mocha coffee option or at least to have an extra that is not as high as $.75. Also this place is cash only, keep that in mind when coming here.

"The only problem with this place is the loungers (but I guess that's every internet cafe) There will be people here who will sit all day and just take up seats for no reasonLuckily, we found a spot in the corner. We bought the Brooklyn BBQ and City Slicker with chips. The sandwiches were filling enough. We didn't need the chips.(That's my tip for the day)Everything was delicious, and the Habiscus and Black teas were perfect compliments",4.0
"Good coffee and even better breakfast and lunch sandwiches/simple baked goods. The tofu scramble is a favorite as is the turkey sandwich with avacado. Only reason for one star off is that the place is so narrow, dark and sometimes the Wi-Fi doesn't work. Since the demise of Has Beans across 5th Avenue, this place and La Boulangerie Lopez are my go to places for a little bit of food and a business meeting. In the Spring & Summer, the small back patio is a nice option/alternative to the rather darkened main room. Also there are almost no outlets. People spend several hours parked here with laptops, which is not the business's fault.",4.0
"Perfect neighborhood café with a cozy and friendly atmosphere, super nice staff and owners. Great place to come work and be around fellow south slopers. They have a mean breakfast menu and awesome coffee drinks to boot.",5.0
"I can't stop loving this place. Consistently friendly staff, and I mean FRIENDLY. I keep telling my friends that I've moved in next to the nicest coffee shop on earth. I love the vegan options. The tofu scramble burrito is fantastic with black beans, avocado and tomato AND vegan sausage. Great coffee. Great atmosphere and I really can't get over how nice the staff and owners Amanda and Christian are. Solid, wonderful place. Thanks for being perpetually awesome, Roots Cafe!",5.0
"What an adorable little gem in the South Slope! This place has become a new local spot for my boyfriend and I on weekend afternoons. You can't go wrong with their City Slicker sandwich (turkey, mixed greens, meted swiss and avocado!) and a good ol' cup of joe. Aside from the food, the atmosphere is cozy and down-to-earth and the employees are incredibly friendly. No complaints about this joint!",5.0
good coffee :) Highly recommended if you love mom and pop coffee shops,4.0

"My 14-year-old son wanted to go to ""Brooklyn,"" so we sort of randomly picked this as a starting point based on the Yelp reviews. It was a perfect start to our day. A little hole in the wall with a satisfying menu and such friendly staff. Even though I am SURE we didn't look like locals, we felt like locals. Thank you.",5.0

the place is a very nice place - to sit down and just hang out really comfortably. the owners are great ppl and thats what makes up for the place.coffee is very tempermental- the regular house blend/ ethiopian blend both.the food portions are generous though and they really are a super nice place to hang out in.,4.0

"This is the first time I've felt compelled to leave a yelp review. This place was so great! I stumbled upon it on a lazy morning headed to the train.

The fact that the staff goes out of their way to know their customers beyond their order, now that is customer service.",5.0
"My new fave! A very random but successful find. No-nonsense breakfast menu, self serve, good value. Very cozy outdoor patio, multiple planters with herbs and patio lights.

There are a few recycled books and board games on display, for locals to enjoy.  We will most definitely come back.",5.0

The music is always perfect, at least for me (from jazz to classic rock). The atmosphere is perfect for getting work done on your laptop. The food is excellent (and, even better, they have many vegan options). The coffee's consistently is dark and strong (just how I like it). It's a pleasant retreat from the stuck up coffee shops of NYC.

"The Roots Cafe was a quintessential Brooklyn experience for some out-of-towners looking for breakfast and coffee.

When they heard we were tourists, they didn't make us feel bad or awkward, rather they made us feel comfortable and welcomed. They could not have been more friendly. They catered to everything we needed or wanted. The food was delicious. I had the egg & cheese bowl with black bean spread and tomatoes and the acai mango iced tea.

"The weird thing about South Slope is that the few dining and drinking options stomp the hell out of Park Slope. The cheaper rents tend to attract restauranteurs and artisans who just want to focus on their passion, shabby-looking neighborhood be damned.

It's big enough that you don't feel like you're taking up valuable space but cozy enough where you aren't drinking coffee in someone's closet.The panine are tops and Stumptown coffee is famous for being really damn good.One warning too.

"PROS: Roots coffee has great coffee, very friendly staff, and a great atmosphere. CONS: They don't shake the almond or soy milk before pouring it in customers' coffee -  not cool. They also use brands of almond/soy milk that contain carrageenan - HORRIBLE for you and causes a plethora of health issues. A true shocker to me (especially with the vibe of this place and amount of vegan and ""natural"" food items they have in their store) - they use HERSHEY'S syrup in their mocha's. Really??? You have vegan pastries, but you use Hersey's syrup in your store? The first ingredient on the label is high fructose corn syrup - not to mention the preservatives. I was really shocked by this and will not be purchasing coffee from Roots until they use a more quality brand of chocolate for their mocha's, hot chocolate, etc. Gross.",1.0

Now mind you they don't do the pour-over so much of Brooklyn is getting used-to (and I enjoy as well) but they do have a $1 refill which you can't get at pour-over spots. Most impressive to me though is that they make delicious breakfast burritos that don't drip all over you.I LOVE breakfast burritos but they almost always come apart or are soaked through with some watery salsa. These folks grill their burrito just enough to hold tight, and offer a tasty pepper dipping sauce on the side.Having just moved within a block I couldn't be happier to have my morning coffee-shop ritual taken care of.

"Awesome little coffee shop. The Borderline sandwich (black beans, avocado, and cheddar on toast) is akin to a religious experience. Okay, maybe not, but still really good. Great little desserts at the counter, delicious iced tea, and cool decor. The guy who is usually working at the counter is very friendly. Free WiFi, too.

"Roots Cafe is very small, and completely awesome. They have some of the most comfortable couches I've ever sat on in a place of business.* I actually want to live in here, and I'm not the only one who feels this way. People were just making up excuses to come hang out. ""Did I leave my wallet here? No? Oh weird, there it is, in my back pocket. Who would've thought. I guess I'll just sit in this chair for the next two hours.""When I started looking at the menu, one of the guys engaged in conversation behind me jumped behind the counter. I asked him if he had a favorite sandwich. The answer was matter-of-fact, ""No. They are all amazing."" As it turned out, he was not remotely fucking around.I ordered the BBQ Bird. Turkey, cheddar, onions, sweet relish & BBQ sauce on a half-wrap, half-pita sort of thing. As he made it, the guy sang along to ""Here Comes the Sun"" by the Beatles. And honestly, it was prophetic, because when this sandwich arrived, it was pretty much exactly like the sun.

"Roots has become the go-to spot for my girlfriend and I to get work done during the weekend, and I couldn't possibly be more in love*. Good coffee, cozy atmosphere, and yummy food? Count me in.

When I asked about the change, the staff said that there just wasn't a demand for it. I'm kind of over restaurants, especially ones that clearly cater to the typical Brooklyn hippy dippy cow huggin' crowd, that carrying a few packages of tofurkey [which run about 3 bucks a pop] is too much to ask for.

Great little desserts at the counter, delicious iced tea, and cool decor. The guy who is usually working at the counter is very friendly. Free WiFi, too.

"Roots Cafe is very small, and completely awesome. They have some of the most comfortable couches I've ever sat on in a place of business.* I actually want to live in here, and I'm not the only one who feels this way. People were just making up excuses to come hang out. ""Did I leave my wallet here? No? Oh weird, there it is, in my back pocket. Who would've thought. I guess I'll just sit in this chair for the next two hours.""When I started looking at the menu, one of the guys engaged in conversation behind me jumped behind the counter. I asked him if he had a favorite sandwich. The answer was matter-of-fact, ""No. They are all amazing."" As it turned out, he was not remotely fucking around.I ordered the BBQ Bird. Turkey, cheddar, onions, sweet relish & BBQ sauce on a half-wrap, half-pita sort of thing. As he made it, the guy sang along to ""Here Comes the Sun"" by the Beatles.

"This is your typical, run of the mill hippy coffee shop in the Slope: high priced mediocre food, zero non-white people, singer-songwriters on repeat, and the staff doesn't give a crap about you even after you try smiling and conversing with them. If it wasn't for the sheer convenience of it's location to my apartment, I wouldn't have ever gone here as much as I did, but in the end I've found much better, more colorful, friendlier coffee shops in the area that charge the same amount or cheaper but provide higher quality food and better service.  I am willing to bet the only real reason people go here is because it meets the criteria of their white privileged comfort zone. Yuck.",1.0

"I have to admit, I don't drink coffee, but I do like Roots Cafe. My wife and I had lunch there today. We chose a couple of paninis, and they were toasted to perfection. My wife's was turkey, mozzarella, and avocado, mine avocado & black bean paste. Both were delicious, and served with a side of chips and salsa.The atmosphere and staff are welcoming and warm, and there are plenty of outlets if you happen to bring your laptop and need to get some work done.Washed down with Austin's own Sweet Leaf Tea (the mint and honey green tea is one of my favorite non-alcoholic libations), this was the perfect meal on a cold winter day.",4.0
A Very sweet neighborhood cozy joint that I love to frequent whenever I'm on 5th. I haven't been in since the re-model but I am very excited to check it out and order one of their lovely coffee drinks!,5.0
"Roots Cafe is definitely a viable option for southern (slope) brunchasaurs. The breakfast paninis are fine and tasty. The cheese grits are pretty cheesy and better than those of Sidecar. I ain't a coffee drinker, but even I enjoyed a sip of their Stumptown brew. And it's the only place I know of in the neighborhood where you can get sweet tea. (Attention all restaurants north of the Mason Dixon Line: stop pretending Snapple is iced tea!)  Though tiny, Roots Cafe also has some music on Friday evenings. During the day, it's the kind of place you can hole up in for a while, staring at the oddments on the walls and the offerings of its public bookshelf.",4.0

"It's weird to me that I didn't love this place the first time I came in. I come here ever time I'm in New York now. The coffee is terrific. I still love the cheezy grits (they keep tweaking the recipe - it's not garlicky anymore, and not as buttery as it used to be - just very cheezy). The menu has lots of other good stuff - I don't get that, ""here, eat a twig!"" feeling at all anymore. The people who work here are very nice, and the atmosphere is very cozy. They know their customers. It's on a human scale. And above all the music is excellent. They're almost always pretty full, so - 5 stars, but save me a seat!",5.0

"I've reviewed the Tea Lounge, Red Horse, Cafe 474, Cafe Regular, Ozzies--you get the idea. This is my new favorite cafe in Park Slope.

Really strong, sweet coffee ""Stumptown"" and a good selection of teas (Chocolate/Vanilla, Mango, Blood Orange, etcetc). Very tidy in spite of the coziness, you won't feel like a roach is about to crawl on you or get the bedbug feeling like in Tea Lounge. And best of all, VERY few (none when I went!) children.

The food prep is a little on the slow side, but the few things I've had off the menu have been delicious. Breakfast burrito was fantastic, served on a plate of cheesy grits, oh baby.

"This coffee shop has to be the most bizzar place ive ever entered.  I came in here for a cup of coffee and the moment i walked in the door i felt like i had walked onto another planet.  First of all it was packed full of hipsters and sorts. the store is much longer then it is wide so you walk down the store past the small tables and ppl standing around until finally I got to the cash register where there was a band playing all sorts of weird music that sounded like something ive never heard before.Everybody sitting around and standing, leaning up against things, completely zoned out, almost like i had walked into an opium den... My head started to spin i couldn't comprehend what was going on.  It would have felt more at ease trapped in the lion cage at the zoo.  This place really gave me the hibijibies.  Upon receiving the coffee i bee lined to the the door and once outside in the fresh air i breathed a sigh of relief, looked at my friend as we exchanged looks, WTF just happened back there.",3.0

"My girlfriend & I were in Brooklyn visiting for the weekend.  We had breakfast here one morning on the way to check out Prospect Park Zoo & were very pleased with the menu & prices being reasonable.  Great food, cool place, & southern hospitality.  Her Aunt & Uncle joined us & they loved the Stumptown coffee as well as the food.  I had the peanut butter & banana sandwich w/ cinammon & honey.  We shared the cheese grits & that was my favorite.  In addition, I assume this is one of the few places in that area you can get sweet tea also.  My girlfriend had the oatmeal & enjoyed it.  The owner is from Alabama & I heard him say they were going to have live music that night & if I wasn't going to Dr. John @ BAM then I would have come back there.  Avett Brothers were playing while we ate so I can only imagine he would have a good band to play that I would've enjoyed.  Hope to return sometime.",5.0
"Roots Cafe is a very warm and comfortable space.  Also, he decor is quirky and fun.  There is an old school black and white TV playing Planet of the Apes when I walked in.Great place to relax  and enjoy coffee and grab a snack.  Or meeting place for friends before heading out somewhere else.More importantly  the coffee is good better than most places around.The owner Jamey is extremely friendly and nice.

"I recently moved into the area, not knowing much about it. The first place I discovered was Roots Cafe. The place definitely makes the neighborhood! And like others, this is the first coffee shop I've come across in NYC or NJ that has that ""chill"" factor. The place is completely unpretentious, super comfy, and their menu has way more than you would expect for a coffee shop. And you never know what little surprise awaits you - perhaps some acoustic guitar in the middle of the afternoon, great art exhibit or just a really great cup of coffee. With respect to space, I haven't found it to be an issue. There are loads of seats, tables of 4's 2's and big comfy chairs, probably seats about 30 or so people at once. I went during what must've been the lunch rush, the place was pretty buzzing, and still found a few empty seats. People are friendly and I imagine, more than willing to share the tables - in fact there are some reserved specifically for sharing. You really can't ask for much more.
