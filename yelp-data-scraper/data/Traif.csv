"I read a handful of yelp reviews before calling in to make my reservation.  As you can imagine, I had high expectations. I will definitely by coming back.EnvironmentIntimate space with a outdoor/indoor dining area in the back. If you dine here in the evening, it will be lit up with candles so I think it will be a great for couples. I would advise to make reservations since it was pretty packed when I dined here on a Wednesday night.  FoodIf you like New American tapas, bacon, and you don't mind sharing food this is heaven.  My husband and I ordered 6 dishes and two cocktails.  I highly recommend the tuna tartare, dayboat scallops, burrata, and their pork chop.  NO MATTER HOW FULL YOU ARE, TRY THEIR BACON DONUTS THAT COMES WITH A SIDE OF COFFEE ICE CREAM FOR DESSERT!!!Most of their desserts are not too sweet so if you do not have a big sweet tooth, give this place a try.  *They have a $50 Chef's tasting menu if you are interested. It's 9 course meal and you get to choose two items off the menu. SERVICEOur waitress was great. Checked on us a few times to make sure we were ok and gave us great recommendations.",5.0
"Traif has always kind of sparked my interest, but I've never been fully invested in trying it because I hardly venture out to Brooklyn. My friend and I have been trying to change that by creating quota to go to Brooklyn at least once a month now that the weather is nicer. The restaurant itself can be hard to miss if you're not actively looking for it - it looks like your standard small place with closed doors to prevent heavy winds. We were looking for it and since we were across the street, we actually almost missed it. However, Traif is a lot bigger than what I expected - they even have outdoor seating! Hearing of the long waits, we arrived at 6:30 (they open at 6) and surprisingly the restaurant was pretty much empty. They even seated us outside on a table meant for 4. I highly recommend you ask to sit out here, especially for those nice summer nights. After receiving menus, our waitress immediately informed us that for 2 people, it's recommended to order 5-7 dishes (5-7 dishes for 2 people is an over exaggeration of the amount of food you need for 2. 4 is plenty). We took the recommendation into mind, but were only really interested in 4 things, so we went ordered the tuna tartar, the short rib sliders with sweet potato fries, the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs, the broccoli rabe with mushrooms and egg on truffle toast, and the bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. Ironically and unintentionally, that was the order of my favorite dishes. - The tuna tartar resembled poke with an abundant amount of spicy mayo combined with eel sauce, served on top of tempura eggplant. SO good that my friend and I shamelessly tried to wipe the plant clean of the eel and spicy mayo combo with our eggplant. The eggplant surprisingly was not greasy at all either. - The short rib sliders were so flavorful and juicy for its size that the juice dripped down both my friend and my face. The sweet potato fries were okay in my opinion, your standard sweet potato fries. However, they were a bit too salty. I liked the paprika dripping sauce though. - Meat so tender that it just falls off the bone. However, the ribs were grilled a bit too long that some of the ends were too charred and hard for my liking. The sauce was unique, where the strawberry really came through - kind of like strawberry jam, but it was too overpowering that you didn't taste the cinnamon at all. Generous portion of 4 large ribs. - Surprisingly, the broccoli rabe was served last. You would think it'd be the first dish out of the kitchen because vegetables don't take long to cook at all. It took so long that we actually thought they forgot we ordered it. When it finally arrived, it literally smelled and looked like heavy cheese, overwhelming you. For $15, you literally just get a plate of broccoli rabe with a slice of soggy bread (not the toast that was advertised), few pieces of mushroom, a fried egg, and a bed of parmesan cheese on top of the egg. It wasn't a bad dish, but it wasn't wow either, so I would skip this and order something else.  - We were already stuffed, but my friend said the bacon doughnuts was THE dish to get at Traif, so our second stomachs kicked it, overruling our minds. As we saw this dish bought out to the other tables, we were super excited as it looked heavenly. However, one bite in and we were so disappointed. The doughnuts were so dense and not light and airy. The bacon accompanying them were so overly fried that it was unenjoyable. I know, you're probably thinking how could bacon be bad? When it cuts the top of your mouth. The saving grace of this dish was the coffee ice cream - you can tell it was house made. Service overall was great. Our waters were never empty and the food came relatively quickly minus the broccoli rabe. It's not a fancy restaurant, but prior to your meal, they do bring you an amuse, which was pea soup the day we went. It was steaming hot, but really good - I would actually order a cup/bowl of it if it was on the menu. My friend thought the taste resembled the dry seasoning packet for the spicy packaged ramen. The only thing my friend and I didn't appreciate about the service was the semi dirty look and aggressiveness of our waiter when we only ordered 4 things opposed to her 5-7 recommendation. Good thing we didn't listen to her because we literally were so stuffed due to how heavy the food was - I definitely would just stick to ordering 2 dishes per person. Then after after we finished, she immediately just placed the dessert menu on our table without even asking if we wanted dessert. Her behavior reminded me of a commissioned sales person trying to meet her targets. Overall, we're glad we made the journey out to Brooklyn and makes us want to venture out there more. I just wish Traif wasn't so pricy!",4.0
"We were absolutely stuffed after 5 plates. But still managed to make some room for dessert. Had a reservation for 8pm and got seated right away in the back. Passed by their impressively super small kitchen on the way. The waitress recommended 5-7 plates for us. 7 would have been way too much for us. I think we would have been fine with 4 plus dessert.They brought out our plates in order of most to least delicious. 1. Pork belly - melt in your mouth goodness. so good. must order.2. Scallops on risotto - scallops on the salty side, but risotto was delish.3. Mussels - was supposed to be clams, but they ran out, so they took it off our bill. a pretty big bowl of mussels! pretty good, though nothing special. probably could have done without.4. Shrimp with salt and pepper in a sweet/spicy sauce - not a fan. tasted like a panda express dish. 5. Broccoli rabe - very weird dish. it was a bed of broccoli rabe and a piece of toast lying on it. layered with mushrooms, a fried egg, and cheese. really could have done without. 6. Bacon donuts - underwhelming. I liked the coffee ice cream it came with though. I enjoyed the place. The plates are kind of a hit or miss though.",4.0
"the Chef's tasting was amazing, I highly recommend it. For $50, you get 8-9 small dishes and 2 desserts. Yes, that is not a typo. TWO DESSERTS. All the dishes were artfully presented and had really fun, unique flavor pairings. Our 8 courses will likely be different than yours, but trust the chef, because everything was sophisticated and delicious. It included a great variety of seafood (shrimp, scallops) and other protein (beef sliders, lamb, ribs, duck).The first dessert was this amazing lemon cheesecake topped with a quenelle of angelic white fluff that was just divine to the very last morsel. Sometimes cheesecake is really fatty and begins to lose its magic as you continue to eat it, but hang on to your pants, because this one just keeps getting better and better. The ratio of cheesecake filling to crust is just complete mastery here at Traif. The second dessert was their famed warm bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. That texture contrast between the crunchy bacon and soft doughnut/ice cream as well as the warm/cold temperature contrast was done right. The ambiance is dark, the music is hip, the kitchen is open, and the mood is just right. I appreciated the waiters explaining all the ingredients in each dish that came out, even if it was hard to hear them.",4.0
"I sing the praises of this place to anyone who listens. The name alone is enough to earn a visit. The first time I came here I was a bit skeptical about doing the chef's choice. How do they know what I would actually want to eat? Well considering everything on the menu is actually amazing, they can't go wrong.Came in here the last time for a birthday dinner with my parents who had never been before. We did the chef's selection menu which consisted of about 10 dishes not including dessert (party of 3). My mother is more of a seafood person so our server told her to pick 2 seafood options and they would make sure they were a part of the selection ( she picked the scallops and the squid with bok choy which were delicious.) Personally, the soft shell crab and the gnocchi stole the show. The crab was fresh and cooked to a delicious crisp. As a huge fan of everything carbs it's no surprise I loved the gnocchi as well. Thanks to my mom having a cinnamon allergy, the bacon donuts were not included in the chef's selection so me and my dad got an order on top of everything. The restaurant didn't want mom to be left out so they brought her the key lime pie. All of this on top of the 2 dessert options included with the meal (which I believe means we tried every dessert on the menu that night and the bacon donuts were by far the best).Overall every visit here is a great experience. The service is great, the food is even better, and the food coma you fall into when you leave should make for an amazing night of sleep.",5.0
Would be 5 stars if they can go slightly easier on salt. The omakese meal was full of surprises. Thought some dishes were very unique.,4.0
What I had:Short rib sliders: add an extra slider for $5. pass. It was mediocre and I didn't care for this at all.Hoisin sauce wings: sweet and tangy. It was okay. I felt weird asking for hot sauce to eat my wings with.Foie gras over potatoes and a fried egg: it was.... Really rich. I've had foie gras served multiple times before but never fried. It was a little much for me.Bacon donuts: it was not fluffy and amazing but more dense and chewy (not in the good way)Service was great! Just wish the food was as great. Traif did not live up to my expectations.,2.0
"So, I know I'm probably gonna get a lot of crap for giving this place only 3-stars as it has over 1,500 glowing reviews, but it just didn't impress me to be honest.I've been to a number of awesome high end (Michelin Star) as well as low end (hole-in-the-wall) restaurants, so I think I know something good when I find it.  And I didn't find it in Traif, in my opinion.We chose the ""Adventurous"" Tasting Menu, which includes things like pork belly, foie gras, sweetbreads, etc, which was $50 per person for 11 courses, but, after including drinks, champagne, wine, tax, tip, the meal came out to $250.  Normally I don't factor cost into any of my reviews and don't mind paying up for a great meal, in fact, I paid $450 at Gramercy Tavern for a meal that I thought was worth every penny.  But I thought Traif was way too pricey for the quality of the meal, dishes, presentation and service.  The location was a little off the beaten path, even for Brooklyn, which is fine, and cool to be honest, and the actual ambiance of the restaurant is nice as well.  I liked that you could sit at the food bar and watch the chefs prepare your meal.  Dark lighting, cozy vibe, overall, really nice.The problem with Traif is with the:1.  Inconsistent Quality of the Dishes- some were great, some were ok, and some were downright terrible, with some having flavors/seasoning that was overbearing to the point where that's all you could taste (like using way too much goat cheese on our dish that was a beet-based dish, to the point we couldn't even taste the beets, all we could taste was the goat cheese).2. Timing of the Dishes- it seemed like we had only eaten half of our current dish, when they would bring out the next one.  So, then we would hurry to finish the dish, and start the next one, when they would do it again.  They did this for ALL 11 DISHES.  I asked them to slow down with them after the 3rd one, but they didn't listen and kept bringing them, haha.  I laugh now, but it was a BIG Disappointment as it was happening.3. Poor Service from the Waiter (not busboys though)- seemed like we always had to call him over or waive him over when we wanted more water, or when we wanted to order more wine, etc.  And then he almost seemed a little annoyed by it.  4. Poor Communication on the Dishes- the waiter or busboy would deliver the dish, but then he wouldn't explain what it is that we were eating.  The waiter even mistakenly called our lamb chop dish the ""duck breast"" dish, until I corrected him, cause obviously a lamb chop doesn't look like a duck breast, lol.List of Dishes:1. Taro Root Soup- pretty good actually2. Wild King Salmon Sashimi with Tangelo- was good, but the citrus was too overbearing3. Yellow Beets with Goat Cheese- way too much cheese and mint, couldn't taste the beets4. Berkshire Pork Belly with hearts of palm- one of the better dishes, but I've had better belly5. Seared Dayboat Scallops with risotto- probably the best dish of the bunch6. Whole Tiger Prawns- not sure what sauce they used on it, but it was terrible7. Lamb Chops with hummus and mint yogurt- was good, but not the best again8. Foie gras with sunny side egg- loved the foie, but the egg threw it all off, trying to hard9. Short rib slider with fries- tasted like a Sloppy Joe I used to get in middle school10. Green tea & chocolate pudding- green tea was too overbearing and strong11. Bacon donuts with coffee ice cream- probably the 3rd best dish, but got old after a whileLooking back, I sort of wished we had ordered dishes a la carte as some of the ones on the menu looked better than what we got from the Chef's Tasting.  So, if you come here, I'd recommend that.Overall though, I'd pass on this place if I were you, as there are MUCH Better options in Brooklyn than this place...St. Anselm being one of them and only a few blocks away...",3.0
"My friend and I definitely enjoyed our experience there! The food was inventive and delicious.We had :- Tuna tartare,  which was simple, tasty and perfectly spicy.- Roasted squash salad; it had some asian flavor. My friend LOVED it!- Cauliflower with cucumber and puffed riced was, to a veggie lover like me, sublime. My friend thought it was ok.- Melted cheese plate with chorizo; don't take that.. Boring. But the waiter kind of tell us before, so the mistake is on us.- Scallops with quinoa; we had mixed feelings about it.. It came with a sweet puree. We kind of liked it.. But kind of not at the same time.. We would have chosen something else! - The chocolate mousse dessert was one of the best I had. It came with a sorbet and it made the desert somewhat light and fresh.Go try it out! It's worth it :) The place is also super cute.",5.0
"We ended up here in an failed attempt to get into an oyster happy hour near by, and so glad to have found and checked out Traif with its awesome tasting menu!Casual with a nice vibe and crowd, fairly empty at 7pm but filled up quickly by 8pm.Here's a quick assessment of the pre-fixe we got:-Carrot soup (3.5, a bit salty)-salad with mustard greens and butternut squash (5, amazing, loved the dressing)-Tuna tartar on Japanese egg plant (4.5, flavor was very good, the scent of hot sauce mixed with tuna gave a smell that could be mistaken for sitting in the fridge too long, hence not a 5)-Scallops with quinoa (2.5, overly sweet without some refreshing tart/aromatic flavors)-Chicken liver with bacon and aged balsamic (5, classic Italian with a nice twist of crisp Rosemary)-Mussels with bacon fennel and crostini (3, bacon overpowered mussels)-Sweetbread with olives and capers (4, while I'm not a huge fan of sweetbread, this is some of the best I've had)-Salt and pepper shrimp with beets and snap peas (5, loved the mix of hot and cold in this dish)-Strawberry cinnamon baby back ribs (5, perfectly tender on the inside, and crisp on the outside, with a fantastic and unique bbq sauce)-Bbq short rib sliders with sweet potato fries and paprika aioli (5, amazing aioli sauce and sweet potato fries, I could eat this all day)-Foie gras bacon with a sunny egg (3.5, I love foie gras but this was a bit heavy and didn't stand out)Key lime pie with pineapples (3.5)The service was attentive, and the staff very efficient.For the price, this place is a fantastic value and while some dishes were just okay, overall I enjoyed the food quite a bit and look forward to coming back for a repeat of my favorite dishes here!Hungry Kat, approved.",4.0
"What can I say? Traif is to me what Heaven is to Catholics, the land of eternal happiness and enveloping warmth. All the dishes I tried were artfully prepared and like a blank canvas the plates were adorned with incredible artistic presentations of pork belly, braised pork, foie gras and other various ingredients with precision and thorough thoughtfulness. Seating quarters fill fast and service is quick. Sample the extensive wine list or throw back a bottle or two of artisanal beer. Come with an open mind, an empty stomach and an adventurous pallet.

"Traif definitely goes down as a 4.5+ star place in my book. It's been on my (and my girlfriend's) list of places to try since the dark ages, but the fact that it's in Brooklyn was a huge deterrent. I finally used this past Valentine's Day as an excuse to drive out there and knock this one off our bucket list. The price was superbly reasonable for a 9 course pre-fixe meal on the most superficial and overrated money-grabbing scheme/holiday of the year (don't tell her I said that).As other reviewers had mentioned, Traif was definitely not what I was expecting decor-wise. Had Yelp not existed (god forbid), I never would've looked twice at this restaurant if I was walking by. It's not your tablecloth + fancy schmancy napkins folded into roses + classical music in the background type of place. Traif feels and looks like your average bar, with basic wooden tables and chairs, loud music, and dim lighting. It does have a colorful mural on the ceiling to give it that Brooklyn/Queens/NYC feel though.What Traif lacks in terms of decor, it makes up for handsomely with their food. When I made the reservation, I was told it would be nine courses - eight savory and one dessert. They actually ended up serving us nine savory courses and two dessert. Anytime a restaurant gives more food than I'm expecting, my heart is won. AND the food was amazing. I won't go into detail but some highlights were the softshell crab, the sashimi over risotto, osso bucco, and the bacon donuts. We (okay, mostly me) pretty much licked every plate clean. The portions were perfect for her and I was satiated, though I probably could've eaten some Taco Bell or something.The service was mostly good but we had a long 30 minute break in between our 5th and 6th dishes where I think there was some confusion in the kitchen. The table next to us got their desserts and had to explain to the waiter that they hadn't received all their savory courses yet; another table by us received a second osso bucco and kindly sent it back (I would have eaten it without a second thought).Tldr; amazing food, fair prices, don't come expecting lavish decor and being treated like an Arabian prince(ss).",4.0
"Had the Valentine's Day tasting menu. One of the best meals me or my girlfriend has ever had. The type of meal that stays in your head long, long after the first bite. Highlights: butterfish sashimi with truffle/foie risotto, and of course, the bacon donuts (the perfect dessert, in my opinion).",5.0
"This 2 star review feels so out of place among the masses of glowing reviews, but I just didn't have the same experience. I came here for dinner with two friends and we all opted for the $50 per person, chef's tasting experience. We were given the option of either doing the ""Standard"" or ""Adventurous"" tasting, and we chose to try the latter. I wish our server had given us a better explanation of what each entailed, because now I wonder if I would have had a better experience with the normal fare. However, I didn't bother asking, so not his fault. The good:1. Portions: 11 courses for $50 is quite the steal - I don't think I have ever gotten so much food at this caliber of restaurant for this price. I was uncomfortably full by the end of the meal. The bad:1. The food was... not bad. But rather confusing and not very cohesive. It was overwhelmingly heavy (sliders, foie gras, short ribs, cheese...) and interspersed randomly with lighter fares (seafood). Some seemed higher end (foie gras with sunny side up egg) and others were disappointingly random (sliders with fries). I guess that for an establishment with such glowing reviews, I was expecting more thought to be put into the plates and that the ""adventurous"" menu would be, well, more adventurous! 2. Spacing of food: Sometimes we would get one plate and have to wait quite a bit for the next course. Other times, we would get 2-3 courses in the span of 10 minutes, which was overwhelming. Plates I enjoyed: - Atlantic Salmon with Seaweed Risotto: I usually am not a fan of salmon, but it was cooked very well, and I was impressed with the seaweed risotto - flavorful and rich but not overwhelmingly creamy. Plates I didn't enjoy: - Hampshire pork belly with celery root: I know pork belly is supposed to be fatty, but this was overly so - I've had pork belly served where the leaner meat:fat ratio was perfect, and this was overwhelmingly fat. The celery root slaw was bland and didn't do a good job counteracting the heaviness of the meat. - Sliders with sweet potato fries: What. I'm not sure how this is adventurous in any way, or what it's doing at a restaurant of this level. It tasted like elementary school dining hall food - not necessarily bad tasting, but sloppy and over-sauced. Other plates included: - burrata cheese with beets- scallops with lentils- chopped chicken liver (spread) with balsamic toast- ribs with strawberry and cinnamon- pasta with mushroom (cheesy)- foie gras with sunny side up egg and potato- buttermilk panna cotta with passion fruit- bacon donutsAgain, maybe had I not gone in with such high expectations, I would have had a better experience. I was expecting to be blown away by a restaurant with almost 1500 reviews and 4.5 stars (and in NYC too!), but it fell short. Maybe next time!",2.0
"2 and a half. Unfortunately very underwhelmed by this 4* place. We went for the tasting menu and were very dissapointed. Looking over the menu, I would recommend to just order a la carte, as in it appeared after reviewing the menu you don't gain  or save anything by letting them order. There were many things I feel I would have ordered that weren't sent.  We told the waitress we were adventurous but still they sent out pretty basic dishes.Everything was acceptable, but nothing was better than good in my opinion. The service was very nice and the drink list was good, but overall was not impressed with flavor. However, I was impressed by how they send so many dishes out in such a small open kitchen",3.0
"Excellent.Finally got to try Traif after months, nay, years of anticipation. We had planned on going to a show at Rough Trade later in the night, so I got an early reservation on Open Table, just a few days in advance. The place was about half empty at around 7pm on a Wednesday, which I was little surprised about, given the hype and popularity of the place. To be honest, the place is a little out of the way in a fairly empty side of S 4th Street, right by the Williamsburg Bridge entrance. Anyways, I liked the bar and the open kitchen setup, and the overall vibe was pretty dark intimate, what with the dim lighting, close quarters and all. The back area is enclosed in glass and lined with hanging Christmas lights, which provide for a pretty cool ambiance.After a bit of going over the menu, we ended up getting the chef's selection for 2 (around 8 plates and not one, but two desserts). At $50, not too shabby, given that each plate is around $13-20. They seem to have somewhat of a rotating menu, but with a few favorites that stay on the menu year-round. We started off with a couple cocktails: the Autumn Cabin, which was like an old-fashioned with five-spice, and the Rude Little Piggy, which was pretty smokey and sweet, with bacon-salted rim. What we received:- Sweet potato soup (kind of an amuse bouche)- Chopped chicken livers with balsamic bacon toast- Bigeye tuna tartare on tempura Japanese eggplant- Berkshire pork belly with Macintosh apple slaw and Concord grapes- Chicken wings glazed in hoisin, five-spice, chiles, Sriracha- Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs with pomegranate seeds- Mussels, kale, feta in spicy harissa broth- Sauteed sweetbreads, with mushrooms, Brussels sprouts- Seared scallops over braised lentils, butternut squash, and huckleberry gastrique- Short rib sliders with sweet potato fries- Panna cotta with strawberry- Bacon doughnuts with dulce de leche/coffee ice creamMy favorites were the ribs, sweetbreads, and tuna tartare. The ribs had an interesting flavor with the strawberry cinnamon, yet weren't incredibly sweet. The sweetbreads were legitimately incredible, and perfectly crisped. The tuna tartare had a great mix of textures with the crispy tempura and tender, rich raw tuna. To be fair, everything was pretty excellent, but these dishes truly stood out among the rest. Service was very attentive and obliged to just about every little request we had. Prices, as previously mentioned, are pretty standard, if not a little on the pricier side for BK. However, you can be assured that the quality of everything is top-notch. Even something as simple as the chicken wings were perfectly cooked, both crispy and juicy at the same time. It really speaks to the attention to detail and dedication to quality, which is accurately reflected in the overall Yelp rating. I'll certainly be back to try some of the other dishes on the menu the next time I make that trek to Williamsburg.",5.0
"Was here in Tuesday for bae's birthday. We had a 6pm reservation aka early bird special & we're probably the only ppl in the restaurant until at least 7pm. The place is casual but super trendy & when it gets packed it can be kinda loud, so we enjoyed our 1hr of private dining. They offer a tasting menu on weekdays which consists of 9 savory dishes & 2 sweet ones. It's $50/pp (totally reasonable) & recommended for 3+ but usually they're able to accommodate 2. So obviously that's what we did. Honestly everything we tried was unbelievable, (except the mussels) each dish had an interesting mix of flavors & textures which we loved. But here's a breakdown Food:-scallops with wheat barley: scallops were juicy & soft, not too fishy. Wheat barley was cooked well but I'm just not a fan of it in general-winter salad with persimmon: amazing, dressing was tangy, endive was bitter, cheesy with bacon & almond crunches & delicious persimmon -pork belly: topped with snow peas & artichoke hearts. I don't normally eat pork belly but bae made me try it and I must say it was good. Well marinated, soft, overall Delish-spicy tuna on tempura Japanese eggplant: I think this was my favorite dish. The tempura batter was light & airy, tuna was fresh with just enough spice -salt & pepper shrimp with pineapple & sweet potato: another amazing dish, shrimp were cooked to perfection & crispy. I loved the pineapple with it & sweet potatoes were yummy too-lamb chops with black hummus: AMAZING so perfectly cooked it was super soft almost melt in your mouth. They sprinkled some pomegranate seeds on too which was a nice touch. Black hummus was great & so were the two sauces accompanying the lamb (no idea what they were)-red pepper pasta: topped with an egg & lots of cheese. Pasta was well cooked, yummy flavors but I thought it was a little too liquidy of a sauce for my taste personally. The pasta looked like it was floating in a soup almost -mussels: I adore mussels & was so excited when these came out but they were just way too spicy. I like heat so I don't mind things on the spicier end but this was too much, especially for mussels. Probably the only dish I wouldn't order again-short rib sliders with sweet potato fries: the waitress said these sliders are the reason she works there & I can totally see why. The bun was sweet & soft. Short rib inside was so amazingly delicious. It melted in your mouth, was a bit sweet and just cooked to perfection. Fries were wonderfully crispy but I personally didn't love the smoked paprika aioli. -bacon donut: I think this is a signature here. It was good but not scream from the mountain tops good, I liked the key lime pie better. -key lime pie: amazing custard, tangy & sweet. Crumbling crust & home made whipped cream all topped with pineapple. All the flavors mixed together were wonderful. A must get in my opinion. Overall it was an obscene amount of food, especially for the price, but everything was so delicious we couldn't stop eating!!! Would def recommend this place for a midsized group, but no matter what you HAVE to get the tasting.",5.0
"This is a perfect date night spot. They dimmed the lights throughout the night which made it intimate and cozy. I came here on a Thursday night and it didn't get pack till 8ish. The interior is small and you might feel cramp with the table arrangement since the seating provide just enough space to slide in and out. Let's talk about the food. The pork belly was delicious. It melts in your mouth. It was fat and juicy. The grapefruit provided a refreshing taste. The strawberry ribs literally just come off the bone when you bite into it. It was sweet and juicy. The scallop which was one of my favorite was delicious. I couldn't get enough of it. It was crispy outside and juicy inside. The soft shell crab was crunchy outside and juicy inside. It didn't taste oily at all. The lamb was moist. It was crispy outside and when you cut into it, it got a nice pink tone. The clams was refreshing after eating all those meat! I had so much fun digging into the clams and the sausage that came with it was also good. It got a spicy kick. For dessert, we got the infamous bacon donut. I definitely enjoyed the thin crispy bacon on the donut. Hopefully I mentioned about all the food I had here. For the drinks, I got the rude little pig and the cola one as a dessert drink. The cola one was definitely refreshing after the huge meal I had. Overall, i had a nice time pigging out here.",5.0

The price was superbly reasonable for a 9 course pre-fixe meal on the most superficial and overrated money-grabbing scheme/holiday of the year (don't tell her I said that).As other reviewers had mentioned, Traif was definitely not what I was expecting decor-wise. Had Yelp not existed (god forbid), I never would've looked twice at this restaurant if I was walking by. It's not your tablecloth + fancy schmancy napkins folded into roses + classical music in the background type of place. Traif feels and looks like your average bar, with basic wooden tables and chairs, loud music, and dim lighting. It does have a colorful mural on the ceiling to give it that Brooklyn/Queens/NYC feel though.What Traif lacks in terms of decor, it makes up for handsomely with their food. When I made the reservation, I was told it would be nine courses - eight savory and one dessert. They actually ended up serving us nine savory courses and two dessert. Anytime a restaurant gives more food than I'm expecting, my heart is won. AND the food was amazing. I won't go into detail but some highlights were the softshell crab, the sashimi over risotto, osso bucco, and the bacon donuts. We (okay, mostly me) pretty much licked every plate clean. The portions were perfect for her and I was satiated, though I probably could've eaten some Taco Bell or something.The service was mostly good but we had a long 30 minute break in between our 5th and 6th dishes where I think there was some confusion in the kitchen. The table next to us got their desserts and had to explain to the waiter that they hadn't received all their savory courses yet; another table by us received a second osso bucco and kindly sent it back (I would have eaten it without a second thought).Tldr; amazing food, fair prices, don't come expecting lavish decor and being treated like an Arabian prince(ss).",4.0
"Had the Valentine's Day tasting menu. One of the best meals me or my girlfriend has ever had. The type of meal that stays in your head long, long after the first bite. Highlights: butterfish sashimi with truffle/foie risotto, and of course, the bacon donuts (the perfect dessert, in my opinion).",5.0
"This 2 star review feels so out of place among the masses of glowing reviews, but I just didn't have the same experience. I came here for dinner with two friends and we all opted for the $50 per person, chef's tasting experience. We were given the option of either doing the ""Standard"" or ""Adventurous"" tasting, and we chose to try the latter. I wish our server had given us a better explanation of what each entailed, because now I wonder if I would have had a better experience with the normal fare. However, I didn't bother asking, so not his fault. The good:1. Portions: 11 courses for $50 is quite the steal - I don't think I have ever gotten so much food at this caliber of restaurant for this price. I was uncomfortably full by the end of the meal. The bad:1. The food was... not bad. But rather confusing and not very cohesive. It was overwhelmingly heavy (sliders, foie gras, short ribs, cheese...) and interspersed randomly with lighter fares (seafood). Some seemed higher end (foie gras with sunny side up egg) and others were disappointingly random (sliders with fries). I guess that for an establishment with such glowing reviews, I was expecting more thought to be put into the plates and that the ""adventurous"" menu would be, well, more adventurous! 2. Spacing of food: Sometimes we would get one plate and have to wait quite a bit for the next course. Other times, we would get 2-3 courses in the span of 10 minutes, which was overwhelming. Plates I enjoyed: - Atlantic Salmon with Seaweed Risotto: I usually am not a fan of salmon, but it was cooked very well, and I was impressed with the seaweed risotto - flavorful and rich but not overwhelmingly creamy. Plates I didn't enjoy: - Hampshire pork belly with celery root: I know pork belly is supposed to be fatty, but this was overly so - I've had pork belly served where the leaner meat:fat ratio was perfect, and this was overwhelmingly fat. The celery root slaw was bland and didn't do a good job counteracting the heaviness of the meat. - Sliders with sweet potato fries: What. I'm not sure how this is adventurous in any way, or what it's doing at a restaurant of this level. It tasted like elementary school dining hall food - not necessarily bad tasting, but sloppy and over-sauced. Other plates included: - burrata cheese with beets- scallops with lentils- chopped chicken liver (spread) with balsamic toast- ribs with strawberry and cinnamon- pasta with mushroom (cheesy)- foie gras with sunny side up egg and potato- buttermilk panna cotta with passion fruit- bacon donutsAgain, maybe had I not gone in with such high expectations, I would have had a better experience. I was expecting to be blown away by a restaurant with almost 1500 reviews and 4.5 stars (and in NYC too!), but it fell short. Maybe next time!",2.0
"2 and a half. Unfortunately very underwhelmed by this 4* place. We went for the tasting menu and were very dissapointed. Looking over the menu, I would recommend to just order a la carte, as in it appeared after reviewing the menu you don't gain  or save anything by letting them order. There were many things I feel I would have ordered that weren't sent.  We told the waitress we were adventurous but still they sent out pretty basic dishes.Everything was acceptable, but nothing was better than good in my opinion. The service was very nice and the drink list was good, but overall was not impressed with flavor. However, I was impressed by how they send so many dishes out in such a small open kitchen",3.0
"Excellent.Finally got to try Traif after months, nay, years of anticipation. We had planned on going to a show at Rough Trade later in the night, so I got an early reservation on Open Table, just a few days in advance. The place was about half empty at around 7pm on a Wednesday, which I was little surprised about, given the hype and popularity of the place. To be honest, the place is a little out of the way in a fairly empty side of S 4th Street, right by the Williamsburg Bridge entrance. Anyways, I liked the bar and the open kitchen setup, and the overall vibe was pretty dark intimate, what with the dim lighting, close quarters and all. The back area is enclosed in glass and lined with hanging Christmas lights, which provide for a pretty cool ambiance.After a bit of going over the menu, we ended up getting the chef's selection for 2 (around 8 plates and not one, but two desserts). At $50, not too shabby, given that each plate is around $13-20. They seem to have somewhat of a rotating menu, but with a few favorites that stay on the menu year-round. We started off with a couple cocktails: the Autumn Cabin, which was like an old-fashioned with five-spice, and the Rude Little Piggy, which was pretty smokey and sweet, with bacon-salted rim. What we received:- Sweet potato soup (kind of an amuse bouche)- Chopped chicken livers with balsamic bacon toast- Bigeye tuna tartare on tempura Japanese eggplant- Berkshire pork belly with Macintosh apple slaw and Concord grapes- Chicken wings glazed in hoisin, five-spice, chiles, Sriracha- Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs with pomegranate seeds- Mussels, kale, feta in spicy harissa broth- Sauteed sweetbreads, with mushrooms, Brussels sprouts- Seared scallops over braised lentils, butternut squash, and huckleberry gastrique- Short rib sliders with sweet potato fries- Panna cotta with strawberry- Bacon doughnuts with dulce de leche/coffee ice creamMy favorites were the ribs, sweetbreads, and tuna tartare. The ribs had an interesting flavor with the strawberry cinnamon, yet weren't incredibly sweet. The sweetbreads were legitimately incredible, and perfectly crisped. The tuna tartare had a great mix of textures with the crispy tempura and tender, rich raw tuna. To be fair, everything was pretty excellent, but these dishes truly stood out among the rest. Service was very attentive and obliged to just about every little request we had. Prices, as previously mentioned, are pretty standard, if not a little on the pricier side for BK. However, you can be assured that the quality of everything is top-notch. Even something as simple as the chicken wings were perfectly cooked, both crispy and juicy at the same time. It really speaks to the attention to detail and dedication to quality, which is accurately reflected in the overall Yelp rating. I'll certainly be back to try some of the other dishes on the menu the next time I make that trek to Williamsburg.",5.0
"Was here in Tuesday for bae's birthday. We had a 6pm reservation aka early bird special & we're probably the only ppl in the restaurant until at least 7pm. The place is casual but super trendy & when it gets packed it can be kinda loud, so we enjoyed our 1hr of private dining. They offer a tasting menu on weekdays which consists of 9 savory dishes & 2 sweet ones. It's $50/pp (totally reasonable) & recommended for 3+ but usually they're able to accommodate 2. So obviously that's what we did. Honestly everything we tried was unbelievable, (except the mussels) each dish had an interesting mix of flavors & textures which we loved. But here's a breakdown Food:-scallops with wheat barley: scallops were juicy & soft, not too fishy. Wheat barley was cooked well but I'm just not a fan of it in general-winter salad with persimmon: amazing, dressing was tangy, endive was bitter, cheesy with bacon & almond crunches & delicious persimmon -pork belly: topped with snow peas & artichoke hearts. I don't normally eat pork belly but bae made me try it and I must say it was good. Well marinated, soft, overall Delish-spicy tuna on tempura Japanese eggplant: I think this was my favorite dish. The tempura batter was light & airy, tuna was fresh with just enough spice -salt & pepper shrimp with pineapple & sweet potato: another amazing dish, shrimp were cooked to perfection & crispy. I loved the pineapple with it & sweet potatoes were yummy too-lamb chops with black hummus: AMAZING so perfectly cooked it was super soft almost melt in your mouth. They sprinkled some pomegranate seeds on too which was a nice touch. Black hummus was great & so were the two sauces accompanying the lamb (no idea what they were)-red pepper pasta: topped with an egg & lots of cheese. Pasta was well cooked, yummy flavors but I thought it was a little too liquidy of a sauce for my taste personally. The pasta looked like it was floating in a soup almost -mussels: I adore mussels & was so excited when these came out but they were just way too spicy. I like heat so I don't mind things on the spicier end but this was too much, especially for mussels. Probably the only dish I wouldn't order again-short rib sliders with sweet potato fries: the waitress said these sliders are the reason she works there & I can totally see why. The bun was sweet & soft. Short rib inside was so amazingly delicious. It melted in your mouth, was a bit sweet and just cooked to perfection. Fries were wonderfully crispy but I personally didn't love the smoked paprika aioli. -bacon donut: I think this is a signature here. It was good but not scream from the mountain tops good, I liked the key lime pie better. -key lime pie: amazing custard, tangy & sweet. Crumbling crust & home made whipped cream all topped with pineapple. All the flavors mixed together were wonderful. A must get in my opinion. Overall it was an obscene amount of food, especially for the price, but everything was so delicious we couldn't stop eating!!! Would def recommend this place for a midsized group, but no matter what you HAVE to get the tasting.",5.0
"This is a perfect date night spot. They dimmed the lights throughout the night which made it intimate and cozy. I came here on a Thursday night and it didn't get pack till 8ish. The interior is small and you might feel cramp with the table arrangement since the seating provide just enough space to slide in and out. Let's talk about the food. The pork belly was delicious. It melts in your mouth. It was fat and juicy. The grapefruit provided a refreshing taste. The strawberry ribs literally just come off the bone when you bite into it. It was sweet and juicy. The scallop which was one of my favorite was delicious. I couldn't get enough of it. It was crispy outside and juicy inside. The soft shell crab was crunchy outside and juicy inside. It didn't taste oily at all. The lamb was moist. It was crispy outside and when you cut into it, it got a nice pink tone. The clams was refreshing after eating all those meat! I had so much fun digging into the clams and the sausage that came with it was also good. It got a spicy kick. For dessert, we got the infamous bacon donut. I definitely enjoyed the thin crispy bacon on the donut. Hopefully I mentioned about all the food I had here. For the drinks, I got the rude little pig and the cola one as a dessert drink. The cola one was definitely refreshing after the huge meal I had. Overall, i had a nice time pigging out here.",5.0

"Finally had a chance to try Traif!Walked in right on time for an 8pm res and told the host we were now 2, not 3. He gave me a look and said ""unfortunately that presents a problem because your table is for 3 and now we have to see what's available for 2"". I just looked back at him and he appeared to get the message. He surveyed the tables, came back, and the other host seated us. She made a point to say that our table was meant for 3 but they would give it to us with only 2. I didn't even respond. I mean seriously, I'm about to drop a ton of money on your overpriced food so you have a job, don't give me your 'tude the second I walk in the door. Am I right? Our waitress however was a breath of fresh air. She was kind and quirky and attentive. We ordered a few dishes: salmon with seafood risotto, short rib sliders, buffalo mozzarella, tuna tartare with eggplant tempura, and lamb ragu cavatelli. Highlights were the sliders, tuna and cavatelli. The salmon was a good portion but boring, and needed some lemon or some kind of sauce to add to it. The buffalo moz was oddly blended, it came with beets and strawberries but if you're taking that route it's worth it to add a drizzle of honey or something along those lines.I'm no chef, but the highly regarded Traif loses 2 very significant stars because of a crappy host staff and neither here nor there food. I would consider going back but Xixa down the street (sister restaurant) still holds my heart.",3.0

"Came here for dinner for two with VERY high expectations, noting the amount and quality of Yelp reviews for this restaurant.Traif being a small eats restaurant, we were overwhelmed with the sheer amount of choices we were given. I was interested in more than I think we could've handled, so I was curious about the tasting menu. Although kind enough to allow the two of us to order it (the menu says 3+ guests), the waiter offered absolutely no guidance on the tasting menu. He pretty much said, ""9-10 plates, you choose between signature and adventurous."" What did that even mean? Being a waitress myself, I'm pretty harsh, but I expect a waiter to be able to properly at least EXPLAIN a tasting menu. In the end, I'd suggest the tasting menu if more than 4 dishes catch your eye. You can specify 3 dishes that you'd like to try in the tasting menu and they'll work it out for you. The tasting menu also includes dessert! For $50 a person, and we left STUFFED (I couldn't eat the last two dishes), it was well worth it.FOOD:Butternut squash soup (amuse bouche) - Decent, interesting, but not mindblowing.Strawberry-cinnamon ribs - I thought the cinnamon was a great touch and the meat was tender. It's good but not amazing.Spicy bigeye tuna tartare, eggplant tempura - This was good as well, but very standard. I felt like I could get this at any generic Japanese restaurant. The tuna was fresh and had a good kick with the spice. Berkshire pork belly with apple slices - I actually really enjoyed this dish! I loved the apples with the pork belly. Roasted cauliflower - I liked this dish as well. I thought the curry was a bit much, but paired nicely with the blander rice and cauliflower of this dish.Salt and pepper shrimp - More like spicy mayo shrimp. This dish was good, but I don't feel like it was very inventive. Wheat cavatelli, smoked boar - The boar was tender and slow-cooked, but the noodles were bland.Buttermilk-fried quail - So disappointing. The quail was tender but the biscuits and gravy underneath were disgusting.Dayboat scallops - Scallops were cooked well, but I didn't care too much for the lentils underneath.Pulled pork sliders - So disappointing. Tasted more like sloppy joe's on potato buns. Definitely the worst dish of the night. I didn't even bother to finish my slider.Panna cotta - Meh. I could barely taste the passionfruit sauce. The panna cotta itself was average.Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream - AMAAAAZING. The doughnuts were nicely fried on the outside and fluffy on the inside and the bacon actually WORKED. The coffee ice cream is a good bittersweet complement. Highly recommend this dish.",3.0
All I can say is YUM!! I came with a group of four and we ordered a bunch of plates to share. We had like 80% of the menu and not a single thing went un-eaten.

Service was also great. I would totally recommend.,5.0
"Traif means ""non-Kosher"" in Yiddish.  Bet you didn't know that.  They certainly live by that mantra here, so if that's an issue for you, don't bother coming.  If you revel in the pleasures of the swine, among other culinary indiscretions, by all means get your ass to Traif ASAP!This place is incredible.  I was literally stunned at the level of sophistication of each dish, the flavor development, the playfulness and creativity of some of the combinations, and the overall dining experience.  Much to my pleasant surprise, the chef's tasting menu is available for parties of 2 during the week (on the weekends, it requires full participation of parties of 3 or more, oddly).  My friend and I selected that without hesitation and were assured that although we could provide direction on items we really wanted, they would take care of us and make sure we got the goods.  They delivered on that promise again and again.  I didn't take pictures nor did I keep good notes, but from memory, we had the following:- snap pea soup (amuse)- tuna tartare over eggplant tempura- burrata- chicken liver with toast points- pork belly- baby back ribs- pulled pork sliders- scallops- sweetbreads- foie gras- pasta dish with sausage- panna cotta with mixed berries- bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream- pineappleIt was a lot of courses, but the portions were modest.  Enough to give you a good taste of each dish, but not so big that the meal was overwhelming or excessively gluttonous.  There is a nicely curated cocktail list (get the tequila drink with a bacon rim!), approachable wine list and solid selection of beers.  In addition to the tasting menu, my buddy and I each had a cocktail and shared a bottle of wine.  All in, we got out for about $100 each.  Given the caliber of the food, the great level of service and the relaxed environs, it's the best 100 bucks I've spent in a long time.",5.0

The Service was really good as well.  Also really appreciated the gratuitous soup to start and the clementine to end the meal.  Will definitely return and do the chef's tasting menu!  The only negative thing I must point out is that the decor is meh.  I would have liked a nicer ambiance.  - 1 point.",4.0
"Traif, where have you been all my life? Oh, that's right, you've been in South Williamsburg, and I've just been too lazy to swing by. But after a few years, I finally did and it was one of the best meals I've ever had in Brooklyn - if not in NY.If you have the fortune of dining at Traif, DEFINITELY 100% do the chef's tasting menu. It's 10 shared plates followed 3 dessert courses, and very reasonably priced. Our (funny) waitress informed us that we could specify three plates that we absolutely needed, but also gave us a wink about how some things are standard and included in each. Below is the list of everything we got:0) Complimentary red pepper soup1) Dayboat scallops*2) Foie gras terrine*3) Tuna tartare over eggplant tempura*4) Strawberry cinnamon ribs**5) Sweetbreads**6) Chicken liver7) Pulled pork sliders with sweet potato fries8) Seared foie gras9) Prawns seared in foie gras10) Paccheri pasta with sausage sauce* Dishes that we specified wanting** Dishes that we wanted, but our waitress assured us would definitely be includedAnd for desserts:1) Buttermilk pannecotta2) Peanut butter brittle and dark chocolate fudge3) Bacon doughnutsOne of the benefits of doing the chef's tasting is that they will adjust the serving sizes so everyone can get a taste (which makes sense since the chef's tasting is all-or-nothing). I can't say enough about how amazing the food was. My favorite dishes were the scallops, the strawberry cinnamon ribs, sweetbreads, prawns, and the tuna tartare over eggplant tempura.At some point, another table broke out in birthday song, and my friends started jokingly singing the same to me (my birthday was a week beforehand). Our (funny) waitress asked if it was my birthday, and then brought out a single lit candle on a plate and started singing happy birthday to me before bringing out our three dessert plates. I sure felt like the belle of the ball.Oh, and I can't complete this review without speaking about the cocktails. They have a great selection, but the one you definitely have to try is the Rude Little Pig, which is a tequila cocktail with a bacon salted rim. That's right, bacon. This is the cocktail that you'll have to pass around to your friends because they'll all want to try it (so I hope you're fine with them licking your rim... hehe). But damn, was it good. I actually ended up ordering two of them.I could write an essay about how amazing everything is at Traif, but you'll just have to take my word for it. Make a reservation though, because it's one of the most in-demand restaurants in NY right now (and rightfully so!).",5.0
"Im shocked by all stellar reviews. While i will say that i had an enjoyable solid experience nothing blew me out of the water.  It's good people. ..just not THAT good.  Yes the scallops were so delicious and had that wonderful delicious brown sear. But they were a tad small for the price and honestly, ive had better... and the risotto they were served on were hard. Yes the strawberry ribs were yummy but they were not chunky- fall of the meat tender like how i expect bbq ribs should be.  The sliders were delicious as they should be but pretty standard and the broccoli rabe, toast with Asiago cheese  is not something i care to get again.  The foie gras again was great but nothing to gush over. The bacon donuts was one of my favorite parts of our meal but again the dough was a bit tough.I got the rude little pig to drink which i enjoyed very much and thought the bacon bits on the rim were a neat way to stand out but again, (i licked them off clean! )  it was great but no fireworks lit up my world.Would i go back?  Sure if someone else was really set on going.  But there are better places",4.0

Our (funny) waitress informed us that we could specify three plates that we absolutely needed, but also gave us a wink about how some things are standard and included in each. Below is the list of everything we got:0) Complimentary red pepper soup1) Dayboat scallops*2) Foie gras terrine*3) Tuna tartare over eggplant tempura*4) Strawberry cinnamon ribs**5) Sweetbreads**6) Chicken liver7) Pulled pork sliders with sweet potato fries8) Seared foie gras9) Prawns seared in foie gras10) Paccheri pasta with sausage sauce* Dishes that we specified wanting** Dishes that we wanted, but our waitress assured us would definitely be includedAnd for desserts:1) Buttermilk pannecotta2) Peanut butter brittle and dark chocolate fudge3) Bacon doughnutsOne of the benefits of doing the chef's tasting is that they will adjust the serving sizes so everyone can get a taste (which makes sense since the chef's tasting is all-or-nothing). I can't say enough about how amazing the food was. My favorite dishes were the scallops, the strawberry cinnamon ribs, sweetbreads, prawns, and the tuna tartare over eggplant tempura.At some point, another table broke out in birthday song, and my friends started jokingly singing the same to me (my birthday was a week beforehand). Our (funny) waitress asked if it was my birthday, and then brought out a single lit candle on a plate and started singing happy birthday to me before bringing out our three dessert plates. I sure felt like the belle of the ball.Oh, and I can't complete this review without speaking about the cocktails. They have a great selection, but the one you definitely have to try is the Rude Little Pig, which is a tequila cocktail with a bacon salted rim. That's right, bacon. This is the cocktail that you'll have to pass around to your friends because they'll all want to try it (so I hope you're fine with them licking your rim... hehe). But damn, was it good. I actually ended up ordering two of them.I could write an essay about how amazing everything is at Traif, but you'll just have to take my word for it. Make a reservation though, because it's one of the most in-demand restaurants in NY right now (and rightfully so!).",5.0
"Im shocked by all stellar reviews. While i will say that i had an enjoyable solid experience nothing blew me out of the water.  It's good people. ..just not THAT good.  Yes the scallops were so delicious and had that wonderful delicious brown sear. But they were a tad small for the price and honestly, ive had better... and the risotto they were served on were hard. Yes the strawberry ribs were yummy but they were not chunky- fall of the meat tender like how i expect bbq ribs should be.  The sliders were delicious as they should be but pretty standard and the broccoli rabe, toast with Asiago cheese  is not something i care to get again.  The foie gras again was great but nothing to gush over. The bacon donuts was one of my favorite parts of our meal but again the dough was a bit tough.I got the rude little pig to drink which i enjoyed very much and thought the bacon bits on the rim were a neat way to stand out but again, (i licked them off clean! )  it was great but no fireworks lit up my world.Would i go back?  Sure if someone else was really set on going.  But there are better places",4.0
My daughter took me to Traif for a birthday dinner.  It was absolutely delicious!  I enjoyed the chef choices very much. Small plates but lots of food.  Just enough to keep you excited for the next selection.  The service was great and I highly recommend anyone going to this restaurant.  It was a wonderful way to kick of my birthday weekend!  Thanks to the Chef and staff for a memorable evening.,4.0
"Come with a party of 3 or more people who are not picky eaters, and get the $50 pp Chef Selection - it's an amazing deal - I couldn't keep track of the # of dishes that came out, but I'm pretty sure it was at least eight dishes. Highlights were:- strawberry-glazed ribs that were flavored with pomegranate seeds- sweetbreads (I usually don't like these but at Traif, they were crisped perfectly and very tasty)- spicy bigeye tuna tartar on eggplant tempura- seared foie gras with yukon potatoes- warm donuts sprinkled with bacon bitsA well-rounded menu for a great price. The area in the back is quite nice; it has a greenhouse like quality to it.",4.0
"I've been wanting to try Traif for the longest time! I've been to the sister restaurant couple doors down and I really enjoyed it so I decided to come here with couple friends last Saturday night. It's a small restaurant with an open kitchen - typical brooklyn feel. It's cozy, dark and cute! We ordered the chef's tasting menu which consisted of 2 apps, 8-9 dishes and 2 desserts! My oh myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy the food was EGGGGGCEEELLEEEENNTTT!!! I can't remember the name of all the dishes but my favorite was definitely the foie gras. It was JUICY. It was SOFT. It was ORGASMICCCC!!! The beef sliders were on CRACK too!! It was a little disappointing that this dish came out last, because I was TOO full by this point. Phenomenal food and service. Highly recommend!",4.0
"Top five restaurant experience I've had in Brooklyn and one of my recommendations for food lovers who eat everything.  Don't ask me why it took me almost five years to finish this review but I guess, moving out of NY and living in LA made me think about this restaurant (and miss it!) after hearing other people talked about it.  I've only dined here twice but each time left fulfilled and happy.  If you can eat anything and don't have any food allergies, I recommend getting the Chef's tasting menu. Granted the price may have increased since I went so come here to treat yourself to a top notch gastronomical tapas experience with better prices than the city.  Once you decide to stick with the tasting, you can either pick and choose or leave the selection up to the Chef for more of a culinary adventure.  We had to do the former since one of my friends had shell-fish allergies so unless you're a vegetarian, there should be no problem with the selection. But seriously, if you aren't going to eat any pork, then don't bother getting the Chef's tasting.  There's something for everyone when it comes to drinks including great non-alcoholic beverages.  I enjoyed the cocktails and wine each time.",5.0
"You'll never think a top notch restaurant like this one could be hidden between bridges and metro trains in a dark street approaching south Williamsburg.My girlfriend recommended Traif like 3 years ago in it was in my to-do list since then. We finally came here and definitely with a special occasion in mind: Valentines Day, although we didn't come on the 14th (very clever move).The ambience is nice. I was expecting a little bit more class inside like the music for example that was very loud and kind of not adequate for the place. Also, the dining furniture, silverware and napkins didn't seem to match the classy and sophisticated menu they have. I know is a stupid detail to address but it got my attention.Anyway, talking about food the menu is pretty big for a place that serves tapas-like dishes. Everything is pretty well thought and the plates are very creative. The waiter recommended 5 to 7 plates for both of us but we went with 4 so we could order more if we still be hungry. I'm glad of the decision because it was plenty of food. Both of us were full and satisfied and we order all we wanted to have.The dining experience started with a complementary red pepper soup that was delicious. You would definitely not expect that flavor from a soup. Then we order all the tapas that come in the order the chef thinks is best served. We got the tuna tartare on top of a fried eggplant with a delicious spicy sauce. It was followed by the cavatelli, a beet and wholw wheat pasta which was very surprising in a good way. Then the star of the night: the short rib sliders! Wow! What a flavor. Instant mouth watering effect. The meat is just perfection between two moist buns and a manchego cheese that adds the right touch to the slider. They come with Provençal sweet potato fries which I loved! Because it reminded me of the fries I used to eat in Argentina. And to finish it up, an aioli that is to die for. To finalize the savory round we had the baby back ribs that everyone in the restaurant was ordering and indeed they were amazing. I really like the contemporary approach of the strawberry-cinnamon glaze. Two thumbs up!Lastly, the dessert, it wasn't that tempting on the menu but when we got it we couldn't stop eating it. A chocolate budino with green tea cream, jasmine caramel and banana ice cream. At the beginning we asked the server what happened to the ice cream because it was supposed to be banana ice cream and we got an orange scoop which I didn't like at all. First because I don't like orange ice cream and second because nobody told us beforehand and took the liberty to put another ice cream in the plate. What I really like and this is something I've been looking for in any restaurant here in the states is a service and responsibility that speaks highly of the whole dining experience: the pursuit of the customer's satisfaction. When we addressed the issue and talked to the waiter he offered another dessert to replace the one we got and even just bring something on the house. Since we were already full we didn't want to keep eating. When the check came, they took out the dessert. That's a serious service! Always looking for the clientele's comfort and happiness.Traif is a delightful experience, romantic and joyful for your palate. Surprisingly it isn't as expensive as I thought specially if you eat slowly and enjoying the moment instead of eating with your eyes. Start with a couple of plates and then add more if you are still hungry and reserve some space for the amazing budino!",5.0

"Traif was featuring a Valentine's Day menu for $65 per person, so me and my boyfriend made a reservation for 6pm on that Saturday. The restaurant had a ""Chef's Selection"" seven course sharing style menu (six savory dishes plus dessert) of their classic and specialty dishes.  The dishes we were able to sample included1. Red Pepper & Vidalia Onion Soup2. Beets, Pomegranate, Strawberry, mozzarella salad3. Roasted Pork belly with bacon, palm, snow peas and Artichoke4. Scallop Risotto with asparagus 5. Spicy Tuna Tartare6. Oysters Gratinee with mushrooms and sunchoke on a baguette7. Duck Confit on creamy polenta 8. Ricotta with peanut sauce for dessert. All the dishes were unique and innovative - well prepared with fresh ingredients and creatively put together. It was great to sample a variety of dishes and different combinations we normally wouldn't have at a typical restaurant. However, all their meals are small plates, so portions were small - about 1-2 bites per person per dish. We didn't think the Valentine's Day menu was as great of a value, as their normal tasting menu has 9 courses with two desserts at only $45 each.The restaurant is fairly noisy and with tables too close together, but me and my boyfriend enjoyed our evening that we barely noticed. It was still a wonderful experience dining at Traif and would recommend it if you're looking for a good date night spot!",4.0
"My parents treated me, some neighbors, and a bunch of my friends to dinner here for my 21st birthday back in November. It was one of those memorable meals. As we were a large group, we had the tasting menu and they made separate courses of equal deliciousness for my friend who's a pescatarian. A bit of a wait for our table in the beginning (even with our reservation) but understandable given the small size yet large popularity of the place. Service was excellent, wine & spirits poured continuously, savory morsels came & went, and everyone left thoroughly satisfied. The specifics of the dishes elude me as is the case when I'm enjoying my meal/company... but I do recall a sweetbread course toward the end that I convinced my friends to eat. Even the picky ones enjoyed it without question because their trust had been procured by the chef(s) over the duration of the meal. All -or at least most- of Traif's standout dishes were served and one of the desert courses was the infamous foie gras donuts... which were much more subtle than I had expected and enjoyed by all. Traif met and exceeded all of our expectations (which were high)... receiving positive reviews from my one neighbor who is a food critic... and left all with fond memories. Priceless.Believe the hype. Yes, even in Williamsburg.",5.0

"I feel compelled to write a review about this place after dining last night because it was such a delightful and yummy experience. We had never been before and we're celebrating a birthday. Even though we were a party of two, we couldn't help but order a bunch. The cocktails were pretty good, my boyfriend loved the rude little pig. We ordered the short rib sliders, burrata with bacon marmalade, short rib sliders, soft shell crab, day boat scallops, gnocchi, tuna tartare, muenster cheese and chorizo crostini, the baby back ribs and lastly the bacon donuts. I cannot stress how outrageous all of the dishes were! We normally are weary of tapas because often you get a small but pricy portion and the bill can quickly add up, especially if you're starving. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were generous and considerate lol meaning an even number of items on the plate and easy to split. We were having a hard time picking favorites but the tuna tartare and soft shell crab were out of this world. I also cannot rave enough about the service, our waitress was awesome. She gave great recommendations and the food was paced perfect. She surprised us with the bacon donuts insisting we couldn't leave without them and I'm so glad she did! Will definitely come back soon :)",5.0
"The best restaurant I have eaten at in such a long time. The menu is tapas style however they're pretty large portions. I came with a friend for dinner time as soon as it opened so there was no wait but as time passes it gets really full. Ordered 6 plates to share: the BBQ sider, pork belly, liver, soft shell crab, and duck (can't remember the other one) but I enjoyed EVERY dish and we were BEYOND stuffed. Also got the bacon dessert. The price is a bit expensive but for the amount of variety and taste of each dish, it's worth every penny and when you split the whole thing with friends it's even better so you can try as many dishes as possible from the menu. The other yelpers have said it, there's just such a depth to the taste of each dish here and you honestly won't be disappointed. I Highly highly recommend Traif. Also parking isn't too bad in that area of Williamsburg. Found 2 spots right across the street at around 7pm.",5.0

"Traif was featuring a Valentine's Day menu for $65 per person, so me and my boyfriend made a reservation for 6pm on that Saturday. The restaurant had a ""Chef's Selection"" seven course sharing style menu (six savory dishes plus dessert) of their classic and specialty dishes.  The dishes we were able to sample included1. Red Pepper & Vidalia Onion Soup2. Beets, Pomegranate, Strawberry, mozzarella salad3. Roasted Pork belly with bacon, palm, snow peas and Artichoke4. Scallop Risotto with asparagus 5. Spicy Tuna Tartare6. Oysters Gratinee with mushrooms and sunchoke on a baguette7. Duck Confit on creamy polenta 8. Ricotta with peanut sauce for dessert. All the dishes were unique and innovative - well prepared with fresh ingredients and creatively put together. It was great to sample a variety of dishes and different combinations we normally wouldn't have at a typical restaurant. However, all their meals are small plates, so portions were small - about 1-2 bites per person per dish. We didn't think the Valentine's Day menu was as great of a value, as their normal tasting menu has 9 courses with two desserts at only $45 each.The restaurant is fairly noisy and with tables too close together, but me and my boyfriend enjoyed our evening that we barely noticed. It was still a wonderful experience dining at Traif and would recommend it if you're looking for a good date night spot!",4.0
"My parents treated me, some neighbors, and a bunch of my friends to dinner here for my 21st birthday back in November. It was one of those memorable meals. As we were a large group, we had the tasting menu and they made separate courses of equal deliciousness for my friend who's a pescatarian. A bit of a wait for our table in the beginning (even with our reservation) but understandable given the small size yet large popularity of the place. Service was excellent, wine & spirits poured continuously, savory morsels came & went, and everyone left thoroughly satisfied. The specifics of the dishes elude me as is the case when I'm enjoying my meal/company... but I do recall a sweetbread course toward the end that I convinced my friends to eat. Even the picky ones enjoyed it without question because their trust had been procured by the chef(s) over the duration of the meal. All -or at least most- of Traif's standout dishes were served and one of the desert courses was the infamous foie gras donuts... which were much more subtle than I had expected and enjoyed by all. Traif met and exceeded all of our expectations (which were high)... receiving positive reviews from my one neighbor who is a food critic... and left all with fond memories. Priceless.Believe the hype. Yes, even in Williamsburg.",5.0
Absolutely delicious. Been here a few times and every time each item we have ordered off the menu was exceptionally tasty. Will update this review next time I go back with some more specifics on the dishes.,5.0
"I feel compelled to write a review about this place after dining last night because it was such a delightful and yummy experience. We had never been before and we're celebrating a birthday. Even though we were a party of two, we couldn't help but order a bunch. The cocktails were pretty good, my boyfriend loved the rude little pig. We ordered the short rib sliders, burrata with bacon marmalade, short rib sliders, soft shell crab, day boat scallops, gnocchi, tuna tartare, muenster cheese and chorizo crostini, the baby back ribs and lastly the bacon donuts. I cannot stress how outrageous all of the dishes were! We normally are weary of tapas because often you get a small but pricy portion and the bill can quickly add up, especially if you're starving. The prices were very reasonable and the portions were generous and considerate lol meaning an even number of items on the plate and easy to split. We were having a hard time picking favorites but the tuna tartare and soft shell crab were out of this world. I also cannot rave enough about the service, our waitress was awesome. She gave great recommendations and the food was paced perfect. She surprised us with the bacon donuts insisting we couldn't leave without them and I'm so glad she did! Will definitely come back soon :)",5.0
"The best restaurant I have eaten at in such a long time. The menu is tapas style however they're pretty large portions. I came with a friend for dinner time as soon as it opened so there was no wait but as time passes it gets really full. Ordered 6 plates to share: the BBQ sider, pork belly, liver, soft shell crab, and duck (can't remember the other one) but I enjoyed EVERY dish and we were BEYOND stuffed. Also got the bacon dessert. The price is a bit expensive but for the amount of variety and taste of each dish, it's worth every penny and when you split the whole thing with friends it's even better so you can try as many dishes as possible from the menu. The other yelpers have said it, there's just such a depth to the taste of each dish here and you honestly won't be disappointed. I Highly highly recommend Traif. Also parking isn't too bad in that area of Williamsburg. Found 2 spots right across the street at around 7pm.",5.0
"One of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. If you're in the area, you definitely have to give it a try.We've always come in starving so we opt for the tasting menu. You can request certain dishes to be included, and what kind of foods to avoid. Here is a brief rundown of what we got: (please note that the menu is always changing)1) Amuse-bouche: chilled mint and pea soup - very refreshing2) Braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli - the sliders are pretty tasty, but weren't anything unique. The fries with the aioli were addicting. 3) Pork belly - I have a slightly unhealthy obsession with pork belly. But their version blew my mind. It's so greasy, fatty and heavenly.4) Corn risotto with scallops - Delicious, fantastic dish. Scallops seared to perfection. 5) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs - Very tender, the meat slides right off. The strawberries make it a cute dish.6) Spicy bigeye tuna tartare on eggplant tempura - Amazing. I just can't.7) Miso-glazed hamachi collar - this is the juiciest hamachi I've ever had.  8) Soft shell crab with avocado, pineapple, papaya - Hot, crispy, and delicious. Lastly, the bacon glazed donuts with cappuccino ice cream. I'm a big fan of salty+sweet combination, so this dessert hits the spot. Definitely will be back!",5.0
They have my favorite meal here. Trust me order the foi gras. Dessert is awesome too. Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. Salty sweet and delicious ughhh. This is date night go to kind of place,5.0
"Traif is amazing! We went here for my birthday dinner last Sunday night, and it was so good that I have found myself thinking about the dishes a week or so later. If time allows, I would really love to enjoy another meal at Traif because it was that good. We had eight o'clock reservations, which they called the day before to confirm. The place is pretty tiny, so the hostesses greeted us outside, immediately upon entering the restaurant, I was surprised by how loud it was. That being said, it may not be the best place to dine with older folks. We're young, so we didn't mind the noise.We each started off with a cocktail--the rhubarb spritz for me and the Violet Beauregard for him. Both cocktails were expertly crafted and very tasty. The server was super nice and helpful. She recommended that for two, we order five to seven small plates to share. We narrowed it down, and she was able to help us make some final decisions. The menu changes fairly frequently, but it seems like some dishes remain as constants, so hopefully, you are able to try some of the plates we tried.Our meal started out with tiny cups of chilled pea soup that was on the house. It was creamy and delicious. The corn salad was the first dish that we ordered that came out. I can take or leave corn, so I wasn't expecting much from this salad, but I was blown away. It had great variety in texture between the corn, other vegetables, and duck cracklings. This is one of the dishes that I surprisingly keep thinking about long after the meal was over. Up next was the spicy pork belly---melt in your mouth amazing texture with a nice balance of spicy. We then had the mussels, which are always a favorite of mine. The mussels were delicious as well, and we both really loved the broth. The spicy bigeye tuna tartare seems to be something that is always offered on the menu, and it is not to be missed! The tuna itself was paired so nicely with the thinly friend eggplant that it was on top of.  The broccoli rabe was so, so, so amazing. I don't remember what was in it, but it too was one of my favorite dishes of the meal. We ordered the dates instead of a cheese at the suggestions of our server, and it was the only dish that left us disappointed. For two reasons, they came served with a tabbouleh like side, and we can make stuffed dates at home. It is really hard for me to pick just one dish as my favorite because they were all so amazing. We also enjoyed another round of cocktails, and I really loved the Red Pearl!The service was also incredible throughout our entire meal. At one point, I noticed something was in my drink, and I was investigating to see what it was. The food runner came over and asked me if something was wrong, and I said I wasn't sure yet. He whisked my drink away and brought out a fresh one. Each time we were finished with a dish, they came over to clear the plate. The timing of the service was also great--we were able to enjoy our dish without feeling rushed onto the next one or feeling like there was a ton of lag time in between each plate being served.We opted to skip dessert because we were so full, and they brought out watermelon with rhubarb syrup on the house to end our meal with a sweet note. If I could give Traif more than five starts I could. The food and service were both outstanding, and we thoroughly enjoy our visit.",5.0
"Amazing food and service!!  I have no clue what fellow reviewers were talking about when they said the plates are tiny because they give AMPLE portions!!  We started off with our drinks which were so spicy I didn't really like mine but oh well I should have expected that since it said chili infused.  Complimentary butternut squash soup were given to us in cute tiny bowls.We ordered the kale salad which was very good and fresh who knew kale tasted so good?  We then moved onto the Berkshire pork bellyTopped with radish which was also very good and tasty and once again not a small portion!  The best dish of the night was the seared foie gras, it just melted right in your mouth and Only my 2nd time trying. Oh so delicious.  Then the Mahi Mahi came out and whoa!  This looked more like an entree than anything lol.  The sauce was to die for and very tangy.  By this point we were so full and tried to cancel the mushroom dish we got but it was too late.  It was very good but I was so stuffed I could barely eat any.  At the end we were given complimentary pineapple with pomegranate sauce and ordered one more drink to hit the road with.  solid spot:) I'm satisfied",4.0
"The food is of very good quality don't get me wrong everything is made in a small little kitchen that you can see...along with waiters giving new plates and utensils with every new dish you order.  I would go back for the desert(IT WAS GREAT) and sliders(great but too small) but there was some obvious big problems. Problem 1: The menu is really long and they suggest that you order at least 6 things since portions are small and trust me there not cheap. Your looking at an easy over 80  for two people if your trying to fill up.Problem two: I like to relax and think about things before I order I'm usually extremely undecided and I think its okay I mean your paying them money. When I didn't know what I wasted after the waitress came back twice she said that this table is reserved for someone that they reserve time blocks kind of rushing me, well not kind of. How rude?Problem 3: Portions are small if you have money to spend go on an empty stomach and spend! If you don't want to spend a lot of money on food that's not really going to fill you up maybe pre-eat then go!Might go back for desert and sliders as a snack just portions are way to small. The seal of the deal was at the end they offered us complimentary pineapple they literally brought us a pineapple chunk like one chunk each, yes the chunk from canned pineapple.",2.0
"I've been here twice which shows how much I love this place! Our first dish was baked Muenster cheese with smoked chorizo and green apple, as well as crostini to dip. The cheese was warm and extremely delicious, along with the chorizo at the bottom. It paired perfectly with the apple and bread. We were even given more bread to finish the rest of the cheese.Next came the strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs, which were as delicious as it sounds. The ribs were coated with just the right amount of seasoning and sauce, and we could really taste the cinnamon spice. The meat came off the bone easily and tasted tender, hearty and a mix of savory and sweet.After that was the BBQ braised short rib sliders with smoked paprika aioli and sweet potato fries. The short rib was incredibly juicy and had a burst of mouthwatering BBQ flavor. And the sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy, crunchy, and delightful. Some of the best I've tasted!Last was the broccoli rabe, which we thought would be a good, healthy choice but it came smothered in aged asiago, portobello truffle toast and fried egg. Each component tasted great on its own but combining the strong flavors of sauteed broccoli rabe, mushroom, cheese and egg is what made it a wonderful masterpiece.The dessert was maple bacon mini donuts with coffee ice cream and this was amazing! Warm doughy, sweet, chewy donuts, glazed with caramel and sprinkled with bacon bits- What could be better? And the ice cream was very yummy, with authentic flavor of milky coffee.",5.0
"What good Jew wouldn't be lured to a place called Traif?  For those of you not in the know, ""traif"" in Yiddish means foods that aren't Kosher.  So, you say to yourself, then why would an observant Jew come to this place?  Well, an observant Jew most likely wouldn't, but while Jewish, I'm not that observant, and I happen to be lured here by the many, many outstanding reviews for this place....... and being a foodie that resides in Los Angeles, well, I just had to give this place a try when visiting NYC.  I've had my eye on this place for at least a couple of years.Well, now having dined here, it reminded me of that scene in the movie, Chocolat, where Vianne had prepared this amazing birthday dinner feast.  I remember watching her guests as their eyes continuously rolled to the backs of their heads in utter gastronomic bliss.  That's how I felt here.  Every dish was sublime, such unique and wonderful flavors dancing on my tongue, and yes, my eyes would roll to the back of my head with each taste I took.  It was amazing, and I didn't want it to end.What was interesting to me was that I don't normally eat some of the foods that I ate.... like pork belly.  (Did you just gasp?)  No, not because I'm Jewish, but more because I don't like it.  (Okay, I heard you gasp that time.)  But I tried it because if ever I'm going to like it, it'd be here.  While I can safely say it wasn't my favorite dish, I'm still glad I tried it.  As for the list of dishes we dined on, I'll be happy to tell you what we ate, but then, the menu WHEN you decide to go will most likely be different.  It changes frequently, and quite honestly, that's a very cool thing.  To me, it speaks to the chefs' creativity and versatility.  I'm still blown away by the unique combinations of ingredients, herbs, spices, everything.The dishes are on a par with ""small plates,"" but because of the richness of each dish, you will only want small portions, and yet, you will still get full.  Three of us devoured 9 very unique dishes.  They are, in no particular order......1.  spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis2.  baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini3.  bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli4.  sauteed broccoli rabe, portabello mushrooms, truffle toast, fried egg, aged asiago5.  seared dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, caper-tomato-lemon brown butter6.  buffalo milk burrata cheese, piquillo pepper romescu sauce, black olive caramel, baguette7.  Hampshire pork belly, Tippy's black lentils, brown butter apple sauce8.  icy blue mussels, meyer lemon, sherry, cream, parsley, garlic aioli9.  parmesan spaetzle, sherried black trumpet mushroom, artichoke alfredoEven just reading that sounds amaaaaazing.  Let me tell you, tasting it is even more so. Unfortunately, we chose to get dessert elsewhere, which, in retrospect, was a big mistake, given how wonderful the food is here.  Hindsight is amazingly always 20/20.  I knew enough to take a picture of the dessert menu because it looked great, and I wanted a photo to remind me of what we had the chance to eat...... but didn't.  Guess what..... I won't make that mistake again..... but the menu will be different by the time I return.  The good news is, though, I WILL return !!  This was one of my favorite meals EVER.  Gastronomic geniuses at work RIGHT HERE.By the way, the only way to get reservations is either by telephone or email.  They do not take online reservations, such as through Open Table.",5.0
"From the reviews, I was expecting amazing food. We got the chef's selection, but we all found the food to be just ok. Nothing was bad... it just wasn't anything I would want to eat again. The crab was not at all crispy, and covered in a strong mayonnaise sauce that overpowered the dish, the pork belly was all fat, and the list goes on. Maybe it was an off night, but we've had amazing food for that price at other restaurants, so it seems silly to spend so much on an ok meal. The dishes we thought were ok were the Cauliflower with cucumber, and the gnocchi, and the duck, out of the 11 or so we tried. The desert was mediocre. But the ambiance and service was great!",3.0
"Traif, is by far, one of the best Tapas restaurant in New York. As a consumer, do not expect the dishes to be big, each dish is portioned in small amounts (Hence, Tapas-Small Dishes). Aside from the portioning of their dishes, this place gets filled rather quickly. Make sure that you make reservations a few days prior if you want to ensure a seat without waiting for long. Traif opens their doors at 6pm, and even with reservations at 10:30 pm, my friends and I still had to wait for 15 minutes. The ambiance of the place is small, and dark, lit by candles on each table (perfect place for a date night!). Our server was amazing, and friendly. She gave us two complimentary desserts (Key Lime Pie, & Bacon Doughnuts), and soup before our dishes came. Moving on to food, the dishes were amazing! The dishes were portioned perfectly. Prior to coming to Traif, I had already downed chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and fries a few hours before, so I was already NOT in the mood to eat anything else. To my amazement, the food was so amazing that I didn't care how full I was. I ate as much as I could, and I never felt sickened by the fact that I was eating on a full stomache. The food was just that phenomenal! I seriously, have not stopped thinking about how amazing the food was, and cannot wait to go back.Seated right by the kitchen area, I watched with amazement as the chefs prepared our foods. The chefs put so much care into cooking & displaying the food. Each dish takes awhile to arrive, but I believe it is so worth it. The chefs want to ensure that each dish is absolutely close to perfection before being served, and the wait is definitely worth it. Food Recommendations:  * Strawberry-Cinnamon Glazed Baby Back Ribs* ""The Baller"" (Served once a week to one customer only)* Pork Belly (AMAZING!) * Duck (Can't remember the full name, but I provided pictures) * The potato slices served with buffalo milk (AMAZING!) * Scallops (Boyfriend & Friends Favorite - Since I do not eat seafood)* Cheeseburger Sliders w/ Sweet Potato Fries (They were good, but not amazing) The food here can get real expensive (Our bill was a few hundred dollars - including ""the Baller"" steak priced at $100). If you are planning to eat here, please have your wallet ready. Since the portions are small, you will most likely order many dishes. Each dish are priced at 6-15$, which is not cheap for super small portions. Overall, I had a good experience. Every minute of waiting and travelling to get here, is completely worth it. For anyone, who has never tried Traif, you must! Absolutely the most delicious Tapas you can get in New York.",5.0
Needed a venue to celebrate a special occasion that would accommodate a big group. After having a great experience at Xixa we decided to try Traif. Reservations are highly recommended and they accept them 30 days in advance. We opted in for the tasting menu which was really good  and the wait staff accommodated all our requests. We tried several of the cocktails- all of which were interesting but I would recommend wine for the tasting menu. Between Xixa and Traif I preferred Xixa but that could have been because of the menu they were offering when we ate there. The quality of the service was great and the Traif experience was worth the bill.,4.0

I won't make that mistake again..... but the menu will be different by the time I return.  The good news is, though, I WILL return !!  This was one of my favorite meals EVER.  Gastronomic geniuses at work RIGHT HERE.By the way, the only way to get reservations is either by telephone or email.  They do not take online reservations, such as through Open Table.",5.0
"From the reviews, I was expecting amazing food. We got the chef's selection, but we all found the food to be just ok. Nothing was bad... it just wasn't anything I would want to eat again. The crab was not at all crispy, and covered in a strong mayonnaise sauce that overpowered the dish, the pork belly was all fat, and the list goes on. Maybe it was an off night, but we've had amazing food for that price at other restaurants, so it seems silly to spend so much on an ok meal. The dishes we thought were ok were the Cauliflower with cucumber, and the gnocchi, and the duck, out of the 11 or so we tried. The desert was mediocre. But the ambiance and service was great!",3.0
"Traif, is by far, one of the best Tapas restaurant in New York. As a consumer, do not expect the dishes to be big, each dish is portioned in small amounts (Hence, Tapas-Small Dishes). Aside from the portioning of their dishes, this place gets filled rather quickly. Make sure that you make reservations a few days prior if you want to ensure a seat without waiting for long. Traif opens their doors at 6pm, and even with reservations at 10:30 pm, my friends and I still had to wait for 15 minutes. The ambiance of the place is small, and dark, lit by candles on each table (perfect place for a date night!). Our server was amazing, and friendly. She gave us two complimentary desserts (Key Lime Pie, & Bacon Doughnuts), and soup before our dishes came. Moving on to food, the dishes were amazing! The dishes were portioned perfectly. Prior to coming to Traif, I had already downed chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and fries a few hours before, so I was already NOT in the mood to eat anything else. To my amazement, the food was so amazing that I didn't care how full I was. I ate as much as I could, and I never felt sickened by the fact that I was eating on a full stomache. The food was just that phenomenal! I seriously, have not stopped thinking about how amazing the food was, and cannot wait to go back.Seated right by the kitchen area, I watched with amazement as the chefs prepared our foods. The chefs put so much care into cooking & displaying the food. Each dish takes awhile to arrive, but I believe it is so worth it. The chefs want to ensure that each dish is absolutely close to perfection before being served, and the wait is definitely worth it. Food Recommendations:  * Strawberry-Cinnamon Glazed Baby Back Ribs* ""The Baller"" (Served once a week to one customer only)* Pork Belly (AMAZING!) * Duck (Can't remember the full name, but I provided pictures) * The potato slices served with buffalo milk (AMAZING!) * Scallops (Boyfriend & Friends Favorite - Since I do not eat seafood)* Cheeseburger Sliders w/ Sweet Potato Fries (They were good, but not amazing) The food here can get real expensive (Our bill was a few hundred dollars - including ""the Baller"" steak priced at $100). If you are planning to eat here, please have your wallet ready. Since the portions are small, you will most likely order many dishes. Each dish are priced at 6-15$, which is not cheap for super small portions. Overall, I had a good experience. Every minute of waiting and travelling to get here, is completely worth it. For anyone, who has never tried Traif, you must! Absolutely the most delicious Tapas you can get in New York.",5.0
Needed a venue to celebrate a special occasion that would accommodate a big group. After having a great experience at Xixa we decided to try Traif. Reservations are highly recommended and they accept them 30 days in advance. We opted in for the tasting menu which was really good  and the wait staff accommodated all our requests. We tried several of the cocktails- all of which were interesting but I would recommend wine for the tasting menu. Between Xixa and Traif I preferred Xixa but that could have been because of the menu they were offering when we ate there. The quality of the service was great and the Traif experience was worth the bill.,4.0
What an extraordinary restaurant. We just finished the $50 tasting menu which was the ultimate bargain. I'm not sure how many courses but there were almost ten and every one was spectacular. The service provided by Alison was as good as it gets. We finished dinner with some amazing dessertsHighlighted by the bacon doughnuts. Be sure and write a reservation because it is very popular. The outside patio is an ideal place to dine.,5.0
"We came here as a group of 8 to celebrate our friends' birthday. The food is great. We had the prefix tasting menu-a total of 10 courses, just the right amount. Many of the courses taste sour, not my favorite but really creative. It is hard to find similar food anywhere else in the city. Definitely recommend if you wanna try something new and awesome.",5.0
"This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend, and the power of that alone was enough for me to try this place. If you are thinking of visiting this place, word of warning, you will need to book well in advance, as this place get's jammed up pretty much every night. I was lucky enough to be sat at the bar on my visit, and I have to tell you, this place is amazing. With what appears to be the Kitchen, Bar and Dining Room all jammed into one tiny space, this place has atmosphere coming out of every single pore in existence.   When it comes to the menu, as the name suggests (Traif = is the Yiddish word for any form of non-kosher food) don't expect to eat here if you are allergic to bacon or pork in any form. In addition, because it's tapas, the menu is always changing, so expect the unexpected. I had two courses, first was the BBQ Pork sliders. The bun felt as though it had just dropped from the sky and was made from clouds it was that fresh and soft. The BBQ pork was marinated in an amazing sauce containing onions and what appeared to be Colonel Sanders 12 secret spices. They were incredible and combined with the fresh cut sweet potato fries, this was an amazing start to my meal.  I followed this all start performance with deep fried shrimp and pineapple, which were glazed in some type of spicy chilli sauce. Round 2 = PERFECT - Food Fatality! While I only had two dishes, I was encouraged by the bartender to NOT miss out on the desert menu, in particular, the Bacon Doughnuts. Boy am I glad she convinced me! Served with a Coffee Ice cream, these were quite simply, delectable. Worth coming here just for these!All up, an incredible dining experience. The staff were on point, super friendly and service was exceptional. Everyone worked as a team, and it was plain to see that everyone who worked there loved their job. If you are anywhere near this part of town, or even if you aren't, do yourself a favor and check out this fine establishment. I can't wait to come back. Hat's off the owners, Jason Marcus, the chef, and his girlfriend, Heather Heuser. You guys nailed it!",5.0
"Little pricey but awesome! Make a reservation if possible, This place gets super busy on the weekends and you will wait. Ordered the baked muenster cheese, chicken wings, salt and pepper shrimp, day boat scallops, bbq braised short rib sliders, and quail. Everything was delicious. Could've done without the chicken wings; it was the last thing they served and by then we were too full to enjoy them. I don't even eat quail and it was worth it. The scallops, although overpriced, were my favorite along with the BBQ biased short rib sliders - a must-try!",4.0
"OVERALLGreat food, good service, crappy seating and drinks. There is a $50 chef tasting menu but its ONLY during weekdays.I think this place gets way more credit than it deserves, and all these flawless 5 star reviews are probably from the local hipsters who have probably avoided every ""good"" restaurant in NYC for fear of being too mainstream.THE LAYOUTWow is this place uncomfortable to sit in. We sat in a corner table for two and there was hardly any room to move. The tables are so close together you are almost on top of the tables next to you.On top of that, its got an open kitchen layout - which means if you're seated anywhere near the kitchen, expect to be in the blast range of some of  the most intense heat you'll ever experience in a restaurant. My room temperature app recorded 80 degrees with 50% humidity - I was sweating balls in my short sleeve shirt.THE FOODWe tried 6 dishes, and normally I'd go over them in detail but apparently the menu changes DAILY. Prices for each dish are about $13-17 average and are enough for about 4-5 bites each for two people. Our waiter recommended 6 dishes for 2 people. That worked about right with room for dessert.Decent portion size even if they were a bit on the expensive side.So here's a quick rundown of whats good and whats passable:Pork belly - awesome and tender. *Must have*Tuna Tartar on eggplant - pretty good, tastes like sushiShort Ribs with strawberry glaze - awesome, tender, *Must have*Sweetbreads - MehBacon wrapped dates - perfect combo of sweet and salty *Must have*Pork sliders - awesome, loved the chipotle sauce *Must have*Fois gras - decent, too large of a portion of eggs and potatoes and not much meat.Bacon Donuts - these were just OK. Not amazing by any means. Its just tiny donuts with a bacon bits served with caramel ice cream. Talk about total letdown. My girlfriend summed up our reaction perfectly:""Anyone who writes that they are life changing must really have a shitty life.""THE SERVICEWhen we first started getting dishes, the food was flying out of the kitchen and we'd get everything pretty quickly. Half way through dinner though, we would finish and wait 10-15 minutes for the next dish to come. Pacing was a bit weird and not consistent at all.DRINKSCocktails are totally hit or miss. For $12 average price, one of my cocktails came in what might as well have been a shot glass on a wine glass stem.The Rude Little Pig signature drink is pretty gross. Way too much bite, and doesn't taste like bacon at all. It just has some bacon garnish around the glass with salt.I'm probably the only person ever to order a ""digestiv"" here but I tried to Becherovka. Its $9 for a shot and tastes what you'd expect the ""Nutmet/Cinnamon challenge"" to taste like in liquid form. Man its strong. I would not get it again.",3.0
"2.5 stars. I came here with my wife and a friend for their $50/pp tasting menu. It sounded like a great deal, and we were excited for some great food after seeing other reviews. Unfortunately, we didn't really have a great experience, and felt the dishes were thrown together without much thought to how they complement each other.Food:11 dishes for $50/pp. We thought this was a steal and came in with high expectations after hearing other Yelpers rave about food here. We ended up going with the adventurous selection since we like trying new things, but in the end, we didn't really feel that the food was very adventurous. Every dish was cooked nicely, but together the menu didn't make too much sense. We also felt that the dishes were too heavy without any light or refreshing components. We got the following dishes in order of appearance:-Butternut Squash Soup (amuse bouche): Good but not memorable.-Burrata Cheese with Beets, Strawberries, Pomegranate, and Nuts: This dish was simple. If you like beets and burrata cheese then you would like this. The nuts worked well and played with textures. We felt the portion of this dish was a bit too large and would have liked a easier way to scoop the cheese since we were clearing making a mess and just pushing things around. -Scallops on Top of Lentils: The scallops themselves were cooked okay. Only the top was seared though which is a big let down. Lentils were complemented nicely. -Chopped Chicken Liver Spread with Balsamic Vinegar Toast: Classic combination executed well but was hard to eat without getting hands sticky from the balsamic vinegar.- Hampshire Pork Belly with Celery Root Slaw: Pork belly was cooked nicely, but by this time, I was starting to feel uncomfortable from all the heavy dishes.-Pulled Pork Sliders with Sweet Potato Fries: By far, the worst dish of the night. The pulled pork had too much sauce and covered up everything else. Following a pork belly course, this dish also was way too heavy. My opinion might have changed if this was on its own. Also, this dish was disappointing since there was nothing adventurous about pulled pork sliders with sweet potato fries.-Atlantic Salmon with Seaweed Risotto: This was my favorite dish of the night. The fresh fish complemented the creamy well cooked risotto nicely. It was also one of the lighter dishes of the night and after the pork belly and sliders; this was a nice change of pace. -Short Ribs with Strawberry and Cinnamon: This dish tasted like a Chinese braised short rib. Nothing spectacular unfortunately. -Mushroom Cream Pasta: Way too creamy for my liking, but my wife loved it. At this point, we felt overwhelmed by the heavy dishes and felt sick. -Foie Gras with Sunny-Side-Up Egg and Potato Wedges: This might have been my favorite dish if it came out earlier since I am a huge fan of foie gras; however, after so many heavy courses, I couldn't enjoy this heavy dish in addition (what a bummer!)-Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Passion Fruit Sauce: Loved the passion fruit sauce since it was the only tart element of the night. Tasted good but pretty standard panna cotta. -Bacon Donuts with Tres Leches Ice Cream: This was probably the most ""adventurous"" dish of the night, and it worked. I mean, who is the genius that decided to put the these two gorgeous foods (bacon and donut) together? We would have appreciated it more if the other dishes weren't so heavy. Service:Service was friendly and attentive. I had my water glass refilled constantly. However, pacing was off, though this is probably more a result of the kitchen did putting food out at unevenly. We would get a bunch of dishes at once, then have a long wait for the next batch of dishes.Overall:A great price for individually well cooked dishes. The menu seemed kind of haphazard and could have used more thought to form a cohesive tasting experience. There also wasn't much ""adventure"" in the adventurous tasting menu. I would have appreciated it if our waiter explained the menu in more detail, so that we knew what we were getting ourselves into. Another thing that I didn't like was that wines by the glass were not listed anywhere on the menu. You need to specifically ask the waiter/waitress. Overall, we felt that the quality of the dishes were good, but were let down by our experience as a whole. We would come back for individual plates but not for their tasting menu. The overly chaotic tasting menu, heavy dishes, inconvenient wines by the glass options stopped me from having a positive experience here. As a result, Traif gets 2.5 stars and rounds up to 3 on yelp's system because of their price.",3.0

She's on my BF's list but she had her back to us the whole night so he missed his chance lol.",4.0
"Personally, I do not understand the hype of this restaurant. The experience as a whole was really poor. It's a tony restaurant with an open kitchen - the heat from the kitchen turns the restaurant into a furnace. The food here was also pretty bad - it was super greasy and not that flavorful. My girlfriend and I both bad upset stomachs after we left. I will admit the service was great, but the best service in the world could not save this place from being awful. I think nyc has some of the best restaurants in the world and this restaurant does not deserve to be getting the attention that it does.",2.0
"Why is this such a renowned restaurant, you ask? Traditional home-style comfort meets ""Yo instead of chicken or whatever let's use quail"" is why. Basically, Traif meets all of your prepubescent memories of ""home"" while throwing in a twist of new-age sophistication. Also who can't love when restaurants pull the old amuse-bouche?Cardoon portage with lemon crema and fried capers was the most special dish of the night, with unbelievable umami, savory, creamy, and even subtly bitter qualities. The rabbit and gnocchi dish was very pulled-porky, and the ratio of meat to carb wasn't ideal. The fried quail leg and the sweetbread were both definitely great, and very emblematic of Traifs' apparent theme of new-age twist on old-home food. Simultaneously I get and don't get all the hype. Their formula is nostalgia + creativity and it works, however I wish the balance they struck was thicker with the whacky sauce.",4.0
"I don't write many reviews, but last night's dinner at Traif deserves a few raves. We ordered the chef's selection, 10 small plates plus 2 desserts. Unlike some other restaurants, where I've had tasting menus that were high priced and yet, left me hungry, Traif gives you more than enough food. But this story is not about quantity, It's about quality. The hits just keep coming. Just about every dish delivered heavenly flavors. Varied textures also enhanced the experience. Standouts included the pork belly, short rib sliders, Magret duck breast, seared scallops and ... well I could go on and on.",5.0
"Definitely do the tasting menu !! Opened with a chicken pate toast followed by awesome burrata  which might've been my favorite. I personally am not crazy about pulled pork so my least favorite were the sliders w sweet potato fries. Butterscotch budino was fantastic, not too sweet how it's good. We had a cocktails then had like 2 glasses  of their equivalent to Pinot noir (sorry forgot the name). I know pacing is a lame excuse to not give 5 stars but I did feel bombarded w food at some points. Great experience! I feel like we're lucky to have gotten in with no reservation on a Thursday. We got there like 630",4.0
"Man that was a good meal.  So many great, exciting dishes at just the right size.  We ended up order 6 dishes for 2 plus dessert, which proved to be 1 dish too many (should have skipped the foie gras, though it was tasty).  Loved the sliders (smoked paprika aioli is a revelation), muenster cheese, tuna tartare...enjoyed the soft shell crab and donuts. Less wowed by the pork belly and foie, although both were well prepared.  Great cocktails, too. Attentive service, great laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere.  We went early (6 pm) and thus did not have any service issues in terms of timing that have been mentioned by others.  We will definitely return, and next time, we'll bring guests.  Great visit to Traif - now easily in our top 5 in Brooklyn.",5.0
"I'll admit it, I like Traif! There I said it. The food is adventurous and a little quirky. So, my review is not about Traif per se, but rather another  review of Traif... The following reader must specialize in ripping $50 dollar meals in W'Burg, Bklyn to shreds. (Reader comments as follows) : This 2-star review feels so out of place among the masses of glowing reviews, (self-serving!) but I just didn't have the same experience. I came here for dinner with two friends and we all opted for the $50 per person, chef's tasting experience. ($50 in New york is not a high-end dining experience, a pizza pie, with drinks and a few sides will topple this number. This price structure entitles the reader to rip the menu and dining experience apart.) We were given the option of either doing the ""Standard"" or ""Adventurous"" tasting, and we chose to try the latter. (Wonderful.) I wish our server had given us a better explanation of what each entailed, (was the restaurant busy?) because now I wonder if I would have had a better experience with the normal fare. (Did you have a few drinks before you walked in the door?,where your faculties impaired?) However, I didn't bother asking, so not his fault. ( One could jump to that conclusion.)The good: (Here we go!) 1. Portions: 11 courses for $50 is quite the steal ( you are getting a bargain, that's $4.50 per plate! -- a slice of Pizza and a Coke will easily come in at $5 or $6.50 a meal, and you are getting 11 unique meals! You could do better with a Mc Donalds value menu...) - I don't think I have ever gotten so much food at this caliber of the restaurant for this price. (So, why not stop here with this BS review and call it a day?) I was uncomfortably full by the end of the meal. (You did not have to keep eating.)The bad: (Ah, ye. The real point of the poison pen.) 1. The food was... not bad. ( Wow, generally, most folks stop eating at this point, unless someone is waterboarding them, and forcing food down their throat, Traif does not approve of these policies. ) But rather confusing and not very cohesive. ( Clearly, this diner is an Iron Chef on the Food Network Channel or at best one of the three judges on Chopped! ) It was overwhelmingly heavy (At his point, one would stop eating! ) (sliders, foie gras, short ribs, cheese...) and interspersed randomly with lighter fares (seafood). (So, you were seduced by the copious selection of food, this isn't like shopping for a handbag or shoes, you don't have to engage, there is free will involved in this, unless of course you are compelled by a force greater than yourself to continue on this gluttonous journey. ) Some seemed higher end (Food Network expertise.) (foie gras with sunny side up egg) and others were disappointingly random (sliders with fries)- ( It appears that the diner is looking for a presentation level of say a: Wolfgang Puck, Tom Colicchio, or José Andrés, where price points quadruple). I guess that for an establishment with such glowing reviews, (The reviews are primarily from Yelp folks like yourself, who want a great meal at a great price!, $50 bucks is a steal in New York, in Kansas it may be called luxury pricing --no offense to Kansas.) I was expecting more thought to be put into the plates, (There was thought put into the plates, you, however, we're too busy with your pen instead of your spoon to notice!) and that the ""adventurous"" menu would be, well, more adventurous! (Its Traif in W'Burg, not in Las Vegas! Again, context! Go spend real dollars on a pricey meal and give us another review! )Yes, the proverbial spacing of food. (Was the restaurant busy, it may not excuse pacing, but all in context.) 2. The spacing of food: Sometimes we would get one plate and have to wait quite a bit for the next course. (Were you enjoying your gluttonous evening, we're you not drinking or were you too busy hunched over your IPhone to engage with your company?), Other times, we would get 2-3 courses in the span of 10 minutes, which was overwhelming. ( Folks engaged in an evening, 1. Pace the meal. 2, Talk, chat --not on their phones!, go to the bathroom, flirt with a waiter, play footsies with their partner underneath the table, etc., You, however, could not wait to nail this meal review!)Plates I enjoyed: (Finally, positives of a $50 evening!)- Atlantic Salmon with Seaweed Risotto: I usually am not a fan of salmon, but it was cooked very well, and I was impressed with the seaweed risotto - flavorful and rich but not overwhelmingly creamy. Plates I didn't enjoy: (Couldn't help yourself...)- Hampshire pork belly with celery root: I know pork belly is supposed to be fatty, but this was overly so - I've had pork belly served where the leaner meat: fat ratio was perfect, and this was overwhelmingly fat. The celery root slaw was bland and didn't do a good job counteracting the heaviness of the meat. (I can go on, however, my stomach hurts from reading this!)",4.0

I came here last Friday night with two friends.  It was our first time and we were all excited.  We opted for the tasting menu which was $50 per person and came with 9 dishes and 2 desserts.  It was all tapas style and each dish was tailor made to be enough for 3 people. You pretty much got 1-2 bites per person per dish.We started off with the strawberry gazpacho.  It was good. A little bit on the tart side.Second tasting dish was some sort of cheese with pear and pistachios. It was super delicious.Third tasting was tuna tartare over fried eggplant. That was my fav dish of the night.Fourth was the seared scallops over what looked like corn risotto. Scallops were seasoned and cooked to perfection.Fifth was a battered and fried shrimp dish with melons. I wasn't crazy about the shrimps as I felt they were too salty but the melons were good.Sixth dish was a fried pork belly dish with 2 sauces and figs on top. That was pretty good if you're into pork fat.Seventh dish was pork sliders and sweet potato fries. THIS WAS SO GOOD! My fellow diners felt this was their fav dish. This was my second fav. Eighth dish was stewed ribs with strawberry on top. It wasn't bad but we were still oohing and aahhhing over the pork sliders.Ninth dish was a grilled hamachi (some sort of fish) collar with cherry tomatoes and sauce. It was just ok for me.Tenth dish (looks like they messed up and gave us more than the 9 dishes---woo hoo) some sort of pasta dish with all different types of mushrooms and truffles. Very good and mushroomy if you like fungus.DESSERTS:Bacon donuts and omg...I forgot what it's called!!! It looks like flan but its not flan. It's white and some sort of cheese. Darn it.

"my favorite restaurant in NY thus far. the tasting menu is absolutely reasonably priced, and the food is delicious and thoughtful and unassuming. it's a definite must-visit. the restaurant is small and cozy inside (and when i say cozy i mean get ready to bump elbows with the next table over) and it's very loud inside. service is fine, but the food makes this place great. even my non-foodie bf loves this place -- so that means it's better than papa john's and bojangles fried chicken -- a definite accomplishment!",5.0
"Great little place in Brooklyn. Was looking for a last minute anniversary dinner and we love to try new places and this place had such terrific reviews it was a must so glad we made the trip!! Great service, small shareable plates, very flavorful... Wish i could have tried the entire menu!! Will definitely come again",5.0
"I loved the dining experience at Traif, and I will be back!  I went out on a limb for a friend's birthday dinner here and we definitely weren't sorry.  The chef began with a cold asparagus soup that was on the house to wet our appetites while looking at their extensive menu of small plates options.  The portions are small, which makes the bill ring up fast since it is recommended to have at least 7-9 dishes per visit.  All worth it in the end. Here's what we devoured during our last visit:Bacon wrapped blue cheese dates--these were flavorful and deliciousDayboat scallops--my favorite of all we tried--scallops were moist, tender and exploding with flavorBraised short rib sliders--excellent and fun little bites of BBQSweet potato fries w/ paprika aioli--hands down the best fries I have ever tiredBroccoli Rabe with truffle toast and mushrooms--surprisingly not bitter at all, deep truffly goodness, and a great veggie optionKey Lime pie--yum, said the people who shared around mePineapple finisher--delicious, sweet, freshThe food's presentation was lovely, the tastes were high quality, unique and delicious.  Can't wait to return!",5.0
"Amazing tasting menu, coming here was a wonderful experience. I could not believe the amount of elaborate looking dishes that come out. Everything tasted as good as it looks! Would definitely come back",5.0
"Reservations are hard to come by unless you dont mind going at a late hour. But its definitely worth it. Its very affordable. The portions are small but the food is great, seasoned well and very flavorful. If you aren't very careful you can order everything based on the price.   The chicken liver is a must. Bacon donut is sinful!! Its called Traif for a reason.",4.0
My boyfriend and I went in for the tasting menu. It's usually a minimum of 3 people but if you can get there early enough try and get a seat at the bar. The tasting menu is only $50/person for 9 courses. The location is a hidden gem and a bit out of the way but definitely worth it. If you have a long wait ahead of you wonder over to Bia for a drink. They let you pick a handful of the courses too!Hoisin Wings - Tangy and Spicy our batch was a bit dryFoie Gras- We opted to be good people and skip this course - but it came out anyway and how could we say no - it was deliciousDate Stuffed with Cheese wrapped in Bacon- I love this dish always and foreverBacon Donuts - I was not wowed but pretty creativeBuratta cheese - nothing spectacular.This is one of our favorite restaurants in Brooklyn.,5.0
"All these five star reviews, guess what? I thought it was a (4) star place, I noticed lots of cooking mistakes with our dishes. The (4) of us ordered the $50 tasting menu. It felt like the food just kept coming!I called for a reservation, they took my number and was asked if they could call me back for confirmation. Wowza, that's some crazy security. I guess naming a restaurant TRAIF in a Hasidic neighborhood, ya might have a few haters.Let me knock out the MEH dishes:Our strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs, they were overcooked. It had all the great flavors, they just over cooked the ribs.The same with our scallops. One or two came on the plates that were a little more brown on the top than the other scallops.Now for the amazings:The homemade Burrata cheese was so fresh, it was a great first starter.Foie gras with a poached egg was another rich and decadent dish. Spicy shrimp dish was also cooked perfectly.Pork Belly? Yes please! Pork belly is something I can never get enough of, its so fatty and decadent!But my all time favorite dish:Soft shelled crabs: OMG!! Ba-zinga! Word to the mother kra-zay good.So I have my cocktail, the food kept coming and the wait staff was on target. The dessert dish everyone is raving about is the Dulche de leche bacon doughnuts. I also see there is Key Lime Pie? I LOVE KLP!I told our waiter I love KLP but we have to try is the Dulche de leche bacon doughnuts. (Sad face)Guess what? Our waiter brought out both! That my yelp friends is just some excellent customer service.The bacon doughnuts, try to picture a large doughnut hole, drizzle caramel on top as well as a bacon crumble.  Push some coffee ice cream to the side and now you have a dish that is so opposite of kosher, I'm praying God finds a sense of humor in this dish. LIke how he created the Platypus.And the Key Lime Pie? The crust to the Key Lime itself, it tasted sweet and homemade.Just a perfect dessert that's doesn't offend any religious groups.Traif is a cool, funky place to have a nice meal with friends or a fun first date. Like Mission Chinese, its something that's not a regular go to place. A solid 4 stars from me",4.0

"My boyfriend and I walked in around 30 minutes after the restaurant opened without a reservation. Luckily, the hostess was nice and gave us a table telling us we had to give it up by 8. Of course we agreed wanting to try this place for the longest, so we readily followed the hostess to our table. Once sat, our server filled our cups with water and asked us if it was our first experience at Traif. We answered yes, and he explained shortly how the dishes were prepared and left to gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted. He came back shortly giving us complimentary shots of some kind of drink. We were unsure of what it was, but drank it anyways.We ordered the Hampshire pork belly,  dayboat scallops, and the foie gras with fingerling potatoes. I thought the pork belly was mediocre. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. It lacked a lot of flavor, and the meat was rather dry in my opinion. The dayboat scallops were pretty much the best thing I had there. The scallops were plain, but the savory corn risotto definitely saved the entire dish. Lastly, the foie gras with fingerling potatoes. We were rather disappointed when we took our first bite. EVERYTHING was soaked in oil, and the foie gras was not seared evenly. We probably drank 3 cups of water after to wash the oil out our mouths. Though the service was spectacular, I do not think we will return. It was an alright first experience, but the food was way over hyped. With the prices you're paying here, you might as well find a different tapas restaurant with better food.",3.0

"So this is my official 3 star stamp, I been here twice, once for dinner in June '12 and Christmas eve '14 for their Chinese Xmas and I was not blown away by either meal. I am in the minority opinion amongst Yelpers since everyone seems to go gaga over this unkosher restaurant that serves American small plates but simply put, I was disappointed, twice non the less. The meal definitely had some high points, but after the first set of rounds, which were respectable, it quickly went down hill after the 5th to 10th plates. If the first round stayed consistent throughout the meal, a 4 star review would apply, but this was not the case. For the food, I will list the order in which the food came out. Also, the service does earn a point of mention since they were so friendly and welcoming and I feel they went above and beyond for my friend who has a soy allergy. They were able to accommodate her and accommodate her well.The food:Strawberry-Cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs- Reg menu. This is kind of their go to dish. I ordered this on both visits and truth be told, they were just regular tender ribs, and I also didn't get a strawberry note at all. It also bothered me that the ribs weren't hot but lukewarm. It's a pretty dish but I don't see the hype.Sweet & Sour pork belly, Korean chile paste, quince, pineapple, haricots- Xmas menu. It was a nice dish, it was a sizable dish and the pork belly was tender, but I felt it should have been a little more tender and should have had a tad bit more fat. It didn't have the unctuousness I expect from pork belly. I also wish there was some type of exterior crust on the pork belly. The flavors were good but could have been tweaked.Lettuce, mac apples, grapes, bacon, blue cheese, sunflower, pomegranate- Reg menu. This dish stood throughout the night as my favorite dish. It seems absurd for me to enjoy salad so much, but it was a testament to how great the salad was. The salad was so wonderfully sweet and savory. The greens were dressed properly, the apples offered a nice crunch, the grapes and pomegranate added a wonderful sweetness and there was an amazing underlying blue cheese note throughout the salad that was fantastico. And crispy bacon needs no mention =)Stir-fried Mongolian lamb tongue, cumin,Szechuan peppercorns- Xmas menu. The lamb tongue was so insanely tender, no teeth required, but the flavor was just OK for me. I didn't think this dish was that memorable and there was no heat what so ever from the peppercorn. I thought the sauce was too overpowering and gloppy and the tongue taste was lost, it seemed like it was only there for texture.Spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura Japanese, eggplant, kecap manis- Reg menu. This dish had no heat, the tuna had good flavor but the eggplant did not have a pleasant texture. The eggplant was too soft and not really crunchy, it was also greasy to boot. The tuna by itself was nice, the bottom, not so much.Joe's chopped chicken livers, balsamic-bacon toasts, rosemary & shallots- Reg Menu. I was super excited to try this dish, but sadly, it was one of my least favs. It really didn't resemble chopped liver at all, the flavors were so mild and the toast was a bad choice, the toast was too thick and the balsamic was too sweet, not a pairing that worked for me.Dayboat scallops, butternut squash risotto, huckleberry, pistachio, sage- Reg menu. The scallops were cooked well, super soft and tender, a tad under for me, but the risotto bothered me. I was expecting a little bite from the rice but it seemed more like pumpkin rice pudding than risotto. The texture of risotto usually has some type of a chew to the rice, the rice in this dish was soft throughout. Spicy garlic roasted eggplant & crispy sweetbreads, arbol chillies- Xmas menu. This was essentially General Tso's chicken. The dish was too sweet for me, the heat was OK but the sweetbreads, which are normally creamy and milky, were completely lost when it was fried and submerged in the overpowering and overly sweet General Tso's sauce. The fact that it was sweetbreads didn't help at all, they could have easily used chicken and it wouldn't have changed the flavor at all.Crispy whole-fried flounder, curry-coconut sauce, Chinese sausage- Xmas menu. This dish bothered me a lot. First, the overpowering smell of the curry was too much. Second, the coconut was so unpleasantly flavored and way too sweet. Third, the fish was overcooked and dry, while being greasy. The fish wasn't really crunchy either, it was basically limp and it looked that way when it was put on the table. I knew when I saw it, I wasn't going to like it. Lastly, I did not like the Chinese sausage they used. It almost seemed like a fake Chinese sausage or Costco brand.Five-spice layer cake, yuzu, sesame, coconut- I thought this was a nice finish to the meal. It was light and refreshing, the coconut ice cream had nice flavor and the yuzu offered a nice refreshing tartness. The cake was a tad dense though",3.0
"I dig it. I do.But perhaps it was an off night? It happens to the best from time to time so-Highly creative. Interesting flavors & textural elements.SMALL PLATES. W the 1,300 reviews I some how missed this important detail.And too, if you or any one in your circle has food allergies or food sensitivities this is NOT the spot! Yes, the persnickety server flallingly copped a ""we can accommodate slightly"" attitude, it more or less failed in its actual delivery.Our party of 5 shared small intermittent & some times mingling plates:Duck confite, pork belly, scallops, seared foie gras, pork sliders, baked Munster cheese, spicy big eye tuna (loved!) & spinach salad. And no one wanted the bacon donuts. So the panna cotta was sublime in both flavor & texture. But all of us ogled over and savored the hazelnut ice cream thing.All in all...enjoyable.The kitchen is actually in the dining ""space"" dare I call it a ""room"" bcz intimate, even in Brooklyn would be putting it mildly, so one leaves smelling as if one where actually in the kitchen....Plan accordingly.Minuscule dark unisex bathroom- not my fave.Decent wine list, cocktail list was meh. The service was mock accomodating w a pinch of behind back snear, they tried- ish.Have fun parking!",4.0
"A two for me means I wouldn't go back.It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good. Service was a bit slow, we had trouble flagging anyone down to refill our water or to get the check. Food wasn't that great either.Tuna tartare - This was good. Simple and flavourfulStrawberry-Cinnamon baby back ribs - Very very dry. I like the idea of a strawberry glaze but the ribs we just too poorly cooked. By itself, these ribs would be the worst I've ever hadParisienne Gnocchi - This was good, delicious.Chicken and Biscuits - Chicken and biscuit were good, but there were vinegar soaked watermelon cubes. Not too sure what's that about because it feels like you're chewing vinegar. It wasn't pleasant at all and the menu doesn't mention the vinegar hell the watermelon will bring you toOverall just not worth it.",2.0
"Excellent dishes for the most part, price was just right and the wine was good. Service was nice and fast- I mean the dishes came out one after another boom boom boom, could barely keep up. Waitress was knowledgable of all dishes, wine and sensitive/catering to the pregnant person in our party with a lot of allergies. Knocked off star because not all the plates were excellent. I did the chef tasting- 50$ per person. Chef selection is 8 different tapas off the current menu. They are flexible- can tell them what you definitely want part of it and what you definitely don't (for example, I requested that chicken liver, foie gras, sweetbread and lamb tongue be kept off the chef selection- we were not feeling adventurous) you get a starter soup, 8 selections and then end with two desserts. Started with the butternut squash soup- tasted like a cinnamon curry soup. Was glad to have gotten a tiny cup of it. Anymore and I would've tired of it quickly. Interesting but I would never order again. Favorite was the crispy sweet and sour shrimp. Yum!! Light and crispy batter hugging a generous sized perfectly cooked shrimp. Flavors went off in the mouth. The sliders were excellent- but the fries not so much. The texture was fine but not very sweet for sweet potato fries, not sweet at all- and in sweet potato fries, I feel the sweetness is what makes it so special. Also, the sauce that it came with was kind of bland. Fried soft shell crab was great! Loved the sauce it came with and it was nice light and crispy. Would get this again. Scallops were tasty. Scallops are scallops- not much more to say. The beet dish we weren't thrilled with. Flavors came together nicely but nothing to rave about. Maybe I'm not just a beet person but I didn't think it was anything special. You would probably appreciate it if you really like beets. Otherwise, you can skip it. Chicken wings were ok. These are the kind of wings where it's just so saucy you end up with more thick gloppy sauce on your fingers than on the wing somehow. The sauce reminded me of general tsos chicken. Neither dessert was memorable.",4.0
"Came to Williamsburg for dessert and wanted a small bite to eat before so we came here. Picked 5 tapas for two people straight off the menu without influence from reviews or photos on Yelp even though I looked beforehand. We got the fall sushi, Icy blue mussels, tuna tartare, braised short rib sliders, and foie gras. The tuna tartare with fried eggplants were my favorite followed by the braised short rib sliders. I could've done without the icy blue mussels because they were a little too spicy for me and the mussels were really small. I also wasn't a big fan of the foie gras because it was a little too fatty and just tasted like a simple breakfast meal with the egg and potatoes. The fall sushi was not bad mainly because I love salmon and it came with seaweed salad and risotto which was nice. There are so many more dishes I want to try after looking at more pictures on Yelp and reading the reviews. When the dessert menu came, I wanted to get the bacon doughnuts but I wanted to save room for the dessert that brought us to Williamsburg so we passed but I truly regret it and will be coming back for those. Overall our dining experience was very pleasant. Our food came one dish after the other since it wasn't busy when we arrived and our waiter refilled our water at least 5 times without being asked to. We will definitely be back to try more of the tapas!-they also gave complementary butternut squash (I believe) soup to start and pineapple with lime juice at the end. Both were very good",5.0
"I've always noticed Traif listed on Yelp's Best of Brooklyn feature, so one day on a whim I randomly asked my friend if he wanted to try it with me. We ended up getting a reservation for a Sunday night, surprisingly easy to book only a few days before.The interior of the restaurant feels kind of like a bar - dark, low-key, and a little cramped. The kitchen is completely open though, and features this abstract, colorful mural that spans the ceiling. My friend and I spent a while debating whether or not the open kitchen was the only kitchen in the restaurant... it was as far as we could tell, which makes it extra impressive how they're able to produce so much amazing food in such a small space! There's a really nice-looking patio in the back of the restaurant too, but it was unfortunately full by the time we got there.The menu consists entirely of small plates, and our server explained to us that the items are listed from lightest to heaviest. The concept of Traif is best described as ""eclectic,"" and we took literally forever to decide what to order because everything looked so interesting.We ended up getting--1) Chilled mint and pea soup (amuse-bouche) - Incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day, though a bit heavy on the salt.2) Shannon's bacon fat focaccia - Came with a side of bacon marmalade and creamy buttermilk ricotta. The bacon marmalade was like a gritty, slightly sweet bacon paste, and paired so well with the focaccia. This was easily my favorite dish of the entire meal, and I normally don't even like bacon, so this is saying a lot!3) Dayboat scallops - Served with snap and English pea risotto. The scallops were perfectly seared and buttered, and came topped with capers and bits of tomato. The risotto was nice and creamy, the flavor of pea subtly there.4) Spicy bigeye tuna tartare - The tartare was served on top of slices of Japanese eggplant tempura and then drizzled with kecap manis (which I had to look up - apparently it's Indonesian sweet soy sauce.) Eaten together, they paired really well and tasted almost like Japanese curry. 5) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs - The glaze was amazing and incredibly sweet, but this was the only dish I didn't love. The meat itself was dry and not very tender. The strawberry slices thrown in were a nice touch, though.6) BBQ braised short rib sliders - The short rib was incredibly tender and juicy, and I easily polished off my slider in a couple of bites. The sweet potato fries with paprika aioli, served on the side, were also pretty good. This dish was another favorite of the night.7) Buttermilk panna cotta - This was also amazing. The panna cotta was incredibly milky and smooth, and got a good kick of flavor from the pool of Meyer lemon cream it was sitting in.8) Bacon doughnuts - Traif's famous doughnuts! The bacon flavor was surprisingly subtle - it was basically only in the bacon bits crumbled on top of the doughnuts. The coffee ice cream on the side was the perfect complement to the doughnuts.Our server presented us with complimentary pineapple with pomegranate sauce to end our meal. Having a piece of fruit was actually a really refreshing way to end our dinner, considering how much meat we'd just consumed.Conclusion: Dinner at Traif is easily one of the best meals I've had so far in New York, and I know I would come back in a heartbeat!",5.0

Loved Traif so much I got tired of the food for going too often. The open kitchen makes for a great show for foodies. Havent been back in a while but cant wait to go back....xixa the sister store a few doors down is pretty good too but Traif is still better.,4.0
"Best to come in group of 3, 4, 5, for best seating arrangements--it's easier to bump out into the patio. Couples tend to be by the bar area with individual tables. Exceptional servicing by the waitress & clean up staff. Intimate decor. Medium noise level. Maybe a 2-3 minute walk from the train station. Currently, most of the dishes range in the 9-15 range. The Chef's Selection is 50. There will be tax later. My group went with the selection, all with single serve tasting. While eating, I wondered if any of this would've been better had I ordered regular dishes, getting more of what I liked. They ask you first what you'd like to see and what you don't like, to better get an idea of what to serve you. We had a starting complimentary small cup of soup, followed by 10 dishes, and ending with 3 desserts + a complimentary fruit bite. Out of our dishes, I highly recommend the scallops if they're part of the menu. Everything else was a combination of interesting flavors. We left either satisfied or stuffed. I don't like mentioning specifics, since the dishes could often change per season.The one annoying part of the night that made me consider bumping it down to 4 stars was waiting in the cold. Reservation's at 6PM, yes, but my group can't wait by the bar or the little entrace you created for reception? A bit uptight. For the price and service, I'd consider it a treat to come here. I wouldn't have minded if we had maybe 1-2 more extra dishes, but it's all good.",5.0
"The kitchen started us off with a shot of Squash soup (yum!) & also ended the meal with a seasoned cube of pineapple. So many of the dishes were seasoned with various fruits; savory bites with pops of fruity sweetness. Just amazing!We ordered the scallops with green pea risotto, the roasted cauliflower, the Foie gras, BBQ short rib sliders with sweet potato fries and the Burrata. I have placed them in order from tremendously delicious to delicious. Because everything was delicious!  Better to have a  reservation; we waited 20 minutes for seats at the bar & we were grateful for it. Drinks were wonderful. Buttermilk pana cotta for dessert was very good.",4.0
"So this is my official 3 star stamp, I been here twice, once for dinner in June '12 and Christmas eve '14 for their Chinese Xmas and I was not blown away by either meal. I am in the minority opinion amongst Yelpers since everyone seems to go gaga over this unkosher restaurant that serves American small plates but simply put, I was disappointed, twice non the less. The meal definitely had some high points, but after the first set of rounds, which were respectable, it quickly went down hill after the 5th to 10th plates. If the first round stayed consistent throughout the meal, a 4 star review would apply, but this was not the case. For the food, I will list the order in which the food came out. Also, the service does earn a point of mention since they were so friendly and welcoming and I feel they went above and beyond for my friend who has a soy allergy. They were able to accommodate her and accommodate her well.The food:Strawberry-Cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs- Reg menu. This is kind of their go to dish. I ordered this on both visits and truth be told, they were just regular tender ribs, and I also didn't get a strawberry note at all. It also bothered me that the ribs weren't hot but lukewarm. It's a pretty dish but I don't see the hype.Sweet & Sour pork belly, Korean chile paste, quince, pineapple, haricots- Xmas menu. It was a nice dish, it was a sizable dish and the pork belly was tender, but I felt it should have been a little more tender and should have had a tad bit more fat. It didn't have the unctuousness I expect from pork belly. I also wish there was some type of exterior crust on the pork belly. The flavors were good but could have been tweaked.Lettuce, mac apples, grapes, bacon, blue cheese, sunflower, pomegranate- Reg menu. This dish stood throughout the night as my favorite dish. It seems absurd for me to enjoy salad so much, but it was a testament to how great the salad was. The salad was so wonderfully sweet and savory. The greens were dressed properly, the apples offered a nice crunch, the grapes and pomegranate added a wonderful sweetness and there was an amazing underlying blue cheese note throughout the salad that was fantastico. And crispy bacon needs no mention =)Stir-fried Mongolian lamb tongue, cumin,Szechuan peppercorns- Xmas menu. The lamb tongue was so insanely tender, no teeth required, but the flavor was just OK for me. I didn't think this dish was that memorable and there was no heat what so ever from the peppercorn. I thought the sauce was too overpowering and gloppy and the tongue taste was lost, it seemed like it was only there for texture.Spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura Japanese, eggplant, kecap manis- Reg menu. This dish had no heat, the tuna had good flavor but the eggplant did not have a pleasant texture. The eggplant was too soft and not really crunchy, it was also greasy to boot. The tuna by itself was nice, the bottom, not so much.Joe's chopped chicken livers, balsamic-bacon toasts, rosemary & shallots- Reg Menu. I was super excited to try this dish, but sadly, it was one of my least favs. It really didn't resemble chopped liver at all, the flavors were so mild and the toast was a bad choice, the toast was too thick and the balsamic was too sweet, not a pairing that worked for me.Dayboat scallops, butternut squash risotto, huckleberry, pistachio, sage- Reg menu. The scallops were cooked well, super soft and tender, a tad under for me, but the risotto bothered me. I was expecting a little bite from the rice but it seemed more like pumpkin rice pudding than risotto. The texture of risotto usually has some type of a chew to the rice, the rice in this dish was soft throughout. Spicy garlic roasted eggplant & crispy sweetbreads, arbol chillies- Xmas menu. This was essentially General Tso's chicken. The dish was too sweet for me, the heat was OK but the sweetbreads, which are normally creamy and milky, were completely lost when it was fried and submerged in the overpowering and overly sweet General Tso's sauce. The fact that it was sweetbreads didn't help at all, they could have easily used chicken and it wouldn't have changed the flavor at all.Crispy whole-fried flounder, curry-coconut sauce, Chinese sausage- Xmas menu. This dish bothered me a lot. First, the overpowering smell of the curry was too much. Second, the coconut was so unpleasantly flavored and way too sweet. Third, the fish was overcooked and dry, while being greasy. The fish wasn't really crunchy either, it was basically limp and it looked that way when it was put on the table. I knew when I saw it, I wasn't going to like it. Lastly, I did not like the Chinese sausage they used. It almost seemed like a fake Chinese sausage or Costco brand.Five-spice layer cake, yuzu, sesame, coconut- I thought this was a nice finish to the meal. It was light and refreshing, the coconut ice cream had nice flavor and the yuzu offered a nice refreshing tartness. The cake was a tad dense though",3.0
"I dig it. I do.But perhaps it was an off night? It happens to the best from time to time so-Highly creative. Interesting flavors & textural elements.SMALL PLATES. W the 1,300 reviews I some how missed this important detail.And too, if you or any one in your circle has food allergies or food sensitivities this is NOT the spot! Yes, the persnickety server flallingly copped a ""we can accommodate slightly"" attitude, it more or less failed in its actual delivery.Our party of 5 shared small intermittent & some times mingling plates:Duck confite, pork belly, scallops, seared foie gras, pork sliders, baked Munster cheese, spicy big eye tuna (loved!) & spinach salad. And no one wanted the bacon donuts. So the panna cotta was sublime in both flavor & texture. But all of us ogled over and savored the hazelnut ice cream thing.All in all...enjoyable.The kitchen is actually in the dining ""space"" dare I call it a ""room"" bcz intimate, even in Brooklyn would be putting it mildly, so one leaves smelling as if one where actually in the kitchen....Plan accordingly.Minuscule dark unisex bathroom- not my fave.Decent wine list, cocktail list was meh. The service was mock accomodating w a pinch of behind back snear, they tried- ish.Have fun parking!",4.0
"A two for me means I wouldn't go back.It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good. Service was a bit slow, we had trouble flagging anyone down to refill our water or to get the check. Food wasn't that great either.Tuna tartare - This was good. Simple and flavourfulStrawberry-Cinnamon baby back ribs - Very very dry. I like the idea of a strawberry glaze but the ribs we just too poorly cooked. By itself, these ribs would be the worst I've ever hadParisienne Gnocchi - This was good, delicious.Chicken and Biscuits - Chicken and biscuit were good, but there were vinegar soaked watermelon cubes. Not too sure what's that about because it feels like you're chewing vinegar. It wasn't pleasant at all and the menu doesn't mention the vinegar hell the watermelon will bring you toOverall just not worth it.",2.0
"Excellent dishes for the most part, price was just right and the wine was good. Service was nice and fast- I mean the dishes came out one after another boom boom boom, could barely keep up. Waitress was knowledgable of all dishes, wine and sensitive/catering to the pregnant person in our party with a lot of allergies. Knocked off star because not all the plates were excellent. I did the chef tasting- 50$ per person. Chef selection is 8 different tapas off the current menu. They are flexible- can tell them what you definitely want part of it and what you definitely don't (for example, I requested that chicken liver, foie gras, sweetbread and lamb tongue be kept off the chef selection- we were not feeling adventurous) you get a starter soup, 8 selections and then end with two desserts. Started with the butternut squash soup- tasted like a cinnamon curry soup. Was glad to have gotten a tiny cup of it. Anymore and I would've tired of it quickly. Interesting but I would never order again. Favorite was the crispy sweet and sour shrimp. Yum!! Light and crispy batter hugging a generous sized perfectly cooked shrimp. Flavors went off in the mouth. The sliders were excellent- but the fries not so much. The texture was fine but not very sweet for sweet potato fries, not sweet at all- and in sweet potato fries, I feel the sweetness is what makes it so special. Also, the sauce that it came with was kind of bland. Fried soft shell crab was great! Loved the sauce it came with and it was nice light and crispy. Would get this again. Scallops were tasty. Scallops are scallops- not much more to say. The beet dish we weren't thrilled with. Flavors came together nicely but nothing to rave about. Maybe I'm not just a beet person but I didn't think it was anything special. You would probably appreciate it if you really like beets. Otherwise, you can skip it. Chicken wings were ok. These are the kind of wings where it's just so saucy you end up with more thick gloppy sauce on your fingers than on the wing somehow. The sauce reminded me of general tsos chicken. Neither dessert was memorable.",4.0
"Came to Williamsburg for dessert and wanted a small bite to eat before so we came here. Picked 5 tapas for two people straight off the menu without influence from reviews or photos on Yelp even though I looked beforehand. We got the fall sushi, Icy blue mussels, tuna tartare, braised short rib sliders, and foie gras. The tuna tartare with fried eggplants were my favorite followed by the braised short rib sliders. I could've done without the icy blue mussels because they were a little too spicy for me and the mussels were really small. I also wasn't a big fan of the foie gras because it was a little too fatty and just tasted like a simple breakfast meal with the egg and potatoes. The fall sushi was not bad mainly because I love salmon and it came with seaweed salad and risotto which was nice. There are so many more dishes I want to try after looking at more pictures on Yelp and reading the reviews. When the dessert menu came, I wanted to get the bacon doughnuts but I wanted to save room for the dessert that brought us to Williamsburg so we passed but I truly regret it and will be coming back for those. Overall our dining experience was very pleasant. Our food came one dish after the other since it wasn't busy when we arrived and our waiter refilled our water at least 5 times without being asked to. We will definitely be back to try more of the tapas!-they also gave complementary butternut squash (I believe) soup to start and pineapple with lime juice at the end. Both were very good",5.0
"I've always noticed Traif listed on Yelp's Best of Brooklyn feature, so one day on a whim I randomly asked my friend if he wanted to try it with me. We ended up getting a reservation for a Sunday night, surprisingly easy to book only a few days before.The interior of the restaurant feels kind of like a bar - dark, low-key, and a little cramped. The kitchen is completely open though, and features this abstract, colorful mural that spans the ceiling. My friend and I spent a while debating whether or not the open kitchen was the only kitchen in the restaurant... it was as far as we could tell, which makes it extra impressive how they're able to produce so much amazing food in such a small space! There's a really nice-looking patio in the back of the restaurant too, but it was unfortunately full by the time we got there.The menu consists entirely of small plates, and our server explained to us that the items are listed from lightest to heaviest. The concept of Traif is best described as ""eclectic,"" and we took literally forever to decide what to order because everything looked so interesting.We ended up getting--1) Chilled mint and pea soup (amuse-bouche) - Incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day, though a bit heavy on the salt.2) Shannon's bacon fat focaccia - Came with a side of bacon marmalade and creamy buttermilk ricotta. The bacon marmalade was like a gritty, slightly sweet bacon paste, and paired so well with the focaccia. This was easily my favorite dish of the entire meal, and I normally don't even like bacon, so this is saying a lot!3) Dayboat scallops - Served with snap and English pea risotto. The scallops were perfectly seared and buttered, and came topped with capers and bits of tomato. The risotto was nice and creamy, the flavor of pea subtly there.4) Spicy bigeye tuna tartare - The tartare was served on top of slices of Japanese eggplant tempura and then drizzled with kecap manis (which I had to look up - apparently it's Indonesian sweet soy sauce.) Eaten together, they paired really well and tasted almost like Japanese curry. 5) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs - The glaze was amazing and incredibly sweet, but this was the only dish I didn't love. The meat itself was dry and not very tender. The strawberry slices thrown in were a nice touch, though.6) BBQ braised short rib sliders - The short rib was incredibly tender and juicy, and I easily polished off my slider in a couple of bites. The sweet potato fries with paprika aioli, served on the side, were also pretty good. This dish was another favorite of the night.7) Buttermilk panna cotta - This was also amazing. The panna cotta was incredibly milky and smooth, and got a good kick of flavor from the pool of Meyer lemon cream it was sitting in.8) Bacon doughnuts - Traif's famous doughnuts! The bacon flavor was surprisingly subtle - it was basically only in the bacon bits crumbled on top of the doughnuts. The coffee ice cream on the side was the perfect complement to the doughnuts.Our server presented us with complimentary pineapple with pomegranate sauce to end our meal. Having a piece of fruit was actually a really refreshing way to end our dinner, considering how much meat we'd just consumed.Conclusion: Dinner at Traif is easily one of the best meals I've had so far in New York, and I know I would come back in a heartbeat!",5.0

"Great overall restaurant. Have been eating all over Manhattan and BK for a while, including Traif 6 times. First, CONSISTENCY is key and they have nailed it every time. No need to repeat the reviews of the past, the menu has something from everyone. One of my trips was with Fiancé and myself, my mother, and grandmother, everyone went home thrilled. Second, FOIE GRAS, if for any reason at all to visit Traif. Consistency again, I have had this dish 6 times. That is what makes the menu amazing, you can always have your go to dish, along with some new experiences. I have had Foie in many, many, places and this is still my fav. Well may be a second to Jean-George NYC. Still this one won't run you an arm and a leg.Service is always on point.

"Been ages since I was last at Traif but still as indulgent as ever.   Whether its the seared foie or the sauteed sweetbreads, we never make it to dessert.  Dimly lit for romance and yet typical casual Williamsburg so its great for mellow catch up with a friend or date with a steady. A bit crazier now than when it originally opened thanks to the hordes gushing into brooklyn, desperate for a little 'cool' that has long off gone but we do brave back to visit a steadfast foodie stop like Traif.",4.0
"it is way too dark in here. when we first got in, it was dark, and it just got darker as the night went on. i know it sets some type of atmosphere, but i think it was a bit toooo dark. the food was really good though! 1. dayboat scallops - snap & english pea risotto, lemon-caper brown butter: MY FAVORITE!! this was DELICIOUS, and i don't even really like scallops. it was so tender and full of flavor. this is a must have dish if you eat at train.2. Baked Muenster Cheese - smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini: this was kind of like a 'artichoke dip' type dish, but the dip was muenster cheese with pieces of chorizo inside.  i'm not a huge fan of cheese, and the muenster cheese was super overwhelming.  but i learned to have a piece of crostini, put some cheese on, and then put the apple on top and eat; the apple helped cut back the strong cheese taste.3. Strawberry - cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs: tasted like ribs.. but the meat was very tender, slide right off!4. Berkshire Pork Belly - rhubarb, grapefruit, blackberries, sugar snaps: this was eh in my opinion. the pork belly was a bit too dry for my liking.5. Sauteed Broccoli Rabe - roasted portobella-truffle toast, fried egg: i didn't like this either. it was waaaaayyy too bitter for me. but if you take just a tiny bit of broccoli rabe, cut a slice of toast and egg, then eat it it's not too bad.6. Seared Foie - fingerlings, ham chips, sunny egg, maple, hot sauce: it was our first time trying foie gras and well, i don't think i'll ever eat it again.  the dish itself was very tasty and flavorful, but we didn't enjoy the texture of the foie gras, it was way too slimey. good to try though!the service is a little on the slower side, but i think it's because they want you to enjoy each dish, and rest as you go. we usually take 45 mins to an hour at restaurants but we were at traif for a little over 2 hours.be sure to make reservations as it gets quite busy!",4.0

It is worth granting at the size of the kitchen, then place in perceptive the quality of food in the end. Great for dates.ENJOYYXiXa is nothing to pass over, worth the try right down the block.",5.0
"Been ages since I was last at Traif but still as indulgent as ever.   Whether its the seared foie or the sauteed sweetbreads, we never make it to dessert.  Dimly lit for romance and yet typical casual Williamsburg so its great for mellow catch up with a friend or date with a steady. A bit crazier now than when it originally opened thanks to the hordes gushing into brooklyn, desperate for a little 'cool' that has long off gone but we do brave back to visit a steadfast foodie stop like Traif.",4.0
"it is way too dark in here. when we first got in, it was dark, and it just got darker as the night went on. i know it sets some type of atmosphere, but i think it was a bit toooo dark. the food was really good though! 1. dayboat scallops - snap & english pea risotto, lemon-caper brown butter: MY FAVORITE!! this was DELICIOUS, and i don't even really like scallops. it was so tender and full of flavor. this is a must have dish if you eat at train.2. Baked Muenster Cheese - smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini: this was kind of like a 'artichoke dip' type dish, but the dip was muenster cheese with pieces of chorizo inside.  i'm not a huge fan of cheese, and the muenster cheese was super overwhelming.  but i learned to have a piece of crostini, put some cheese on, and then put the apple on top and eat; the apple helped cut back the strong cheese taste.3. Strawberry - cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs: tasted like ribs.. but the meat was very tender, slide right off!4. Berkshire Pork Belly - rhubarb, grapefruit, blackberries, sugar snaps: this was eh in my opinion. the pork belly was a bit too dry for my liking.5. Sauteed Broccoli Rabe - roasted portobella-truffle toast, fried egg: i didn't like this either. it was waaaaayyy too bitter for me. but if you take just a tiny bit of broccoli rabe, cut a slice of toast and egg, then eat it it's not too bad.6. Seared Foie - fingerlings, ham chips, sunny egg, maple, hot sauce: it was our first time trying foie gras and well, i don't think i'll ever eat it again.  the dish itself was very tasty and flavorful, but we didn't enjoy the texture of the foie gras, it was way too slimey. good to try though!the service is a little on the slower side, but i think it's because they want you to enjoy each dish, and rest as you go. we usually take 45 mins to an hour at restaurants but we were at traif for a little over 2 hours.be sure to make reservations as it gets quite busy!",4.0
"Started off with a cold zucchini soup very flavorful, ordered 7 more dishes including pork belly, ribs, foie gras. I must say I was not impressed with the tapas. And even the most talked about dessert bacon doughnut was just MEH. It tasted like regular zeppole with bacon. For the price you pay you would think I would be full and satisfied but was disappointed. Definitely will not be back here",2.0
"My experience at Traif was good overall. The atmosphere was pleasant and the space is very cozy. And I enjoyed the meal, particularly the chopped chicken liver spread (SO good) and the bigeye tuna tartar. The mussels and burrata were also tasty, but I just wasn't particularly blown away by anything. I think that, based on all of the grand reviews I've read about Traif, I went in with pretty high expectations. Our waiter was also kind of cold, like we were an annoyance to him, so that kind of put a damper on my mood.",3.0
"The service and atmosphere was great.   The food, I think they just are trying to hard to be different.  Just not for me...  Sorry guys, good luck. BBQ ribs way to much sauceSome bone cut in half with some butter in the middle.  Sorry somethings are just not meant to be eaten  Sangria margarita-  I believe it should be one or the other.  Tacos were good but I think it had to much Cinnamon? or some kind of spice.  I have to say it was well cooked and prepared.  Can't say don't try it, it's got a unique taste that's just not for everyone.",2.0
"We headed in to Williamsburg with no plans, and started browsing Yelp for some delicious small plates. Guess what popped up?So we headed over, no reservations on a Friday nite at like 7:30, fingers crossed!We were graciously accommodated, and given a table for 2. Jenna, our server, was lovely. Smiling, bubbly, and full of suggestions. She guided me toward the tuna tartare, which was awesome. We ordered 4 savory plates, and 1 dessert. A few cocktails as well. Everything was spot-on. Only reason I didn't go 5 stars was because the food was not ""jaw-dropping"" good, and the portions were a tad small for the $$ (Yes, I know it's small plates, but even still...)So I'd say it was 4.5, which is what it currently stands at.I would return, and recommend!",4.0
"A prominent Yelper wrote that Traif was his favorite restaurant.  At the time, he reviewed 700 or 800 restaurants.  I wouldn't go as far to say this is my favorite restaurant, but it comes close.  And if I wanted to impress friends with the NYC culinary scene, it's hard to do better than Traif.Ambiance is dark, muted, and intimate.  The tables are not bumped up next to each other (a pet-peeve of mine) so you're not engaged in your neighbor's conversation.  Very date appropriate.  Another prominent Yelper said there was a TV (another pet peeve of mine).  Either it was missing or wasn't on, since I didn't notice it.The 2nd Yelper went on to say that while the food is delicious, it lacks subtlety, balance, and complexity.  I agree with this sentiment. Yes, the food is prepared with a dwarven mace rather than an elven bow.   Yes, the flavors are bold and apologetic.  Like a jpeg image where the color saturation is set to full to produce an almost cartoonish effect.  But it's a restaurant whose foundations are built on pork and shellfish.  You're not exactly coming here for subtlety.Service was perfect.  Our waitress was a bit flirty in a friendly way and very interactive.  Helpful in food selection.  Attentive despite the place being packed.Food style is tapas.  The dishes are small and easily shareable.  I think it works best if you're 3 or 4 people.  More than 4 and some of the dishes will have to be cut a bit too small.  Less than 3 and it becomes less of a tapas sized serving.  I went with my cuñado and my wife.  We ordered 8 dishes.  I entered a food coma at dish 6 and couldn't eat the last two dishes.  The best strategy is to order 2 dishes per person and then order as you go from there.Hampshire Pork Belly: AThe perfect pork belly.  Presented beautifully which belies the fact that you're eating delicious fatty pork fatmeatfat.  If you like greasy fatty pork belly, this is it, but served as a gourmet looking dish.  Served with a salsa of tomato, leek, sugar snaps, asiago, cheddar, and bacon.  Yes, Virginia.  There's bacon crumbled onto the pork belly.  It's the 8th wonder of the world and the bane of the pig world.Strawberry Cinnamon Baby Back Ribs: AThe glaze was a hair sweeter than I like, but the meat was soft enough to be cut easily with a fork and expertly cooked.  The meat has a great sear due to the caramelized strawberry sugars.Short-Rib Sliders: AThese are great pulled pork sliders.  My brother-in-law is Cuban/Honduran, and said that this was better than any Cuban pulled pork we could think of.  The bread was as soft as an angel's butt.  Comes with sweet potato fries (perhaps fried in bacon fat?) and a smoked paprika aioli (like a chipotle).  PROTIP: You're supposed to use the aioli with the fries, but it goes FANTASTICALLY on the sliders as well!!!Pork Cheeks: ASoft and fatty.  Served on a bed of grain I couldn't identify, a starchy vegetable I couldn't identify, and dolops of green lentil soup.Bacon Fat Focaccia: BThe only thing on the menu I didn't love.  Matteo R. said the food was cooked without subtlety or balance.  I agree somewhat, and this is what happens when you do that.  This dish would be great in another context, but next to such larger than life dishes of pure sweet pork indulgence, it seemed very plain.  PROTIP: Skip this one.  It's great, but you have so many other things to try!Broccoli Rabe: A-Cooked in bacon grease.  The chef was able to cook it to the point of being very soft but still very broccoli rabe flavored.Spring Cassoulet: BGood, but not on par with the other dishes.  Sausages were a bit plain.  Good polenta, though.Dayboat Scallops: A+Served on a bed of snap & english pea risotto and topped with a lemon-caper brown butter and a tomato chive salsa.  As an ex-physicist researcher, I'm intelligent enough to (mostly) stay away from works like ""the most"" or ""the least"" or ""the best/worst"", but I will make an exception here.  This was the best scallop dish I've ever had anywhere.  It was the most expertly cooked, most expertly presented scallops.  Anywhere.  This blows away any seafood restaurant I've been to in NY, SF, DC, or Tokyo.Braided Bread: AServed gratis.  A delicious braided bread, soft and warm, served with a ricotta spread and a bacon/bacon bit marmalade.  PROTIP: This is nice to start your meal with.Keylime Pie: AI didn't care for the pineapple marmalade, but the dollop of cream was a beautiful addition.  The pie itself was perfect as was the graham crust.Bacon Doughnuts: ASweet bacon glaze with bacon crumbles on a perfect doughnut.  PROTIP: You'll be sorry if you don't get this.Coffee: ANo espresso, but the coffee is marvelous.  It's oddly difficult finding good coffee at NYC restaurants.",5.0
"I dined at Traif almost exactly a year ago, (jan24, 2015) and I haven't had a more memorable restaurant experience since, excluding long an & eagle (but come on, that's a Michelin star gastro pub) I dined at Traif a while ago but I can still remember how good the buffalo frog legs were, and how every dish that came out was better than the last. I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday last year and we still remember that night as one of the best dates we've been on since we met. I would like to mention the fact that I was going to make a Yelp account just so I could praise this fine establishment. We arrived at 8 for an 8 o clock reservation. The hostesses told us there was a 20 minute wait, but we didn't have anything to do until 11:30 so we didn't mind. Once we were sat the manager (Katie) came over to our table and apologized to us for the wait fiasco and seemed sincerely apologetic. We told her that we were understanding and didn't mind. She wished my girlfriend a happy birthday and sent out two cups of free soup and two glasses of champagne on the house! We ordered 5 tapas style items off of the menu and left absolutely nothing for the dishwasher to clean! When it was time for dessert, I accidentally asked for menus and our waiter told me that I had ruined the surprise and that dessert was on its way. The manager, once again outdid herself by serving us the key lime pie that was driven in from New Jersey that morning along side an order of the bacon doughnuts. Traif, this all happened a year ago and I want to say that this night was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Kudos to the team that makes this place thrive! When I come back to Brooklyn, I will undoubtably come here.",5.0
"11+ course tasting menu for 50 bucks!!! What a bargain! You've seen the reviews- this restaurant is oh-so-good! The staff is super friendly and really cater to your every need.Keeping it short and to the point. We went for the tasting menu, and by the 7th item, I was so stuffed my dress needed to be unzipped, but I suffered through the remaining delicious items. They provide an amuse bouche, 9 savory courses, then 2 desserts and a pineapple bite to cleanse your palette at the end. My favorites were the tuna tartare served on a piece of eggplant tempura, the short rib sliders, head-on prawns, chopped liver, and of course those bacon donuts.TIP- on the weekends you may not be able to get the tasting menu for 2, they usually require 3 people minimum unless it is a slower day.",5.0
"Literally have no idea how the reviews are so good. Meatless sliders. Hardly any food on the plate. $15 for four ribs? What? The foie was okay, but it was served with one of those white carton eggs. Don't understand how foie gras could be served with caged eggs. One of the tuna pieces over the eggplant was frozen. $140 for 6 tiny portions? The salad was pathetic. Extremely disappointed and definitely do not recommend.",1.0
"I was here again last night, and again had a terrific meal. I went for their tasting menu. Some dishes were disappointingly the same as 18 months ago, but still qualitatively impeccable. This time it was 5 stars hands down. - Lentil soup: a sip of warm creamy nectar. - Apple greens w/ shaved blue cheese: a good preparation for the rest to come. - Pork belly: rich but not overwhelming.- Scallops w/ butternut squash over saffron risotto: delicious; truly a fantastic dish. - Short rib sliders w/ sweet potato fries: the best I've ever had; no kidding. - Ribs: the meat came off the bone just by looking at it, and the reduction was to die for. - Sweetbreads w/ artichokes: one of their best dishes; I couldn't get enough of it. - Tuna tartare over fried eggplant: a wonderful combination of 2 opposite tastes; yes, it worked. - Pesto pasta: rich and creamy; I wish the mushrooms had more flavor, but the dish was fabulous nonetheless. - Fried chicken w/ gravy on a biscuit: I'm not a lover of fried chicken, but this one was phenomenal; a bit sweet, and the gravy was wow. - Panna cotta: refreshing, but nothing to rave about. - Bacon donuts: the weak dish of the night; they weren't crunchy, and sure needed some type of filling; the ice cream helped, but I've had better ones. - Pineapple bite: a nice ending of an outstanding meal. All accompanied by an outstanding Malbec. Wow.",5.0

"WOW!!  That meal was amazing. The timing of everything was perfect, the drinks were delicious and our server was hilarious and very helpful!!We got the pork belly, short rib sliders, baked muenster cheese, broccoli rabe and paccheri.  Then ended with bacon donuts!! Because my friend didn't like coffee ice cream our awesome server brought us a side of chocolate pudding instead. Honestly it was hard to walk out of there but we couldn't stop eating because everything was on point. Favorite: short rib sliders, that came with sweet potato fries, PERFECT. A nice toast to the bun, great flavor from the meat. I would suggest getting 3-4 plates for 2 people, they suggest 5 but if you are even considering dessert (which you should because the donuts were out of this world, perfect blend of sweet and salty, not too bacon-y, just right!) then stick with 3-4. The service was very laid-back and attentive without being in your face. Perfect Brooklyn experience. Although they do change the menu frequently, I can almost guarantee whatever you order will be fantastic! This is a GREAT place to take someone you want to WOW with a good meal... or maybe impress on a date :) Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed. I can't wait to go again.",5.0

"I loved eating here. It was our first time here after hearing positive reviews from everybody we know, and it was to also celebrate our anniversary. I made reservations 4 weeks out and the process works like this... they don't pick up their phone till after 6, so you call them while they're in the middle of their packed and busy dinner service. You say you want a reservation, they put you on hold. They come back on and ask for date, time, name, and contact info. Then you're called back in around 20 minutes confirming your reservation. Simple enough but tedious. I forgot to write down the time of my reservation and I couldn't remember if the reservation was for 6:30 or 6:45. This was entirely my fault and it's no big deal since restaurants normally call 24-72 hours ahead of time to confirm that everything's all set. But they didn't call, so I called the day before. The person who picked up told me they'd have to call me back, and four hours later at 10pm I still hadn't heard anything and tried calling again. And instead of getting an answer I got a lecture about how the don't keep their reservation book downstairs and I was calling in the middle of service so I wasn't going to get an answer.  I understand it's a really small restaurant but for its level of popularity there could be a better reservation system. Whatever it happened, I can deal because the food and service that I received on the day of my dinner service was almost perfect and deserving of 5 stars. We arrived 15 minutes early but were seated right away, our server was new but friendly and the service went smoothly. We ordered five dishes and one dessert: the pork belly, chicken liver, pork cheeks, ribs, scallop risotto, and bacon dulce de leche donuts. The pork cheeks were uninspiring, and the pork belly was over cooked making it rather rough to eat. But the flavors were still there and good. The stars of the night for me were the scallops and donuts. The scallops were cooked lightly seared and perfect, with a squash risotto. They complemented well and I highly recommend this dish to everyone. Bacon dulce de leche donuts with cappuccino ice cream, speaks for itself. My partner is a big fan of cappuccino ice cream, didn't like the ice cream that much but I was in love.",5.0

My partner is a big fan of cappuccino ice cream, didn't like the ice cream that much but I was in love.",5.0
"Wow. We came here as a last minute decision due to the yelp reviews and weren't disappointed!We had 5 dishes, including scallops on a butternut squash risotto, tuna tartar w/ japanese eggplant, lamb tenderloin, strawberry baby back ribs and broccoli rabe with toast fried egg with mushrooms... all delicious.Dessert we had the panna cotta which was excellent and ended the meal with bacon glazed donut with a coffee ice cream... possibly the best dish of the night.Well worth it. Waiter was attentive and approachable. Will come again, especially as their menu changes everyday.",5.0
"I'm not even sure where or how to begin singing the praises of Traif. The restaurant, whose name translates to ""unkosher"" in Yiddish , has long been a staple in the Brooklyn dining scene. The cuisine it serves can't be described by the traditional genres; even Zagat is only able to place in the ""Eclectic"" and ""Small Plates"" categories. Regardless, one thing is for certain: The food served here is delicious.I'd been able to call in a few days beforehand to snag an 8PM dinner reservation; it goes without saying that these are pretty much necessary to guarantee a seating. On the planned day, we took a stroll on the Williamsburg Bridge and arrived at the inconspicuous entrance of Traif. The interior is fairly simple and cozy; tables are lined in two rows opposite the bar area, each set with a small candle for ambiance. As we were a little early for our reservation, we started with drinks at the bar. The bartender was extremely friendly, despite having to juggle multiple roles at once. As I was sipping the glass of Cava Rose I had ordered, he skimmed through the menu for us, explaining how all the dishes were very seasonal and even changed on a daily basis. With some of his recommendations, we decided on our plates for the night.One: Glazed Confit Chicken Wings. The wings were covered in an ingenious savory-spicy sauce composed of hoisin, five spice, and sriracha, covering a wide spectrum of tastes. The chicken skin was crisp and not overly fried, the interior white meat still tender. The plate was served right out of the kitchen, so the chicken was still extremely hot; eat with care.Two: Hampshire Pork Belly, Hearts of Palm, Bacon, Artichoke, and Clementine. Once I saw pork belly on the menu, there was no doubt that I was going to order it. The pork belly was perfectly seared, the interior delightfully fatty and tender. It was complemented with small bacon bits, hearts of palm, and artichoke leaves, while the hint of clementine added a hint of sweetness. There are times I find myself craving this dish because it was -that- good.Three: White Asparagus with Burrata Cheese, Roasted Hazelnuts, and Black Truffles. It was the first time I had tried white asparagus and compared to its green counterpart, was much milder in flavor. The burrata cheese was creamy, hinting on sweet, and the additional texture from the hazelnuts and the hint of the black truffle flavor made for a surprisingly rich dish.Four: Salt and Pepper Shrimp with Cauliflower. While I was a little hesitant to try this dish, I eventually was grateful that my palate had expanded to include seafood. The seasoning on the shrimp wasn't too zealous, allowing us to get the actual taste of the shrimp in each bite. The cauliflower was lightly charred, giving a smoky edge to an otherwise bland vegetable. A spicy, sriracha-based sauce was a smart addition to this plate.Five: Barbecue Short Rib Sliders. The short rib was so tender that it was clear it had been braised for hours. I wish that the sauce that had been used was a little less sweet and a little more spicy, it was was nonetheless delicious and the ratio of filling to bread was just right. The sweet potato fries were just as satisfying; they were served warm, neatly seasoned, and paired well with the smoked paprika aioli they were served with.We couldn't go home without trying the famed Bacon Donuts, of course. We were presented with four small glazed doughnut holes, sprinkled with bacon bits, and finished off with a scoop of coffee ice cream. While I wasn't blown away by this concoction, I certainly see (and tasted) its appeal. It's a smart combination of sweet doughyness against the salty, savory bacon bites and definitely worth an order, especially on your first visit.I have no qualms declaring that Traif delivers the full dining experience: a warm and comfortable dining environment, knowledgeable and professional staff, and an eclectic, creative menu that brings out a variety of ingredients, tastes, and cooking styles. Dishes are very reasonably priced as well, which means that it's perfectly all right to put Traif on your regular restaurant rotation... which, trust me, I already have.",5.0
"Went here last night and it was amazing.  I sat at the bar and the bartender took great care of me and was very friendly and conversational.I trusted his recommendations and ordered the tuna tartare and the ribs.  I'll admit I was a bit skeptical of the strawberry cinnamon glaze, but these were amazing.  Yeah, it was a little bit heavy on the sauce, but the ribs were cooked perfectly-fall of the bone.  And i think the strawberry cinnamon glaze made the dish unique.  Now the tuna tartare was absolutely awesome.  I loved the crunch of the tempura and the slight heat of the tartare.  Honestly, I could eat that dish every day.  Despite being full, I had to order the bacon doughnuts.  I loved these.  They were nice, light little donuts.Hands down, I will be coming back next time I am in town.  The vibe, food, and service are on point.",5.0
"A restaurant with a creative menu and worth a trip to Williamsburg UNLESS YOU ARE A BIG GROUP, and in which case you should STAY AWAY.  We went there for a bachelorette dinner for our friend but did not have a pleasant experience with the restaurant. The food was enjoyable, but this really felt like a MONEY HUNGARY establishment, and people should be aware before coming here.  Be ready to be asked to pay even before you finish your dessert and be kicked out the moment you paid while being over charged service charge on your bill. ***message to management: service charge of 20% should be charged on the bill before tax, not after. They would NOT make you feel special for your special occasion.  First was difficulty with reservation. You need to give them your card to hold the reservation for your party and $50 each person will be charged if you don't show up.  This we understood since any popular restaurant would ask this to make sure they don't hold an empty table for no show guests.  And for a big group they offer a set menu, so you don't know what you are getting but they do ask you of any allergies. When we had two friends from out of town hoping to join us, the restaurant told us the maximum people they could hold would be 7 people, which was the number of people from our original reservation. Disappointed, but again, we understood.  After we got to the restaurant, we did not have a 7 people table but three table put together which usually accommodate 6.  They seated us to be squeezed at one side of table, 4 and 3 facing each other.  It was fine, we had enough room.  So they LIED... THEY TOTALLY COULD HAVE FITTED ONE MORE PERSON TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE since they managed to seat us as 4 and 3.  They could have fit 8, and the max certainly wasn't 7! When a few of us were running late for less than 5 minutes, our friends who got there first called us nervously on the phone and said if the rest of us can not make it there in 10 more minutes they will give away out table.  5 more minutes later, we all got there, no big deal.We sat down, and started our dinner.  Hot appetizers came before cold salad.  Food came before our drinks. It's okay, they are busy, no problem.  I received an cocktail with an BROKEN GLASS, and sent it back to the bar, but NO Apologies . There could have been a broken glass inside. No one gave me information on wether it was a replacement or they just poured the same drink into another glass. Our waitress was nice, until she kicked us out!  As a group of 7 we were charged with 20% after tax, which is WRONG!  You should only charge people on the food and drinks before tax, but not on the tax itself.  Noting the overcharge of $7, we still paid respectfully because we didn't want to seem rude to our host who made this reservation and our waitress was really nice.  And guess what? Our ""nice"" waitress came back, asking for 83 cents that's ""short"" from our total bill! 83 cents!!! Really??  We were shocked... but paid anyways despite the disgust.At that point, we had already been rushed to leave the restaurant and pay, twice because we were told they had taken a reservation after us.  We could have paid when we were ready, but instead paid even before we finished our dessert and drinks because the waitress sent the bill without us asking and asked us if we were ready just a few minutes after.  She clearly knew we didn't had time to check the bill because it had not been touched. The last dessert course came even after we paid our bill. What kind of restaurant does that? At that point, I had no appetite to try any more food.  Three of us decided to use the restroom before leaving and were lining up outside the only restroom they had. We were approached by the waitress, telling us we could use the restroom in their other restaurant which was 2 blocks away! Hummm? What?! You want us to go to another restaurant just to use the bathroom?? We said, no, thank you, we are okay.  At the time there were two other ladies waiting to use the restroom.  Our waitress then proceed to attend to other business and then turned back again, and told the same thing to the other two ladies.  To that point, I realized she didn't tell us that to save us the time of waiting on line but to get rid of us!! The whole table of us!! I was the second to use the restroom amongst the three of us.  After I was done, perhaps just 3 minutes after our conversation with the waitress, I notice our entire party standing up, and bus boy already clearing out our drinks while my friends were still managing to grab our stuff from the table. At that point, one of our friend told the waitress, "" you escorted us out! That is really not classy!""  And she was right!!! If they had waited 2 more minutes, we would have been on our way anyways! This is not a place that put the happiness of customers first! They want your money and after you paid, they kick you to the curb!!! Literally!!!",1.0

"Dined here for the first time for a celebratory dinner. I'd been to the sister restaurant Xixa for a yelp event and decided to give this place a try.Reservations are a bit of a hassle. You have to call during their evening hours, have someone take down your name, number, and reservation request, and then someone else calls you back the next day or two sometime during the hours of 2-5 to tell you what's available. Yeesh. Makes me appreciate OpenTable even more. The place was packed when we got there and super loud. I'm fine with the casual atmosphere but it was awkward being constantly bumped and squeezed past by servers and busboys. (Note: Try not to get the table right next to the serving area)Also, although I appreciate the intro to the menu as it was our first time at the place, lay off the hard sell. Our server kept pushing us to get 5-6 dishes for the two of us, but we held our ground and stuck with the 4 we chose. Result: We were STUFFED after those 4 dishes! (Moral of the story: Listen to your tummy, not your server)All complaining aside, the food is FANTASTIC. It's worth 5 stars on its own. We ordered the strawberry cinnamon baby back ribs, twisty beef fat bread, foie gras, and sweetbreads. The ribs were sticky, sweet, and oh-so-tender. It's a weird sounding combo, but the cinnamon and strawberry works great with the meat. The foie gras was buttery, fatty, and just all around gobble-worthy. The accompanying egg and potatoes were nice, but sort of extraneous. Great flavors with the maple syrup and hot sauce.    The twisty bread baked with beef fat came with ricotta and a meat marmalade. It was super filling and rich, but tasty. The veal sweetbreads were sooo good! So soft and tender. Loved the mushrooms and artichokes too.",4.0

We only had one pork dish (the pork belly), so I'd be curious to come back and hit up their top pork-dishes!",5.0

"The tuna tartare served on the fried eggplants was prime.The dessert, rum pudding, was what told me I must come back again.This place is kind of the equivalent to The Local Mission Eatery in The Mission - San Francisco.  It's just a little bit more edgier.A take away from five stars would probably be that no one who worked there seemed happy.  I work at a restaurant, and I know that when we dance, the customers dance.  These guys were all saying things under their breath, rolling their eyes... It was kind of strange to watch, because they WERE kind to customers...I do love the open kitchen & the bar tender was friendly, so that helped the atmosphere out.  Food was great, but I wish the energy was a little happier.I think this would be a great 3rd or 4th date place - nice enough to feel special, food is good enough to feel loved, and the tapas-style way here is great when you're just getting comfortable about sharing food.  (I don't like to share either, but at a tapas place, the more you share the more you taste ;)TIP: Sitting at the bar is awesome because of the open kitchen.  I would def recommend bar seats.  Also + they do a tasting plate for parties of 3 or more, so bring the whole gang and get to taste more food! Yum!",4.0
"The food is unique with many surprising flavor combinations. Service was good, helpful waitstaff. Large wine list and good cocktail menu. I would definitely come back...so much more on the menu to try! I highly recommend the rigatoni and the ribs, but you really can't go wrong.",4.0
"A fun evening of small bites. We were permitted to do the 9-course chef's tasting with only 2 people on a weeknight. With a few stated non-preferences up front the chef selected most of the menu items we were lusting after to begin with. The parade included tuna tartare, pork belly, baby back ribs and foie gras, all delectable. 9 courses plus a sweet potato soup amuse bouche and 2 desserts for $50/p. A wonderful culinary experience at a great price.",4.0
Our second visit to Traif and that's  saying a lot.  We don't give second chances to anyplace   It has to be good first time or we don't go back. The menu has changed a bit since last visit but everything is still great quality ingredients prepared correctly and presented nicely. Good prices for food and wine. This is a solid place !,4.0
Tasting menu is the way to go. Was great for a table of 4. Garden seating was solid. Friendly waitstaff. A few snacks compliments of the chef were thrown in. Even though its in BK.... overall I'd highly recommend.,5.0
"I've been to Traif twice and it's easily my favorite restaurant in New York. We've stuck to the less expensive plates and found the food to be unique and all around excellent. The only so-so dish we've had was a salad (don't remember which one). It was good, but nothing overly special.",5.0
"WOW! One of the best meals I've ever had. The food here is simply amazing. Very creative and executed perfectly. We had the strawberry-cinnamon baby backs, pork belly, tuna tartare and washed it all down with the life changing bacon donuts. I left feeling guity...While service was just okay, the food was just so incredible that I simply didn't care about anything thing else happening around me. I was tempted to ask our server to just bring us an entire repeat of what we just had, but I guess I'll wait and go back soon.",5.0
"Went here with a party of 4 for a birthday celebration, and the table opted in for the 9-course, $50 tasting menu. Really enjoyed the tapas-style way of serving for the table, though it seems that we got smaller portions with 4 people. I think odd numbers (3 people minimum, maybe 5 next time?) would make for the ideal tasting menu portioning!Favorites include the seared scallops with butternut squash risotto, tuna tartare, BBQ braised short rib sliders, and of course the bonus bacon doughnuts (which were fried to the EXACT bite and consistency you'd want in a doughnut).While it's a pork-centric eatery, we had one person in our party who doesn't eat pork, so our tasting menu leaned towards beef and seafood. We only had one pork dish (the pork belly), so I'd be curious to come back and hit up their top pork-dishes!",5.0
"Excellent food, we had the Chefs Tasting Menu for $50 (really reasonable, you get HEAPS of food including dessert). The vibe is really nice, waiters are lovely. Great date place. The Key Lime Pie? I died.",5.0
"Had dinner recently on a Sunday night Had some trouble finding the place even though we actually parked on the street where it was located. The signage is difficult to see at night : a friendly bystander pointed us in the right direction and I still walked past it once!No matter because the food experience was one of the best I've had Every item from the complementary soup to the beet salad, strawberry short ribs pork belly, mani mahi and cheese chorizo was perfect!For desert we had the bacon donuts: divine!!Wine selection was great and reasonably pricedOur waitress could have done with a bit more personality but the rest of the staff were really attentive and fantastic We can't wait to go back",5.0
"The tuna tartare served on the fried eggplants was prime.The dessert, rum pudding, was what told me I must come back again.This place is kind of the equivalent to The Local Mission Eatery in The Mission - San Francisco.  It's just a little bit more edgier.A take away from five stars would probably be that no one who worked there seemed happy.  I work at a restaurant, and I know that when we dance, the customers dance.  These guys were all saying things under their breath, rolling their eyes... It was kind of strange to watch, because they WERE kind to customers...I do love the open kitchen & the bar tender was friendly, so that helped the atmosphere out.  Food was great, but I wish the energy was a little happier.I think this would be a great 3rd or 4th date place - nice enough to feel special, food is good enough to feel loved, and the tapas-style way here is great when you're just getting comfortable about sharing food.  (I don't like to share either, but at a tapas place, the more you share the more you taste ;)TIP: Sitting at the bar is awesome because of the open kitchen.  I would def recommend bar seats.  Also + they do a tasting plate for parties of 3 or more, so bring the whole gang and get to taste more food!

"Debating between 3 or 4 stars since they fall in between but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Gave Traif a second try, and it was much better this time, definately came on their off day before... I wasn't as impressed as I hoped to be the first time. I felt like everything was just alright. The second time here was a friend's bday with 8 people and we were set up with a pre-fix for $55pp. You get 8 tapas, 2 per each side of the table, where we all get one whole piece to ourselves. Really filling and much more worth it... Plus they give you most of their top regular signature tapas! I still feel like it's a bit overhyped and over priced for a simple tapas joint with small portion. There's definitely way more better tapas joint in NY.Some of my more favored tapas I would order again from here:STRAWBERRY CINNAMON GLAZED RIBS - Awful & let down the first time. I remember this was the dish I was most excited for because everyone orders this, and c'mon it looked&sounded delicious. First time I had it, it was so hard and crunchy on the top. The ribs were not a bit tender at all that we had to yank it off the bone hard with our teeth. Second time, was a charm. It tasted much better and was more tender where you could just fork it off the bone... Now that's what in talking about, how ribs are suppose to be.DAYBOAT SCALLOPS - definitely the best dish out of all from the first&second time here. The scallops are good but they're whatever I've had better... But risotto is consistent! Makes the highlight of the dish, however I liked the first time risotto even better when it was a savory corn risotto!SPICY TUNA TARTARE OVER TEMPURA EGGPLANTS - mMm this probably comes second best.BRAISED SHORT RIB SLIDERS W/ SWEET POTATOES FRIES &SMOKED PAPRIKA AIOLI - My third favorite, short ribs are yummy and tender. Sweet potatoe fries are perfect accompaniment and that sauce is the best part, interesting and addicting... Soo good like CRACK.Least favorite tapas:Jumbo prawns cooked in foie gras fat- these shrimp weren't tiger shrimp. You could tell they weren't even fresh, but frozen. Can't tell at all it was cooked in foie gras either. Waste of $20. Rip off.Seared foie gras w/ sausage&sunny side eggs - SO MUCH OIL. I LOVE foie gras but this didn't cut it for me. The foie gras wasn't good, lower grade like foie gras. The combination on the plate didn't work with the foie gras for me either.Veal sweetbreads - the sweetbreads left a bad after taste stuck onto my tounge.**BTW BACON DOUGHNUTS A MUST GET & PANNA COTTA FOR DESSERT. HEAVEN. YUM",4.0
"$50 dollar adventurous chef's selection was out of this world.  We got the best of all the world... I am a big big fan of chopped liver... and I reallllllyyy loved it.  The bread, the drizzle, the ingredients in the liver--- were so perfect.  I can have that probably everyday.I got to have sweetbreads here for the first time.  Its got a very fatty consistency.  I actually didn't know what to expect.  But the gravy that it was served in was very delicious and full of savory-umami goodness.  I got to enjoy the bacon donuts and that really made the night remarkably full of bacon.  (I had the 'rude piggy cocktail' to start the night -- I think that's the name-- )Highly recommended for the service, food, and great establishment itself.",5.0
"Traif is the perfect date night alcove. The atmosphere is dark and enviable, only glistened by candlelight and kitchen beams. Space is limited, be sure to RSVP days in advance. And quite literally, physical space is limited as well, avoid bringing large items or bags with you.The tapas were very creative and equally tasteful. We tried the spicy big eye tuna, which was a tuna tartare served with fried eggplants. The eggplants were light and masked by the tuna and sauce. The fried soft shell crab was crusted to perfection with a few spices mixed into the flour, and quite frankly, I was contemplating a second order. The pork belly lived up to its name and fame, the meat was tender and juicy, breaking on your tongue at a delightful pace. Be sure to slow your inner stomach demons, the small serving disappeared very quickly. Lastly, be sure to leave room for the bacon doughnuts. The doughnuts are soaking in maple syrup and topped with caramelized bacon bits with coffee ice cream on the side. In hindsight, I should have ate everything slower, definitely try to slow your roll and take in all the mixed flavors and aromas.I would come again to try their drinks.",5.0
"One of the finer meals I've had in a very, very long time. The kind of meal that you continue to talk about for days on end. Fine dining these days IMO has taken a back seat for small plate establishments. The days of three course meals are over. Emerging from the scene are places like Traif, where laid back decor meets creativity, and tastes to wield any imagination. Tuna tartar - every establishment makes tuna tartar so it's all the same right? Wrong. With a crispy fried eggplant nestled underneath delicious tuna tartar. Combination of flavors are explosive and you'll want to eat it slowly to savor each bite. Pork Belly - this may be the best piece of mouthwatering, melt in your mouth pork belly I've ever eaten. So tender you can cut it with a spoon. Flavor is amazing. Escargot with sausage - good but not as epic as the pork belly. Short rib sliders - this was great. Remind me of Fetta Saus pulled pork sandwiches. Only this comes with sweet potato fries. The perfect combination. Scallops - surprisingly one of the lesser favorites. Bacon doughnuts for dessert. While I didn't taste too much bacon, the dulce de leche ice cream was a wonderful compliment. I must go back to try all the rest. Quail... Here I come.",5.0

"Don't you just love it when you go through all your pictures and you see more food than people? I do. Makes me salivate and hungry but I do.Is there anything Traif spews out that I won't like? I mean roasted bell pepper and carrot soup to start. I do not like bell pepper. Anything with bell pepper I immediately dismiss. I think the taste is just too overpowering. But I seriously didn't mind a shot of this soup. It was damn good. Certainly got me excited for my meal.Tuna tartare. Served on a fried battered eggplant. Again? I do not like eggplant either. Makes my throat itch. But I seriously didn't mind it with the tartare. It actually enhanced the tuna and I cannot eat it without the eggplant.Hampshire Pork Belly was melt in your mouth not in your hands goodness. Fatty? Yes. Just as I expect it to be. Soooooo good.Escargot with sausage and mushroom served with toast to soak up that sauce. 4 pieces of snail in the stew. The sausages and mushroom added to it oomph to it.Short rib sliders with sweet potato fries and smoked paprika aioli. Honestly, that aioli was good but the sliders and the sweet potato fries can stand on its own. Mad good.Scallops with lentil and pistachio. Really couldn't care for the lentils but the pistachio with the scallops worked well. For dessert of course we had the bacon doughnuts with dulce de leche. The bacon bits added crunch to the soft sweet doughnuts. And it's saltiness complemented the ice cream with the doughnuts. Love it!If you ask me what my least favorite is, it would be the escargot and that's only because I had to choose. Traif is a must for everyone.",5.0

"Had somewhat of a disastrous meal at Traif. A large party should not dine here. Let me explain. To begin with, before even arriving we had been warned over the phone that we would have the table for exactly two hours only.We arrived for dinner and sat down and the waitress seemed friendly. That is until my aunt asked if any dishes could be specially made gluten free. The waitress's attitude went from funny and smiley to quite hostile, alerting her that that was absolutely not possible - they could not change ANY of the dishes. That immediately made the mood go sour.Next, we were given the option of ordering a la carte or the chefs selection ($50 per person). We thought that the chefs selection sounded like a bit too much food and went with a la carte ordering 14 tapas dishes for 7 people. I understand that the plates are all tapas style but one dish came out immediately (scallops with risotto...not the salads or cheese we had hoped would arrive first) and then we waited 15 minutes for any other dishes to come our way. Um...one tiny dish for seven people?? Obviously not enough. Absolutely ridiculous! The scallops were consumed and then we waited and waited...and waited. Next a salad came. And nothing else...again. We asked the waitress what was going on and her curt response was ""I told you you should have ordered the chefs selection.""This restaurant absolutely does not work for large parties. The timing was totally absurd although I could see how for two people it would have been lovely. Eventually our other plates did start coming at a faster pace, which we were relieved about. At the end of the meal, which did NOT warrant a 20% tip in the slightest, we noticed that the gratuity had been added since we were over 6 people. However, 20% had been added on AFTER TAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Unbelievable.This restaurant is all about rules and they cannot seem to break any of them even slightly in order to please their guests.The only thing I can say that was positive was that the food was absolutely fantastic. We loved each dish and enjoyed the food greatly. The menu was extremely creative. It was unfortunate that the experience had to be marred by the service and timing.",2.0

"Walked up to Traif and thought it was closed, so I was giving my boyfriend the, what are we doing eye. Then a nice gentleman greeted us at the door and seated us in the back. It truly is a gem of a restaurant with small plates meant for sharing and adventurous chefs making the tastiest bites. I'm pretty sure the menu changes frequently but we had this wonderful short rib in a light red wine sauce with mushrooms and dates, and foie gras with toast points. Definitely get two of the foies next time.  Omg THE BACON DOUGHNUTS are amazing. I was a little worried they were going to be too sweet with the dolce de leche drizzled on top, but it was the perfect balance.  The drinks were a little sweet for me. I had the Red Pearl and something made with raspberries. I enjoyed the flavor profile but the sugar was too much. Just an fyi, they are not open on Mondays and the doors open at 6pm, so no lunch or brunch.  But with such fantastic food, who cares about Lunch and its second cousin, Brunch?",4.0
"Came for an every dinner at 6pm and was seated right away in the outdoor heated patio area. Nice comfortable, casual atmosphere. The place has a semi-chic, hipster air to it. Nothing spectacular but I like a nice chill dining experience regardless of where I go.They offer a chefs menu for groups of 3 or more for $45 per person. The chefs menu includes 8-10 savory dishes and 2 desserts portioned according to how many people you have. We were also allowed to choose two of our dishes specifically. If coming with a group, I'd recommend this option for the best value as this restaurant is made for sharing and many of the plates will not be properly proportioned for equal sharing. The chefs selection also includes pretty much all the most popular dishes on the menu (at least according to what I've read on yelp) so go for it.As far as the actual meal, I'm not going to name everything but my two favorite dishes were 1) Tuna Tartare over fried eggplant and 2) Short rib sliders with sweet potato fries. In that order. All the food was good. Felt like portions could be a little bigger and some things could have packed a bit more flavor, but overall a damn good meal.Service was friendly, knowledge, accommodating, and our waitress had a great sense of humor. Not issues there.I hear they change their menu often and would definitely wanna try this place again for newer menu items.",4.0
"This place seems ideal as a date night spot. It's best to reserve in advance but we got lucky with the Easter weekend. That being said, the food was quite good, but varied quite a bit. We had the tuna tartare, rib sliders, soft shell crab, foie gras and burrata. Every aspect of the foie gras was delicious and the burrata was very good. While the tuna tartare was great, we both felt it was a bit overpowered by the eggplant so you couldn't taste much of the tuna. The braised short rib sliders were good but I probably wouldn't order it again in the face of everything else available on the menu. The soft shell crab is their seasonal dish, but I found it didn't quite live up to the hype.The cocktails were fantastic, and actually pretty unique. I'm still a little perturbed by one of the cocktails using scotch being labelled Chinese, but we ordered a few of the Red Pearls and Rude Little Pigs. Both have very unique, balanced flavors, although I really loved the Red Pearl. I also love spicy liquor though, so I may be biased.",4.0
"Traif is phenomenal.  An absolute treat and well worth the money.  The small plates are lovingly and expertly prepared, and each time I've been, most dishes have blown away my friends and I.  I need to check this place out for brunch too.",5.0
"I came here on my birthday for dinner and really enjoyed my experience. The place itself is not as spacious as I imagined it. While I enjoyed the food, I think the place is a little overrated. Their cuisine is ""New American"" which I've become a big fan of. The menu is a bit overwhelming with its essay-type format on one sheet of paper. Also, keep in mind everything is tapas style and can be shared. My boyfriend's favorite dish was the Venison. I enjoyed it as well. The Pomegranate Ribs with cinnamon-strawberry glaze was another favorite for us. My least favorite dish was the Baked Muenster cheese. It was overly salty. The pork belly was yummy. The drinks were on point. I had the Cabin Fever which was very strong! For dessert we tried the bacon donuts that came with coffee ice cream. It was interesting... I will probably return here at some point. The cuisine was very creative but I wish their menu was organized better. I enjoyed my experience here although I was not blown away. Perhaps bc I had such high expectations. However, I would totally recommend this place to anyone..",4.0
"Just to let you know what kind of people are running this place...Made a reservation for my birthday, thought it would be fun to invite my aunt along. At the last minute, she couldn't make it. Rather than adjusting the reservation, Traif could't find a way to seat me and my fiancé. They turned me out on my birthday. Thanks guys. That one extra customer that didn't make the reservation cost you at least, what, $40 in profit? Totally worth screwing someone over on their birthday, though. At least now we know exactly what your priorities are and how much your customers are worth to you.",1.0
"Wow. First of all make a reservation! This place is packed and I got there right when it opened, luckily we were able to get seats by the bar for three. Service was great, comfortable and it was fun being able to watch the chiefs as your foods are being made. Um three people I would recommend ordering at least 6 dishes plus a dessert. Their bacon donut is to die for! Wouldn't say it's too kids friendly, but it's great place for friends to hang out or for a date.",5.0
"The food at Traif is great. Apart from the fact that the coffee ice cream served with our portion of the legendary bacon caramel donuts had refrozen, giving it that unpleasantly icy texture, every aspect of the food was perfect. Fun cocktails, too.But from the moment we stepped through the door we felt hurried and rushed. We had conscientious, knowledgeable servers, but they continually pressed us to make decisions and to choose more plates whenever we said we wanted to take a few minutes to decide. I appreciate that on a Saturday night they need to keep things moving, but it was an unpleasant detraction from an otherwise very pleasant evening.",4.0
"Schedule this for bi-annual ""look how chic and bad-ass I am"" out-of-town impress your friends dinners. It's totally worth coming back to since the menu will likely have totally changed in 6 months. They have a very solid wine list if you wanna go that extra mile.Be sure to come at off hours to get that coveted table, so as not to actually come across as a loser hoping to get a glimpse.",5.0
"Probably among one of my favourite meals in NY. Ordered a few different plates including mussels, pork belly, spicy shrimp.  Waiter persuaded us to order 5 dishes but we felt 4 would have been more than enough and left a bit stuffed.",4.0
"Walked up to Traif and thought it was closed, so I was giving my boyfriend the, what are we doing eye. Then a nice gentleman greeted us at the door and seated us in the back. It truly is a gem of a restaurant with small plates meant for sharing and adventurous chefs making the tastiest bites. I'm pretty sure the menu changes frequently but we had this wonderful short rib in a light red wine sauce with mushrooms and dates, and foie gras with toast points. Definitely get two of the foies next time.  Omg THE BACON DOUGHNUTS are amazing. I was a little worried they were going to be too sweet with the dolce de leche drizzled on top, but it was the perfect balance.  The drinks were a little sweet for me. I had the Red Pearl and something made with raspberries. I enjoyed the flavor profile but the sugar was too much. Just an fyi, they are not open on Mondays and the doors open at 6pm, so no lunch or brunch.  But with such fantastic food, who cares about Lunch and its second cousin, Brunch?",4.0
"Came for an every dinner at 6pm and was seated right away in the outdoor heated patio area. Nice comfortable, casual atmosphere. The place has a semi-chic, hipster air to it. Nothing spectacular but I like a nice chill dining experience regardless of where I go.They offer a chefs menu for groups of 3 or more for $45 per person. The chefs menu includes 8-10 savory dishes and 2 desserts portioned according to how many people you have. We were also allowed to choose two of our dishes specifically. If coming with a group, I'd recommend this option for the best value as this restaurant is made for sharing and many of the plates will not be properly proportioned for equal sharing. The chefs selection also includes pretty much all the most popular dishes on the menu (at least according to what I've read on yelp) so go for it.As far as the actual meal, I'm not going to name everything but my two favorite dishes were 1) Tuna Tartare over fried eggplant and 2) Short rib sliders with sweet potato fries. In that order. All the food was good. Felt like portions could be a little bigger and some things could have packed a bit more flavor, but overall a damn good meal.Service was friendly, knowledge, accommodating, and our waitress had a great sense of humor. Not issues there.I hear they change their menu often and would definitely wanna try this place again for newer menu items.",4.0
"This place seems ideal as a date night spot. It's best to reserve in advance but we got lucky with the Easter weekend. That being said, the food was quite good, but varied quite a bit. We had the tuna tartare, rib sliders, soft shell crab, foie gras and burrata. Every aspect of the foie gras was delicious and the burrata was very good. While the tuna tartare was great, we both felt it was a bit overpowered by the eggplant so you couldn't taste much of the tuna. The braised short rib sliders were good but I probably wouldn't order it again in the face of everything else available on the menu. The soft shell crab is their seasonal dish, but I found it didn't quite live up to the hype.The cocktails were fantastic, and actually pretty unique. I'm still a little perturbed by one of the cocktails using scotch being labelled Chinese, but we ordered a few of the Red Pearls and Rude Little Pigs. Both have very unique, balanced flavors, although I really loved the Red Pearl. I also love spicy liquor though, so I may be biased.",4.0
"Traif is phenomenal.  An absolute treat and well worth the money.  The small plates are lovingly and expertly prepared, and each time I've been, most dishes have blown away my friends and I.  I need to check this place out for brunch too.",5.0

"I have bookmarked Traif ever since I started yelping - after months and months of trying and rescheduling - my fiance and I finally found a perfect weekend that we and his friends were able to have our long overdue double date. My fiance called about 2 weeks in advance to reserve our table for 4. It took a bit of going back and forth since we were only able to leave a voicemail and they called back also left a voicemail to confirm that our reservation was set.  On the night of our dinner date, we arrived around 6:30 and were seated immediately. Upon entering, we were surprised by how small the restaurant was and that all the food was actually prepared right behind the counter. The place smelled amazing and I could hardly wait! Our sweet waitress soon came over to welcome us and explained the menu. We knew we were going for the tasting before they even handed us the menu so we wasted no time. Let's say the food came out in lightning speed - Within 5 mins, our first 3 courses were served and 2 more were followed soon after! The food just came on coming - the only true pause was between the shrimp and sliders. Although the food seemed to coming out in an unnaturally non pre-made speed - everything tasted fresh, amazing, and piping hot - definitely were not sitting around.  1. Sweet potato soup - not your typical SWEET soup - there was a hint of cinnamon - first sip, I was surprised by the ""saltiness"",  since i prefer sweet soup I was a bit disappointed.2. Broccoli + cheese + pistachio - I love the broccoli puree (reminded me a lot of your typical Mediterranean dip), the cheese was house made - melt in your mouth GOOD. Not your typical store brought rubbery mozzarella cheese.  3. Tuna Tartare on Fried Eggplant - the best dish of the night - FRESH tuna + crispy tempura style fried eggplant - AMAZING. I would not mind if all 12 courses were this tuna tartare... 4,. Skate cheek - We couldn't hear what the waitress was saying when she was explaining this dish. Our friend thought it was cheese, my fiance thought it was crab cake. After noticing how confused we looked, our sweet waitress came back over to explain once more. It did tasted very much like crab cake. Lightly fried with a juicy meaty inside - simply delish. 5. Pan seared Scallop - my second fav of the night - LOVED the squash sauce and the bed of lentil under. Seared to perfection.6. Strawberry ribs - the meat on the ribs was soooo well cooked. We had a difficult time forking it over to our plate without the meat falling right off the bone. Wished the waitress/servers weren't so on point with the service - they literally take the plates as soon as they appear empty - I wanted to dip my ribs back into the sauce!!! 7. Pork belly - I usually don't eat pork belly (just fat in my mouth doesn't sound delicious) but these fats in my mouth was a different story. It really just dissolved as soon as I bit down. The piece of peach slice on top cut the ""fatty-ness""  taste. So good 8.  Shrimp with bread - the least impressive dish of the night - the shrimp was fresh but nothing outstanding about it. They poured a bit of the shrimp sauce over the bread - not a fan of the sauce. But the bread was every reason why i LOVE carb9. Pork Sliders with sweet potato fries - these pork sliders were nothing we'd ever tasted before. The flavor was indescribable - let's just say AH-MAZING. loved the sweet potato fries and paprika aioli they paired with. Wished it was a burger not a slider.  10. Escargot, sausage, mushroom  in red wine - loved the toast it paired with - if only they gave us a basket of it because there was so much red wine sauce left over! A comfort, unique dish - always love escargot! 11. Key lime pie - my fiance and I loved the graham cracker crust + the light house made whipped creme on top! The keylime wasn't overly sour or sweet. The chopped up mango pieces complimented it so well!12. Bacon donuts + coffee ice cream - our friend was dying to try the bacon donut before leaving. Sweet and savory all in one bite. I'm not a big bacon person so I would actually prefer my donut without the bacon pieces. The coffee ice cream helped cut the donut sweetness a bit which was the  perfect balance. Not a coffee flavored anything person but the ice cream was damn good. Amazing service + food + a real bargain (where else can you get 12 amazing dishes - for 45 dollar pp?). We left impressed + extremely satisfied. Can't be any happier! We are already looking into trying the sister restaurant, Xixa - for our second double date!",5.0

I headed to the restaurant with high hopes and an empty stomach!I decided to have a beer and ordered a variety that the server recommended: Stiegl. It was nice and light and also paired well with the meal. We began the meal with a carrot soup from the chef - very yummy! We also split several dishes. My favorite dishes were the tuna tartare, pork sliders, ribs and doughnuts. The tuna was served on fried eggplant which was a unique presentation and really added to the flavor. Both of the pork dishes were so good! The ribs were exquisite! Who would have thought strawberry cinnamon would be so yummy! Other items we ordered that didn't really impress me were the peach salad, burrata, chorizo spread and risotto. Overall, the meal was good...not great. Although there were several standout dishes, I would note that EVERY DISH at Xixa was a knockout. You simply must go to Xixa.",3.0
"Traif is an unkosher gem in a historic Jewish neighborhood, and their bathroom similarly breaks with tradition to provide a solid experience on the pot. You enter and your eyes are dazzled by the fantastically frenetic paint accents contrasting against the black walls. The toilet is of course a creamy shade of pig-skin pink, and the industrial accents of the soap dispenser and sink are nice touches. Upon further examination, additional appreciated features include an awesome De-Stijl painted ceiling, an artsy framed photo of the brooklyn bridge, and a glass block window. The window requires an explanation. Typically, you would think a bathroom window would face outdoors. But no, this one is at waist level inside the bathroom and dead level with some unsuspecting diner's head inside the restaurant. Which means when you're standing with your trousers down, your private piglet and his head are at the same level. It's a little unnerving trying to do your business in such tense scenarios, to say the least. Thank goodness the glass is frosted. Another item that irks me is the low-riding sink faucet. It's a wonderful steel sink with a classy basin. But there exists only 3 inches of clearance betwixt the faucet and drain! This guarantees that while scrubbing your hands after hogging down some wonderfully messy pork ribs, you will indubitably accidentally brush either the under-side of the faucet or the basin itself. That really twists my tail. Overall it was a good bathroom experience in a great restaurant, but if you wanna get the blue ribbon you gotta have the fattest boar at the fair, am I right?Do yourself a favor and try the bacon doughnut.",4.0
"Simply, one of the best food experiences in Brooklyn. I'm a huge fan of creative dishes and flavors that work well together. Traif executes this extremely well. Although the menu selection changes from time to time, some plates have become quite standard... A few things we tried were the short rib sliders, bacon doughnuts (with THAT ice cream!), broccoli rabe/egg/toast & scallops. They're all making my mouth water as I write this. Oh, also keep in mind, Traif's style is small plates - one of my favorite ways to indulge. On top of the food being excellent, the service was also great. Ambiance is a dimly lit dining area... Very sexy to go along with that sexy-ass food Traif creates. Get it.",5.0

"Why 4 stars? Because it was a hipster haven, hold the 'tude!   ---   ---   ---The most impressive thing to me about Traif, was that it had every excuse to consist of angry hipster employees... but the customer service was more like what you'd expect at The Capital Grille or something.We showed up in a group of 6, and were waiting on one more to arrive. Traif is relatively on the quieter side of restaurants, which made it awkward/hilarious when our 7th friend showed up loud, annoyed, and wet. He had gotten lost on the way, and it was raining... so he was loving life. He was loudly complaining about the restaurant, as a server was standing right behind him waiting to greet him with a menu. Classic sitcom stuff. Deja-vu that moment, as he was looking over the menu, complaining about its weirdness, as the server had walked back to take our order.But for the rest of us... we just mass-ordered these small plates and went to town on them. From what I can remember, we ordered the bbq braised short rib sliders, seared foie, sauted veal sweetbreads, and the coffee ice cream and bacon doughnuts. There was by far more, but that's what I have pictures of.Some things were phenomenal, some were ok... but I couldn't believe how friendly the employees were.

"We arrived at Traif on Saturday, December 27, 2014 at 7 PM. Williamsburg was extremely quiet  as I imagine most of the residents returned to their true homes for the holidays. We were dressed up as it was my girlfriend's birthday.I parked about a half block away. When we went inside we were greeted by a very pretentious male host. He stared at us for a second and asked if we had reservations to dine with them tonight. I said we did not have reservations.The restaurant was 80% empty. There were probably 3 tables that had guests dining. The host had the nerve to tell us they could not accommodate us and he had to check but he might have had a seat at the bar because it gets pretty busy on weekends.My girlfriend and I looked at each other and walked out. How can an empty restaurant refuse service. We walked by a half hour later and the restaurant was still dead. I could understand if it was a busy night but clearly it was a holiday weekend and the neighborhood was quiet. I really wanted to try the food here and I am very upset that we were basically refused. We returned to our car and 5 mins later we found a restaurant in Manhattan.",1.0
"This is the first restaurant I've ever trusted everything to be stellar.

"This place is amazing beyond words. Top 5 meals of my entire life.This is where my fiancé brought his sister for her birthday, so I got to tag along and I'm glad I did. We had a reservation, but were seated immediately and the place was at a lull. It's quickly filled up, and after the meal, I understood why. The service was incredible. No more than 2 plates on the table at a time, water glasses always full, and never more than 5 minutes in between dishes being brought to the table. The three of us decided to pick 9 different dishes. They were all amazing, but there were obvious stand-outs.1. Spicy big-eye tuna tartar over tempura Japanese eggplant. Delicious and well thought out. A little too spicy for my taste, but the eggplant was great. 2. Salt and pepper shrimp. Delectable! Shrimp were perfectly cooked and the accompaniments were tasty.3. Pork belly. Yummy! Some of the best pork belly I've ever had.4. Baked muenster cheese. Addicting. Velvety, melty, gooey cheese. How could you go wrong? 5. Short rib slider. So good! A little spicy, but the Gouda cheese paired well with it. The sweet potato fries were incredible as was the aioli paired with the dish.6. Scallops. The scallops were perfectly cooked, but I wasn't crazy about the items it was paired with. 7. Sweetbreads. Oh my god. They were amazing. Best I have ever had and it's made me want to try them at different places to see how they'll measure up.8. Foie gras. Holy living God. Best dish of the night. The maple and hot sauce went together perfectly. Egg cooked perfectly and the potatoes were delicious.9. Bacon donuts. They're as good as they sound. I, personally, think the coffee ice cream was a little overpowering, but it was still good.Food was great, service was great, and prices were great. What more do you want? If you're looking for a serious meal for the right price, this is it. I encourage bringing more people with you, so you can try more things!",5.0
"Traif is one of my favorites and I'm glad I decided to venture out to Brooklyn just to give this place a go.I would recommend making reservations. I think I made mine 2-3 weeks in advance and only 630 and 945 were available for a Saturday night. The woman who took my reservation was very pleasant.Where do I begin...FOODTuna tartare $10: the tuna tartare was served on tempura battered eggplant. This made vegetable tempura at some Japanese restaurants I've been to go to shame. This came with 4 on the plate.Dayboat Scallops with Risotto $22: If I was in the privacy of my own home, I would've licked every last drop from that plate. Best scallops I've had so far and the risotto was cooked to perfection. Two difficult ingredients to cook and they somehow made it the most delicious thing ever. For two people this plate came with 4 scallops on top of the risotto. Broccoli rabe $14: with portobello mushroom, fried egg, truffle toast, and aged asiago. The truffle was a nice touch and the egg was made with just the right amount of salt and pepper. Squid ink with edamame $16: it was a toss up between this dish and the scallops for my favorite of the night. This was cooked to perfection. Even the edamame was done perfectly with no hint of being undercooked. Braised BBQ pork sliders $10: these were tiny and it was one slider per person. Nonetheless, one was enough. The pork was well seasoned and marinated in the sauce. The dish came with sweet potato fries that paired with a tasty dipping sauce: smoked paprika aioli, which I also put on the sliders- yum!Pork belly, bacon, peas, cauliflower, and mango $12: unique dish. flavors of the ingredients blended very well. Bacon doughnuts $7: even though I was stuffed I had to try the famous bacon doughnuts. This came with 4 mini almost spoon size doughnuts topped with bacon bits. On the side was coffee ice cream with bacon bits. Coffee and bacon... Yum. On the house pineapple with pomegranate sauce. 3 drinks, 6 dishes, 1 dessert came out to $135.Food came out a plate at a time with just the right amount of intermission between each.SERVICE Our server was Rebecca. She was great: friendly, knowledgable, sociable, and frequently checked in to see how we were doing. Even though the restaurant was tightly packed, everyone who worked there did so like an orchestra - harmoniously. My glass of water never went below the halfway mark. Empty plates were always cleared away to prepare us for the next. AMBIENCE It was pretty dark inside with most of the lighting coming from the bar/kitchen area and the Christmas light decoration in the back of the room. Each table had a candle. The place got pretty loud, so don't expect a quiet and intimate evening.",5.0
"Make sure you make a reservation and try to arrive on time. When we arrived a couple walked in without a reservation, they were turned away. If you want to do the tasting menu, make sure you have a party of 3 or more. I ate their with my wife and we couldn't do the tasting menu, however the waiter recommended some dishes that mimic the tasting menu.  The place is not remarkable and not a super big place and we walked right pass the restaurant without noticing it. It is not a very big place and their is a outdoor area, but in the winter it is covered and you will get more lighting than seating inside.We ordered the Roasted beets, Foie Gras, seared scallops, Tuna tartare, and BBQ braised short rib sliders. The dishes were all very tasty.Over time and as the place has become more popular, it will gets harder to get a reservation and the price of the tasting menu has increased.A note about their website, it hasn't been updated for years and the menu posted on the site is soo outdated.Overall we enjoyed this place and enjoyed making the trip out to Brooklyn for a nice evening meal.",4.0
"Traif, meaning un-kosher, specializing in pork products and shellfish, and it is right on the edge of a very Hasidic neighborhood. They get five stars for the irony alone. But it doesn't stop there. Our group went around 8:30 on a Wednesday night and i was surprised that it was packed full. Once I tried the food I understood why. The space is cozy and dimly lit by soft lighting and candles. The crowd was young and energetic. Our waitress appeared right away to welcome us and take our drink order. They serve small plates that are meant for sharing so we were able to try a huge array of their offerings. Salt and pepper shrimp, pulled pork sliders, bacon wrapped blue cheese, dayboat scallops, and more! The food was absolutely amazing. The wait staff was extremely attentive, I never had to fill my own glass of wine, and the plates of food came out with expert pace, ensuring everything we ate was fresh and hot out of the kitchen. I will definitely be back again, and again, and again.",5.0
"Went here for my birthday this week and it totally lived up to the hype. My bf and I got the tasting menu and every dish was so delish and well- balanced. It also seemed like the food just kept coming and coming! By the time dessert came we were good but couldn't pass up another delectable bite! The drinks, too... amazing. And a shout out to Jenna and the team for such great service!",5.0
"The food is great and that's really where my heart lies at.  It's a little busy in there so you won't get the most attentive service, but you will get respectful energy from the staff.  This is the perfect place to have a glass of wine/champagne and small interesting meals. The service could of been better but it's kind of hard for perfect service at a very busy location.  The complimentary samples and the politeness made up for it.",5.0
"If you're an adventurous eater, do yourself a favor and trust the chef's tasting. From the best tartare I've ever had atop fried eggplant, to strawberry-infused ribs, it's the best spot for a special occasion in Brooklyn.",5.0
"Why 4 stars? Because it was a hipster haven, hold the 'tude!   ---   ---   ---The most impressive thing to me about Traif, was that it had every excuse to consist of angry hipster employees... but the customer service was more like what you'd expect at The Capital Grille or something.We showed up in a group of 6, and were waiting on one more to arrive. Traif is relatively on the quieter side of restaurants, which made it awkward/hilarious when our 7th friend showed up loud, annoyed, and wet. He had gotten lost on the way, and it was raining... so he was loving life. He was loudly complaining about the restaurant, as a server was standing right behind him waiting to greet him with a menu. Classic sitcom stuff. Deja-vu that moment, as he was looking over the menu, complaining about its weirdness, as the server had walked back to take our order.But for the rest of us... we just mass-ordered these small plates and went to town on them. From what I can remember, we ordered the bbq braised short rib sliders, seared foie, sauted veal sweetbreads, and the coffee ice cream and bacon doughnuts. There was by far more, but that's what I have pictures of.Some things were phenomenal, some were ok... but I couldn't believe how friendly the employees were.

"This is def a cute spot to take your date or for a night out. Similarly, Traif resembles Salt & Fat in LIC with the tapas concept. For a table of 2, it's normally recommended btwn 4-5 dishes, if you're extremely hungry then go for 5-6 according to our server. Keep in mind though the dishes don't come cheap. The pink prawns is their most expensive item with the salads & fruits as the least expensive item on the menu. Typically, you're spending about $70+ btwn two ppl (not incl. drinks).

It left a bitter taste that did not go well with the donuts. Not too crazy about it. The key lime on the other hand was much better. It was tarty balanced well with the pineapple sauce and a vanilla bean type of mousse. Their tapas did have a creative flair in addition to distinct flavors and ingredients. And, they offer a great wine selection in addition to cocktails and beers. We also got to try their gazpacho and a glazed pineapple muse. Our server was friendly. I had the moijito that was just perfect. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll return unless the menu or tapas improved significantly to justify their prices.

"A close friend had rave review of this place and so on her birthday, we came here with  a party of about 10-11 to a prix fixe menu of small plates. They managed to accommodate our large group with a table near the door. It was a chilly night but my friend near didn't seem to mind too much, besides the constant opening of the door. I don't know if it was of any consequence but he got a nosebleed halfway through dinner.Everyone started off with a wine or cocktail off of Traif's extensive drink menu. We started off with an arugula salad. Pretty good, I noticed some feta cheese in it. Some of the more notable plates served had to have been the pork belly, braised beef sliders, seared scallops, and prawns. If you're looking into a prix fixe menu for your group, please please please try these, you will not regret it!The pork belly was my absolute favorite, I'm pretty sure I could've finished the whole plate meant for 3-4, by myself! It was literally melting in my mouth and it was everything good in the world combined, in that one dish. Unfortunately my friend next to me had a less than excellent experience with the pork belly. Just as she was exclaiming in joy over the goodness of it, she spit it out because, I couldn't believe it, but there was a screw in her portion, about 1 1/2 inches long. Funnily enough, this would happen to the person who has the most amusing reactions to anything ever, and I couldn't stop laughing. I felt so bad but at the same time, it was comedy. Our waitress came right over and assured us that this has never happened before, and quickly disposed of the screw. I'm glad nothing more serious happened and that my friend was fine. Her and the birthday girl's drinks were comped, and they offered free champagne and dessert to the group as well. The dessert, a key lime pie (my fave), and bacon glazed donuts were sublime, loved both. The bill came to about $100 individually, and honestly, I left a little hungry! But all in all I had a wonderful evening, full of laughs. I'm honestly sure the screw incident was a fluke, and I would like to come back here on another occasion.",4.0
"One of the few eating establishments in the NYC area that can be truly considered a ""panty dropper"". Seriously, if you want to score some serious ""smush time"" points make sure you take your date to Traif to wine and dine her or him. After an amazing meal here if you can't ""get some"" then you would have a hard time scoring in a whorehouse with a fist full of hundreds.It has been a while since we dined at this wonderful restaurant but I just realized I never reviewed it, so here we are at #1900, and it's truly fitting for a milestone review!What I remember most is, um, let me think.......EVERYTHING!!!Totally amazing food, top notch service, delicious cocktails - it's the total package! Five stars all the way. Throughout the night even the 80's new wave music was on point. I was in awe as everything that I placed in my ravenous mouth was just perfect. Started with a cocktail - the violet beauregard - blueberry infused bourbon (Whoa!), beet salad (YUM!), meaty juicy strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs (OMG!), succulent BBQ braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries (YOWZA!), and bacon donuts with ice cream (NOM!!!) were all just ridiculous.Traif straddles the line between casual and upscale. It's a perfect spot to impress a hot date, special event, or for some friends to get together and enjoy conversation over a fantastic meal and cocktails. The staff are friendly, competent, knowledgeable, and go out of their way to make sure you have a truly enjoyable dining experience here. Even the prices are reasonable and affordable for the quality of food and service you receive. The menu is eclectic with something for everyone's palate. Even though small the cocktail list and craft beer selection are terrific. How can anyone not like this place? If you can't enjoy a night out at Traif then you might need to check your pulse, and your taste buds.Boom-chicka-bow-wow!",5.0

If you're looking into a prix fixe menu for your group, please please please try these, you will not regret it!The pork belly was my absolute favorite, I'm pretty sure I could've finished the whole plate meant for 3-4, by myself! It was literally melting in my mouth and it was everything good in the world combined, in that one dish. Unfortunately my friend next to me had a less than excellent experience with the pork belly. Just as she was exclaiming in joy over the goodness of it, she spit it out because, I couldn't believe it, but there was a screw in her portion, about 1 1/2 inches long. Funnily enough, this would happen to the person who has the most amusing reactions to anything ever, and I couldn't stop laughing. I felt so bad but at the same time, it was comedy. Our waitress came right over and assured us that this has never happened before, and quickly disposed of the screw. I'm glad nothing more serious happened and that my friend was fine. Her and the birthday girl's drinks were comped, and they offered free champagne and dessert to the group as well. The dessert, a key lime pie (my fave), and bacon glazed donuts were sublime, loved both. The bill came to about $100 individually, and honestly, I left a little hungry! But all in all I had a wonderful evening, full of laughs. I'm honestly sure the screw incident was a fluke, and I would like to come back here on another occasion.",4.0
"One of the few eating establishments in the NYC area that can be truly considered a ""panty dropper"". Seriously, if you want to score some serious ""smush time"" points make sure you take your date to Traif to wine and dine her or him. After an amazing meal here if you can't ""get some"" then you would have a hard time scoring in a whorehouse with a fist full of hundreds.It has been a while since we dined at this wonderful restaurant but I just realized I never reviewed it, so here we are at #1900, and it's truly fitting for a milestone review!What I remember most is, um, let me think.......EVERYTHING!!!Totally amazing food, top notch service, delicious cocktails - it's the total package! Five stars all the way. Throughout the night even the 80's new wave music was on point. I was in awe as everything that I placed in my ravenous mouth was just perfect. Started with a cocktail - the violet beauregard - blueberry infused bourbon (Whoa!), beet salad (YUM!), meaty juicy strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs (OMG!), succulent BBQ braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries (YOWZA!), and bacon donuts with ice cream (NOM!!!) were all just ridiculous.Traif straddles the line between casual and upscale. It's a perfect spot to impress a hot date, special event, or for some friends to get together and enjoy conversation over a fantastic meal and cocktails. The staff are friendly, competent, knowledgeable, and go out of their way to make sure you have a truly enjoyable dining experience here. Even the prices are reasonable and affordable for the quality of food and service you receive. The menu is eclectic with something for everyone's palate. Even though small the cocktail list and craft beer selection are terrific. How can anyone not like this place? If you can't enjoy a night out at Traif then you might need to check your pulse, and your taste buds.Boom-chicka-bow-wow!",5.0
"An incredibly disappointing experience:  we choose the chef testing menu and unfortunately not a single dish was close to pleasant in flavour or texture.The service was very slow at the beginning, although the waiter assigned to our table tried to complement these delays with a couple of extra dishes..., yet overall  no redemption for an overall negative experience...",1.0
"Consider me a fan.  When i'm in NY, I make it a habbit of checking out the ""new"" food buzz.  Usually it very rarely lives up to the hype....or price lol.  This spot delivers on the hype!I had the strawberry glazed ribs were out of this world delicious.  Moist and flavorful.  Great combination.The soft shell crab with avocado, pineapple, papaya was out of this world good.  Loved it.  Hot, fresh, and just the right amount of sweetness.Lastly, the bacon glazed donuts with cappuccino ice cream.

"Wow! This is some of the best food I've ever had.  I selected Traif for my big birthday night out and it did not disappoint.Making a reservation here is pretty easy.  I made one for six people one week in advance for a Saturday night.  Unfortunately, two people had to cancel, but it was no problem with the hostesses to reduce the reservation to four people at the door.  From there, we were waited on by a super nice, enthusiastic, and chill waiter.  He answered all of our questions and really added to our experience.We all ordered the tasting menu and every dish was wonderful.  At first the portions seem small, but in the end, we all left very full and happy.Some of my favorite dishes:-The pork belly - so juicy and tender-Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs were super sweet and fall-off-the-bone tender.-BBQ short rib sliders came with delicious sweet potato fries.-Seared scallops were fresh, cooked perfectly and some of the best scallops I've ever had.-BACON DONUTS- by far the best dessert and a must if you visit.The space itself was not what I expected. It is very casual and no-frills. I tend to like this environment simply because I hate been judged by my attire in a restaurant but I was expecting something slightly fancier.I would definitely recommend working with your waiter as to which dishes for the tasting menu you prefer. If you have a specific food allergy, mention this when you make the reservation so that they have time to accommodate your party. The bacon donuts were a must for my B-day and I made sure to ask for them.Overall I had a wonderful time and I would certainly return.  I do have to say, the sister restaurant Xixa was a little better in my opinion but Traif is still the HBIC and I wouldn't have it any other way.",5.0
"Truly a gem in Brookyln, Traif is a smaller restaurant focusing on small plates of very interesting food.  The beer list, while not huge, has some great bottles at fair prices.  The dishes I had ranged from sweetbreads to chicken and waffles and all were great.The best dish I had was the strawberry BBQ ribs, although there could have been more than just once slice of strawberry on the ribs.  The chicken and biscuits portion was massive and we couldn't finish.  I'll definitely be back!The space is small, dark, and somewhat cramped and there is only one toilet, so there is often a wait.  That said, we didn't feel uncomfortable or claustrophobic.  The open kitchen is right in the dining room.  Because of the minuscule size of the kitchen, there were irregular wait times between dishes being delivered, but the quality of the food made us quickly forget about any slowdowns.",5.0

"Where do I begin to describe how awesome Traif is?  Let's start with the reservations.  After weeks of reservation making and changing, I finally got a date that worked.  The girl on the phone was really patient with me and even called me the day of to make sure I was still set for dinner that day.  Seriously though, folks, make a reservation! And if possible, ask if you can get a seat in the glass canopy area in the back.  It looked so nice in the early evening and it's probably better lighting in that area for picture taking! By 7:00pm, the small space filled up quickly.  The dishes are tapas style and go from small to large down the menu list.  My friend and I ordered 4 small to medium dishes and it was enough food to be quite full!Salt & pepper shrimp: DELICIOUS! There were sweet potato chunks in this dish that I absolutely LOVED and I'm not usually a huge fan of sweet potatoes.  The shrimp was breaded in a nice batter and super juicy and crunchy.  The dish was not too flavorful or salty and the portion was satiating.Icy blue mussels: The mussels were soaked in a pesto pea soup.  Don't neglect the delicious fluffy buttered toast wedges on the side.  They were soooo delicious!  The mussels were served in a generous portion.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the peas as my friend was. Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs: AMAZING.  My favorite dish of the night! The meat fell right off the bone.  The tenderness of the meat was paired with a nice BBQ sauce made of cinnamon and strawberry reduction.  The cinnamon aspect was really unique, but not too overwhelmingly pungent.BBQ, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli: The sliders are about 3-4 bites so don't expect anything extravagantly large.  The short ribs resembled something similar to pulled pork - shredded and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were fried lightly so they had the perfect texture.  The smoked paprika aioli was great, but moderate - it's a bit salty!Unfortunately, we so full that we didn't have any room for the infamous bacon doughnuts, but I'll definitely be back for more!  The menu changes month to month so I'm looking forward to trying something new.",4.0
I heard about Traif from a foodie coworker but it took me another two years to make my way here. Boy I'm sorry I've waited this long.

"It seemed no matter where I looked for places to go in Brooklyn, Traif kept popping up on the must try lists.  So, I made sure to make another trip to Williamsburg for dinner and to try out the modern-chic contemporary american restaurant.  Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  As usual, exploring different cities, I got myself a seat at the bar.  The bartender was amazingly cordial and quite accommodating in terms of providing me with advice and information into the food.I started out with the ""Violet Beauregard"", an absolutely delicious bourbon  cocktail that had a great scotch aroma with every sip.  The first dish I ordered were the seared scallops.  A delicious risotto dish was a freshness that was perfect for a starter.  I then had the tuna tartare on fried eggplant.  I think this was the best dish of the night.  The fresh raw tuna against the fried eggplant created a dynamic dish.  I then had the sauteed sweatbreads.  With Brooklyn initializing my enjoyment of sweatbreads, I decided to try them here as well.  They were maybe the low point of the meal.  A bit heavy due to their being fried, but still not all that bad.  I then tried the hampshire pork belly.  This dish was quite delicious.  A complex but hearty dish.All in all the meal was delicious.  I would highly recommend Traif to anyone visiting Brooklyn.  It wasn't completely consistent in terms of taste throughout the meal but none the less, it was pretty great.",4.0
"I had very high expectations of Traif given the Yelp reviews. The restaurant started off on a bad foot with me due to the unfriendly hostesses. At first they told me my table would be ready at the time of my reservation (I had arrived early). Then when it came time, I asked if I could be seated only to be told that I had to have the entire party present. Finally when my friend arrived, she had to go ask them to be seated but apparently I had to close out my tab at the bar first (why I couldn't just add it to my bill later I don't know). I then paid and once again walked over to them to get seated...This poor service would have been okay if the food was spectacular. The only dish that blew us away was the short rib sliders. They were so tender and bursting with flavor. The scallops were incredibly salty, the pork belly chewy and tough. The foie gras with egg was good, but definitely not even close to the sliders.The famed bacon donuts were just alright. We were completely stuffed with 4 dishes even though they recommend 4-6 for two people. Would not go out of my way for this place again.",3.0

"Traif's been a favorite of mine since it opened in 2010. Actually, I pretend I'm an early adopter, but I didn't step foot inside until 2011. This much is true; I know I can rely on Traif for thoughtful cocktails and consistent forkfuls of what the hell was that!?! All the family and friends I've dragged here have stumbled out satisfactorily Traifed, I assure you.""That's what we call it,"" Kim says, ""even if we eat something delicious somewhere else.""""Like, we got Traifed by the polenta at Home Plate in San Francisco.""""Or when we got Traifed at Pig & Khao by that crispy sweet pork belly.""Small plates and amazing drinks are one of my favorite combinations, and Traif always brings me to that happy place. This New Years, Kim and I are at the counter again, like last year, two food nerds who can't wait to be entertained by expedition and execution.I admit part of me wondered what might be happening a few doors down at sister spot Xixa. They also had a tasting menu tonight - and apparently Jason Marcus' attention during my seating at Traif. Can't these two open a place in Park Slope already?I've had nights at Traif where literally every plate made you gasp. Heat and flavor and texture and execution all lined up perfectly. Ending the whole shabang with bacon doughnuts and coffee ice-cream or their sumptuous chocolate pot de cremes.This New Years experience was a little different. For one thing (not to complain) we were seated forty minutes after arriving on time. They were seemingly in recovery mode when we got there - mentioning the kitchen had fallen behind. Someone suggested that mixing Traif classics with new experiments messed with their timing. Who knows. It's likely some reservations started and ran late which totally throws off the plan. Guests are reminded about start and end times on the phone, in email, in a phone call the day before, and in person. That's how they manage the night. At some point it becomes herding cats because, in all fairness, why would anybody want to leave this place?Regardless, I started having fun the moment I got there and especially while summoning a steady stream of Rude Little Pigs to do my bidding. Lapsang-infused tequila, Cointreau orange liqueur, pomegranate, bacon rim. Sounds like a novelty. It ain't.  A shot-glass of creamy Vidalia onion soup to start was delectable, followed by strawberry-cinnamon ribs which seemed early considering Traif's usual light-to-heavy pacing.  Don't get me wrong, I can eat those ribs until I flat-line. The blue cheese and persimmons in the salad that followed were tasty, just off schedule.One thing my Italian family has never been able to instill in me is a love of mussels. Not my thing.  But I was Traifed for sure, soaking up mussels and that buttery sauce with thick cuts of brioche. So unlike me. I wonder if I'll like that anywhere else.Now it's midnight, my girl and I are a little buzzed when suddenly air horns and loud pops send confetti twinkling beautifully into the air and ultimately into all of our drinks. Mmmm, now we're having some beef sliders. The peekytoe crab on top might be superfluous, but those sweet potato fries and smoked paprika aioli are a killer combo as usual.So many different plates are coming out of this tiny kitchen. From our vantage point we saw a lot of unfamiliar dishes we are dying to try.""That's bone marrow,"" I say to Kim, with the enthusiasm of someone that just saw Elvis at the deli.""Just take it from that guy,"" she suggests. ""He doesn't deserve it.""""The one over-emoting to Always Something There to Remind Me?"" I ask, sipping around the confetti in my Rude Little Pig.""His eyes are closed and everything,"" the Chef interjects. ""He's really feelin' it.""Whereas my eyes are peeled for the baked muenster, smoked chorizo, apples, and crostini dish I love so much. Alas, no dice. Oh, but very happy to see you again, foie with egg, maple, potatoes and hot sauce - come sit on my lap.While the flavors were good, the pork belly suffered from lack of competing textures. And is that the same crab that topped the sliders? Not a particularly contrasting lead-in for the more purposefully soft final savory course of short ribs on polenta. Tasty, and one of the bigger small-plates for sure. Might be a bit heavy for some, but those people don't know.In the past, I've had desserts at Traif that blew my mind. Sometimes I fantasize about coming here alone just to have secret dessert. Our meal tonight ends simply with some zeppoles and poppy-seed vanilla ice-cream. Good, sure, but not a closer - especially once you've experienced the other tricks up their sleeve.Traif remains one of the best things you can do with your clothes on. I know I'm not special for feeling that way, it's the most Yelped restaurant in Brooklyn these days.If pork and shellfish make it through your dietary force-field, make a reservation and get there on time.jealousfoodies.com",5.0
"We approached an unmarked door near the Traif address.  ""Welcome to Shiksa"" the beautiful young girl opened the door. My Jewish friend was happy.  ""I love it!""He laughed.  (Shiksa means gentile, or equivalent to white girl in Yiddish.)The next thing they'll do is open a place called ""schwartze""!   He said.Thats bad right?  I said.   Yes.  He affirmed.Shiksa is the sister restaurant to Traif, more of a Spanish tapas twist on Traif.  We had hiked all this way so I was determined to have the originally planned experience.  Shiksa seemed subdued from the outside, dark loungey and luscious.  So did Traif, yet the loud music made for more of a nightclub ambiance.  It was Friday after all.    The music was jamming and switched up.   The bartenders and waiters were young professional hip and attractive.We started with a corn chowder shooter which was delicious and I tasted a rich delightful use of mace.    I ordered the sweet breads.  They were fat, crispy, moist and flavorful.  The best I've ever had.    Marcus wasn't wild about his lobster risotto.  He looked wilted.  ""it wasn't what I expected."". He said like a sad child.It was exactly what I expected for $15:rice with small lobster pieces. Oh are you comparing it to the one you had in south beach for $40?I remembered.So I felt bad for him and ordered the bacon donuts.   Honestly I don't like bacon and I don't really like donuts but I thought it might be interesting.   I was disgusted, but Marcus happily ate all four. ""with a name like Traif, I was expecting more pork on the menu.""  he said.(Traif means unkosher.)We were given a burstful juicy watermelon piece on a little plate and we were happy to forage into the quiter noise of the Williamsburg freeway.Traif is a young place with a small menu - think stylish club meets a gastropub.It's dark, loud and jazzed.   The menu is mostly small plates ranging from 15-40.I was the oldest person there.  I'm 45 and look 35.Shalom y'all",4.0

Yes, it can seem that there isn't enough food on the plates but they proportion it to your party size. I ate here with my two guy friends who can EAT, and we were all full. ps: make a reservation in advance or its wait list for counter service.",5.0
"The place serves mostly small dishes, it is great for small groups so you can try a variety of dishes. The dishes are all individually unique with flavor combinations you have perhaps never dreamed up of. My favorite was the bacon covered dates which in and of itself was not unique to trait, but was spectacularly done.Highly recommended - promise you will not be disappointed.",4.0
"SOOOOO GOOD.  My Boyfriend and I went there for dinner own summer Friday night and had 6 plates including one dessert and it was all amazing.  there's a tasting that I would recommend 12 plates, including 2 desserts for $50 ... totally worth it.  Two things in particular come to mind ..... 1) shrimp and pineapple in curry sauce and the Short RIb sliders ... oh and .... THE MOUSSE ... delicious.  Great service and warm welcoming space.",5.0
"It seemed no matter where I looked for places to go in Brooklyn, Traif kept popping up on the must try lists.  So, I made sure to make another trip to Williamsburg for dinner and to try out the modern-chic contemporary american restaurant.  Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  As usual, exploring different cities, I got myself a seat at the bar.  The bartender was amazingly cordial and quite accommodating in terms of providing me with advice and information into the food.I started out with the ""Violet Beauregard"", an absolutely delicious bourbon  cocktail that had a great scotch aroma with every sip.  The first dish I ordered were the seared scallops.  A delicious risotto dish was a freshness that was perfect for a starter.  I then had the tuna tartare on fried eggplant.  I think this was the best dish of the night.  The fresh raw tuna against the fried eggplant created a dynamic dish.  I then had the sauteed sweatbreads.  With Brooklyn initializing my enjoyment of sweatbreads, I decided to try them here as well.  They were maybe the low point of the meal.  A bit heavy due to their being fried, but still not all that bad.  I then tried the hampshire pork belly.  This dish was quite delicious.  A complex but hearty dish.All in all the meal was delicious.  I would highly recommend Traif to anyone visiting Brooklyn.  It wasn't completely consistent in terms of taste throughout the meal but none the less, it was pretty great.",4.0
"I had very high expectations of Traif given the Yelp reviews. The restaurant started off on a bad foot with me due to the unfriendly hostesses. At first they told me my table would be ready at the time of my reservation (I had arrived early). Then when it came time, I asked if I could be seated only to be told that I had to have the entire party present. Finally when my friend arrived, she had to go ask them to be seated but apparently I had to close out my tab at the bar first (why I couldn't just add it to my bill later I don't know). I then paid and once again walked over to them to get seated...This poor service would have been okay if the food was spectacular. The only dish that blew us away was the short rib sliders. They were so tender and bursting with flavor. The scallops were incredibly salty, the pork belly chewy and tough. The foie gras with egg was good, but definitely not even close to the sliders.The famed bacon donuts were just alright. We were completely stuffed with 4 dishes even though they recommend 4-6 for two people. Would not go out of my way for this place again.",3.0
"I loved the tuna tartare with eggplant tempura! The sliders were ok, not anything extraordinary. I recommend getting at least 2 plates per person as they are a bit bigger than tapas plates.",4.0
"Traif's been a favorite of mine since it opened in 2010. Actually, I pretend I'm an early adopter, but I didn't step foot inside until 2011. This much is true; I know I can rely on Traif for thoughtful cocktails and consistent forkfuls of what the hell was that!?! All the family and friends I've dragged here have stumbled out satisfactorily Traifed, I assure you.""That's what we call it,"" Kim says, ""even if we eat something delicious somewhere else.""""Like, we got Traifed by the polenta at Home Plate in San Francisco.""""Or when we got Traifed at Pig & Khao by that crispy sweet pork belly.""Small plates and amazing drinks are one of my favorite combinations, and Traif always brings me to that happy place. This New Years, Kim and I are at the counter again, like last year, two food nerds who can't wait to be entertained by expedition and execution.I admit part of me wondered what might be happening a few doors down at sister spot Xixa. They also had a tasting menu tonight - and apparently Jason Marcus' attention during my seating at Traif. Can't these two open a place in Park Slope already?I've had nights at Traif where literally every plate made you gasp. Heat and flavor and texture and execution all lined up perfectly. Ending the whole shabang with bacon doughnuts and coffee ice-cream or their sumptuous chocolate pot de cremes.This New Years experience was a little different. For one thing (not to complain) we were seated forty minutes after arriving on time. They were seemingly in recovery mode when we got there - mentioning the kitchen had fallen behind. Someone suggested that mixing Traif classics with new experiments messed with their timing. Who knows. It's likely some reservations started and ran late which totally throws off the plan. Guests are reminded about start and end times on the phone, in email, in a phone call the day before, and in person. That's how they manage the night. At some point it becomes herding cats because, in all fairness, why would anybody want to leave this place?Regardless, I started having fun the moment I got there and especially while summoning a steady stream of Rude Little Pigs to do my bidding. Lapsang-infused tequila, Cointreau orange liqueur, pomegranate, bacon rim. Sounds like a novelty. It ain't.  A shot-glass of creamy Vidalia onion soup to start was delectable, followed by strawberry-cinnamon ribs which seemed early considering Traif's usual light-to-heavy pacing.  Don't get me wrong, I can eat those ribs until I flat-line. The blue cheese and persimmons in the salad that followed were tasty, just off schedule.One thing my Italian family has never been able to instill in me is a love of mussels. Not my thing.  But I was Traifed for sure, soaking up mussels and that buttery sauce with thick cuts of brioche. So unlike me. I wonder if I'll like that anywhere else.Now it's midnight, my girl and I are a little buzzed when suddenly air horns and loud pops send confetti twinkling beautifully into the air and ultimately into all of our drinks. Mmmm, now we're having some beef sliders. The peekytoe crab on top might be superfluous, but those sweet potato fries and smoked paprika aioli are a killer combo as usual.So many different plates are coming out of this tiny kitchen. From our vantage point we saw a lot of unfamiliar dishes we are dying to try.""That's bone marrow,"" I say to Kim, with the enthusiasm of someone that just saw Elvis at the deli.""Just take it from that guy,"" she suggests. ""He doesn't deserve it.""""The one over-emoting to Always Something There to Remind Me?"" I ask, sipping around the confetti in my Rude Little Pig.""His eyes are closed and everything,"" the Chef interjects. ""He's really feelin' it.""Whereas my eyes are peeled for the baked muenster, smoked chorizo, apples, and crostini dish I love so much. Alas, no dice. Oh, but very happy to see you again, foie with egg, maple, potatoes and hot sauce - come sit on my lap.While the flavors were good, the pork belly suffered from lack of competing textures. And is that the same crab that topped the sliders? Not a particularly contrasting lead-in for the more purposefully soft final savory course of short ribs on polenta. Tasty, and one of the bigger small-plates for sure. Might be a bit heavy for some, but those people don't know.In the past, I've had desserts at Traif that blew my mind. Sometimes I fantasize about coming here alone just to have secret dessert. Our meal tonight ends simply with some zeppoles and poppy-seed vanilla ice-cream. Good, sure, but not a closer - especially once you've experienced the other tricks up their sleeve.Traif remains one of the best things you can do with your clothes on. I know I'm not special for feeling that way, it's the most Yelped restaurant in Brooklyn these days.If pork and shellfish make it through your dietary force-field, make a reservation and get there on time.jealousfoodies.com",5.0
"We approached an unmarked door near the Traif address.  ""Welcome to Shiksa"" the beautiful young girl opened the door. My Jewish friend was happy.  ""I love it!""He laughed.  (Shiksa means gentile, or equivalent to white girl in Yiddish.)The next thing they'll do is open a place called ""schwartze""!   He said.Thats bad right?  I said.   Yes.  He affirmed.Shiksa is the sister restaurant to Traif, more of a Spanish tapas twist on Traif.  We had hiked all this way so I was determined to have the originally planned experience.  Shiksa seemed subdued from the outside, dark loungey and luscious.  So did Traif, yet the loud music made for more of a nightclub ambiance.  It was Friday after all.    The music was jamming and switched up.   The bartenders and waiters were young professional hip and attractive.We started with a corn chowder shooter which was delicious and I tasted a rich delightful use of mace.    I ordered the sweet breads.  They were fat, crispy, moist and flavorful.  The best I've ever had.    Marcus wasn't wild about his lobster risotto.  He looked wilted.  ""it wasn't what I expected."". He said like a sad child.It was exactly what I expected for $15:rice with small lobster pieces. Oh are you comparing it to the one you had in south beach for $40?I remembered.So I felt bad for him and ordered the bacon donuts.   Honestly I don't like bacon and I don't really like donuts but I thought it might be interesting.   I was disgusted, but Marcus happily ate all four. ""with a name like Traif, I was expecting more pork on the menu.""  he said.(Traif means unkosher.)We were given a burstful juicy watermelon piece on a little plate and we were happy to forage into the quiter noise of the Williamsburg freeway.Traif is a young place with a small menu - think stylish club meets a gastropub.It's dark, loud and jazzed.   The menu is mostly small plates ranging from 15-40.I was the oldest person there.  I'm 45 and look 35.Shalom y'all",4.0
"I was dragged in here again by my GF. I have to completely change my review on this place. This is a tapas place, I recommend if you are going here, go with one or two other people. We ordered a total of about 7 dishes, they were all delicious. I guess this isn't a place to go if your with a big group, as the menu is prefixed. Otherwise I will end up coming back here again.

My cocktail was a-ok but not super spectacular, but my friend really appreciated the bartender's good beer choice. We ordered some small plates to share (ribs, beet salad, and tuna tartare bites) and had a panna cotta for dessert. Before our plates came, we were served a little complimentary ceramic shot glass each of a creamy soup. The ribs were very tasty, and the meat literally fell of the bone. Very good! Beet salad was nice, but the tuna tartare bites were the best. Fat little mounds of tuna coated in a spicy sauce on top of crispy eggplant rounds. Yum! Panna cotta was on the mark but didn't wow me either. Again, the meal ended with a little complimentary bite of a pineapple cube with some sort of topping. Very nice touch. Overall, I wasn't entirely wowed by the experience nor the food but service and eats were real nice, drinks very drinkable, and the complimentary bites were a nice touch.

"Went there last weekend at a very late hour, but the food and service was excellent. I would skip the their sauteed broccoli rabe (served on truffled toast and a runny egg), and their baked muenster cheese. They weren't anything special and I think in order for the sauteed broccoli rabe to work, it needs to be cut smaller. It would be easier to eat and to share. The baked muenster was described to have chorizo but I didn't taste it in the dish and only saw a few small chunks. The bacon doughnuts that everyone has been raving about is just meh. They dust it with bacon bits, but I was looking for bacon IN the batter it self. Now THAT would have been great! The coffee ice cream that came along with it was really good though. Here's some things you MUST get: * Big Eye Tuna Tartar served on crispy Japanese eggplant. Think really, really,  good spicy tuna on top of fried eggplant. Yum! It was so good that we got a second order despite what our filled tummies said. * Day boat scallops on seasonal Rissotto (I had butternut squash). The scallops were perfectly seared and the rissotto was very good. It's a classic pair, but nothing new. Just a classic done well. * Seared Foie Gras. It was executed very nicely. I could have eaten the whole thing. * Berkshire Pork belly. Need I say more?*Meyer Lemon Tart was super yummy. It tasted fresh and the whip cream is necessary as it is very sweet. It needed to be sweet to balance the acid, which I get and I didn't mind.",4.0
"My girlfriend took me to Traif for my birthday - Given the restaurant's reputation and the unique menu, I was really excited.

Our taste buds were definitely doing the happy dance :)The cinnamon strawberry glazed baby back pork ribs gave me life! One bite and I was in food heaven. The combination itself sounds a bit weird but it was absolutely amazing! The ribs melted off the bone and were simply succulent!We then moved onto the BBQ braised short rib sliders with truffle fries and the ""amazing"" orange sauce! This small plate was my favorite! It's def a must try at Traif.The salt and pepper shrimp were just ""ok"" to me. Maybe it was because it came after the sliders and the ribs which were absolutely delectable. The spices were a bit too strong for my taste buds.The last small plate was the buttermilk fried quail which was very good. Well seasoned and soaked in a creamy buttermilk sauce. Now for the grand finale - the BACON DOUGHNUTS with dulce de leche and coffee ice cream. UNBELIEVABLE!! After the first bite, I made sure I savored every last bit.

"Two of my girlfriends were back in town for spring break so I figured I would set up a fun girl's night since we were all finally united. I usually don't venture out to Brooklyn so this place has been on my list forever. Now that I've tried it, I sincerely regret not not coming sooner as this place is definitely in my top 10!After work, I decided to walk over the Williamsburg bridge to get here since I knew it would be a heavy night, hha. We met up for 7:30pm and the place was relatively empty, surprisingly! We opted for the tasting menu at 45/pp with 11 courses. We were served shots of chilled pea soup to start -- a tad salty but deliciously creamy! we also had:1) salad with berries, pine nuts, blue cheese, bacon2) bershire pork belly3) eggplant tempura with spicy tuna tartare4) rigatoni with pesto, asparagus and peas5) strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs6) pork cheeks with polenta7) short rib sliders8) quail with mac and cheese9) dayboat scallops10) bacon doughnuts11) vanilla panna cottaEverything was absolutely PHENOMENAL but the standouts for me were the eggplant, pork cheeks, scallops and bacon doughnuts! The salad was a perfect start, with refreshing berries and crumbly blue cheese. The pork belly was perfectly fatty and seared to perfection. The eggplant was AMAZING! Crispy tempura topped with with huge chunks of tartar drizzled in this delicious spicy mayo sauce. I could have easily eaten 1-2 plates of this on my own! The rigatoni was cooked the way I liked, with the asparagus and peas adding a great crunch and sweetness. The ribs, sliders and pork cheeks -- OMG. all so tender and flavorful, especially the pork cheeks -- so good with the creamy polenta! I've never had quail before but really enjoyed the quail here! The breading on it was seasoned well, nice and crispy and the quail was so moist and juicy. The mac and cheese was a standout too -- quite heavy but some of the best I've ever had! The scallops were huge and so FRESH, perfectly seared and seasoned. yum. For dessert, we had hoped to get the keylime pie but the panna cotta was actually quite good. Lastly, bacon doughnuts! They were as great as everyone says. Hot, fried balls of dough, mildy sweet with crunchy bacon bits, with delicious coffee ice cream. it was the perfect end to an amazing meal. Thank you TRAIF! I will definitely be back!",5.0
"Great complex flavors, very interesting take on every dish. Though, a little bit too expensive for me. I felt the dishes were too small for their price. For instance the scallops with butternut squash risotto tasted amazing, but my scallops looked very small for the $23 price tag. My favorite dishes of the night included the baked muenster cheese, complimentary onion soup, bone marrow, and the bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. My least favorite dishes that I would pass if I ever come back would be the Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs and chicken livers.",4.0

"Can't even tell you how perfect this place was from decor to food. I would move to Brooklyn just to be close to Traif. For starters, what a cocktail menu. I had the Rude Little Pig. That Little Pig was far from rude, quite the contrary, quite delicious!! 5 stars for the drinks alone. My boyfriend got the Dark Horse beer and mumbled something about nice menu choice of beers. I didn't really hear him, I was too busy talking about which would be my next drink. It really is a nice drink menu.      Okay, on to the food. I had the baby back ribs. They were strawberry glazed. I've never had this, and OMG would never want it any other way now! My boyfriend had the scallops and he said that they were amazing! Don't miss the bacon donuts. It's a life changing experience.      So in review, sometimes when a friend makes a suggestion on a restaurant and says it's worth the ride, listen to them! Thanks Audra you were right.

Top notch. Food was amazing! Our waitress was also just the best - so friendly and lovely. There's a covered garden in the back if you can get a spot there. It's very popular so be sure to make a reservation. Only negative for me is that I do find the immediate area a little dodgy and I think they could improve the decor but can't fault the food or the service which is most important!,4.0
"I don't know man, I guess I bought the Brooklyn hype. Too many places in this large city to justify paying the money for this place ever again. Kind of wish I went elsewhere in the first place anyway. I want to give them 2 stars, but they probably deserve at least a 3.

"This place is truly a gem in NY! They offer small plates which I loved; it gave us the opportunity to try multiple items. I highly highly recommend this restaurant! Our taste buds were definitely doing the happy dance :)The cinnamon strawberry glazed baby back pork ribs gave me life! One bite and I was in food heaven. The combination itself sounds a bit weird but it was absolutely amazing! The ribs melted off the bone and were simply succulent!We then moved onto the BBQ braised short rib sliders with truffle fries and the ""amazing"" orange sauce! This small plate was my favorite! It's def a must try at Traif.The salt and pepper shrimp were just ""ok"" to me. Maybe it was because it came after the sliders and the ribs which were absolutely delectable. The spices were a bit too strong for my taste buds.The last small plate was the buttermilk fried quail which was very good. Well seasoned and soaked in a creamy buttermilk sauce. Now for the grand finale - the BACON DOUGHNUTS with dulce de leche and coffee ice cream. UNBELIEVABLE!! After the first bite, I made sure I savored every last bit. It was absolutely amazing in evvveeerreyy siiiinnnggllleee way!!!! They are truly heavenly.",5.0

"Two of my girlfriends were back in town for spring break so I figured I would set up a fun girl's night since we were all finally united. I usually don't venture out to Brooklyn so this place has been on my list forever. Now that I've tried it, I sincerely regret not not coming sooner as this place is definitely in my top 10!After work, I decided to walk over the Williamsburg bridge to get here since I knew it would be a heavy night, hha. We met up for 7:30pm and the place was relatively empty, surprisingly! We opted for the tasting menu at 45/pp with 11 courses. We were served shots of chilled pea soup to start -- a tad salty but deliciously creamy! we also had:1) salad with berries, pine nuts, blue cheese, bacon2) bershire pork belly3) eggplant tempura with spicy tuna tartare4) rigatoni with pesto, asparagus and peas5) strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs6) pork cheeks with polenta7) short rib sliders8) quail with mac and cheese9) dayboat scallops10) bacon doughnuts11) vanilla panna cottaEverything was absolutely PHENOMENAL but the standouts for me were the eggplant, pork cheeks, scallops and bacon doughnuts! The salad was a perfect start, with refreshing berries and crumbly blue cheese. The pork belly was perfectly fatty and seared to perfection. The eggplant was AMAZING! Crispy tempura topped with with huge chunks of tartar drizzled in this delicious spicy mayo sauce. I could have easily eaten 1-2 plates of this on my own! The rigatoni was cooked the way I liked, with the asparagus and peas adding a great crunch and sweetness. The ribs, sliders and pork cheeks -- OMG. all so tender and flavorful, especially the pork cheeks -- so good with the creamy polenta! I've never had quail before but really enjoyed the quail here! The breading on it was seasoned well, nice and crispy and the quail was so moist and juicy. The mac and cheese was a standout too -- quite heavy but some of the best I've ever had!

"Came here twice and I still adore this place. Definitely a culinary experience. They switch the menu every few months so it's like trying a new restaurant every time i come here. Great for date nights and great for a friendly reunion. The walls had interesting paintings and the garden seating is so pretty. I also love how they pair different kinds of fruits to make the dishes sweet and savory.1) First time was for my 1 year anniversary and everything tasted wonderful. They started us out with complimentary sweet potato soup served in little cups, fish kampachi (very fresh), pork belly with apples and cinnamon (delightful), spare ribs with strawberries and pomegranate (sweet), foie gras (Personally not a big fan of it but my boyfriend at the time loved it), scallops (super top choice), fatty tuna on fried eggplants ( not greasy at all), chicken with hosin sauce (a bit of a rip off because I can do it at home, but it was still good), and sweetbread (very rubbery...and I finally found out what sweetbread was actually made of). 2) Second time was with friends. We ordered almost the same as above but Traif twisted some of the flavors. Quite interesting because we ordered the same dish as I did last time but the flavor were completely different (in a very good way). I tried their bacon donut with their home made coffee ice cream for the first time...and it definitely was a true winner of the night...but who doesn't like bacon?Also, I think I liked their winter menu more than their summer menu.

"It's good. Would I come here again? Probably not because I think I tried their prized possession dishes and the rest was not as entertaining.Reservation when the restaurant opened, seated immediately. There were about four hungry couples who waited without reservations when the place opened and were also seated quickly at the bar (hint for anyone who wasn't able to score a reservation). Ambiance was casual. Come here in stilettos if you want to look awkward.Things I loved: * Braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries (delicious meaty goodness soaked in more meaty sauce... extremely satisfying)* Scallops + corn risotto (scallops were cooked perfectly and served in a bed of risotto... also extremely satisfying)* Bacon doughnuts were doughnuts sprinkled on top and filled with little bacon bits. I enjoyed this but for whoever though it was a nice thick slab of bacon, you will be sorely disappointed.Things I did not love: * Kale salad (it was literally a bunch of kale, with olive oil, few scattered pomegranate seeds for good measure? This is the kind of salad that I can make, and this is the reason why I hate eating salad at home because I feel like I'm eating mouthfuls of greens and oil.) * Pork belly with... raspberries?? Oh my goodness I loved the pork belly with my whole heart it was fall of the bone great and soft and yummy delicious wowowowow BUT WAITAMINUTE WHAT ARE RASPBERRIES DOING IN HERE? This isn't Chopped, we don't need raspberries on top of delicious pork, oh gosh, take it out, please, please please.Things that are meh:* Quail and biscuits: The quail was cooked but for so little meat it did not make sense to fry it. It seemed more delicious in theory. The biscuit was also a little dry.It was a little bit more effort to get out here than locals, since we live in Manhattan. I don't think I will come here again just due to transportation and we tried the 'popular' items on the menu. I can understand why it's popular if you live nearby or have a car. I am also not sure if it's $$, more like $$$, just a forewarning.",4.0
"I'm only deducting a star because the service started out Rocky.......But! To the nitty gritty -- the FOOOOOOODDD! We had the baby back ribs, short rib sliders, salt and pepper shrimp, and buttermilk quail. Now everything was amaze-balls, but the only thing was the shrimp wasn't a necessity and the quail (I know it's a teeny bird) needs to be bigger (aka replaced). For dessert we had the bacon doughnuts, which are a MUST HAVE, as they are very succulent and immaculately tasty!The ambiance is very quaint and intimate.

Come here in stilettos if you want to look awkward.Things I loved: * Braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries (delicious meaty goodness soaked in more meaty sauce... extremely satisfying)* Scallops + corn risotto (scallops were cooked perfectly and served in a bed of risotto... also extremely satisfying)* Bacon doughnuts were doughnuts sprinkled on top and filled with little bacon bits. I enjoyed this but for whoever though it was a nice thick slab of bacon, you will be sorely disappointed.Things I did not love: * Kale salad (it was literally a bunch of kale, with olive oil, few scattered pomegranate seeds for good measure? This is the kind of salad that I can make, and this is the reason why I hate eating salad at home because I feel like I'm eating mouthfuls of greens and oil.) * Pork belly with... raspberries?? Oh my goodness I loved the pork belly with my whole heart it was fall of the bone great and soft and yummy delicious wowowowow BUT WAITAMINUTE WHAT ARE RASPBERRIES DOING IN HERE? This isn't Chopped, we don't need raspberries on top of delicious pork, oh gosh, take it out, please, please please.Things that are meh:* Quail and biscuits: The quail was cooked but for so little meat it did not make sense to fry it. It seemed more delicious in theory. The biscuit was also a little dry.It was a little bit more effort to get out here than locals, since we live in Manhattan. I don't think I will come here again just due to transportation and we tried the 'popular' items on the menu. I can understand why it's popular if you live nearby or have a car. I am also not sure if it's $$, more like $$$, just a forewarning.",4.0
"I'm only deducting a star because the service started out Rocky.......But! To the nitty gritty -- the FOOOOOOODDD! We had the baby back ribs, short rib sliders, salt and pepper shrimp, and buttermilk quail. Now everything was amaze-balls, but the only thing was the shrimp wasn't a necessity and the quail (I know it's a teeny bird) needs to be bigger (aka replaced). For dessert we had the bacon doughnuts, which are a MUST HAVE, as they are very succulent and immaculately tasty!The ambiance is very quaint and intimate. Kind of noisy over the weekends but the food mutes all of that. So I definitely recommend. Until next time, Cheers Folks!",4.0
"Food is so special, layered ingredients and flavors! Not to mention wonderful staff who truly care about the customers and their experience. Fave dishes: sliders, truffle toast, tuna tartare, bacon wrapped dates, ribs, shrimp.",4.0
"First time here. First time trying American tapas. 5 out of 5. Food is great. Service is great. Ambience is great. I would definitely come here again. I recommend the chefs special. It's $50 and the assortment is great. For our appetizer: Pea soup, Grape salad. For our entree: Pasta pesto, Tuna tartare, Bread w/ butter & Bacon marmalade, Pulled Pork sliders, Spicy sausage w/ cheese, mussels, baby back ribs, soft crab, pork belly. And for dessert: key lime pie, caramel mousse. Bacon doughnuts and Pineapple pomegranate ON THE HOUSE. Everything was really good. I'm not gonna get into details because everyone has a certain palette - I couldn't complain about anything. Like most reviews, there's seems to be a resounding, 'yes.' Overall, a great spot in all facets of what a restaurant should be.",5.0
"Came here on a whim after a long working Saturday, purely because the kitchen was open late.  It was marvelous.  Menu is nicely put together, the staff are helpful and friendly, and the cocktails are superb.  We had the Tuna tartare, the dates, the pork belly (whatever you do, get the damn pork belly) and the sliders, because sliders.  I'm going back as soon as I can with friends.  Great cozy atmosphere too.  If you're in the neighborhood, you're doing yourself a disservice not to try this place.",5.0
"Thanks to other fellow yelpers, I found this gem last time I was in NY.  This place is exactly what everyone says- just delicious. I have days where I think about just booking a flight over just so I can eat here again! Absolutely delicious and definitely worth the trip.What I really liked is how their sauce allowed the food to pop. They have really thought about every detail to deliver a dish worth every complement!  I can't wait for next trip and ohh yes, their drinks are yummy too!!",5.0
Literally my favorite restaurant.  Great for dates or dinner with friends.  I love sitting at the bar and watching them cook.  Cocktail list is great and a perfect wine list.  I have eaten here dozens of times and only had a bad time once.  It wasn't the restaurant's fault though.  I didn't like anyone I was with!,5.0
"Traif wowed me from beginning to end. All of their tapas are so unique, with sometimes bold, sometimes subtle, and always phenomenal flavors. This is a line I've heard a lot but never have been wholly convinced of about any restaurant until traif: you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Seriously, I would love to go again and just have the chef surprise me with whichever few dishes. What's even more impressive about this place is that they boldly present a menu with inspirations from many different cuisines, from Italian to thai, but somehow nail every single one of them. If I had to pick some standout dishes, it would probably be the thai inspired shrimp with pineapple, Pork ribs with strawberry, and burrata with asparagus ""pudding"". Oh and the bacon doughnuts are a must, it's brooklyn afterall. However, as aforementioned this is definitely a place where you needn't ever stress over what to order. Can't wait to come again soon!",5.0
"I can't believe this is my 200th review!I came here with two friends after a much anticipated wait and Traif did not disappoint.We each got a few cocktails, some bubbly, and the tasting menu.The tasting menu is SUCH a steal. For $45 each, we got nine courses and two desserts.The tasting menu included:-Pork Belly with lentils-Pork cheek-Tuna tartar-Hazelnut salad-Foie Gras-the infamous strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs-clam chowder-little sloppy joe type buns-scallopsThe dessert came with a key lime pie and the bacon doughnuts. My favs included: the pork belly with lentils, the foie gras, the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs and the bacon donuts. Our waitress was very kind and accommodating. I don't like cheese, but didn't want to ruin the meal for my companions, so she mainly avoided the cheese items, but for the buns she put cheese on two of them and left mine without. We were also allowed to give suggestions for the tasting menu. We requested the foie gras the ribs and got both.For my cocktail, I got a drink with a raw egg in it. Twice. I learned the hard way that you should probably only get one drink with a raw egg in it. Womp womp.It is places like Traif that remind you that you can great absolutely great food without spending a bloody fortune. If you use places like this as a guideline, it makes it very hard to give out tons of five-star ratings.I highly recommend a trip out to Traif. It is well worth it.",5.0
"Finally! I've been hearing and reading so many good things about Traif that I needed to experience it myself. Valentine's Day dinner number 2. We were quite the rebels and strolled in on a cold Sunday night without a reservation. It was like playing Russian Roulette and Lady Luck was on our side. The wait was only 10 mins for two bar seats. We'll take it!! Honestly, I felt like we had one of the best seats in the house. Situated in front of their open kitchen and the seats elevated high enough to give you a full view of the entire restaurant. Imagine getting front row seats to a Food Network show and you're one of the judges, watching and admiring their art of cooking. With old school music in the background (i.e. Unchained Melody), one can't help but feel nostalgic. Pure awesomeness. Must eats:- Spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis - this was by far my number 1 dish there. The crispy tempura with the spicy tuna was a perfect combo. I think I could eat about 5 of these on my own. Drizzled with a black hoison like sauce. Delicious.- Hampshire pork belly, hearts of palm, bacon, snow peas, cauliflower, mango - the meat could have been a little more tender but overall, a solid dish.After all the tapas family style food, you can't skimp out on the drinks now. I ordered the Red Pearl which consist of  chili-infused vodka, thai basil, kiwi and citrus sour. Loved it! Sweet, sour then a semi spicy finish. Never thought I would like a spicy drink, but this place is definitely opening up new food/drink experiences for me. Stuffed to the brim, I wanted something sweet to finish off the night. We ordered the bacon fried doughnut with coffee ice cream (eh... wasn't impressed, kinda disappointed) and their key lime pie which was SOOOOOOOOO good!!

Everything is served tapas style but they're hefty so don't get it confused... you will NOT leave hungry under any circumstance. Considering the ample amount of reviews on Traif, I'll keep it short and simple. If there's one thing I'd recommend you order it would be the scallops. They were cooked to perfection, fresh, simple and complex. A beautiful oxymoron for sure.

"I have to say, I like this place better than Xixa. First of all, service was excellent - everyone from the hosts to the servers to the bartenders were incredibly friendly. Also, I showed up on a Friday night alone and had no problem finding a seat at the bar. I started off with the spicy bigeye tuna tartare, which was really tasty. I would have preferred thinner pieces of eggplant though, because I thought that slightly overpowered the tuna itself. Next, the scallops and risotto - so good! The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was really interesting with the addition of the capers, a flavor I love but many hate. I ended the meal with the burrata cheese. It tasted good, and I liked the contrasting textures with the nuts, but it was actually such a huge chunk of cheese that it was a bit overwhelming at the end of the meal. I was so stuffed by the end that I ordered the bacon donuts to go. Unfortunately, they couldn't send any ice cream home with me, because they thought it would melt. To be honest, I only had a small taste of the donuts once I got home, because I ended up having a couple friends come over that evening who finished them all, but what I did eat was quite tasty!Overall, I enjoyed my meal and evening and would definitely consider going back to Traif!",4.0

I picked Traif as that experience, so why not do the tasting menu. However, you do need to have at least 3 in your party and everyone at the table needs to participate. So I guess the tasting menu would have been the icing on the cake! We asked the server and she happily asked the chef if we could get the tasting menu. Unfortunately his answer was no, but that was totally fine! I can respect that the server tried, the chef didnt want to disrupt the flow, and that they have a delicious menu - so basically you can make your own ""tasting menu"".2) I guess this could be a larger issues for the hipster that frequents Williamsburg restaurants, but the few people who served my beers could not pour. I'll admit, it wasn't my favorite thing to have to sip through the foam, but I could have just drank out of the bottle they gave me. If this is the only complaint (I feel like that word is somewhat of an exaggeration even) then I will take it!OK now to the good stuff:I made reservations with Rachel a couple weeks in advance since it was my anniversary and I know better than to walk into a restaurant like this on a Saturday night expecting to get seated right away. Surprisingly, there wasn't a wait anyways. Nonetheless, they seated us right away. The server came right over and gave us the full run down. I read the majority of reviews on here so I had a general idea of the ""rules"". I also did a great deal of research by reading all of the articles I could find about Traif - i felt pretty prepared. We both agreed we wanted to get 6 plates (which the server suggested). This review would be way too long if i described what I LOVED about every dish. Just trust me - you won't be disappointed.We ordered:Baratta Pork SlidersTuna TartareSoft Shell CrabPork Friesand the Bacon DonutsSo much good food! I feel like we knew our tastes and we went with very good choices. In the middle of the meal I told my boyfriend that I was so glad we chose Traif because their menu contains dishes that I wouldn't dare to make. You can taste that the chef took pride in his work and the ingredients were super fresh - down the the potato roll that the sliders came on. I will definitely go here again, and probably again after that. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Oh, we went there hungry and left completely full.

"I was really split between a 4 and a 5 star, but decided on a 4 for now until I go back to taste the rest of the menu.So glad I found this gem in Williamsburg! All dishes we tried had some interesting combination of flavors and all turned out to be delicious. - Strawberry Cinnamon Ribs: Sweet and light BBQ flavor mixed well with a hint of spice from the cinnamon. Unlike the typical ribs that are smoky and tangy, this is a light yet flavorful plate of tender ribs that I'll never get sick of eating. Only compliant- couldn't  find any strawberries but instead I spotted pomegranate?- Tuna Tartar w. Eggplant Tempura: I could be biased just because i simply love tuna and eggplant! The mix was unimaginable but turned out to be a delightful experience. Who can resist a plate of well seasoned spicy tuna served on perfectly fried eggplants? Not to mention the sauce on the side...- Sear Foie Gras: WOW it just rocked my world! it is indescribable. You have to try it to believe it.- Berkshire Pork Belly: interesting concept and flavor, but not one of my favorite of the night. The grapefruit puree was awesome...Must Have:Bacon Donuts w. Espresso Ice Cream: Nothing like the sugary donuts you get from the streets. The donut balls were sweetened just enough to keep you eating non-stop... and the chewy interior... and bacon bites... plus espresso ice cream.... I almost wanted to order a second plate to go...Service:Friendly staff who were very attentive as well. We were quickly seated and our food was served reasonably fast. Ambience:Great for dates. Casual and cute. You can even sit at the bar to see the actions behind the kitchen.",4.0
"I went here with a friend from college. The place and the music have out a chill nice vibe. Regarding the food options, I would recommend the tuna tarta, the ribs and the pork belly.

"I have 16 pictures as well as a 725-character note on my phone describing my experience at Traif but even that would not do it any justice.  I made reservations for a party of ten here on a Saturday night for a holiday dinner and we had the 15 course tasting menu.  The gastronomic experience was nothing short of impressive as our group ooh-ed and ahh-ed our way throughout the meal. Some highlights were the seared sea scallops with butternut squash puree, the pork cheek with creamy pearls of couscous, and the tender braised short rib sliders paired with crispy sweet potato frites. The key lime pie that they carried out was just the icing on the cake to a wonderful meal. I have to say that I was a little miffed at first because our table felt extremely rushed when the first 4-5 courses were brought out, but after that it was smooth sailing.  With their unique use of seasonal ingredients, I will definitely be back as I expect the menu changes often.  Also at $40 a person, the price is more than right.",4.0

If this is the only complaint (I feel like that word is somewhat of an exaggeration even) then I will take it!OK now to the good stuff:I made reservations with Rachel a couple weeks in advance since it was my anniversary and I know better than to walk into a restaurant like this on a Saturday night expecting to get seated right away. Surprisingly, there wasn't a wait anyways. Nonetheless, they seated us right away. The server came right over and gave us the full run down. I read the majority of reviews on here so I had a general idea of the ""rules"". I also did a great deal of research by reading all of the articles I could find about Traif - i felt pretty prepared. We both agreed we wanted to get 6 plates (which the server suggested). This review would be way too long if i described what I LOVED about every dish. Just trust me - you won't be disappointed.We ordered:Baratta Pork SlidersTuna TartareSoft Shell CrabPork Friesand the Bacon DonutsSo much good food! I feel like we knew our tastes and we went with very good choices. In the middle of the meal I told my boyfriend that I was so glad we chose Traif because their menu contains dishes that I wouldn't dare to make. You can taste that the chef took pride in his work and the ingredients were super fresh - down the the potato roll that the sliders came on. I will definitely go here again, and probably again after that. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Oh, we went there hungry and left completely full. For two guys who can generally eat a lot - the dishes were paced properly and we did not feel rushed.A well deserved 5 stars from start to finish.",5.0
"Incredible food with even better prices. A local Brookyln gem -- be prepared with an appetite because the food is richer than Donald Trump. Great food, great bear great price, great staff. Certainly a restaurant worth the time (and possibly the commute).",5.0
"Ok, the restaurant is very small. So reservation is a must.Food is very good. Basically this is ""American Tapas"" restaurant. Because the portions are very small and they suggested to order 10-14 (10 would be enough) dishes for my family of 4.I really liked soft shell crab, foie gras, scallops, tuna tartare. These three were exceptional.I also tried pork cheek, baked muenster cheese, chopped chicken liver, short ribs sliders and pork belly.Everything was good.Loved this place!",5.0
"Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious. This is by far one of the most delicious restaurants!There is a FULLY STOCKED BAR - with delicious drinks. Sometimes it gets a little loud in there but the food is worth it! They have an outside seating area although, I have never sat outside but it looks cute. Even if you have reservations you will wait but again WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!!!Their mojitos are so yummy, i get one everytime and they are huge! The food is a whole other story - your taste buds will be in absolute amazement - very unique - they combine amazing flavors together!Spicy tuna tartare ontop of a tempura eggplant - this is a must try!Strawberry glazed ribs with bits of strawberries on thereMelted muenster cheesePulled pork slidersSweet potato fries The calamari was sooooo good and I don't usually eat it,  could not help myself.Warm bacon donuts are a must try, glazed with caramel, sprinkled with bacon bits with a side of some delicious home made ice cream. EVERYONE MUST TRY THIS PLACE AT LEAST ONCE (who am I kidding after you do, you will be coming back again and again!)",5.0
"I was really split between a 4 and a 5 star, but decided on a 4 for now until I go back to taste the rest of the menu.So glad I found this gem in Williamsburg! All dishes we tried had some interesting combination of flavors and all turned out to be delicious. - Strawberry Cinnamon Ribs: Sweet and light BBQ flavor mixed well with a hint of spice from the cinnamon. Unlike the typical ribs that are smoky and tangy, this is a light yet flavorful plate of tender ribs that I'll never get sick of eating. Only compliant- couldn't  find any strawberries but instead I spotted pomegranate?- Tuna Tartar w. Eggplant Tempura: I could be biased just because i simply love tuna and eggplant! The mix was unimaginable but turned out to be a delightful experience. Who can resist a plate of well seasoned spicy tuna served on perfectly fried eggplants? Not to mention the sauce on the side...- Sear Foie Gras: WOW it just rocked my world! it is indescribable. You have to try it to believe it.- Berkshire Pork Belly: interesting concept and flavor, but not one of my favorite of the night. The grapefruit puree was awesome...Must Have:Bacon Donuts w. Espresso Ice Cream: Nothing like the sugary donuts you get from the streets. The donut balls were sweetened just enough to keep you eating non-stop... and the chewy interior... and bacon bites... plus espresso ice cream.... I almost wanted to order a second plate to go...Service:Friendly staff who were very attentive as well. We were quickly seated and our food was served reasonably fast. Ambience:Great for dates. Casual and cute. You can even sit at the bar to see the actions behind the kitchen.",4.0
"I went here with a friend from college. The place and the music have out a chill nice vibe. Regarding the food options, I would recommend the tuna tarta, the ribs and the pork belly. Don't get the asparagus. It was not as what we expected. Lastly, the drinks were fantastic. I got a drink called ""Chinese Medicine"" - definitely tasted better than the name. Would recommend for a chill 2-person dinner.",5.0

"I have 16 pictures as well as a 725-character note on my phone describing my experience at Traif but even that would not do it any justice.  I made reservations for a party of ten here on a Saturday night for a holiday dinner and we had the 15 course tasting menu.  The gastronomic experience was nothing short of impressive as our group ooh-ed and ahh-ed our way throughout the meal. Some highlights were the seared sea scallops with butternut squash puree, the pork cheek with creamy pearls of couscous, and the tender braised short rib sliders paired with crispy sweet potato frites. The key lime pie that they carried out was just the icing on the cake to a wonderful meal. I have to say that I was a little miffed at first because our table felt extremely rushed when the first 4-5 courses were brought out, but after that it was smooth sailing.  With their unique use of seasonal ingredients, I will definitely be back as I expect the menu changes often.  Also at $40 a person, the price is more than right.",4.0

"The food was excellent but the service was horrible. All this place cares about is turning tables. Our waitress spilled water all over our table and on my friend's jacket and failed to realize it because she was so busy. They took our party of 6 early Saturday night, after 2 hours they basically escorted us out before we finished our food. They took our utensils from the table and cleaned up the table while the last desert was coming out. After this horrible service, they charged us 20% tip after tax and had the nerve to ask us for the .83 cents we were short because we paid part cash and card. Even if we miscalculated by .83 cents since we were being rushed, they had the time to ask us for the .83 cents but failed to have the decency to let us finish our deserts?

"I want to give Traif five stars, but had to shave off one because of the slowish service. I am totally impressed that they get so much good food done in such a small space and in a small kitchen, which probably leads to some breaks and service. It's cramped in there, you really can't go with more than a group of four. Bigger tables are in the front or back patio, but otherwise there are mostly two seaters. I made a reservation a week in advance for Friday at 9 PM I came with BF for a celebration. The waitress kindly explained the menu- all small plates style, this lighter items being up top and heavier items being at the bottom.  The recommend 2 dishes per person as a minimum, all to share. There is a lot of variety in the menu which is a huge plus. Unlike what most people think the restaurant is not just about pork having really good seafood, veg, poultry dishes... Didn't see a lot of beef. The menu also changes seasonally. The only thing I wish was that our waitress would have  made recommendations but she was adamant that she didn't play favorites. Funnily, the unorganized service meant that we got two rounds of the amuse bouche. It was a Cajun sweet potato bisque that was really good, it was very spicy and also creamy because of the sweet potato texture. It's refreshing to have a different substantive sampler since most of the time people give you a watermelon gazpacho  to cleanse the palette. I stated with the most popular cocktail; the name escapes me but it had pig in it.  It was spicy and salty with a good bourbon base. Bf had a really nice cab, which was on the dryer versus full bodied side. We had the: Burrata- I love me some good Burrata.  Awesome texture and flavor- it came with reduced balsamic, pistachios, olives, and really good grilled broccoli Rabe. All of the ingredients were the best of the best. The salt-and-pepper rock shrimp, which was sriacha mayo and tempura shrimp. The shrimp was perfectly cooked not too overdone not too undone, and the sauce was really on point. Came with pineapple and sweet potato chunk. The pork belly. I don't eat pork a lot but I couldn't pass this up it's one of traif's best dishes. Of course the pork belly was an excellent cut, so it had the right fat content with the rate crispiness on the outside. Totally melts in your mouth. The fried egg on thick Texas toast with broccoli Rabe, and a thick and flavorful creamy mushroom sauce. Fresh ingredients  again but probably my least favorite dish only because it wasn't as complex and the other things we had. That buttermilk fried quail with cornbread. I think this dishes is usually made with  chicken but I thought that the quail was a nice treat even though it was smaller. I like the dark meat contrast with the crispiness of the buttermilk breading. The cornbread was really flavorful and had a really good sweet buttermilk sauce on top which is surprising because buttermilk is usually sour. Well fried, the dish was very polite. This was the most filling - and towards the end of the menu somewhat like an entrée. For dessert, we went with the world-famous bacon donuts. I really like the donuts as they were dense but still fluffy. The dough used was really good. Bacon bits were sprinkled on top so that wasn't particularly artisanal, but the combination of the saltiness from the bacon bits, the sweet donuts, and the coffee ice cream was a great pairing.We wanted coffee with our dessert but I guess whoever was making it forgot about us and it didn't come until after the donuts. Six dishes are probably overboard as we were so full.  The total cost was $120 after tax and tip, it's a very trendy-hipster vibe, not unlike the neighborhood surrounding. I highly recommend.",4.0

"With 1000 reviews, you really don't need my input...but I've lived in South Williamsburg for years & Traif was strangely one of the few restaurants I haven't eaten at. I've even been to the sister spot Xixa... so now was the time!Traif has quite a reputation, so it was no surprise that it was packed on a weekday night. I did not expect the *noise* in this place to be so horrible. I felt like I was in a sports bar during the Superbowl. It could have just been a freak incident, but at points I could barely enjoy my food because of how rowdy the tables around us were--and I'm no stranger to loud restaurants.Our waitress seemed rushed and disinterested. When asked for suggestions on what's good we received the obligatory unhelpful ""Everything!"". We decided to order six plates, although perhaps it would have been better to get the tasting menu (which seemed like it would have resulted in more plates for roughly the same price per person). The biggest problem with the food was not the food itself...but the timing. Our first dish came out relatively quick, and our second dish came out while we were finishing the first. Then there was a gap where we got our third... then our fourth. And then we waited *30 minutes* for our fifth and sixth plates. Perhaps this seems picky, but at other tapas restaurants (including Xixa) I've always had the plates roll out consistently with no time in between. It felt like we were there for hours. Anyway, the plates:- Scallops in a corn risotto, I believe. Very tasty.- Salad with peaches. Was fine b/c we wanted a veggie plate, but can't really hold a candle next to the other plates.- BBQ sliders with sweet potato fries. This was my FAVORITE. Absolutely balanced sweet/savory sliders.- Spaetzle with mushrooms. Probably my second fav. dish. Very savory without being overly salted like I found some other dishes.- Fried soft shell crab w/ watermelon. Tasty and crunchy, but a little underwhelming and too salty, esp. since it was the most expensive plate on the menu. I'd pass next time.- Baked Muenster cheese. This was actually my least favorite dish (coincidentally I had a baked cheese dip at Xixa and it was my least fav. plate there). Too greasy/oily, although the portions of the dip + crostini + apple slices worked out perfectly, so props for that.Everything was a tad bit oil/salty/greasy in general. Service was inconsistent and when our waitress was back it felt more like ""oh right, you guys are still here"". It's busy, yes, but it's Traif, and it has a reputation, and they should staff accordingly. Definitely was not the special experience I thought it would be between questionable service/noise level/gaps of time between plates. If you're looking for something special/intimate/quiet in the neighborhood, I would try something like Bozu or Marlow or maybe Diner instead.I'd come back just to grab one plate at the bar with a drink if it were super early in the evening, but otherwise my Traif experience is said & done and I have little interest in coming back.",3.0

"I love this place.Food 5/5The food was absolutely amazing here!!!It was recommended we order 8-12 dishes for 4 people. Including dessert, we ordered 11.My absolute faves:Salt and pepper shrimp - sooo flavorful and plump!!BBQ ribs - whatever sauce they out on these fall off the bone ribs... Must be crackPanna cotta - the panna cotta itself was pretty good but the orange tasting ice cream it was paired with was mind blowingPretty damn good:ScallopsBone marrowEscargotKey lime pieBacon doughnuts Slightly disappointed:Pork belly - not fatty enough. I've had better. Also, based on reviews I had very high expectations for this.For four people, 11 dishes, 4 drinks it came out to be about $50 a person. Really not bad considering the quality and variety of food. Can't wait to come back!Atmosphere 3/5It's a hipster restaurant in hipsterville, so you can imagine the crowd. We were seated in the patio in the back, it was extended by adding temporary plastic walls. It was more than sufficiently heated with lamps... it was actually so hot I took my cardigan off. Although I'm happy the extra space can accommodate an extra 4 tables, the heat lamps also casted a red/pink shadow on everything and everyone. Good news: no one can tell you have Asian flush. Bad news: all our food pictures came out red/pink.Service: 3/5I was a little in love with our waitress, she was adorable and just oozed cool with her half shaved head. In a group of 4, we were having a hard time debating if we should do the chef's tasting menu or order separately. However we had a few requests from the tasting menu - no raw fish due to allergies, and our must haves were the pork belly and the BBQ ribs. We were told our requests weren't guaranteed (even though we are supposedly should be granted two requests). After that whole ordeal with feeling uncertain, we just ordered separately.Dishes came out quickly, barely any wait time in between dishes.",4.0
"Two people really amped this place up for me. We had the tasting menu. I am not sure of all the individual items that came out but the one I liked most and like to remember was the sliders and those awesome potato friends. Can I just order 2 sets of those and pig out?The bacon drink wasn't that impressive. I do understand that bacon makes everything taste good, but there is a limit. I like sweet drinks and they really didn't have that much so I ended up requesting some simple syrup to be added to my drink.And for crying out loud those bacon donuts were really not all that. I expected some type of orgasm in my mouth but it just tasted like a eating a salty donut. If they had served the donut with the ice cream, I would not be equally satisfied.

"Came here on a whim on a tuesday and the place was packed (always a good sign) The hostess told us the bar down the block at Xixa (sister restaurant) had a good election of drinks and that they would call us when a table was ready... about 30ish minutes later called and seated (awesome)So i am totally a fan of small plates to share and trait does this perfectly!The short ribs w strawberries, try them.. to the desserts everything was delicious!The service was great very attentive... I would recommend this place for a date night...Deff going back to try the tasting menu!",4.0
"Came here on a Thursday night and as a first timer, I was instantly impressed. First thing's first, I was sat down right away and secondly, the menu looked fantastic with SOOOOOO many good choices to pick from! I ordered three different entrées and every single one was literally finger licking good: the bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates, baked muenster cheese, and the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs. Lastly but certainly not least, you must try the bacon doughnuts to end your dinner! I'm glad I came here and I promise you will too.",5.0
"With 1000 reviews, you really don't need my input...but I've lived in South Williamsburg for years & Traif was strangely one of the few restaurants I haven't eaten at. I've even been to the sister spot Xixa... so now was the time!Traif has quite a reputation, so it was no surprise that it was packed on a weekday night. I did not expect the *noise* in this place to be so horrible. I felt like I was in a sports bar during the Superbowl. It could have just been a freak incident, but at points I could barely enjoy my food because of how rowdy the tables around us were--and I'm no stranger to loud restaurants.Our waitress seemed rushed and disinterested. When asked for suggestions on what's good we received the obligatory unhelpful ""Everything!"". We decided to order six plates, although perhaps it would have been better to get the tasting menu (which seemed like it would have resulted in more plates for roughly the same price per person). The biggest problem with the food was not the food itself...but the timing. Our first dish came out relatively quick, and our second dish came out while we were finishing the first. Then there was a gap where we got our third... then our fourth. And then we waited *30 minutes* for our fifth and sixth plates. Perhaps this seems picky, but at other tapas restaurants (including Xixa) I've always had the plates roll out consistently with no time in between. It felt like we were there for hours. Anyway, the plates:- Scallops in a corn risotto, I believe. Very tasty.- Salad with peaches. Was fine b/c we wanted a veggie plate, but can't really hold a candle next to the other plates.- BBQ sliders with sweet potato fries. This was my FAVORITE. Absolutely balanced sweet/savory sliders.- Spaetzle with mushrooms. Probably my second fav. dish. Very savory without being overly salted like I found some other dishes.- Fried soft shell crab w/ watermelon. Tasty and crunchy, but a little underwhelming and too salty, esp. since it was the most expensive plate on the menu. I'd pass next time.- Baked Muenster cheese. This was actually my least favorite dish (coincidentally I had a baked cheese dip at Xixa and it was my least fav. plate there). Too greasy/oily, although the portions of the dip + crostini + apple slices worked out perfectly, so props for that.Everything was a tad bit oil/salty/greasy in general. Service was inconsistent and when our waitress was back it felt more like ""oh right, you guys are still here"". It's busy, yes, but it's Traif, and it has a reputation, and they should staff accordingly. Definitely was not the special experience I thought it would be between questionable service/noise level/gaps of time between plates. If you're looking for something special/intimate/quiet in the neighborhood, I would try something like Bozu or Marlow or maybe Diner instead.I'd come back just to grab one plate at the bar with a drink if it were super early in the evening, but otherwise my Traif experience is said & done and I have little interest in coming back.",3.0
5 FING STARS BABY! Its so rare to find such a place these days. Very pleasant didning experience. We got a chefs menu. Got stuffed wall to wall. Very nice execution of veriety of different dishes that make you pallet come alive. And at a right price.,5.0
"I love this place.Food 5/5The food was absolutely amazing here!!!It was recommended we order 8-12 dishes for 4 people. Including dessert, we ordered 11.My absolute faves:Salt and pepper shrimp - sooo flavorful and plump!!BBQ ribs - whatever sauce they out on these fall off the bone ribs... Must be crackPanna cotta - the panna cotta itself was pretty good but the orange tasting ice cream it was paired with was mind blowingPretty damn good:ScallopsBone marrowEscargotKey lime pieBacon doughnuts Slightly disappointed:Pork belly - not fatty enough. I've had better. Also, based on reviews I had very high expectations for this.For four people, 11 dishes, 4 drinks it came out to be about $50 a person. Really not bad considering the quality and variety of food. Can't wait to come back!Atmosphere 3/5It's a hipster restaurant in hipsterville, so you can imagine the crowd. We were seated in the patio in the back, it was extended by adding temporary plastic walls. It was more than sufficiently heated with lamps... it was actually so hot I took my cardigan off. Although I'm happy the extra space can accommodate an extra 4 tables, the heat lamps also casted a red/pink shadow on everything and everyone. Good news: no one can tell you have Asian flush. Bad news: all our food pictures came out red/pink.Service: 3/5I was a little in love with our waitress, she was adorable and just oozed cool with her half shaved head. In a group of 4, we were having a hard time debating if we should do the chef's tasting menu or order separately. However we had a few requests from the tasting menu - no raw fish due to allergies, and our must haves were the pork belly and the BBQ ribs. We were told our requests weren't guaranteed (even though we are supposedly should be granted two requests). After that whole ordeal with feeling uncertain, we just ordered separately.Dishes came out quickly, barely any wait time in between dishes.",4.0
"Two people really amped this place up for me. We had the tasting menu. I am not sure of all the individual items that came out but the one I liked most and like to remember was the sliders and those awesome potato friends. Can I just order 2 sets of those and pig out?The bacon drink wasn't that impressive. I do understand that bacon makes everything taste good, but there is a limit. I like sweet drinks and they really didn't have that much so I ended up requesting some simple syrup to be added to my drink.And for crying out loud those bacon donuts were really not all that. I expected some type of orgasm in my mouth but it just tasted like a eating a salty donut. If they had served the donut with the ice cream, I would not be equally satisfied. Again, I know bacon is God's gift to culinary pleasures but ehhh...just give me more potato fries instead.Would I return? not sure. If I am craving sliders and bomb-ass potato fries sure!",3.0

"Grab a couple of your foodcentric friends, come here and order as much of the menu as possible. I joined my wife and a friend of ours about 15 mins late to the party - just in time to see the braised short rib sliders, chicken liver mousse and the hampshire pork belly arriving at the table. Our waitress, a sassy and friendly girl, gave me the ""we've been waiting for you for the longest time"" line. She was funny. I needed a stiff drink to get things going and got the Thai Manhattan,  a delicious rum based cocktail.The initial round of food was very encouraging. The pork belly (5/5) was outstanding - balanced nicely by hearts of palm and a couple of different kinds of citrus. The mildly sweet bbq sauce of the slider (4.5/5), which I pretty much devoured in one bite, sang me a love song. This is what eating is all about. The chicken liver (3.5/5) was pretty decent too.All too soon it was time for another drink and this time I went for the Red Pearl which is like a mojito with a kick. It's a light, refreshing drink which I highly recommend. I was ready for more food. We ended up getting baked muenster cheese with smoked chorizo (5/5), cornmeal crusted soft- shell crabs (4.5/5), whole roasted head-on prawns (4/5),  sautéed sweetbreads (4/5) and the fried chicken (4/5). Every dish was creative and delicious. I'm not going to bother describing each dish as I normally do. It was a meal that needs to be experienced to be understood. Our waitress came by and asked how we were doing. ""Full,"" I said. ""That's what they say until they see the dessert menu,"" came the prompt reply.Almost on cue, we ordered the bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream (5/5). I can't imagine a meal here without getting this.  It summarized my entire experience. There was nothing here that I haven't had before - but it was all presented and prepared in a unique way. We paid about $90 per person all in. Considering the food and alcohol consumed, I thought it was reasonable. We'll be back for more.",5.0

"After having been to Xixa multiple times, I was dying to try Traif. When I finally went, it completely lived up to my rather high expectations. Since there were three of us, we opted for the chef's tasting menu, which at only 45 dollars per person, is pretty reasonable. For that price, you get about 10 small plates to share plus two desserts. You can request a couple of dishes, but the rest will be the chef's choice. We got the following dishes:--sweet potato soup (amuse bouche)--tuna tartare with eggplant tempura--salad with apples and cheese (can't remember which kind)--prawns with Texas toast--baby back ribs--pork belly--fois gras with egg and bacon--skate cheeks--pan seared scallops--short rib sliders--spaetzle with rabbit--vanilla panacotta--bacon donutsOf those, my favorites were the pork belly, scallops, and short rib sliders (and I'm not even a meat lover most of the time). My least favorite was the skate cheeks because it was prepared kung pao style, which I'm not a fan of. Everything was really good, though.We had a reservation because it was a Friday night, but we just got it day of, so my feeling is you could probably wing it and go without one, especially on the early side.I'm sure I'll be back here soon!",5.0

"Hubby threw me an amazing birthday dinner here with 13 of our closest friends. This place is quite small, with an even tinier, open kitchen, but the manager was super accommodating about our reservations.We arrived for our 7pm reservations on a Saturday night and were immediately seated by polite, laid-backed, and uniformly attractive servers. I'd never been to the restaurant before, but had heard about it in several reviews and from my younger brother. The space itself is cozy, dim, and quiet enough to talk comfortably with the people next to you. There's a small ""garden patio"" in the back, where we spied on Mario Batali eating, haha.Every single tapa we had was more amazing than the last (with increasing ""heaviness"" the further you get into the courses). I don't know if it makes sense to even list them out since I'm pretty sure the menu options change regularly. However, my favorites were the tuna tartar on top of an eggplant fritter and the fried chicken. The braised pork belly sliders with sweet potato fries were also a huge hit as well as the strawberry glazed pork ribs (melt in your mouth texture). Supposedly the chef is Jewish (I wonder how he feels about the big pig and heart emblem for the restaurant) and he threw in a few kosher items to the tasting. EVERYTHING was delicious. The bacon donuts with coffee ice cream at the end was my favorite dessert - such a great riff on a breakfast classic. The wine list here is surprisingly expensive, given the value for the food. I instead opted for one of their excellent $10 cocktails, the ""the long count"" with old overholt rye, lemon, mole bitters, caramelized pineapple morita shrub. (it was the caramelized pineapple that won me over). Highly recommend! I especially loved the refreshing little ice chunks that were in it. I also tried ""the dutch apple cider"" which was also good, but not quite as good as the long count.Because we were a larger party, we were given the $40/pp 9 course tasting meal + 2 desserts. Really great value for an exceptional meal. Our one note of complaint is that they were having trouble with their credit card machine at the end of the night and it took 30 minutes to sort it out. Kind of a drag since we were trying to get out of there, but I don't think it was the server's fault.",5.0

"4.5. So I really liked this place. I couldn't find too many things wrong with the dishes. Admittedly, the dishes are on the heavier side, but hey, their sign outside is a fat pig. The place is dimly lit, but it has a very upbeat ambience. We started with the whole-roasted head-on pink prawns, with black truffles, cognac, spring onions, and foie gras toast. 99% of the time, I hate eating shell-on shrimp. I just hate working for my food, especially sauced crustaceans. Somehow I end up forearm deep in sauce and I end up just wanting to take a shower. Regardless of the effort, it was worth it - very flavorful and delicious. I especially liked the foie gras toast. Because it's foie gras toast. Come on. Which is now illegal to serve in my home state of California. So sad. We moved on to a thick cut of pork belly covered in apples and persimmon, I think. Whatever it was, the apple-pork belly combo stole the show. It gave a great crisp, fresh, counterpunch to the heavier, fattier pork. I wished there had been more apples on it. My friend and I kind of started dueling over the remaining slices of fruit. I found Joe's chopped chicken livers with balsamic-bacon toasts, rosemary & shallots to be the only real disappointing dish. My friend liked it, but I prefer my chopped livers to be really flavorful, and I found it to be on the bland side. Oh and the bacon donuts? Awesome.",4.0

"This is my all-time favorite south willy restaurant. Yes the food is always amazing (how they do that in that itty bitty kitchen is beyond me). Yes the ambiance is cozy, especially the heated patio (nice in summer or winter). Yes, it's worth calling a couple weeks in advance and bringing your out-of-town visitors, friends, family, hot date. But more than anything the service is impeccable. I have this annoying nickel allergy where I can't eat canned goods. You can't imagine how difficult this makes dining out. I get everything from people lying to me (wake up to a bad surprise a few hours later when the hives appear) to waiters who don't want to take the risk and just tell me I can't have anything but salad or white rice.

"Hubby threw me an amazing birthday dinner here with 13 of our closest friends. This place is quite small, with an even tinier, open kitchen, but the manager was super accommodating about our reservations.We arrived for our 7pm reservations on a Saturday night and were immediately seated by polite, laid-backed, and uniformly attractive servers. I'd never been to the restaurant before, but had heard about it in several reviews and from my younger brother. The space itself is cozy, dim, and quiet enough to talk comfortably with the people next to you. There's a small ""garden patio"" in the back, where we spied on Mario Batali eating, haha.Every single tapa we had was more amazing than the last (with increasing ""heaviness"" the further you get into the courses).

"After spending a long weekend in NYC, the award for best dish was a tie between the miso black cod from Nobu and the butterfish from here at Traif. Pretty high marks after going to lots of great NY restaurants. After mistakenly going into XIXA, Traif's sister restaurant, we found Traif and were promptly seated. Traif was jam packed on a Friday night and had a great energy. Small open kitchen where you can see all the magic happen. How one chef and his assistants can cook for so many people still baffles me.You must get the butterfish. Like it's name, it was buttery soft with a bit of avocado and a really flavorful oil. Should have ordered a few of these but it was worth it to try some more of the menu.The pork belly was perfectly cooked and a large portion. Hard to cut since it was a slab, but otherwise excellent. One scallop I ate contained a giant piece of sand or something else that was hard, which ruined the experience for me, but otherwise I didn't find the dish cooked well or that flavorful anyways. The sliders were pretty standard. Very sweet with soft short rib. The cockels were the most interesting dish we had. Though my date loved them, I wasn't a fan of the broth. You don't see cockels on most menus, so if you like them I'd say go for it.Traif provided a pretty excellent meal for a good price. Lots of interesting and unique items for anyone's taste.",4.0
"Just enjoyed our one year wedding anniversary dinner here, and it was perfection. They agreed to let us order the chef's tasting menu (11 courses including dessert), which is typically reserved for parties of 3 or larger. This is when I said goodbye to 12 years of vegetarianism, and hello to the best dining experience of my adult life.Some highlights from the enormous tasting menu: seared scallops with corn risotto, spicy tuna tartare over eggplant tempura, short rib sliders, and key lime pie. These were just the absolute highlights, but everything was delicious and memorable. Our waitress was so sweet and brought us champagne for the dessert courses. Service here was also phenomenal, and it really complimented the amazing food. Definitely go here. Tasting menu is $50 per person, and it was absolutely worth it. So much food, so much variety, and so much thought and care for their patrons. Love it.",5.0
"I had been meaning to come here after all the raves and amazing reviews. Finally trekked all the way to the unknown land to me that is Brooklyn.Everyone claims that this is their favorite restaurant. I have to say some of the dishes are amazingly impressive. There was a complimentary gazpacho to start, which was very creamy and interesting in taste. I was really starting to like the flavors of this place! Then we ordered. Boy was the menu confusing! we couldn't tell when the descriptions started and when the title ended. They should work on the menu clarity a bit. We then proceeded to order the following dishes: -Seared Scallops with corn risotto- Amazing. This dish by far was my favorite. So creamy and bold in taste-Short Rib sliders- I liked it, but overall I felt a little meh about it. The sweet potato fries could also have had a little more work into it. Somehow I feel like it wasn't the best dish-Spaetzle- This was a little disappointing. I had never heard of spaetzle and tried it for the first time. This was lacking in the boldness and originality. This was a bit too bland for my taste-Seared Foie Gras- I am also a little biased over this as I have had what I thought was the best Foie Gras done in New Orleans. This was good, but it did not measure up to my expectations...unfortunately-Bacon Donuts- This was the highlight of the show. Amazing! Paired witht he coffee ice cream, this is the signature front of Traif. The savoriness of the bacon was subtle and brought out the sweetness of the glazed donuts. Really wonderful! Overall, I was impressed by thsi restaurant and would definitely give Xixa a shot. Till then, I don't think I will be back in Brooklyn for a while!",4.0
"Had a great birthday dinner there with boy. Opted for a la carte, as the min for pre fixe is 3 people, but all in all it probably netted out to about the same price...and we were super full. I have to preface I'm a food snob and usually look to fancypants pinky out Michelin starred restaurants for celebratory dinners, but I had been hearing a lot about Traif and figured it was as good a time as any to give it a whirl...so glad I did. I can honestly say if I had to order again I would not have passed up on anything. Heck I'd go back and order an identical meal and be just as happy. The best salt and pepper shrimp I've ever had. That's saying something. I actually can't remember dessert (did I have it? Or was it just too much birthday cocktails...?) so it might have been the lowlight, shrouded by the knockout mains. I was pleasantly surprised how casual the environment was. Amazing food + casual ambiance (read: no high heels necessary) + moderate prices = me likey.",5.0
Went here for my friend's 21 birthday dinner almost a year ago. It was a fun atmosphere. The food was really good. The drinks are unique. It's just too crowed. I went with a party of 5. We ordered lots of dishes and shared everything. I recommend going here with a group of people.,4.0
"It pains me to write this review, but the experience stuck so sourly (or shall I say, the taste of the food) that I must share. I used to enjoy Traif at it's very beginning, for both brunch and late night dinners, and continued to go for years, even sending all of my out of town friends there and recommending them to anyone looking for a nice, affordable, culinary experience in BK. I moved away and hadn't been to the place in over a year. Took some friends the other night, raving about the food and ambiance all the while to get there and leave sordidly unsatisfied and disappointed. First of all, we called in an hour before to get a res for four of us, to which the hostess said it wouldn't be a problem and that she would make something work, to when we arrived, keeping us waiting in the front area, whilst making us feel like we were a huge hindrance. Mind you, I work in the service industry on the weekends and we all know that the hostess is the first and last person you see, the beginning and ending of a dining experience. Well, lets just say again, the taste was sour after insisting that we actually didn't want to go down the street to their sister restaurant (if we did want Mexican food, we would have stayed in Bushwick where I can find the best) and were finally seated. Might I add that the restaurant had a slew of empty tables. We ordered at least 15 plates, none of which were memorable, sadly. The complimentary shots of soup that they are known to give are sometimes some of the most tasteful bits of the experience in between courses. This time, it was an overly cinnamon seasoned soup of sorts. The short ribs were dry and uneventful with bits of random strawberry slewn on the side of the plate. The tuna tartar was overly doused in mayonnaise (one of my fav condiments) that really, it could have been anything but tuna.  Bacon wrapped dates were dry and shriveled, no taste of bleu cheese to be tasted. Pork belly was okay but again, used to be one of my fav dishes and was not at it's usual. There was one breaded dish of a unknown protein with a lentil like paste beneath it that tasted and smelled off. The prawns and rabe were enjoyable. Bacon doughnuts were not a balanced flavor of salt and sweet as they should be. The two bottles of pricey wine were the best part of the meal. Service was friendly but contrived and cheesy to the point of cringe and food took a very long time.   Left hungry and embarrassed for having raved so passionately about the food beforehand. Will not be going back to Traif nor recommending it to anyone, ever again. There are many other restaurants in the area doing the same thing with much better ambiance and quality, affordable food. I think the hype got the best of the quality of the food, unfortunately. Another one bites the dust (dollar). Adieu Traif",3.0

"Exceeded expectations. Came here with my visiting parents and husband -- all foodies -- and loved absolutely everything we ate. Not only was the food one of the best meals I've had in the city, it was also beautifully presented. Pacing was perfect as well. A very memorable experience, perfect for mother's day weekend.Other plusses - beautiful atmosphere. Love the intimacy - we sat out in the garden. Inside you can watch the chef cooking -- really impressive to watch.In addition to all this, our waitress handled my husband's (numerous) food allergies spectacularly! I cannot express how grateful I am that we can enjoy fabulous food safely at such an innovative restaurant - (many exciting ingredients involved in the food) and Traif was totally on top of everything. Not only earned my tastebuds' approval but also my trust.",5.0
"Wow I love Traif. I think this place may be one of my new favs. I've been dying to try it out - seriously the dude with the panty dropper review killed me haha The place is relatively small so make a reservation for sure if you plan to visit on a weekend. We were sat quickly and the service was good. I wouldn't say it was overly memorable service but the food.... Ghaaaa SO tasty. There are a really good selection of menu items and the waitress told us they are listed from light to heavy and served ""family style"". I would say it is between tapas and family style because the portions aren't huge but definitely more filling than you expect. Everything is very well priced though - terrific value. They bring things out as they are ready versus all at once which is really nice. Between the two of us we ordered 6 plates and a bottle of wine... I so wanted to dessert but I was legit stuffed. We had the foie gras, butterfish, pork belly, cinnamon ribs, BBQ short rib sliders and baked cheese with chorizo. SO GOOD. The best were the BBQ short rib sliders and the butterfish - the least favorite was the cinnamon ribs and pork belly. The pork belly was super fatty, I would have figured they would have rendered that down a bit. The butterfish was amazing and by now you all should know I am not a fish person... maybe brooklyn's finest is turning me into one though.. dun dun dunnnn Anyway the chorizo cheese was heavenly too but hey - melted cheese is pretty boss always in my book. My bf actually came back for work dinner the other day and had an equally awesome experience and got to try just about everything on the menu. He mentioned the sweetbreads weren't the best but the crab totally rocked. I would DEFINITELY go back... ok see you tomorrow.",5.0
"AMAZING! I went once and ordered off the menu, and then the 2nd time we ordered the chef's tasting menu. it is incredible. definitely open yourself up to trying something you may not think you will like because they will really surprise you and not let you down. Must get: pork belly, baby back ribs, scallops, foie gras and of course, the bacon doughnuts.",5.0
"After spending a long weekend in NYC, the award for best dish was a tie between the miso black cod from Nobu and the butterfish from here at Traif. Pretty high marks after going to lots of great NY restaurants. After mistakenly going into XIXA, Traif's sister restaurant, we found Traif and were promptly seated. Traif was jam packed on a Friday night and had a great energy. Small open kitchen where you can see all the magic happen. How one chef and his assistants can cook for so many people still baffles me.You must get the butterfish. Like it's name, it was buttery soft with a bit of avocado and a really flavorful oil. Should have ordered a few of these but it was worth it to try some more of the menu.The pork belly was perfectly cooked and a large portion. Hard to cut since it was a slab, but otherwise excellent. One scallop I ate contained a giant piece of sand or something else that was hard, which ruined the experience for me, but otherwise I didn't find the dish cooked well or that flavorful anyways. The sliders were pretty standard. Very sweet with soft short rib. The cockels were the most interesting dish we had. Though my date loved them, I wasn't a fan of the broth. You don't see cockels on most menus, so if you like them I'd say go for it.Traif provided a pretty excellent meal for a good price. Lots of interesting and unique items for anyone's taste.",4.0
"Just enjoyed our one year wedding anniversary dinner here, and it was perfection. They agreed to let us order the chef's tasting menu (11 courses including dessert), which is typically reserved for parties of 3 or larger. This is when I said goodbye to 12 years of vegetarianism, and hello to the best dining experience of my adult life.Some highlights from the enormous tasting menu: seared scallops with corn risotto, spicy tuna tartare over eggplant tempura, short rib sliders, and key lime pie. These were just the absolute highlights, but everything was delicious and memorable. Our waitress was so sweet and brought us champagne for the dessert courses. Service here was also phenomenal, and it really complimented the amazing food. Definitely go here. Tasting menu is $50 per person, and it was absolutely worth it. So much food, so much variety, and so much thought and care for their patrons. Love it.",5.0
"I had been meaning to come here after all the raves and amazing reviews. Finally trekked all the way to the unknown land to me that is Brooklyn.Everyone claims that this is their favorite restaurant. I have to say some of the dishes are amazingly impressive. There was a complimentary gazpacho to start, which was very creamy and interesting in taste. I was really starting to like the flavors of this place! Then we ordered. Boy was the menu confusing! we couldn't tell when the descriptions started and when the title ended. They should work on the menu clarity a bit. We then proceeded to order the following dishes: -Seared Scallops with corn risotto- Amazing. This dish by far was my favorite. So creamy and bold in taste-Short Rib sliders- I liked it, but overall I felt a little meh about it. The sweet potato fries could also have had a little more work into it. Somehow I feel like it wasn't the best dish-Spaetzle- This was a little disappointing. I had never heard of spaetzle and tried it for the first time. This was lacking in the boldness and originality. This was a bit too bland for my taste-Seared Foie Gras- I am also a little biased over this as I have had what I thought was the best Foie Gras done in New Orleans. This was good, but it did not measure up to my expectations...unfortunately-Bacon Donuts- This was the highlight of the show. Amazing! Paired witht he coffee ice cream, this is the signature front of Traif. The savoriness of the bacon was subtle and brought out the sweetness of the glazed donuts. Really wonderful! Overall, I was impressed by thsi restaurant and would definitely give Xixa a shot. Till then, I don't think I will be back in Brooklyn for a while!",4.0
"Had a great birthday dinner there with boy. Opted for a la carte, as the min for pre fixe is 3 people, but all in all it probably netted out to about the same price...and we were super full. I have to preface I'm a food snob and usually look to fancypants pinky out Michelin starred restaurants for celebratory dinners, but I had been hearing a lot about Traif and figured it was as good a time as any to give it a whirl...so glad I did. I can honestly say if I had to order again I would not have passed up on anything. Heck I'd go back and order an identical meal and be just as happy. The best salt and pepper shrimp I've ever had. That's saying something. I actually can't remember dessert (did I have it? Or was it just too much birthday cocktails...?) so it might have been the lowlight, shrouded by the knockout mains. I was pleasantly surprised how casual the environment was. Amazing food + casual ambiance (read: no high heels necessary) + moderate prices = me likey.",5.0
Went here for my friend's 21 birthday dinner almost a year ago. It was a fun atmosphere. The food was really good. The drinks are unique. It's just too crowed. I went with a party of 5. We ordered lots of dishes and shared everything. I recommend going here with a group of people.,4.0
"It pains me to write this review, but the experience stuck so sourly (or shall I say, the taste of the food) that I must share. I used to enjoy Traif at it's very beginning, for both brunch and late night dinners, and continued to go for years, even sending all of my out of town friends there and recommending them to anyone looking for a nice, affordable, culinary experience in BK. I moved away and hadn't been to the place in over a year. Took some friends the other night, raving about the food and ambiance all the while to get there and leave sordidly unsatisfied and disappointed. First of all, we called in an hour before to get a res for four of us, to which the hostess said it wouldn't be a problem and that she would make something work, to when we arrived, keeping us waiting in the front area, whilst making us feel like we were a huge hindrance. Mind you, I work in the service industry on the weekends and we all know that the hostess is the first and last person you see, the beginning and ending of a dining experience. Well, lets just say again, the taste was sour after insisting that we actually didn't want to go down the street to their sister restaurant (if we did want Mexican food, we would have stayed in Bushwick where I can find the best) and were finally seated. Might I add that the restaurant had a slew of empty tables. We ordered at least 15 plates, none of which were memorable, sadly. The complimentary shots of soup that they are known to give are sometimes some of the most tasteful bits of the experience in between courses. This time, it was an overly cinnamon seasoned soup of sorts. The short ribs were dry and uneventful with bits of random strawberry slewn on the side of the plate. The tuna tartar was overly doused in mayonnaise (one of my fav condiments) that really, it could have been anything but tuna.  Bacon wrapped dates were dry and shriveled, no taste of bleu cheese to be tasted. Pork belly was okay but again, used to be one of my fav dishes and was not at it's usual. There was one breaded dish of a unknown protein with a lentil like paste beneath it that tasted and smelled off. The prawns and rabe were enjoyable. Bacon doughnuts were not a balanced flavor of salt and sweet as they should be. The two bottles of pricey wine were the best part of the meal. Service was friendly but contrived and cheesy to the point of cringe and food took a very long time.   Left hungry and embarrassed for having raved so passionately about the food beforehand. Will not be going back to Traif nor recommending it to anyone, ever again. There are many other restaurants in the area doing the same thing with much better ambiance and quality, affordable food. I think the hype got the best of the quality of the food, unfortunately. Another one bites the dust (dollar). Adieu Traif",3.0
"Order anything! You won't regret it. My friends and I tried the sliders, the broccoli rabe, the pork belly, the pork cheek, some cheese dish, and the maple bacon donuts with coffee ice cream. We loved everything! Definitely coming back!",5.0
"Exceeded expectations. Came here with my visiting parents and husband -- all foodies -- and loved absolutely everything we ate. Not only was the food one of the best meals I've had in the city, it was also beautifully presented. Pacing was perfect as well. A very memorable experience, perfect for mother's day weekend.Other plusses - beautiful atmosphere. Love the intimacy - we sat out in the garden. Inside you can watch the chef cooking -- really impressive to watch.In addition to all this, our waitress handled my husband's (numerous) food allergies spectacularly! I cannot express how grateful I am that we can enjoy fabulous food safely at such an innovative restaurant - (many exciting ingredients involved in the food) and Traif was totally on top of everything. Not only earned my tastebuds' approval but also my trust.",5.0
"Wow I love Traif. I think this place may be one of my new favs. I've been dying to try it out - seriously the dude with the panty dropper review killed me haha The place is relatively small so make a reservation for sure if you plan to visit on a weekend. We were sat quickly and the service was good. I wouldn't say it was overly memorable service but the food.... Ghaaaa SO tasty. There are a really good selection of menu items and the waitress told us they are listed from light to heavy and served ""family style"". I would say it is between tapas and family style because the portions aren't huge but definitely more filling than you expect. Everything is very well priced though - terrific value. They bring things out as they are ready versus all at once which is really nice. Between the two of us we ordered 6 plates and a bottle of wine... I so wanted to dessert but I was legit stuffed. We had the foie gras, butterfish, pork belly, cinnamon ribs, BBQ short rib sliders and baked cheese with chorizo. SO GOOD. The best were the BBQ short rib sliders and the butterfish - the least favorite was the cinnamon ribs and pork belly. The pork belly was super fatty, I would have figured they would have rendered that down a bit. The butterfish was amazing and by now you all should know I am not a fish person... maybe brooklyn's finest is turning me into one though.. dun dun dunnnn Anyway the chorizo cheese was heavenly too but hey - melted cheese is pretty boss always in my book.

"Got here late on a Thursday night and am glad we were able to eat some good food this late!We started off with their roasted carrot and greens salad.  It was mostly greens with little pieces of carrots and it was all pretty good.  We also got thier pork belly which was a large slab of pork belly, soft and tender.The best dish I thought was the duck confit, it was probably one of the best duck legs I've had.  Super crispy skin, really moist meat served with risotto I think.  Awesome.  Their pork ribs were really tender, fall-off-the-bone tender with a crispy outside.  The strawberry BBQ sauce I thought was just OK, but I really liked the meat.  They gave us an amuse bouche of spiced lentil soup and cubes of pineapple for dessert.  Really good!",4.0
"Traif is an intensely trendy eatery capitalising on the current small plate craze that manages to deliver on a fair part of the hype it has garnered of late.The dining room is cramped, with the table where I was seated mere inches from the entrance on one side and the neighbouring table on the other.  To reach the cramped restroom requires walking through the service station, which is rather awkward.  Otherwise, Traif is clean and cozy, if a bit on the dark side; with an open kitchen set like a horseshoe into one side of the main room, bordered by a counter and chairs.  There is a patio in the back, as well.The majority of dishes are very well prepared, cleanly plated and appropriately seasoned.  The mission figs, the chicken liver pate, day boat scallops, the sweetbreads, tuna tartare, and pork belly all should be staples of any visit.  The chilled green pea and mint soup amuse bouche delivered to the table gratis was delectable.  Others, however, tend toward an awkward conflict between overly salty components sharing a plate with sadly under seasoned ones.  The mixto fritto comes to mind, with the delicately breaded oysters wanting for some salt and pepper, whilst the roasted Brussels sprouts on which they were bedded could have been used to cure meats. Another unfortunate standout was the strawberry-cinnamon baby back ribs, which demonstrated an unmitigated sweetness that was not the refresher it could have been amongst it's savoury companions.The highlight of the meal, truth be told, was our server; a young woman of inestimable joie de vivre and an eagerness to please her guests that entirely belied her diminutive stature. She was attentive, efficient, and made for a very pleasant dining experience.While perhaps on the steeper side for it's immediate environs (discounting it's sister establishment less than a block away), and perhaps even for the inconsistent use of salt, Traif is nonetheless a very tasty destination at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge.",3.0

"Don't even know where to begin.. I heard so much great things about Traif and I have bookmarked this place for a long time..Since my best friend is coming for training in NYC.. Traif just came into my mind and I decided to call them and see whether I can get a reservation.. They mixed up my reservation.. I requested for Saturday 6.30 but they gave me Friday instead.. which I was glad that they called earlier and change my reservation back to Saturday but 6pm instead.. We were late for our reservation because you know how lovely the MTA service is during weekends!! oh well.. I am gad we did not hit the ""rush hour"" at Traif.. There were still lots of tables empty but as soon as it hits 7pm.. The restaurant is full..So they recommended 2-4 dish per person.. but as for girls.. we decided to order 4 dishes total + BACON DONUT!!! So here is what we ordered:- tuna tartare (5/5).. I see plates and plates coming out and I guess it's also being served in one of the items in the chef's menu.. this is our favorite dish.. The tuna tartare was coat with some spicy and sweet sauce on top of a fried egg plant.. My friend was joking about asking it for a ""REFILL"".. - baked clams (4.5/5).. with some edamame and corns.. The baked clams were really good just not as yummy as the tuna tartare.. The clams was baked till the perfect texture and I think it was baked with some honey sauce? I don't know.. but it was still awesome to enjoy..- strawberry glazed baby pork ribs (4/5).. Mmm.. sounds amazing already.. yeah.. it tasted like honey bbq to me.. I still personally prefer pork ribs from some other places but the strawberry glazed was slightly unique.. sweet and just the perfect texture to enjoy it.. and it wasn't as sweet as you thought..- butter fish (3/5).. this was our least favorite because a part of the fish was not as ""smooth""/""tender"".. or whatever the word is.. you get me.. I thought butter fish was supposed to be really easy to eat and swallow but the butter fish here was just not I expected.. but it was still good enough not to complain.. It feels like ""medium rare"" texture to me.. Can we enjoy butter fish that's not cooked? hmm.. I am not surel.. I thought only red meat that are allowed to eat it raw.. oh.. White tuna can be eaten raw too..Finally.. we cannot leave without trying the BACON DONUT.. so my friend told me how disgusting it will be.. like bacon chocolate.. she hasn't try it and dare not try it.. I YELLED in the restaurant and said that bacon chocolate is the best thing on earth.. so since she said she trusted me.. she decided to give bacon donut a try!! So she gave me a look.. and she was like ""SO DELICIOUS""... and yes.. I successfully convince her to try it.. and she wants MORE!! The bacon donut was unlike other donuts.. it was some dough coat with some sweet sauce and top with some crispy bacon.. the bacon gave the sweetness a KICK.. and yes.. that's the famous BACON DONUT.. don't just read my review.. GO TRY IT!! you won't regret.. If you count calories just forget about counting it.. I SAID IT's WORTH IT!!Other than that.. before dinner was served.. we were both given a complimentary asparagus soup.. it was cold and unique.. I like it.. it was served in a shot glass..

"I had been dying to try this place and it was worth the wait.  They are- obviously- known for pork and it did not disappoint.  Pork belly and baby back ribs were succulent yet not heavy.  Other dishes included blistered shishito peppers- a must- and a creamy yet delicate pasta with sausage.  They do veggies really well- nicely roasted carrots and brussel sprouts rounded out the selections.  I had heard about the bacon doughnuts and tried them, of course.  Perhaps I was expecting more...they are on the savory side, and that perhaps threw me off a bit.  They were very light and very good and definitely worth the try.  THE SERVICE IN THIS RESTAURANT IS REMARKABLE!  I have never seen such an attentive staff.  If you've been wanting to visit Traif, go now!",5.0

"I couldn't stop thinking about my experience at Traif last night, so I figured if I wrote it down (aka a Yelp review) it would help. I'm still not hungry the day after.Embarked on the Chef's Selection - and WOW. I think it's around 10-11 dishes?Here's the deal, when you have so many dishes to sample, I really don't like pitting each one against one another. I would be happy having any of them as a meal, but we're New Yorkers and we have to be super picky. And food snobs. SO:Some highlights:- The Scallops with Risotto were probably my personal favorite. I had to close my eyes and smile when I ate this. Could not participate in any conversation.- The Short Rib Sliders. A comfort food classic that was yummy. If you are not an adventurous eater, go with this (unless you're a vegetarian. Good Luck.) Also, you can never go wrong with Sweet Potato Fries. - Spicy Bigeye Tuna Tartare with Tempura Japanese Eggplant. This one may have been out-shined by the scallops, but still fantastic. - The Bacon Marmalade that came with the bread. I need to find jars of this stuff.Wait, so you say everything is fantastic? Please be more judgmental. Ok sure here you go:- The Strawberry Cinnamon Ribs were a bit on the dry side. I really liked the sauce, but the meat itself was very dry. Maybe I got a not-so-good rib? My foodie friend across the table might've snagged the better one.- Sweetbreads. God I thought this was bread that was sweetened. Nope. This is foie gras + 10. I had one bite, and that was enough. It was good, but it is so rich, and with the added mushroom cream sauce it was overkill for me. But foodie friend licked the plate clean.DESSERTYes. Bacon Doughnuts. Please get it. If nothing else. It's like visiting Paris and not seeing the Eiffel Tower. Just do it. **REMINDER** Traif's menu is seasonal, so while there are some year-round favorites (I would assume) it's constantly changing/morphing. Which is great because you can go there again and again and never have exactly the same meal :D",5.0
I liked everything here except for the strawberry glazed ribs. Its probably a personal preference that I do not like sweetish meats. I thoroughly enjoyed everything else we ate. Some well balanced amazingly fresh food. Loved the complimentary soup as an appetizer.,4.0
"Great food and date spot. Waitress who helped our table was super nice and helpful when it came to choosing meals.The tartar and the ribs were my two favorites, and the donuts for dessert are a must.The food did take a little while to come out, however. And it seems like there's only one or two waitresses handling all the tables even on a busy night, so sometimes it'll be hard to grab their attention when you need something. Otherwise, this is a great restaurant.",4.0
"Did the tasting menu. New to the neighborhood, heard this was great. Reviews didn't do it justice. The tasting menu was the way to go, and they even let us tailor it slightly to get two dishes off the menu we really liked. I heard it was a pain in the ass to get a reservation but lucked in that they had a cancellation on a Friday. Place was packed when we left at 10 pm. Ribs and pork belly are a must, as are the sliders. Those sliders were ""slap yo mamma"" good... For me to slap my mamma, it's gotta be good. My only complaint - and I did have one - were the Ribs and pork, while really good, were slightly over cooked. Would've been nice for them to be a little more rare. But it wasn't terrible. Our server was training someone that night and he was so spot on in his reference of what we would like and even sent us an extra dessert. Atmosphere is LOUD, if you don't like that, don't go to this place because it's boisterous. If you're lame or a wet blanket, find somewhere else to go. Like this place, don't hesitate...",5.0
"I went on Monday at about 9 pm and the place was packed, but I was greeted by a nice gentleman who sat me in a cozy table in the back. The ambiance is amazing with small plates meant for sharing and tasty bites to eat that just feel like heaven exploded in my mouth. I had a lot of fun with my girlfriend; the drinks were a bit sugary but overall the food was amazing. If you are planning to go here, I would definitely suggest getting a reservation beforehand because they get packed pretty quickly. And the menu is ever changing but what I had that day was just amazing: ribs in wine sauce and my girlfriend had short ribs with lemon sauce. I definitely would be coming back in the future.",4.0
"Experience was very ""meh."" Waitress was gregarious and funny, but got our orders wrong more than once. Food was lackluster and without flavor for what is, I mean for a pork leaning restaurant, how can the food lack taste? Also, really pricey for the portions. Won't be returning.",2.0
"Called to make a reservation on Wednesday for the following Wednesday. I was told that they had my res, and I would be called back with confirmation eventually. OK. Didnt hear back, so I called on Friday. The woman I spoke with told me not to worry they would get back to me soon, but they may have to change my reservation time, to ""something more convenient for the restaurant"". Needless to say they never got back to me. Triste.This is for a BBQ joint!?!! No worries, Fatty Cue confirmed my res immediately on Open Table. Quality of TRAIF experience = POOR",1.0
"Definitely a go-to when we come to visit family in Brooklyn. While Traif showcases a variety of delicious new American food, I argue that they specialize in all things pork,  from the apps to the bacon donut dessert.Traif will remain on my top ten list of Brooklyn restaurants until I can find another pork replacement!",5.0
"I had been dying to try this place and it was worth the wait.  They are- obviously- known for pork and it did not disappoint.  Pork belly and baby back ribs were succulent yet not heavy.  Other dishes included blistered shishito peppers- a must- and a creamy yet delicate pasta with sausage.  They do veggies really well- nicely roasted carrots and brussel sprouts rounded out the selections.  I had heard about the bacon doughnuts and tried them, of course.  Perhaps I was expecting more...they are on the savory side, and that perhaps threw me off a bit.  They were very light and very good and definitely worth the try.  THE SERVICE IN THIS RESTAURANT IS REMARKABLE!  I have never seen such an attentive staff.  If you've been wanting to visit Traif, go now!",5.0
"This was my first time here, and the experience was great.  This is a place that you wouldn't want to visit alone. Each Tapa feeds aleast 4. You can definitely save $$ this way.  The service was exceptional. The food was brought out in a timely manner; and the waitress checked on us a few times but not too much that one would be annoyed. I would definitely come back again.",5.0
"I couldn't stop thinking about my experience at Traif last night, so I figured if I wrote it down (aka a Yelp review) it would help. I'm still not hungry the day after.Embarked on the Chef's Selection - and WOW. I think it's around 10-11 dishes?Here's the deal, when you have so many dishes to sample, I really don't like pitting each one against one another. I would be happy having any of them as a meal, but we're New Yorkers and we have to be super picky. And food snobs. SO:Some highlights:- The Scallops with Risotto were probably my personal favorite. I had to close my eyes and smile when I ate this. Could not participate in any conversation.- The Short Rib Sliders. A comfort food classic that was yummy. If you are not an adventurous eater, go with this (unless you're a vegetarian. Good Luck.) Also, you can never go wrong with Sweet Potato Fries. - Spicy Bigeye Tuna Tartare with Tempura Japanese Eggplant. This one may have been out-shined by the scallops, but still fantastic. - The Bacon Marmalade that came with the bread. I need to find jars of this stuff.Wait, so you say everything is fantastic?

"Completely disappointed in our 130$ meal.First upon arriving 10 minutes early for my reservation I was told that I had to wait in the entryway.  I said I'd like to get a drink at the bar and was told the bar seating is reserved (there were 4 empty stools as well as empty tables) so I said I'd stand, to which she said no I can't do that but that I could go out in the pouring rain again to their ""sister restaurant"" for my drink.  um ok?  Really odd.  But my date arrived we were sat and here is where things really got shitty.I have never felt so RUSHED in all my dining experiences.  From the moment we sat our server was rushing us, throwing menus down and coming back literally 30 seconds later to take a drink order...um you just threw down an extensive cocktail menu and a menu with a bunch of wine on it, can we have maybe a minute to decide.  Same thing with the food ordering.  ABRUPT AND RUSHED.  (BTW the place was not busy, the 6 top by us remained empty the entire time we were there, and when I went to the bathroom I noticed there were also 2 empty 2 tops which really irked me since we were being so rushed).Now to the food: we were told to order 5 dishes (it's shared plates) so that's what we did.Beet salad: underdressed if it were dressed at all, except for the few beets it was flavorless Salt and Pepper Shrimp: awful, my one shrimp wasn't even deveined.  And I was expecting salt and pepper style and it was more sweet and sour.  no crunch , the breading was all mushy. short rib sliders with sweet potato frys: this was the best thing we ordered which isn't saying much, tasty but nothing to write home about.Burrata: ridiculously small portion for the price, we weren't keen on the sauce either, again not much flavor.Gnocci: this maybe disappointed me the most, just very bland, obviously rolled out then cut - not how they should be prepared but I guess they must be rushed in the kitchen too.Donut: give me a break.  4 little crispy cream chunks that didn't even add up to a whole donut sprinkled with bacos and a spoonful of coffee ice cream.  a joke.Now as I said we were rushed all the way through the meal.  waiter rushing our ordering, bussers trying to take plates away we were obviously still eating from.  And then the gnocci came out so late that we had even forgot we ordered it, if you are going to rush customers then at least have the food come out in good time.And as a final note we were starving after the meal and so we literally went to another restaurant to get a burger after.  totally ridiculous.",2.0

We were unsure of how many tapas to order and made a comment that if we didn't order enough tapas at first, we could always order more. He looked at us and said ""actually you can't. you have to order everything now, the kitchen can't do that."" Can't do what? Make more food? Isn't that how a restaurant works?

"Ok now this place right here................. you need to honk five times........ drive around the corner and honk ten times to give the sign of PERFECTION!I always knew that I had a love affair with FOOD that would never leave my senses. BUT this place right here confirmed how much I love the various flavors of FOOD!That's right and I am proud of it! And...... no I am not overweight - very sexy I might add. My cousin calls me an Epicurean, a person devoted to the pursuit of sensual pleasure, especially to the enjoyment of good food and comfort. Well that is ME y'all.First of all we were greeted at the door by two hostesses who asked if we had reservations - and because we did not - we sat at the bar - which was cool - now we know.We sat at the Bar and was asked if this was our first time - we said Yes. Before we ordered, we were given a very small cup with a table spoon of soup - as we sipped - both me and my friend started trying to figure out what is in the soup - this is how exotic the flavors are in every dish.We began to order.... We ordered Four dishes: 1. baby spinach, sugar snaps, red grapes, currants, sunflower seeds, feta, spiced vin - OMG!!!!!!!!!!! Shut your dayum mouth - This is how good and delicious this salad was - LOL! Seriously - various spices and full of FLAVOR!2. bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli - Shut the dayum door TWICE this time. The potato fries are to DIIIIIIIIE for with just the perfect amount of salt on top with that aoli sauce........ I did not have the sliders bcuz I am watching my weight - but my friend said it was delish and on the sweeter side.3. dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, lemon-caper brown butter - Seriously, smack somebody twice............. LMAO! This dish was filled with flavors and spices... I am personally not a fan of risotto - but this risotto was BANGIN........... yes it was divine............ very good!4. Lastly, the shrimp dish - absolutely wonderful.......... wonderful..... wonderful!Well I will definitely  be back with a group of four to try the Chef special - better believe that!HAPPY EATING!",5.0

"Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream....that's all I have to say. You have to get them, they are so good and go perfectly with the ice cream. I also had a couple other things from the menu like the strawberry glazed ribs. They tasted a bit funky although the meat it self was cooked very well. Also had some sort of slider and cheese dip....they were not very memorable but tasted fine. I would come back again but only to eat the bacon doughnuts.",4.0
"So I think it's time to give Traif a review after several visits in the past 6 months. First time we did not have to wait and were sitting at the bar which I think it's pretty entertaining the fact that you can watch them cook while waiting for your foods to arrive. We had foie and duck confit. I recall my expression after the first bite as well as my company, we were like oh my... this is unexplainably awesome/delicious/impressive/exciting at the same time. We had the bacon donuts as our dessert. Nothing to talk much about the dessert. It's new, creative but just okay. 2nd visit, I had the big eye tuna on eggplant, soft shell crab, scallop risotto all of them were delicious. My company enjoyed the scallops so much! I love the tuna on the crispy tempura eggplant, however we waited for 1 hour for that visit but it's okay, it's my fault for making a spontaneous dinner plan at almost 5 stars restaurant. 3rd visit, this time I think we ordered the wrong items, they were stewed pork cheek and chicken liver. Dessert was salted caramel. The 3rd visit was okay nothing to rave about since I think they weren't as delicious as traif's food suppose to be. I will definitely come back of course but just not going to order those anymore. The cook/chef was very nice! We had a chance to talk to her once when the restaurant wasn't busy, for the service wise, I think Traif has pretty good staffs who know how to run business and know how restaurant business works. She even told me that the owner just opened another resturant around corner called XIXA. I just made a visit to xixa a couple week ago and can't wait to go back!!!!!! We are planning on another visit prob this weekend. Review of xixa is coming up :). But traif we still love you though.",5.0
"Went here with my friends. We didn't realize it would be small plates when we originally went there. We tried the chefs table on the weekday for $50 a head. The food was delicious. Just wish there was more if it. The waitress was very accomodating due to my food restriction of pork, which was kind of a big deal considering they have a picture of a pig on the door and a heart :) She made sure to bring out pork dishes for everyone else, but left one piece out since she knew i couldn't eat it. She then brought me something different to munch on since she knew that I couldn't eat several plates. The food was really good. Wish we could have tried more on the menu. Would have been willing to pay more to get more dishes. Wish that was an option.",5.0
"The service was impeccable! However, I was a little disappointed with the food. The short rib sliders weren't great and I also didn't enjoy the chicken liver- normally a favorite of mine at most restaurants. I loved the sweet potato fries though!! The restaurant has a great atmosphere and I would go again to try some other plates.",3.0
"Can my friends have more birthdays so we can celebrate here more often?The food here is always exceeds my expectations. The menu is always interesting and it's hard not to choose everything. I love the small plates to share restaurant concept. Order somethings from the top, middle and bottom of the menu. If I wasn't so classy I would lick the plates clean. Instead, I scrape up every bit with a fork.The fact that this place is always packed attests to the quality. Expect to wait for a table - and make sure your non-punctual friends hurry the eff up to get there because they won't seat you without the whole party. The service is great and the food is well timed. It is pricey because you end up ordering so many plates (I'd say 2-3 per person is necessary for a meal) and their delicious drinks. Well worth it though.",5.0

We ordered Four dishes: 1. baby spinach, sugar snaps, red grapes, currants, sunflower seeds, feta, spiced vin - OMG!!!!!!!!!!! Shut your dayum mouth - This is how good and delicious this salad was - LOL! Seriously - various spices and full of FLAVOR!2. bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli - Shut the dayum door TWICE this time. The potato fries are to DIIIIIIIIE for with just the perfect amount of salt on top with that aoli sauce........ I did not have the sliders bcuz I am watching my weight - but my friend said it was delish and on the sweeter side.3. dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, lemon-caper brown butter - Seriously, smack somebody twice............. LMAO! This dish was filled with flavors and spices... I am personally not a fan of risotto - but this risotto was BANGIN........... yes it was divine............ very good!4. Lastly, the shrimp dish - absolutely wonderful.......... wonderful..... wonderful!Well I will definitely  be back with a group of four to try the Chef special - better believe that!HAPPY EATING!",5.0
"The food is phenomenal; well crafted, balanced, and nuanced. I am in love. ... The service, however,  is typical Williamsburg.",4.0
"Wow wow wow. The dinner I just had here easily earned a spot in the top 5 dining experiences I've ever had in my entire life. I got ""The Feast"" with my family and the food was astounding. So many amazing flavors, fresh ingredients and high quality produce. The bacon doughnut lives up to the hype. I'm def going back ASAP. Go hungry.",5.0
"Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream....that's all I have to say. You have to get them, they are so good and go perfectly with the ice cream. I also had a couple other things from the menu like the strawberry glazed ribs. They tasted a bit funky although the meat it self was cooked very well. Also had some sort of slider and cheese dip....they were not very memorable but tasted fine. I would come back again but only to eat the bacon doughnuts.",4.0
"So I think it's time to give Traif a review after several visits in the past 6 months. First time we did not have to wait and were sitting at the bar which I think it's pretty entertaining the fact that you can watch them cook while waiting for your foods to arrive. We had foie and duck confit. I recall my expression after the first bite as well as my company, we were like oh my... this is unexplainably awesome/delicious/impressive/exciting at the same time. We had the bacon donuts as our dessert. Nothing to talk much about the dessert. It's new, creative but just okay. 2nd visit, I had the big eye tuna on eggplant, soft shell crab, scallop risotto all of them were delicious. My company enjoyed the scallops so much! I love the tuna on the crispy tempura eggplant, however we waited for 1 hour for that visit but it's okay, it's my fault for making a spontaneous dinner plan at almost 5 stars restaurant. 3rd visit, this time I think we ordered the wrong items, they were stewed pork cheek and chicken liver. Dessert was salted caramel. The 3rd visit was okay nothing to rave about since I think they weren't as delicious as traif's food suppose to be. I will definitely come back of course but just not going to order those anymore. The cook/chef was very nice! We had a chance to talk to her once when the restaurant wasn't busy, for the service wise, I think Traif has pretty good staffs who know how to run business and know how restaurant business works. She even told me that the owner just opened another resturant around corner called XIXA. I just made a visit to xixa a couple week ago and can't wait to go back!!!!!! We are planning on another visit prob this weekend. Review of xixa is coming up :). But traif we still love you though.",5.0
"Went here with my friends. We didn't realize it would be small plates when we originally went there. We tried the chefs table on the weekday for $50 a head. The food was delicious. Just wish there was more if it. The waitress was very accomodating due to my food restriction of pork, which was kind of a big deal considering they have a picture of a pig on the door and a heart :) She made sure to bring out pork dishes for everyone else, but left one piece out since she knew i couldn't eat it. She then brought me something different to munch on since she knew that I couldn't eat several plates. The food was really good. Wish we could have tried more on the menu. Would have been willing to pay more to get more dishes. Wish that was an option.",5.0
"The service was impeccable! However, I was a little disappointed with the food. The short rib sliders weren't great and I also didn't enjoy the chicken liver- normally a favorite of mine at most restaurants. I loved the sweet potato fries though!! The restaurant has a great atmosphere and I would go again to try some other plates.",3.0
"Can my friends have more birthdays so we can celebrate here more often?The food here is always exceeds my expectations. The menu is always interesting and it's hard not to choose everything. I love the small plates to share restaurant concept. Order somethings from the top, middle and bottom of the menu. If I wasn't so classy I would lick the plates clean. Instead, I scrape up every bit with a fork.The fact that this place is always packed attests to the quality. Expect to wait for a table - and make sure your non-punctual friends hurry the eff up to get there because they won't seat you without the whole party. The service is great and the food is well timed. It is pricey because you end up ordering so many plates (I'd say 2-3 per person is necessary for a meal) and their delicious drinks. Well worth it though.",5.0
"Very good dessert, key lime pie is comparable to a 3 stars Michelin restaurant. Wine list is extensive and great. Pork belly is one of the best dishes, burrata was a good dish. Staff is nice and friendly. Ambience is good for a Saturday night, great place.",4.0
"Your experience eating out is this weird combination of ambiance, food, service, the company that you're with, the comparative context that you are dining in, your expectations and anything else that's important to you that evening. I made the mistake of going to the sister restaurant of Traif, Xixa, 2 nights before my visit to Traif. Sorry, but it totally threw off my Traif experience, since Xixa was so awesome. 1st/ this place is super popular and the space is small, so you should consider making reservations. 2nd/ the menu is pretty interesting ( which is kind of a problem when out with the guy that hates anything beyond pretty basic meal options) 3rd/ Just go. You know you want to.  The uniqueness of the menu is reason enough. The ambiance is nice enough for a date, but chill enough for dinner with friends. I don't think I'd come here alone as this restaurant was totally made for sharing - both the food and the experience.",4.0
"Came here with a group of 7 and we ordered every item on the menu, Overall, the food was delicious. The staff  who are very friendly and chill, were so impressed we ate everything, that when we only ordered one dessert, they gave us the rest of the dessert items from the menu for free.",5.0
"I don't know what happened but this did not live up to the hype.  Why?  Like other Elites, do not come with a large party and make sure you order the right dish.  Many where hit or miss.",2.0

I hate to not eat here anymore but quality has really gone down. I think they may be a bit overwhelmed with the over flow of people.

Maybe when they get off that high horse and get back to how delicious it use to be Id be a regular once again.,2.0

"It was a very special friend's graduation and I wanted to pick the perfect place for the celebration and thought that Traif would be the perfect place. I had high expectations for this place since it had 4.5 stars on yelp and it turns out to be only 3 stars for me, very disappointing. A few things I did not like, our group of 7 one of our friend had a drink from Starbucks and they wouldn't allow outside drinks. Fine that's understandable and then there was a ""mandatory"" chef menu for $40 per person for parties of 8 or more, which I don't understand. Our group turns out to be a party of 8 but the last person was running late. We did not want to be restricted to the chef menu and decided that we'll meet our late guest elsewhere. So there was the 7 of us and we ordered many items off the menu which include:1. Spicy, bigeye tuna, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis2. Glazed-confit chicken wings, hoisin, five spice, sriracha3. Crispy soft shell crabs, crushed avocado, pineapple sambal, red papaya4. Bellflower pasta, italian sausage, roasted piquillo peppers, torn basil5. Dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, lemon-caper brown butter 6. BBQ, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli7. Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs8. Seared foie, fingerlings, ham chips, sunny egg, maple, hot sauceThe food was only good, not over the top good. The portions were small, which is the reason why we ordered double of each order this way everyone could sample the food. But even with the double order we still had room for more food and we left hungry and they slapped a 20% gratuity on our bill, which was another ""mandatory"" rule that I did not like. All and all I was not impressed with this place. Oh, I just remember another thing I did not like it was the music it was just too damn loud that we couldn't hold a conversation and had to raise our voices.",3.0

"After many, many blissful meals, I think I can safely call Traif my favorite restaurant. I don't say this lightly. Look at my Yelp profile; I've reviewed just under 700 restaurants, and I have been to hundreds more. This is my favorite. Perhaps I am biased because Traif is just constantly making me look good. Each and every time I recommend it to someone, every single time I bring someone new through the door, Traif exceeds the absurdly high expectations I've set by gushing on the way over. I brought my girlfriend's parents here, and suddenly I'm not ""that asshole she just hasn't dumped yet."" Now I'm ""that asshole who knows good food."" (I'll take it.)I brought my own parents here, and the sweet, wonderful hostess/co-owner Heather actually told them that they had a good son (!). Even more shocking, my mother said, ""Yeah, I guess he's OK."" (The only possible explanation is that she was all hopped up on the bacon doughnuts and every other delicious item that comes out of Chef Jason Marcus's kitchen. The man is a genius.)Traif rides that fine line between casual and upscale that makes it an excellent choice for every occasion. It is perfect for a your first date or your 15th, for a business meeting or a large group dinner.* Come here any time you find yourself looking to:-taste many different things that are otherworldly in their deliciousness. -be waited on by an amazing, genuinely good-hearted and highly competent staff.-dine well at shockingly affordable prices.Oh, you want recommendations? Do the chef's selection. Never has $40 of food been so worth it. However, if you don't have the time/inclination, a few dishes that never disappoint me: the salt & pepper spicy shriimp, the BBQ braised short rib sliders (the accompanying sweet potato fries are fantastic as well), the tuna tartare and the seared scallops.Not only do I enjoy each and every mouth-wateringly savory dish, but Traif even makes me like dessert. Panna cotta? I'd never order that anywhere else. I'll take a grudging bite if someone else insisted, but at Traif I'll be fighting for it, and licking the plate afterward. The key lime pie is about as good as key lime pie can be, and the brown sugar budino will make you weep, it's so rich and smooth and perfect. I've stopped comparing other restaurants to Traif, because quite frankly, it isn't fair.

"Our experience at Traif probably suffered from too high expectations.  After reading so many great reviews my wife and I really wanted to check this place out.  We went on a Friday evening.First, we were greeted outside of the door in a small area with a space heater (not inside the restaurant) which is perfectly understandable given the small space.  What I don't understand is why they chose to have my wife wait in this area while I ran to the muni meter to pay for parking.  She had to actually ask to be seated inside the restaurant.  OK, not off to a great start, but no big deal.We sat down and looked over the menu and ordered cocktails.  The cocktails were excellent, particularly the Red Pearl my wife ordered.  We ordered 6 dishes between the two of us (our waiter suggested 5-7 for two people).  This was definitely a bit too much, probably would have been better off with 5.All of the dishes were OK, but nothing really stood out.  The amuse of beet soup was quite tasty.  We then had the burrata (good, but a little bland, which will be a theme in this review), the pork belly (probably the best dish we had), gnocchi with escargot (very rich and quite good), foie gras (again, a bit bland), sweet breads (the taste was good, but they had a bit more chew than I like with my sweetbreads), and finally the strawberry-cinnamon ribs (very interesting and tasty, but again very chewy).Traif was not a bad meal, but did not come close to living up to expectations.  The service was generally good, though a bit overbearing at times (they were in such a rush to clear our plates and keep us moving so they could turn the table that I had to ask on three separate occasions for them to leave a plate I was still working on).Given all of the great reviews I might give Traif another shot, but so far, I'm not such a fan.",3.0

"Our experience at Traif probably suffered from too high expectations.  After reading so many great reviews my wife and I really wanted to check this place out.  We went on a Friday evening.First, we were greeted outside of the door in a small area with a space heater (not inside the restaurant) which is perfectly understandable given the small space.  What I don't understand is why they chose to have my wife wait in this area while I ran to the muni meter to pay for parking.  She had to actually ask to be seated inside the restaurant.  OK, not off to a great start, but no big deal.We sat down and looked over the menu and ordered cocktails.  The cocktails were excellent, particularly the Red Pearl my wife ordered.  We ordered 6 dishes between the two of us (our waiter suggested 5-7 for two people).  This was definitely a bit too much, probably would have been better off with 5.All of the dishes were OK, but nothing really stood out.  The amuse of beet soup was quite tasty.  We then had the burrata (good, but a little bland, which will be a theme in this review), the pork belly (probably the best dish we had), gnocchi with escargot (very rich and quite good), foie gras (again, a bit bland), sweet breads (the taste was good, but they had a bit more chew than I like with my sweetbreads), and finally the strawberry-cinnamon ribs (very interesting and tasty, but again very chewy).Traif was not a bad meal, but did not come close to living up to expectations.  The service was generally good, though a bit overbearing at times (they were in such a rush to clear our plates and keep us moving so they could turn the table that I had to ask on three separate occasions for them to leave a plate I was still working on).Given all of the great reviews I might give Traif another shot, but so far, I'm not such a fan.",3.0
"To quote myself in 3rd grade: ""This place is da bomb.""  If I could grant Traif 6 stars, I certainly would do so.I liked this place very much even before arriving for dinner as they took customer service to new heights for me.  I called for a reservation same day and they said they didn't have any tables available but we could still walk in.  A few minutes later they called back (I did not leave my name or telephone number with them) and said they had a cancelation.  I was ecstatic.  The food was incredible.  The soft shell crab was fried deliciousness.  Tempura eggplant is an extra tasty way to deliver raw tuna.  The rock shrimp pasta was hearty and filled with pesto goodness.  The nutella mousse was fluffy and chocolaty awesomeness.  The quality of food that this place can put out from its tiny ""kitchen"" is astounding.Simply, Traif is one of my favorite restaurants in all of NYC.  I don't always go to Brooklyn, but when I do, I prefer to dine at Traif.",5.0

"Make a reservation for sure! We came in at 6pm (when they open) and just managed to snag the only walk-in table.I know there's been a lot of hype around Traif lately and I know some people think it is all just hype but I just had one of the best meals of my life here. Everything was such a perfect balance of flavors - everything was an amazing contrast! There was contrasting flavors put together in almost every dish. My favorite of the night was either the Strawberry Glazed Ribs or the Salt & Pepper Shrimp. Both were very flavorful and tender. The ribs, especially, fell right off the bone! Definitely try out the Bacon Doughnuts. Get the Budino too if you have the room! Both were excellent!",5.0

"Went to Traif when a good buddy was in town for a med school interview. With the tasting option for three, we were able to try most of the menu, and sharing small plates of course was easier than eating off each other's plates as we end up doing elsewhere.So good! The wait staff was really great to seat us and let us know that they needed the table back in an hour--which ended up meaning our food was expedited and it was awesome. They were also very patiently informative about each dish and honest about personal favorites. Sat in the back.Would love to try Xixa (same restaurant group) soon and also come back to Traif when the menu's switched up.",4.0
"A hidden gem in Brooklyn! This place is a great tapas/sharing restaurant. Portions are meant for tasting & for everyone at the table to try. Some of my favorites are the glazed baby back ribs, braised short ribs & for dessert, bacon doughnuts. The pork belly is good & I loved the risotto with escargot they once had. The menu does change, but they keep their signature favorites. So if you like a dish, you better voice your opinion to keep it around. The restaurant is small & they do have a space in the back for additional seating. While you wait, the hostess will guide you to a local bar to hang out & then call your cell phone when your table is ready! A fun & tasty place, go there today!",5.0

"Traif is awesome for family style shares. They have little portions of each dish (definitely enough for tasting for 4 people) of gourmet food so you can try a bunch of things on their menu. We had about 10 different items. My favorite was their braised pork belly, strawberry glazed ribs, and their cockle dish. But among the tasty food (I'm sure there are dozens of reviews for their food), I wanted to point out how amazing they were with my peanut/nut allergies. Servers made sure there was no cross-contamination in the kitchen and every time a new dish came out, they noted whether it was nut allergy friendly,for example, they were very specific that their prawn dish had pesto in it and it was NOT ok for me to eat. That made my dining experience so much easier and safer!",4.0
"I came to dinner here after work right as the doors opened.  Traif is a wonderful little restaurant tucked away a nice distance from the main drag.  They have a large bar area near the front and a beautiful backyard garden with a few benches.  As I waited for the gf to arrive, I had a gander at their cocktail list and a nice but small selection of  drinks were offered.  I had the rude little pig and the red pearl.  The red pear was definitely my favorite with the spicy vodka, combined with that kiwi made for a great contrast in flavors.  I was honestly a little disappointed about the rude little big since I was really hoping for more bacon to shine through.Once we were seated, we were treated to an amuse bouche of asparagus soup.  Creamy, buttery, aspargusy?  I enjoyed it but the girl did not.  Our first entree to come out was the tuna and tempura followed by the pork belly.  What I didn't like about the tuna/tempura combo was the fact that the tuna did not highlight the dish at all.  All I could taste was the salty fried tempura.  The pork belly on the other hand was awesome.  Combined with the fresh fruit, salty pork, that perfect play on sweet and savory.  After completing our first two tapas, we had our roast pork sliders and duck confit.  The roast pork sliders were fantastic, nicely buttered rolls, awesome sweet potato fries, and who doesn't love siracha mayo?  The duck confit was a nice leg piece rather than the breast (huge plus) and boy did t hey cook that skin up perfectly.  It was however a little less thrilling in flavor than I wanted it to be.  Still hungry from our first four, we ordered chicken and biscuits and for desert we had the bacon doughnuts.  The chicken was nicely fried although I wish it was crunchier.  The gravy with the green apples made for an awesome pairing that definitely changed the entire flavor profile of the gravy.  The bacon doughnuts sounded amazing on paper but fell flat in my mind.  Rather than dulce de leche, I think a maple frosting would have been more appropriate and would have gone well with their coffee ice cream.All in, the service was great.  Dishes came from the kitchen very quickly as soon as we finished each plate.  The service was on point, and the food had its ups and downs (although they weren't horrible).  Also for a restaurant named Traif, I would have expected more PORK!  I'd come back here again and would really rate this place as a 3.5 star kind of place.  It is however quite expensive for Brooklyn.  Our bill with tip was $137",4.0

I think Brooklyn resident (and fellow Yelp colleague) Peter D says it best (along with his 18 check-ins and counting): ""After many, many blissful meals, I think I can safely call Traif my favorite restaurant.""Boom. I could expand on the cozy, sophisticated interior full of charm and all things seductive, the brilliantly-concocted cocktails, or the impeccable service, but my review real estate is best spent bragging about Traif's culinary efforts: they're transcendental yet completely accessible. What a formula, right?What we had... because I focused on savoring our nibbles instead of taking mental notes, I can't recall everything we tried (also, the menu is constantly changing). But, I can tell you that you should order anything centering around pork belly, short rib, and especially, the seared foie and the veal sweetbreads. Ridiculously rich, this was a meal built on hedonistic principles and I'm a little proud that I probably walked out the door a full pound heavier. This is not a diet-friendly restaurant no matter how you try to slice it... so sit back, enjoy, and know that your taste buds will dance and your palate will be pleased.For what you get, Traif is very well-priced, making it an even more attractive dining destination. Don't be surprised if it's packed - my advice is to come with one friend and strategically snag space at the bar!

"Very, very good! Came here with my husband, sister and brother in law that were visiting from Florida. This is basically a renegade style tapas place. Our waiter recommended 10-15 dishes for four people, which sounded ridiculous, so we went with 8. Believe it or not, it was too much food. The food was amazing. My favorite dishes were the shrimp, brisket sliders, gnocchi, scallops, mussels and the carrots with cheese (forget the name).The crab with biscuits was alright, too heavy.

"Traif was my January entry into my family's ongoing ""Who can find the most delicious food"" contest. I can confidently say that I am winning. (Of course, I am the only person playing with Brooklyn restaurants, which gives me an unfair advantage, but I digress.)Part one, drinks. I got the Winter Cabin cocktail, which had rye and orange and some other flavors. Actually, I got two of them, because it was delicious. There were at least two other cocktails on the menu that I wanted to try, and I didn't even look at the beer or wine list.Part two, food. The food is incredible. We got eight dishes for the four of us. Some of them were very elegant, such as a venison tartare. Others were classed-up comfort food, like the cinnamon-strawberry ribs and the pork sliders. I liked the comforting options best: the ribs, especially, were hard to share, even with my cherished family members. But I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, and the staff can help you figure out how much and what to order.By the time the third or fourth dish was brought out, we had all realized that we were in the presence of Great Food. By the end, we were crazed fanatics who could not stop talking about how amazing all the food was. And just to be safe, I made my parents swear not to tip off the Times.",5.0
"A wonderful meal! Two of us had 9 courses! That was a bit too much, but it was so hard to choose.

The large grilled prawns were fine, but not a standout. I just don't like soft-shelled crabs, but my friend wanted to try them. i still don't like soft-shelled crabs. Dessert (the white chocolate budino) was good but not special...and it was supposed to have rhubarb puree in it, but I couldn't find it anywhere. we had an interesting cocktail and a nice wine as well. Service was polite and accomodating. I was painfully full.The problems we encountered had to do with ambience and temperature. The music was so loud, that I could barely hear my friend speak. It's just too loud for a restaurant like this. And the air conditioner seemed to be broken, so it was uncomfortably warm. I would love to come back...in the winter...and try more dishes here, because the food is, overall, truly special.",4.0
"This place is so gooooood. My friend and I came here for dinner. Got there around 7. Place was booked until 11:30 (Make reservations!) but the bar was pretty open, so we sat there. We had the arugula salad, ribs, sliders with sweet potato fries & aioli. Everything was so, so good. The drinks were fantastic too. Definitely recommend checking this place out. I will be back :)",5.0
"OMG you MUST try the tasting menu while here.  It's the best way to eat your way around the menu and sample the best this restaurant has to offer.  And not bad for $45.  The wine bottle selection is also delicious and reasonably priced.  Some great dishes I had include:Glazed ribs with strawberriesPork belly, lentils and greensMelted muenster cheese with pork belly accompanied with toastSeared scallopsTuna tartareSweet breadsBagels and lox (everything focaccia with smoked salmon)Bacon doughnuts Mom's key lime pie.  Didn't think Brooklyn can do KLP but this one was one of the best I've ever had (and I've had the original from FL too)Everything about this meal is enjoyable.  If you can make the trip out here I highly recommend trying it out.",5.0
"I can't stop raving about this place. Went here last Saturday around 1:30 for brunch and savored the BEST pancake of my life. Better than Clinton St. by far. It was about eight inches in diameter, half an inch to an inch in fluffiness, and full of crispy soft perfection. The glaze was a bright red crab apple, and sandwiched by slivers of moon-shaped pear pieces. SO, SO good. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and biscuit with Macoun apples on the side. Also delicious -- the chicken skin was crispy, yet somehow melted in the mouth with salty, fatty goodnes, and he seemed to love the flavors in the apples -- they were very nicely spiced and complemented the dish very well.For dessert we shared the bacon doughnuts. They were delicious, but we both agreed that the pancake was better. We wanted to come back for dinner, but there were no more reservations. Have already secured another pair of Traif-lovers for a dinner in the near future though, so will DEFINITELY be back.This is my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn, and perhaps in NYC.",5.0
"I almost don't want to write this review, I want to keep this place to myself. My birthday dinner last week at Traif was easily one of the best meals I've had, along with the biggest bang for your buck. I ventured out to the great unknown in a torrential downpour last Friday and I was greatly rewarded! We showed up a bit early and our table wasn't quite ready so we walked down the street to their sister tequila bar Xixa and had some very tasty cocktails while we waited, try the cucumber mint fresca with your tequila. The hostess called us and we waded down the street again and were seated at a tiny table in the covered patio. Our waitress was adorable and very helpful. We decided to order two bottles of wine, a white and a red since we were doing the tasting menu. You can tell the waiter that you would like to try the favorites or pick from the menu for the tasting , fully customizable, which I loved! I didn't write down the exact bottles, the white was from Greece and it was excellent and the red was from Germany, also very good. They have an eclectic wine list which I always love. I wish I could remember all of the 8-9 plates that we had but here's a list of the ones I do recall:1. spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap minis - this is a MUST order! It's a take on the tuna with crispy rice but substitute tempura eggplant for the rice, utterly fabulous!2. bbq braised short rib slider, sweet potato fried, snoked paprika aioli - easily the best pork sliders .... ever.3. seared dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, caper - tomato - lemon brown butter - now I usually don't even like scallops but I nearly licked my plate.4. hamachi carpaccio, avocado mousse, pluots, tarragon, asparagus, truffle-soy-sesame - sublime..all the flavors in every dish work so well together and the ingredients are super fresh.5. hampsire pork belly, hearts of palm, bacon, snow peas, cauliflower - how can you go wrong with pork on pork?!6. bacon donuts - no explanation needed and one other dessert but at this point I was in such a happy food coma I remember nothing else.I really can't wait to go back again and again to try everything else on the menu! EXCELLENT!!!!",5.0
"Traif is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. The menu, which is ALWAYS incredible (new american, served tapas style), changes from time-to-time, which I love. Rest assured, however, they usually always offer their signature dishes... i.e.) if you're going solely for the bacon doughnuts (a legit reason), you won't be disappointed. Traif is one of those places where you can either go with a group, or as a couple, and still have a delightful experience. My only reccomendation is that you bring someone/people that are all about sharing... or ""team eating"", as I call it. Oh, and if you can score a table in the back, in their little glass-enclosed patio, lit mainy with an abundance of fairy lights, DO IT!",5.0
"I went to Traif based on a recommendation and absolutely loved it!My party of 3 ordered the tasting menu. The waitress wanted to know if we were adventurous and asked us what kind of food we liked. We responded and off she went to tell the cooks. (I like that they personalized the menu for us)Out came  10 courses for dinner, followed by 3 courses for dessert - all fantastic.My favourites were: (i) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby-back ribs,  (ii) tuna tartare on japanese eggplant tempura  and (iii) the soft-shell crab dishGreat value for the price we paid. I definitely recommend Traif and going for the tasting menu!",4.0

"Very, very good! Came here with my husband, sister and brother in law that were visiting from Florida. This is basically a renegade style tapas place. Our waiter recommended 10-15 dishes for four people, which sounded ridiculous, so we went with 8. Believe it or not, it was too much food. The food was amazing. My favorite dishes were the shrimp, brisket sliders, gnocchi, scallops, mussels and the carrots with cheese (forget the name).The crab with biscuits was alright, too heavy. As were the doughnuts with bacon and ice cream, it was just too overwhelming.",4.0
"Traif was my January entry into my family's ongoing ""Who can find the most delicious food"" contest. I can confidently say that I am winning. (Of course, I am the only person playing with Brooklyn restaurants, which gives me an unfair advantage, but I digress.)Part one, drinks. I got the Winter Cabin cocktail, which had rye and orange and some other flavors. Actually, I got two of them, because it was delicious. There were at least two other cocktails on the menu that I wanted to try, and I didn't even look at the beer or wine list.Part two, food. The food is incredible. We got eight dishes for the four of us. Some of them were very elegant, such as a venison tartare. Others were classed-up comfort food, like the cinnamon-strawberry ribs and the pork sliders. I liked the comforting options best: the ribs, especially, were hard to share, even with my cherished family members. But I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, and the staff can help you figure out how much and what to order.By the time the third or fourth dish was brought out, we had all realized that we were in the presence of Great Food. By the end, we were crazed fanatics who could not stop talking about how amazing all the food was. And just to be safe, I made my parents swear not to tip off the Times.",5.0

"I am giving two stars for the two dishes I loved out of the five I ordered . To start off my friend made reservations here for 8:30 pm . We were running extremely late so we asked if we could move the reservation to 9 . They told us they weren't able to (this is a Thursday night) and told us to make a reservation for xixa which is there like sister restaurant next door . So we did . While we were walking to xixa we passed by Traif and noticed it was empty . About 7 empty tables I would say . We then asked if there was availability and sat down immediately. Surprising right ? Anyways we sat down I started off with the waitresses recommendation for the kumquat daiquiri . Huge mistake it's one of the strangest tasting cocktails and not in a good way at all. I would just stick to wine if you're planning on drinking here . So then we ordered ... The tuna tartare was spectacular and so was the salt and pepper shrimp with sweet potato and pineapple. The Ragu with sausage and the sliders were also okay . But let's talk about the rack of lamb . It was terrible . I am a huge lamb eater and I have eaten lamb almost every way you can possibly cook it and the minute it came I noticed it was extremely rare , so rare that just by looking at it it looked raw ... I thought maybe if I cut into it it would be fine. As I was attempting to cut it with my knife it just wouldn't cut . It was a struggle cutting the lamb . So when I finally did and put it in my mouth I spit it right out because firstly the lamb was so gamey . I've never eaten lamb with a such a strong Oder or taste like that . Also the lamb wasn't even warm because that's how rare it was and it was so chewy in the worst way possible . We signaled the waitress and explained the situation and she said ""we have a policy that if you cut into the food we can't take it off the bill. My manager isn't here at the moment but I can try to find out what we can do "" well out of curiosity , if I don't try to food how am I supposed to know how good or bad it is right ? What kind of ridiculous policy is that. So then 2 mins later she came back and said ""I spoke to my manager and we took it off the bill"" I am appreciative that I wasn't charged for the lamb however , didn't she just say two mins ago her manager wasn't there ? Long story short , I thought the food was mediocre , I'm still having nightmares of that lamb and also the communication between the staff and customers is lacking clearly because of the whole reservation and manager fiasco .",2.0

I went with a bunch of picky eaters  for a birthday dinner and though they were a bit intimidated by the menu at first once the gorgeous dishes came out and they tasted everything.

Drove in from the city and was skeptical about the decision. Upon arrival the place was dead but as soon as 8 PM hit it was packed. The service was impeccable as was the food.

"One of my absolute favorite favorite favorite restaurants! Traif captured my heart the moment I stepped in. The ambiance is dimly light with a lively crowd. The kitchen is open for the public eye as it is located right behind the bar! Traif provides a seasonal menu that combines various flavors and components to compose remarkable dishes. 5 or 6 dishes is sufficient for two people and dessert is a must! Some of the dishes I had throughout my multiple visits include:*Spicy big eye tuna tartare - Tempura fried eggplant base with spicy tuna tartare topping. Great contrast in texture and temperature!*Strawberry-cinnamon glazed ribs - Delicious, sweet, falling-off-the-bone ribs*Seared scallops with lentils, huckleberries, & pumpkin sauce - Great balance between all the ingredients. The lentils give the dish some body while the huckleberries provides some sweetness*Seared dayboat scallops with snap & english pea risotto (Spring/Summer) - One of my favorite favorite favorite menu items. The risotto is always cooked perfectly. *Risotto of maine lobster - Chunks of lobster and sausage with a touch of pistachios for texture and nuttiness*Sauteed sweetbreads - For the adventurous foodies. Crunchy & delicious!*Whole-roasted head-on pink prawns - Huge prawns with a huge piece of foie gras toast to sop up all the juices*Corn-meal crusted soft shell crabs - Crunchy fried goodness with heirloom tomatoes which adds a touch of sweetness*Sauteed broccoli rabe, portabello mushroom, truffle toast - Like breakfast in heaven. Perfect ratio and flavor combinations. I love that the broccoli rabe has a slight bitterness to it.*BBQ braised short ribs sliders - Succulent and juicy. The short ribs sliders are soft and melts in your mouth! The sweet potato fries with the aioli are amazingly delicious!*Hampshire pork belly - Super tender pork belly that you can effortlessly cut through with your fork! Another one of my favorites*Buttermilk fried quail - A successful replica of fried chicken with cornbread. This one is amazing*Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream - Warm doughnuts dipped in caramel, topped with bacon bits with a side of coffee ice cream = dream come trueNotable beverages:*High Times*Last Word*Rude Little PigTo point out my favorites, I would have to say the buttermilk fried quail, the seared scallops with risotto, the spicy tuna tartare, and the hampshire pork belly all hit the spot!When I first dined at Traif, I didn't know where to start. My best suggestion would be to just go for it and try what is appealing to you and what you think is good based on intuition, reviews, and server recommendations. I personally enjoyed all the dishes I have tried and I really appreciate the complexity that is present in all of their menu items, including their beverages. I can't wait to continue this culinary adventure with this great inspiring establishment!",5.0

"Traif is a really fun restaurant, and considering the size of their kitchen, I am very surprised by the diversity of menu items on the list!  That said, the food presentation is exceptional, as are the sauces each dish comes with.  The service was also attentive, coming by fairly frequently to check up on drinks, water and making sure our table was doing well.  My favorites include the asparagus soup, the pomegranate spare ribs, the chicken liver, sweet bread and panna cotta.  What could have been better for me (though this may be due to the items we selected): some of the texture for some of the dishes were really similar to one another--- while each dish standalone would have been great, the soft shell crab, the fried mushroom, the sweet bread and others have a very similar texture and not having a different food dish in between to break up the textures kind of made it seem like you were eating a variation of the same dish.  Cocktails and beer selection good, but wine by the glass list was limited.",4.0
"First time here and I loved it. The bbq spare ribs and sweet potato fries with the paprika sauce was my favorite. I also tried fried shrimp with pineapple which was also delicious and the short bread with artichoke was an interesting taste. For dessert, I had the coffee ice cream with bacon doughnuts and the key lime pie which was one of the best ever! The service was also great and really friendly.",4.0
"Well here we are in trendy Williamsburg. We had reservations, so we only had to wait while they prepared our table. The staff is super friendly and very patient. No hassles here. we opted for the chefs tasting menu. The menu was varied and delicious. Deserts were unique and scrumptious. Yummy! One quick note. The prices I quoted were for the chef's tasting. The regular items on the menu where priced from $10-$25. Very reasonable.",5.0

"Really great for parties of 4 and up. I like the small plate servings and being able to try everything b/c everyone orders a few plates per person. The food comes out in perfectly spaced out timing (if that makes sense) so you never feel like you're waiting too long for anything and the food comes out hot. Two words: bacon donuts! You've been warned, now go and try them.",5.0
"We were a party of eight, which meant we had to accept the chef's selection. One look at the menu and you'll realize that this actually worked in our favor because the menu has so many great dishes to try. Traif serves tapas style and individual bite size portions in this chef's selection, but don't be discouraged, we were mighty full after these 10 courses. The dishes came out fairly quickly and a few times, two courses came at once. Service was friendly, nothing to complain about here. Our water glasses were never empty and our waitress was quick to take our next drink order. Highlights/Recommendations:Tuna tartare over Japanese fried eggplantBacon wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheeseSoftshell crab with watermelon saladBacon doughnuts with coffee ice creamAnd here's the rundown of our meal...Amuse Bouche: Red bell pepper gazpacho- Nice shot of gazpacho, very clean and tasty.1. Tuna tartare over Japanese fried eggplant- Would definitely recommend this. This dish is presented like a crostini, the fried eggplant serving as the base was absolutely delicious.2. Bacon wrapped figs stuffed with blue cheese-  This is such a great dish and one where I could probably eat 15 of these. I first had bacon wrapped figs at Toro in Chelsea and this was very comparable in taste. I just think this combination of sweet, savory and salty from the blue cheese is fantastic. 3. Cottage cheese with white peaches- Peaches are in season and were nice, but this dish isn't something you can really jazz up for a restaurant. I enjoy cottage cheese and fruit, but not very often and I consider this more of a breakfast on the go type of meal. This dish fell flat and felt out of place.4. Softshell crab with watermelon salad- I mean, you can never really go wrong with softshell crab. One of my favorite things to eat. Really great dish and the watermelon salad was excellent.5. Pork belly with fig molasses- This was about a 5 inch long slab of meat, maybe 2 inches thick topped with sliced figs. Good dish, but difficult to share as the crispy skin fell off as we were slicing it up. Pork belly is great in what ever form it comes in though and this was no exception. 6. Salt and pepper shrimp- Really enjoyed this. The shrimp was cooked really nicely and the glaze was top notch. 7. Scallops with double corn risotto- Had me at double corn risotto. This was a nice dish, but didn't wow me, one that could be better served in a big bowl as a comfort dish rather than a tasting.8. Pork chop topped with molasses- This came at the right time as we were ready for something more substantial. The pork chop was cooked  and sliced up nicely although it wasn't something to really write home about. This kind of reminded me of a baked Christmas ham more than anything.9. Short rib sliders with sweet potato fries- Short rib was delicious and juicy. The soft roll (I love bread) it was served in was a little sweet and made this dish really rich. Good for the serving size at this point as we were beginning to feel pretty full. The fries were really flavorful. 10. Baked muenster cheese with chorizo- This was served in a hot ramekin with bread. Probably not the best dish for the last course and better served earlier in the meal. Nevertheless, a ramekin full of baked melty cheese is always good, rich, and filling.Dessert 1: Buttermilk panna cotta with meyer lemon- Reminiscent of a key lime filling which I love. This was a really nice dessert, creamy, but not overly rich. The meyer lemon sauce at the bottom was a really nice touch and combination of flavors.Dessert2: Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream- These were dumpling sized beauties. Candied bacon topped this fried dough concoction and the coffee ice cream paired with it was absolutely delicious. Complimentary Dessert: Cubed pineapple with molasses- They sure love their molasses here. Molasses flavor didn't really come through here, but that was fine by me. The pineapple was a nice little pop of fresh and juicy.",4.0

"After watching Skyfall, Dave and I decided to head into the heart of hipsterville and check out Traif, which has been on my culinary hit list for sometime. Surprisingly, the restaurant is small but without any doubt, it was also buzzing with energy and smelled delicious once we stepped inside. With an open kitchen, their food is all prepared in a very small space. Personally, I love restaurants like this as it makes my experience feel more interesting and intimate. If anything, their kitchen seem chaotic and impossible to maneuver but all the dishes that they presented to us that evening was fantastic. Dave and I ordered a few dishes and without hesitation we both agreed that their duck confit with barley was the absolute best. The leg was moist, yet tender and literally melted off its bone, while the skin was thin and crispy. More importantly, the barley was al-dente. Like risotto, it was creamy, buttery and carried just the right amount of flavor to make it taste like a perfect dish. For dessert, we tried their much acclaimed bacon donuts with a scoop of coffee ice cream. Although the combination was interesting, I can't say I was oozing with delight as the flavor of the bacon was weak and not as dominate as I was hoping for. Nevertheless, I still recommend going to Traif at least once.  Their menu are seasonal and interesting, while their drinks are strong and well executed. More importantly the restaurant is fun, vibrant, and it definitely has a hiper'ish vibe that will give you a taste of that that ultimate Brooklyn uniqueness experience!",4.0
"Wish I could have actually eaten here. The menu looks so good.Was trying to put together a 25-person group dinner here, but the receptionist forgot to send details about putting together a pre-selected menu after I spoke to her, then didn't return my phone message when I called four days later to remind her, and when I called the third time and asked if they had gotten my message, she told me how busy they were and that she will get to it eventually.  When she emailed me two minutes later, she told me they were going to charge $6,000 (!) plus tax and tip for a dinner for 25 people, and we could eat at 5 PM (!) Regardless, renting out the restaurant was totally not what we wanted, but she either didnt't listen (to the conversation and the voicemail) or she is just obtuse. Either way, I didn't have the energy to start over with the explanation. It's NYC - we have plenty of other options.",1.0
"This is going to not sound like a 5 star review at first, but bear with me.Traif is dim. And not in a romantic candlelit way. I couldn't see my food well. The guy behind the bar was fighting the good fight by holding up glasses to the barely there lighting so that he didn't serve any with water spots. There was a spotlight in the prep area so that the servers could at least see the dishes before they went out. The rest of the kitchen... dim. Traif is loud. I mean LOUD. Like Grand Central loud. Actually worse since it's not such a large space. It became of vicious cycle of shouting. And really lady... nobody has to laugh that loud outside of a comedy show. If you can, sit in the separate area in the rear.If you have a jacket or purse, don't sit at the bar. There's no place to put your belongings but on the chair next to you. And if they need the seat... you're crap out of luck. The portions are small plates. You find that out right away when your server asks you incredulously if ""that's all you want??""I ordered the BBQ Sliders. They come with two sliders & sweet potato fries. You get a very yummy roasted pepper soup amuse bouche that just makes you want more. Now out come the sliders. They made my stomach mad just looking at them. Then I ate one sweet potato fry. Dear God up in Heaven was that good! I think they breaded the sweet potato fries with Angel Dust. Not metaphorically... with actual psychedelic drugs. I destroyed them how Godzilla destroyed Tokyo. They give you the option to add a third slider to the entree, but what they should do is allow you to just order the sweet potato fries on the side. I want to bathe in them. Since I only ordered 3 Sliders, I had plenty of room for dessert. I normally don't, so it was a prime time to have the famous bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. First off, I love coffee ice cream. I love bacon. I love doughnuts. Put all three together and BLAM! And you get a nice amount of them too. They were most likely to share, but don't. Eat them all yourself. Maybe I came on some weird Loud Talker Night but I would gladly go again just for those fries. I'll give away the sliders and order some other entree just to get the fries. Good God the fries!",5.0
"We were in Brooklyn with our two young children for an art event, and decided to stay in town for dinner. After checking yelp, we headed over to Traif, arriving promptly at 6pm on a Saturday night with no reservation...bad move. They were booked solid until 11pm, but thanks to a no-show, by hovering outside we were able to get a table. We could see people freaking out just a little to see our kids make their way to the table, but they earned some credibility by eating everything we ordered, from scallops to spaeztel, frogs legs, ribs, and bacon & bleu cheese stuffed figs. The kitchen is tiny and totally visible, but you'd never know it from the quality of the food - everything was delicious, and the service was fantastic.",5.0
"Uh-mazing! Fantastico! Muy Bien! spectaculaire! Magnifique! As gothamist mag said ""There are three rules when it comes to eating at Williamsburg restaurant Traif: 1) Don't be hungry, 2) don't be on a diet and 3) don't be a vegetarian."" Treif derived the Hebrew word teref which means torn, and originally referred to non-kosher meat only.  AKA pork.  The restaurant is small, with intimately placed tables. The icing on the cake though is the patio outside. Something about it is reminiscent of a restaurant in Europe or somewhere you see in movies.  I'm not sure how other customers feel about it but it definitely brings warmth to me.  However, your best bet is to probably sit at the bar and watch the top-notch chefs do their thing. I've heard this over and over.  We opted for outside seating to allow me and my friends to have good quality conversation. Let's get down to the nitty gritty of the food.  As you may already know it is served in small-plate. Tapas style. The plates definitely has Asian, French, and Spanish influences.  They do a really good job of bringing the food little by little which is good because it's way better for sampling than stuffing yourself.  There are plates ranging from $7 to $10.  I don't think it's expensive at all.  The restaurant offered complimentary amuse bouche of a bacon broth which tasted really good.  I ordered pork belly, lentils, and artichoke.  It was everything I thought it would be.  It was phenomenal.  Then, I had the tuna tartare tempura-fried eggplant ahhh-mazing... I want to learn how to make this.  I know I'll be dreaming about this in my sleep. All in a Terrific meal that was truly orgasmic! Totally amazing food, top notch service, delicious cocktails - it's the total package! I'll def be coming again.Next time I shall make room for desert I heard the bacon doughnut paired with dulce de leche and coffee ice cream is fantastic.",5.0
"This place has a cozy atmosphere and was perfect for a nice night out with my boyfriend. There is an open view to the kitchen from the dining area which I love. Everything we ordered was tapas style and absolutely delicious - we scraped every last night of sauce off the plate. Some of the things we ordered:BBQ, braised short rib sliders - perfectly tender meatA soft shell crab dish that was very fresh and tastyWe finished off with a dessert of their bacon donuts and coffee ice cream. An amazing combo of sweet, salty and a bit smokey. I would love to come back!",5.0
"Make a reservation! We went here on a Saturday night.SERVICE: (A+) Great! Everyone was really friendly. We did not have a reservation and called ahead but they told us when they will start having tables available. When we go there she took our name and suggested we have a drink next door. She took our phone number and called us when our table was ready.They even let us switch tables so we could sit out on the ""patio"". Everyone was attentive and we did not want for anything. FOOD: (A) This is a tapas style meal which was really great because I like tasting everything so you get a really great variety and it's a nice interaction with the table.Tomato Soup Shooter: They bring you this complimentary. It was a bit over salted.Escargot: This was very tasty, the sauce they use is good. I don't know if I would order again though.Buffalo Frog Legs: This was my first time eating frog, it's like a cross between chicken and a white fish. I was not a fan, but the rest of the table loved it!Duck Spaetzle: This was DELICIOUS. The textures were great and all the flavors came together so well - flavor explosion!!!Strawberry Ribs: These tasted like Chinese BBQ ribs but with better texture/fall off the bone.Pork Chop: This was incredible. I don't even like pork chops, but it was heavenly/perfectly cooked. WINNER.Scallops: I was excited to try these after reading some reviews but was disappointed. They were cooked perfect, nice portion, good texture, but over salted!! I would not order this again.Short Rib Sliders: OH MY GOD. If you like sweet BBQ sauce then you will love these. We all flipped over them. I would go back just to get this. Came with sweet potato fries which are always yummy.Crispy fried Quail w/ sweet squash: This was good, the quail was a bit chewy though, I don't know what happened there. The batter they used was just good, not great. The sweet squash though was heaven but doesn't justify ordering this again.Bacon Doughnuts w/ Coffee Ice Cream: These were so good. The bacon on top was crispy bits that gave them a nice crunch and the coffee ice cream was refreshing. Perfectly sweet and salty.Pineapple cleaner: They gave us a piece of pineapple at the end with some sort of pomegranate/basil syrup on it. At first I thought, ""whatever"", but they I put it in my mouth and whatever they soak it in packed a lot of flavor. Yum!!VALUE: We were there for 2.5 hours, table of 3 people, we each had 2-3 drinks; total was $240 (includes tip), but we over ordered!! We opted not to have the tasting menu ($45/pp) because we rather chose our own items off the menu - the tasting is just items that you can pick yourself. WILL I GO BACK? Yes, I like a menu that changes regularly and they have great service. Definitely get the Short Rib sliders!!",5.0
"The food is served tapas style so you share it with your party. There were 4 of us and the waitress recommended 8 dishes, and it was just a little less than perfect, so we ended up ordering 2 more dishes, which ended up a little more than perfect.  The dishes range in size and price.I thought the food was very good for the price level. Nice atmosphere and the service was good.  My favorite dishes were Berkshire pork belly and the lightly fried frogs legs - it was tender and flavorful and it tasted much better than chicken.  I think if the prices were higher, I would have rated it 4 stars, but for the price, I am a fan.  There were a few bottles of nicely priced wines that were terrific and the cocktails were quite yummy.I would definitely return and recommend to friends.Here are a few minor dislikes - annoying but not a deal breaker: 1.  Making a reservation is a bit odd. You have to call (do not email) and they will have a reservation person call you back.  The process was relatively simple and reasonably quick, but a bit odd.2.  We did feel a bit rushed, but it was a Friday night and I'm sure they wanted to turn the table.  3.  Also there is only one bathroom, and it's near the server's station, which means when you stand in line for the bathroom, you are going to be in someone's way.  It's a bit annoying when the Maitre D reprimands you that you are standing in the way of the servers.",5.0

"Traif review2/13/2014This was my second visit to Traif. Besides braving the weather again after going to the Knave in the Parker Meridian for coffee and hot chocolate, we were also venturing into Brooklyn. We took the M train and walked around the corner, which in nice weather seems very fast but the rivers that the streets had become really made this more like fording creeks on the Oregon trail. After walking by Shiksa and realizing their favorite waitress was working there that night, we made our way to Traif. We started the evening with cocktails. I had a Red Pearl (or 3), which is chili infused vodka muddled with Thai basil, kiwi and citrus sour. One of the best drinks I have ever had. My friend had the Rude Little Pig which is lapsang infused tequila with orange liqueur, pomegranate and a bacon rim. I have had this before and for me the bacon rims tastes a little too much like artificial liquid smoke. Her boyfriend had the Dacker Adirondack Ale which was great.Becca, our waitress was phenomenal, letting us order our plates a little at a time because we prefer having only 1-2 at a time. While we were waiting the staff greeted us with an amuse of the bacon broth. I don't quite remember the order of dishes but we started with a few salads. The Macintosh, pomegranate, cranberries, greens with bacon and blue cheese was light and delicate. The cheese was grated into a fine dust instead of hunky which my friend's boyfriend enjoyed. We also has the tricolore salad with grapefruit, clementines, currants, carbs al vino, and sunflower seeds, this was very bright and fresh but I think I preferred the first. The burrata with roasted beets, raspberries, pomegranate yogurt and mint was my least favorite dish of the evening. Way too sweet, it was like eating dessert. Burrata doesn't have enough salt to stand up to the sweetness of both beets and fruit. Eternally on the menu, we had two orders of the spicy big eyed tuna tartare on top of little tempura Japanese eggplant rounds with kecap manis. Still one of my favorites. It warrants saying that my friend is picky about meat products due to animal rights so many of the dishes are off limits. We did get to have the braised escargot with pork sausage, roasted wine mushrooms in a red wine sauce that came with two thick toasts for sopping up the sauce. She did not try the snail but it was her boyfriend's first time so I bullied them into ordering it. Could have been a little more flavorful but it was nice and light which escargot don't have s a tendency to be due to the butter that people use with them. The salt and pepper shrimp with pineapple, roasted yam, snow peas and sweet spicy Thai vin were another highlight of the meal. So much better than the shrimp at ABC cocina. Sadly most of the other pork, duck, foie gras, beef, sweetbreads dishes were off limits for ordering but I saw them all go by and I really wanted one of everything. Supposedly the last menu at Traif was even better. Although I wasn't a proponent of ordering it, the baked muenster cheese with smoked chorizo, golden apples and crostini was another stand out dish of the evening. Perhaps another bite of apple or crostino would have helped the amount of cheese but it was not excessive, being served only in a small ramekin. Our final two dishes included the sautéed broccoli rabe with portobello mushrooms, truffle toast, fried egg and aged asiago and skate cheeks ""New England chowder"" braised bacon, spinach, potato and leeks. The egg on the broccoli rabe would have been better if we had eaten it right away but it over cooked and became hard boiled. I partially blame my friend who turned it over so it would drain into the bread but didn't pierce it enough. Not at good as I remember. The skate cheeks were like a chowder but large pieces instead of incorporated. Buttery texture and a nice light taste, they were another highlight for me. We decided to order the bacon doughnuts because we thought they only came two to an order. They brought us four, along with panda cotta on the house and sweet vermouth after dinner drinks. Another fabulous meal. I specifically complemented Becca on her impeccable service, aside from the little freebies (they also bring a piece of pineapple to refresh you at the end), they were wonderful and attentive, water always in the glass and the drinks just kept coming (by request of course).",5.0
"After watching Skyfall, Dave and I decided to head into the heart of hipsterville and check out Traif, which has been on my culinary hit list for sometime. Surprisingly, the restaurant is small but without any doubt, it was also buzzing with energy and smelled delicious once we stepped inside. With an open kitchen, their food is all prepared in a very small space. Personally, I love restaurants like this as it makes my experience feel more interesting and intimate. If anything, their kitchen seem chaotic and impossible to maneuver but all the dishes that they presented to us that evening was fantastic. Dave and I ordered a few dishes and without hesitation we both agreed that their duck confit with barley was the absolute best. The leg was moist, yet tender and literally melted off its bone, while the skin was thin and crispy. More importantly, the barley was al-dente. Like risotto, it was creamy, buttery and carried just the right amount of flavor to make it taste like a perfect dish. For dessert, we tried their much acclaimed bacon donuts with a scoop of coffee ice cream. Although the combination was interesting, I can't say I was oozing with delight as the flavor of the bacon was weak and not as dominate as I was hoping for. Nevertheless, I still recommend going to Traif at least once.  Their menu are seasonal and interesting, while their drinks are strong and well executed. More importantly the restaurant is fun, vibrant, and it definitely has a hiper'ish vibe that will give you a taste of that that ultimate Brooklyn uniqueness experience!",4.0
"Wish I could have actually eaten here. The menu looks so good.Was trying to put together a 25-person group dinner here, but the receptionist forgot to send details about putting together a pre-selected menu after I spoke to her, then didn't return my phone message when I called four days later to remind her, and when I called the third time and asked if they had gotten my message, she told me how busy they were and that she will get to it eventually.  When she emailed me two minutes later, she told me they were going to charge $6,000 (!) plus tax and tip for a dinner for 25 people, and we could eat at 5 PM (!) Regardless, renting out the restaurant was totally not what we wanted, but she either didnt't listen (to the conversation and the voicemail) or she is just obtuse. Either way, I didn't have the energy to start over with the explanation. It's NYC - we have plenty of other options.",1.0

This place is a hit or miss. I had friends who loved it and others who were super confused as to why there's so much hype around this place.To be honest I can see why. I had the soft shell crab for bunch. Wasn't impressed. The bf had the smoked salmon salad and it was banginnnn. So basically I think it's all coming down to what you get.,3.0

"A brief lesson on how your breakfast choice will be interpreted:McDonalds = I am buying you breakfast because that's how my momma raised me and because you're still around, but let's just be friends *Traif = You entrance me.  I want to skip through a field of flowers with you and wake up next to you every day for the rest of our livesSo be very careful about taking a love interest to Traif...because you may find yourself the object of lustful obsession!  Especially if you sit in the back patio, looking out into the sunny, flower-filled garden!Luckily, I did my dry run with Luscious Leckie, the perfect partner in crime, who never judges me when I suggest that we order the entire menu!  Thankfully, thoughts of the impending bikini season managed to rein in our impressive greed:1. Red Plum Salad ($6) - To be honest, we ordered the salad as a healthy concession, but it was so much more delicious than we ever imagined!  Slices of juicy red plum frolicked with bacon pieces, figs, cheese, mixed greens in a delicious truffle vinaigrette!  We loved it!2. Baked Blackberry Pancake ($8) - SOOOOO ludicrously thick and fluffy!  Stuffed full of ripe and juicy blackberries with delightfully crisp edges!  We spoke with the chef who mentioned that these are baked for optimal fluffiness!  Oh man!  Just thinking about these makes me want more!3. Egg-In-A-Nest ($9) - Think of this as the most opulently buttery, grilled cheese (brie) and mushroom sandwich imaginable with a hole cut out of the center and a perfectly fried egg tucked inside.  The hole is presented as a mini sandwich, which is simply adorable!  There are more mixed greens with the dangerously addictive truffle vinaigrette as an accompaniment!4. Chicken 'n' Biscuit ($10) - Perfect for sharing, we got two biscuit halves topped with decadent bacon gravy on either side of some minty apple salad, and perched upon those gravy laden biscuit halves were golden fried, juicy thighs with hints of honey here and there.  The bites with crispy chicken skin, fatty bacon and creamy biscuit were just...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 5. Bacon Doughnuts ($6) - We were pretty full, but there's ALWAYS room for dessert...and it may be true that we'd already had a sweet fix with the pancake, but NOTHING and NOBODY and certainly NO FULL BELLY was going to stop me from trying the famous bacon doughnuts...and if we were uncomfortably full and had to walk off our blimpyness after brunch, well, at least I can tell you one thing...IT WAS WORTH IT!  I HAVE NO REGRETS!  THESE DOUGHNUTS ARE JUSTIFIABLY FAMOUS!  EAT THEM!  You get four of these beauties (see picture) and they are munchkin sized yeast style doughnuts covered in dulce de leche and sprinkled with crispy bacon bits with a side of coffee ice cream that totally works with the flavors!6. Buttermilk Panna Cotta ($6) - Perfectly silky panna cotta with a bit of a tart kick from a luscious passion fruit sauce and adorned with pomegranate seeds, blueberries and blackberries has convinced me to order every single dessert on the menu every single time I go to TraifPARTING THOUGHT: I've spent so much time writing about the food that I've neglected to mention the incredibly warm service and the friendly owners!  They were awesome!  I can't wait to go back for dinner!  And if you are planning a solo meal, be sure to grab a seat at the bar where you can see the chef in action!* Unless we are talking Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and a Bacon Egg and Cheese McGriddle...then you're just sending mixed signals!",5.0

The atmosphere was also very creative and intimate. We started with the green salad, which had just the right amount of crunchy bacon and the vinaigrette was light and fitting. Then... the cinnamon/strawberry ribs - divine. Fell right off the bone and the glaze was delicious. The scallops were huge and cooked perfectly over a sweet corn risotto. The spaetzle was good as well, though not as memorable as some of the other dishes. Lastly... the duck confit over israeli cous cous. I was so full at this point, but couldn't help myself.

100% fantastic. I love the tasting menu. Meat on meat on meat.,4.0
This place is a hit or miss. I had friends who loved it and others who were super confused as to why there's so much hype around this place.To be honest I can see why. I had the soft shell crab for bunch. Wasn't impressed. The bf had the smoked salmon salad and it was banginnnn. So basically I think it's all coming down to what you get.,3.0

"A brief lesson on how your breakfast choice will be interpreted:McDonalds = I am buying you breakfast because that's how my momma raised me and because you're still around, but let's just be friends *Traif = You entrance me.  I want to skip through a field of flowers with you and wake up next to you every day for the rest of our livesSo be very careful about taking a love interest to Traif...because you may find yourself the object of lustful obsession!  Especially if you sit in the back patio, looking out into the sunny, flower-filled garden!Luckily, I did my dry run with Luscious Leckie, the perfect partner in crime, who never judges me when I suggest that we order the entire menu!  Thankfully, thoughts of the impending bikini season managed to rein in our impressive greed:1. Red Plum Salad ($6) - To be honest, we ordered the salad as a healthy concession, but it was so much more delicious than we ever imagined!  Slices of juicy red plum frolicked with bacon pieces, figs, cheese, mixed greens in a delicious truffle vinaigrette!  We loved it!2. Baked Blackberry Pancake ($8) - SOOOOO ludicrously thick and fluffy!  Stuffed full of ripe and juicy blackberries with delightfully crisp edges!  We spoke with the chef who mentioned that these are baked for optimal fluffiness!  Oh man!  Just thinking about these makes me want more!3.

"I was in NYC for a few nights and visited one of my good friends from college who lived in Brooklyn for dinner. She was a big foodie in college so I knew she would enjoy a good meal.

We were too busy catching up that it literally took us 20 minutes to finally look at the menu. Of course everything looked so good on the menu that it took us even longer to decide on something, but we finally decided to get 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes. The  waitress liked to refer to them as small dishes and larger dishes rather than appetizers and entrees...We decided on a salad and a eggplant tempura topped with a spicy big eye tuna taretare as our ""small"" dish and a bellflower pasta with sausage and peppers and mushroom risotto for our ""larger"" dishes. The eggplant tempura was a winner. The tempura wasn't oily and the fresh spicy tuna added a great kick to the eggplant. I ordered the mushroom risotto. Although some may have loved the dish, it was definitely not my favorite. The risotto was cooked perfectly but the mushroom sauce was overpowering and was just too much for me. After having a bite of my friends bellflower pasta dish, I instantly wished I had ordered hers. Although simple, the flavor was there and it was a nice final dish to the meal. She couldn't finish hers so I ended up picking at it. Although the place was very busy, our server didn't rush us and gave us just the right amount of attention throughout the meal.

Here's what we ordered:Black Nector Pluots with bacon: I love fruit, bacon, and cheese. Perfect amount of tangy, salty, and sweet! Who would have thunk to put these items together?Hamachi carpaccio: meh. It's my fault for ordering seafood at a restaurant known for pork. Strawberry cinnamon glazed baby back ribs: Heaven. My bf and I did the uncouth thing of running our fingers across the plate to get every last bit of the glaze.sauteed broccoli rabe: delicious but didn't hold a candle to the the black nector pluots and baby back ribs. Again, everything that I love (mushrooms, cheese, fried egg) combined in one dish. Desert: Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream and FREE Panna Cotta. I don't know if everyone gets free desert but it made us feel so special! The free desert made up for the long wait time to get our wine. Please note, the place is not conducive to holding a conversation if you're sitting at a table next to the bar. It's also very cramped so it's best to leave the big, chunky purse at home. I had first hung it on the back of my chair but then the servers couldn't get through and then I moved it to the side of my chair which people kept tripping over.  Remember, you're going for heavenly foods, not for silly conversation or space; It's New York people, there's no such thing as space.",5.0

I like most things about this place. The food however is underwhelming for me. It's just ok. Friends and I have plunked down a lot of money here and I'm always left feeling unimpressed.

There could have been more space between the tables, but coming from Manhattan, I'm used to eating in close quarters with dining neighbors so it didn't bother me as much as it would others.Ordered some cocktails, which were really delicious. I like how their cocktails have unique ingredients, which reminded me of drinks from a mixology bar. Now, food. Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese was my favorite dish of the night. It was melt in your mouth good. Second favorite was the scallops on a bed of risotto. The bacon doughnuts were quite delicious too at the end of the meal, so that would be my third favorite. We ordered seared foie gras, broccoli rabe with truffle toast, and breaded lamb as well. Although all were good, I wouldn't order them again next time like I would the other three dishes. Overall, I'd give this place a 4.5. Food came out with perfect timing in between each dish. It was also an open kitchen, so you can see the chef creating your food. However, minus .5 since I would've been more comfortable with more space and three out of the six dishes were good but not 5 stars good.",5.0
"Went on a double date here.  Hands down amazing food - but had to tell the service to slow it down with the plates.  It was AGGRESSIVELY fast.  As other reviewers have noted, they'll bring out the next course (and we opted for the tasting menu, so there were a LOT of courses to be had), while we were on our 2nd or 3rd bite of the previous course.  I absolutely hate feeling rushed through a meal especially when the food is so delicious, and the waitstaff seem to have perfected their job at making you feel like they are shoving food at you from every direction without getting a chance to breathe and enjoy what you have in front of you. Otherwise, a great bargain for the quality and amount of food though - highly recommend the tasting menu.",4.0
"DELICIOUS. This place is not overhyped. It really is amazing. You must do the tasting menu -- every bite makes you want to melt! The bacon doughnuts... well, we even went as far to order some to go, which they totally accommodated for us. AMAZING.",5.0
"Been here three years in a row for my birthday...alone, with mom, and with one of my gfs. (Not enough, btw, but I like to try other places too.)I really love this place. It's quaint and has an incredible feel inside and on the patio. The waldorfish salad with mezclun greens, pears, bacon, cranberries, nuts, blue cheese, etc. is super good for a starter. Salt and pepper shrimp are SO good...don't let the simplicity of the name fool you. Sweet potato and pineapple chunks and green beans w the shrimp creates this perfect combination of flavors that explode in your mouth! I loved the braised short rib sliders and sweet potato fries with the little sauce. Calamari - nice and crispy, awesome!...eggplant with tuna tartare - awesome (and I am no fan of the texture of eggplant)! Muenster cheese and chorizo - super rich and greasy as you would expect cheese and sausage to be but just delicious, especially when sizzling hot (as its served). I'd recommend ordering extra toast and def sharing between at least 3 ppl. I'm surprisingly not excited about the strawberry cinnamon ribs...seems like they were missing something?Wait staff is very attentive and keeps the food rolling out. A couple behind me actually asked them to slow down because they wanted more time in btwn. The staff was very accommodating. Never knew there were so many photos on yelp...no point in adding mine but if def recommend you check them out. Visuals are always nice.Make a reservation.The one thing I didn't like is that they don't typically seat just one person at a table...you'll have to sit at the bar espec if they're busy.

"My favorite aspect of this restaurant is the service.  The hostess seated us much earlier than our very late reservation though the dining room was packed, and our main waitress was phenomenal in her ability and warmth.  I am a bit over the whole exposed kitchen thing, especially in a very small space (though i understand the reasoning), because all that meat being seared and grilled creates a smoky atmosphere that you take home on your clothes.  Still, Traif was a great experience.",4.0
"Came to Traif for my 30th birthday and I stil remember as if it were yesterday (July 22nd). The five stars is for the food. I wish we could have sat in the back room because I heard the atmosphere is a lot less loud and cramped, but I still had a rocking time. Here's what we ordered:Black Nector Pluots with bacon: I love fruit, bacon, and cheese. Perfect amount of tangy, salty, and sweet! Who would have thunk to put these items together?Hamachi carpaccio: meh. It's my fault for ordering seafood at a restaurant known for pork. Strawberry cinnamon glazed baby back ribs: Heaven. My bf and I did the uncouth thing of running our fingers across the plate to get every last bit of the glaze.sauteed broccoli rabe: delicious but didn't hold a candle to the the black nector pluots and baby back ribs. Again, everything that I love (mushrooms, cheese, fried egg) combined in one dish. Desert: Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream and FREE Panna Cotta. I don't know if everyone gets free desert but it made us feel so special! The free desert made up for the long wait time to get our wine. Please note, the place is not conducive to holding a conversation if you're sitting at a table next to the bar. It's also very cramped so it's best to leave the big, chunky purse at home. I had first hung it on the back of my chair but then the servers couldn't get through and then I moved it to the side of my chair which people kept tripping over.  Remember, you're going for heavenly foods, not for silly conversation or space; It's New York people, there's no such thing as space.",5.0
"All I can say is HOLY CRAP this place is AMAZING!!!! Dinner was delicious and Dessert (the bacon donuts with coffee ice cream) was out of this world!! If you try it and don't like it, there is something seriously wrong with you. Definitely worth the 45 min drive for me.",5.0
"I really wanted to like this place. I really did. This was my third visit. Make sure you get a reservation because the walk-ins during weekends are 60 to 90 minute waits. This restaurant does a lot of things right. Management of reservations and waits is effective, polite and even friendly.  The service was excellent. The menu is playful, interesting and smart. I like most things about this place. The food however is underwhelming for me. It's just ok. Friends and I have plunked down a lot of money here and I'm always left feeling unimpressed. Everyone else seems to love it here though. The chef's wife runs Xixa next door which I may try next.",3.0

"A trendy, romantic establishment with a large assortment of small, medium, and large dishes meant to be shared family style.  Their wine list is compact but well chosen.  We had the roasted brussel sprouts which lacked flavor and was a bit on the limp side.  The Berkshire pork belly with currants was unfortunately very dry in the lean parts but the fat part was very good, and the currant sauce was excellent.  The salt and pepper shrimp was just ok but the siracha sauce was excellent.What I loved was the duck confit risotto and the bacon doughnuts.  The risotto was a mixture of wild and Arborio rice which was prepared very well. The duck was fabulous.  The doughnuts were fried nicely with small bits of bacon dotting the maple glaze.  It was served with coffee ice cream which paired well with the smoky bacon.  I'd go back for the above two dishes!  Service was extremely friendly and they let us nurse our wine for 4 hours without giving us any stinkeye.",4.0

"I thought Traif was going to be another snooty place that was way overpriced for something way undertasty.

We went for the chefs selection.  For $50 we got 6 courses including dessert. All we had to do was tell the waiter if we had any favorites and whether or not we were adventurous eaters.  We responded ""pork"" to former and ""absolutely"" to the later.  He also recommended a great wine. Each of the small plates were very flavorful and beautiful. The pork belly was perfectly cooked, and the sliders were magic. Even the foie gras (not usually my favorite) was perfect.

"Almost missed reviewing this place as it was cute but not to be forgotten. Although we had a reso for another night, we decided to take the train DT after Book of Mormon (another must see) and walked right in to sit at the bar.  And it was much better than going anywhere stuffy in mid-town or above 14th, that's for certain. Quite a young, hip and casual crowd and a perfect way to end a perfect eve and day that started out at the Transit Museum (another must see in Brooklyn Heights). The hostess was extremely pleasant both in person and on the phone so kudos to her (not sure if it was the same one both times) as was the bartender. He was a cool hipster-actor dude who turned out to be from YYZ so that was fun, too.The only downside was it was so extremely hot, (as is NY this time of year) and although I wore a short, lightly knit dress it was almost impossible to bear. That and there was only one BR per gender which is of course the norm in these parts. But getting here was easy and I'd highly recommend it (although we had to pretty much walk in the dark off the subway to get there as google maps steered us out of the way).I combed the rewiews and this was what we decided on although I have to say that the burger looked amazing. It was fun to dine at the bar and watch them cook. A few standouts: 1. strawberry-cinnamon glazed berkshire baby back ribs- (delicious but not big enough of course),2. fresh mission figs & its mostarda, burrata cheese, shaved foie, thai basil, hazelnuts, balsamic-delicious3. hamachi carpaccio, avocado mousse, pluots, tarragon, asparagus, truffle-soy-sesame4.seared dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, caper-tomato-lemon brown butter 5. and of course, the donuts for dessert-they really were as good as people said they were! cocktails (ask for a light not too sweet one if you are like me). Overall, definitely rec. by me, esp. if you want to get out of the city and experience Billyburg at night. Too bad we were too stuffed to go to the cool little bar up the street that they also own. 4.5 stars.",4.0
"The food was really really interesting, but I felt that it was a bit hit or miss. It's all smallish plates (but not tiny). Six choices for two people who eat a lot was VERY filling. Get four if you don't overeat on the regular.The great: the burrata and the roasted carrot salad. The burrata was perfectly creamy, with a really interesting ""grilled aspiration"" (whatever that is) of something and some lovely bitter notes in the sauce. I would go there again just for that. The roasted carrot salad was a mixed green salad with cheesy bits mixed in. It was perfectly balanced.The good: the cinnamon-strawberry ribs. The meat fell off the bone, and if I liked ribs more, I would have loved it.The OK: the foie gras, the toasted spaetzle, and the key lime pie. The foie gras had a weird tough texture on the outside, and was like liver added to a fried egg, bacon, and maple syrup. The toasted spaetzle was greasy and flavorless. I wouldn't get either of those again. The key lime pie was good, but like every other key lime pie I've ever gotten, nothing special.The service was great, and I asked for a non-alcoholic cocktail. The result was amazing - some sort of minty spritey thing. I could have had six. Too often, ""craft cocktails"" are gross and bitter. This was perfectly balanced.I'm knocking off a star for the noise. It was REALLY REALLY loud. Like, I was raising my voice to be heard and couldn't hear my date. This is a dimly-lit romantic place. It shouldn't be so shouty. The new ""no sound insulation"" trend in restaurants is awful.",4.0
"Coming from Chicago, Traif was one of the most enjoyable and unique dining experiences I've had in any city. I went here over the weekend with a group of 8 people, so we took advantaged of the Chef Selection, which included 9 entree courses and 2 dessert portions. Doled out in tapas-style small plates, each dish was awesome in it's own way. Our selection was relatively pork centric (not a bad thing), which included belly, ribs, and sliders to name a few. Everything from the drinks (bacon salted rim anyone?) to the ambiance (low-lit intimate, feel-good music) was on point. If you want to indulge in an unreal, Brooklyn-fueled food journey, get yourself over to Traif.",5.0
"There's not much that I can say about Traif that the others haven't already.  The distribution of the reviews are somewhat correct, although I honestly dunno how anyone can rate this place less than 3 stars.The waitstaff is completely attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is top of the line.  The rotating menu keeps me coming back, and the fact is, the menu is so vast that I'd come back regardless.  There aren't many places that come to mind that top this one, and I really do feel that this is my favorite in Brooklyn at this point.A couple items that come to mind which I do love are:  Bacon Donuts, Bacon wrapped dates, pork belly such and such (sorry can't remember), short rib sliders, hamachi.  Oh jeez, I can't remember all of the good ones, but please know that it is only a blur because all of it is so damn good!If you are at all on the fence, give it a shot, read a more thorough review and form your own!  I can assure you, the 1000 or so that have already posted aren't totally off ;).",5.0
"Few things live up to the hype but Traif may be the rare exception.  I ate here recently and the entire evening was almost perfect, from the reservation process (via email, with immediate responses) to our wonderful waitress who even moved us when we were stuck next to a loud table (and claustrophobically wedged into the corner).  We ordered a white wine--I don't remember too much about it; it did the trick.  Foodwise, we were advised to order 5-6 plates to share.  This may have been a little too much, i think we would have been fine with 4, but this way we got to try more.  We ordered a salad with peaches and blue cheese (fine; I might skip it though and save room for the more exciting stuff), the pork belly, the fried egg with kale, and meunster with chorizo.  The egg dish was actually quite large, and we couldn't really finish it.  it was a little boring, but I was also getting full here.  The pork belly was incredible.  it was a few days ago and I'm still thinking about how good it was.  Lastly we got the meunster chorizo.  Here is where I felt like the set-up could have been a bit better.  For a substantial ramekin, we got 4 micro pieces of toast.  We asked for more bread right away, but it took them awhile to provide and in the meantime our molten cheese hardened to an unappetizing gummy texture.  Dessert somewheat made up for the bread sitch; we ordered the bacon donuts (obviously) which were great, although just tasted like donuts, and banana pudding which was amazing!  I wish I'd finished the whole dish, but at this point I was near the painful point of being full, so sadly had to stop.  Next time--less dishes, more bread with the cheese and get the pudding!",5.0
"I've been on a hiatus from Yelp for the past couple of weeks. So what better way to make up for lost time than reviewing one of the BEST, if not the BEST restaurant in all of Williamsburg. Traif is undeniably a foodie lovers paradise. Eating here is like there's a party in my mouth and all of Traif's dishes have VIP accessTraif apparently is translated from a hebrew word that means non-kosher food and kosher friendly, it is not. Because a good majority of the dishes being cranked outta this kitchen has some form of tasty swine attached to it. One of thier signature cocktails; The Rude Little Pig, even has bits of bacon on the rim of the glass. The chef/owner, Jason Marcus, ironically, is Jewish. Go figure.The ambiance here is very hipster and has a romantic vibe to it. The decor is very eclectic and on top of all the good food you get to have, you also get to see all the action in their small open kitchen. Another plus is they have a garden room where you can dine outside overlooking their garden. Def a cozy date spot.The menu isn't very cohesive and a bit on the schizophrenic side but every component on all the dishes I was served melded together so divinely. The only way I can describe it is; if Picasso and Daisy pig hooked up, Traif would be their illegitimate lovechild.  Word for word, this is what we had:Spicy Big-Eye Tuna served on top of Japanese Eggplant Tempura drizzled with Kecap Manis. The tuna was very fresh and the tempura eggplants were light and very crispy. Addicting!!! $9Berkshire Pork Belly with Rhubarb, Grapefruit, Blackberries and Sugar Snap Peas. The pork belly was seared until most of the fat was rendered out. It was crispy yet when it hit your mouth it melted like butta. Everything else on the dish was relevant and when you had the pork with the grapefruit and blackberries it was the perfect bite. So very Yummy. $11BBQ Short Rib Sliders with Sweet Potato Fries and Smoked Paprika Aoili. Pretty much self explanatory. Simple yet oh so delicious. $9Seared Dayboat Scallops with a Sweet Pea Risotto in a Brown Butter Lemon Caper Sauce. This was flawless, the scallops were seasoned and seared perfectly. The sweat peas enhanced the creaminess of the risotto that was cooked al dente. $17Crispy Softshell Crab with Crushed Avocado, Pineapple Sambal, and Papaya. The softshell crab was fresh and tasted light, not at all greasy. I loved the sweet and spicy elements of the pineapple sambal that complimented the dish very nicely. $22My absolute favorite dish of the night, hands down, had to be the Strawberry- Cinnamon Glazed Pork Baby Back Ribs. This was BOMB, completely off the chains delicious. The ribs were so tender yet crispy from the aromatic cinnamon BBQ glaze. The acidity from the fresh sliced strawberries offset the fattiness of the ribs perfectly. Oddly enough, this was served with a bowl of lemon water to clean your hands after you eat em. Which I thought was completely pointless because at that point I had sucked my fingers clean. $9The grande finale of the night was dessert.. Bacon Doughnuts!!!! It was 4 mini doughnuts sitting in a pool of dulce de leche with a scoop of espresso ice cream sprinkle with crumbled bacon.  This was a complete mind f*ck for me. It was so sinfully good that I was speaking in tongues. Doughnutty caramelly porky goodness. There's drool running down my chin as I'm typing this.The waitress was really helpful and very nice, not the phony kind of nice either. The only bummer of the night was we couldn't partake in the chef's $40 tasting menu because they need a minimum of a group of four, I thought that was pretty weak. But that was the only minor setback for an overall awesome dining experience.So when I left that night I was happier than a pig in shit........ See what I did there?",5.0
"Their dish combinations are creative and brilliant. Who would've thought of ribs with strawberry & cinnamon, bacon and doughnuts...and it works! Culinary magic!No wait needed that rainy week night when we walked in. Tapas style, they have one long sample menu to share. Reasonable prices,  ($6 to $18 max). We shared, not in order of deliciousness:*the autumn salad; with apples, cranberries, greens, bacon (of course), pecans, and blue cheese. Great combo. *confit crispy chicken wings five-spice glase*strawberry-cinnamon baby beef ribs, *crispy braised pork belly with avocado, corn, tomato marmaladeEvery single dish was delish! Beautiful presentations. The flavors were so interesting and different. We were both satisfied. Honestly I feel like you couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu. For dessert, had bacon doughnut, dulche de leche with coffee ice cream on the side. Blew my mind!On top of great food, they also had great service to match. Decor was very inviting with bright colors. It didn't feel odd at all sitting next to the kitchen watching the chefs work. I got hungry just writing up this review. Def heading back there soon.Best value fine-dining adventure!",5.0

"Almost missed reviewing this place as it was cute but not to be forgotten. Although we had a reso for another night, we decided to take the train DT after Book of Mormon (another must see) and walked right in to sit at the bar.  And it was much better than going anywhere stuffy in mid-town or above 14th, that's for certain. Quite a young, hip and casual crowd and a perfect way to end a perfect eve and day that started out at the Transit Museum (another must see in Brooklyn Heights). The hostess was extremely pleasant both in person and on the phone so kudos to her (not sure if it was the same one both times) as was the bartender. He was a cool hipster-actor dude who turned out to be from YYZ so that was fun, too.The only downside was it was so extremely hot, (as is NY this time of year) and although I wore a short, lightly knit dress it was almost impossible to bear. That and there was only one BR per gender which is of course the norm in these parts. But getting here was easy and I'd highly recommend it (although we had to pretty much walk in the dark off the subway to get there as google maps steered us out of the way).I combed the rewiews and this was what we decided on although I have to say that the burger looked amazing. It was fun to dine at the bar and watch them cook. A few standouts: 1. strawberry-cinnamon glazed berkshire baby back ribs- (delicious but not big enough of course),2. fresh mission figs & its mostarda, burrata cheese, shaved foie, thai basil, hazelnuts, balsamic-delicious3. hamachi carpaccio, avocado mousse, pluots, tarragon, asparagus, truffle-soy-sesame4.seared dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, caper-tomato-lemon brown butter 5. and of course, the donuts for dessert-they really were as good as people said they were! cocktails (ask for a light not too sweet one if you are like me). Overall, definitely rec. by me, esp. if you want to get out of the city and experience Billyburg at night. Too bad we were too stuffed to go to the cool little bar up the street that they also own. 4.5 stars.",4.0
"The food was really really interesting, but I felt that it was a bit hit or miss. It's all smallish plates (but not tiny). Six choices for two people who eat a lot was VERY filling. Get four if you don't overeat on the regular.The great: the burrata and the roasted carrot salad. The burrata was perfectly creamy, with a really interesting ""grilled aspiration"" (whatever that is) of something and some lovely bitter notes in the sauce. I would go there again just for that. The roasted carrot salad was a mixed green salad with cheesy bits mixed in. It was perfectly balanced.The good: the cinnamon-strawberry ribs. The meat fell off the bone, and if I liked ribs more, I would have loved it.The OK: the foie gras, the toasted spaetzle, and the key lime pie. The foie gras had a weird tough texture on the outside, and was like liver added to a fried egg, bacon, and maple syrup. The toasted spaetzle was greasy and flavorless. I wouldn't get either of those again. The key lime pie was good, but like every other key lime pie I've ever gotten, nothing special.The service was great, and I asked for a non-alcoholic cocktail. The result was amazing - some sort of minty spritey thing. I could have had six. Too often, ""craft cocktails"" are gross and bitter. This was perfectly balanced.I'm knocking off a star for the noise. It was REALLY REALLY loud. Like, I was raising my voice to be heard and couldn't hear my date. This is a dimly-lit romantic place. It shouldn't be so shouty. The new ""no sound insulation"" trend in restaurants is awful.",4.0
"Coming from Chicago, Traif was one of the most enjoyable and unique dining experiences I've had in any city. I went here over the weekend with a group of 8 people, so we took advantaged of the Chef Selection, which included 9 entree courses and 2 dessert portions. Doled out in tapas-style small plates, each dish was awesome in it's own way. Our selection was relatively pork centric (not a bad thing), which included belly, ribs, and sliders to name a few. Everything from the drinks (bacon salted rim anyone?) to the ambiance (low-lit intimate, feel-good music) was on point. If you want to indulge in an unreal, Brooklyn-fueled food journey, get yourself over to Traif.",5.0
"There's not much that I can say about Traif that the others haven't already.  The distribution of the reviews are somewhat correct, although I honestly dunno how anyone can rate this place less than 3 stars.The waitstaff is completely attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is top of the line.  The rotating menu keeps me coming back, and the fact is, the menu is so vast that I'd come back regardless.  There aren't many places that come to mind that top this one, and I really do feel that this is my favorite in Brooklyn at this point.A couple items that come to mind which I do love are:  Bacon Donuts, Bacon wrapped dates, pork belly such and such (sorry can't remember), short rib sliders, hamachi.  Oh jeez, I can't remember all of the good ones, but please know that it is only a blur because all of it is so damn good!If you are at all on the fence, give it a shot, read a more thorough review and form your own!  I can assure you, the 1000 or so that have already posted aren't totally off ;).",5.0
"Few things live up to the hype but Traif may be the rare exception.  I ate here recently and the entire evening was almost perfect, from the reservation process (via email, with immediate responses) to our wonderful waitress who even moved us when we were stuck next to a loud table (and claustrophobically wedged into the corner).  We ordered a white wine--I don't remember too much about it; it did the trick.  Foodwise, we were advised to order 5-6 plates to share.  This may have been a little too much, i think we would have been fine with 4, but this way we got to try more.  We ordered a salad with peaches and blue cheese (fine; I might skip it though and save room for the more exciting stuff), the pork belly, the fried egg with kale, and meunster with chorizo.  The egg dish was actually quite large, and we couldn't really finish it.  it was a little boring, but I was also getting full here.  The pork belly was incredible.  it was a few days ago and I'm still thinking about how good it was.  Lastly we got the meunster chorizo.  Here is where I felt like the set-up could have been a bit better.  For a substantial ramekin, we got 4 micro pieces of toast.  We asked for more bread right away, but it took them awhile to provide and in the meantime our molten cheese hardened to an unappetizing gummy texture.  Dessert somewheat made up for the bread sitch; we ordered the bacon donuts (obviously) which were great, although just tasted like donuts, and banana pudding which was amazing!  I wish I'd finished the whole dish, but at this point I was near the painful point of being full, so sadly had to stop.  Next time--less dishes, more bread with the cheese and get the pudding!",5.0
"I've been on a hiatus from Yelp for the past couple of weeks. So what better way to make up for lost time than reviewing one of the BEST, if not the BEST restaurant in all of Williamsburg. Traif is undeniably a foodie lovers paradise. Eating here is like there's a party in my mouth and all of Traif's dishes have VIP accessTraif apparently is translated from a hebrew word that means non-kosher food and kosher friendly, it is not. Because a good majority of the dishes being cranked outta this kitchen has some form of tasty swine attached to it. One of thier signature cocktails; The Rude Little Pig, even has bits of bacon on the rim of the glass. The chef/owner, Jason Marcus, ironically, is Jewish. Go figure.The ambiance here is very hipster and has a romantic vibe to it. The decor is very eclectic and on top of all the good food you get to have, you also get to see all the action in their small open kitchen. Another plus is they have a garden room where you can dine outside overlooking their garden. Def a cozy date spot.The menu isn't very cohesive and a bit on the schizophrenic side but every component on all the dishes I was served melded together so divinely. The only way I can describe it is; if Picasso and Daisy pig hooked up, Traif would be their illegitimate lovechild.  Word for word, this is what we had:Spicy Big-Eye Tuna served on top of Japanese Eggplant Tempura drizzled with Kecap Manis.

"Okay, so I see what all the fuss is about!I had to change my reservation a couple times and they were incredibly accommodating about it. When we finally arrived last night at 8:30, there was a bit of a wait for our table to clear up. Some people do not seem to understand that if you're visiting a restaurant like this, it is rude to linger over a glass of water for 20 minutes after your meal has been cleared away. (We actually saw a couple of different 4-person tables doing this while we were eating there and the server was polite enough not to rush them but you could tell she was chomping at the bit to bring them their checks so they would go. This is a place that holds class and standards above all, and they do not force the check on patrons until they ask for it, but, people! Come on.)We were three. Our meal was a veritable bacchanal. Two bottles of wine and 11 dishes later (including 2 desserts), we all moaned with satiety and contentment, rubbing our full bellies and recounting our favorite dishes.

My personal favorites were the pork belly with figs and oranges, potatoes bravas, tuna tartare on tempura eggplant and the salt & pepper shrimp (that sauce was pure heaven on anything it touched). Everything else was perfectly executed and delicious as well. One major standout was the chicken fried steak. Pure gluttony. The fry on this would have made a southern grandmother weep; crunchy on the outside, deeply juicy inside, covered in gravy and accompanied by a delectable slice of cornbread topped with black-eyed peas. Crazy.Our server was wonderful. Her name was Allison and her great sense of humor and the undivided attention she gave us at our table was as much a part of our enjoyment of Traif as were the bacon donuts and maple sugar pie that sent us sighing to the heavens at the end.

"This place was amazing! I came with my boyfriend and ordered the strawberry cinnamon ribs, braised short rib sliders,  tempura japanese eggplant with tuna tartare and the pork belly. Everything was amazing but the sliders were my favorite. The plates came out quickly, the waitress was awesome, the ambiance was really inviting and intimate. I would really recommend reserving a table because we had to wait about an hour for one, also our bill was about $80 which is more than we would have liked to spend for just two people so I would suggest coming with a group of three our four people and sharing. Otherwise, awesome place and I'll definately come again!",4.0
"I recently tried Traif after trying Xixa.  I found the portions to be a little bigger at Traif but the ingredients/dishes are similar.  I came with a group of 6 and we were encouraged to order about 18 plates.  We chose:Pork sliders, short ribs, brussels sprouts, soft shell crab, fried muenster cheese with chorizo, scallops, pork belly, shrimp, tuna tartare, prawns and fried chicken.(Some of the dishes we chose more than one so every one could have a generous taste.)My favorites were hands down the brussels sprouts, tuna tartare, pork sliders with sweet potato fries and the muenster cheese with chorizo.  There are a lot of heavy dishes so as you get full you tend to enjoy the next dish less than you probably would if you had it in the beginning.  The waitress never brought out the shrimp but by that time we were so full we didn't say anything and it wasn't on the bill so we didn't mind.For dessert of course we tried the bacon donuts- yum yum yum!  It tasted like a churro with a little salty taste.I liked the vibe, decor and service so I'd definitely come back.",5.0

"Great place, but since I went with my friend that was visiting from Hong Kong and we were speaking in Chinese, they totally tried to ignored us. Very rude though. The food wasn't bad.

"Came for dinner on a wintry weekend night: four people, ordered eight dishes to share. The menu changes and while all the plates were sent back cleaned, there was nothing amazingly mind-blowing, but two standouts: the porcelet chop and a bacon/pasta/brussel sprouts dish. Two weird things: the foie gras, which came with a scoop of sorbet and, when eaten together, was slimy-sweet to taste (and I love foie gras); the slice of bread in a broccoli rabe/egg dish, which added height but nothing else.Service was great, except for one last oddity: at the end of our eight plates, we wanted to order another porcelet chop, but was told by our server that she should've mentioned the caveat earlier, but you have to put in all your orders for the mains at the beginning. It would take another 25 minutes to fire/serve our chop, should we do it at the end of the meal. So we got dessert (panna cotta) instead, and she sent over a key lime pie as an apology. A table turning measure? Nonetheless, a sweet end to the meal.",4.0
"This will be my first review in three months, and with good reason. Traif, or ""unkosher"" in Yiddish, served some of the best dishes that I have had in months, in a trendy yet casual setting. Backtrack three months to Morgane, one of the worst French (or otherwise) restaurants to which I have been, and my ensuing hiatus from Yelp. Although I had a few decent meals between then and now, none inspired me to get back on until Traif. Its 4.5 rating truly reflects its quality.With a menu that can change from day to day, Traif offers a fresh selection of seasonal products in unique and and flavorful combinations. The plates are intended to share- similar to tapas- so it is ideal to order a few-- or more!-- depending on the size of your party. That said, reservations are recommended, especially if your party is large.In addition to their spectacular selection of dishes, Traif also offers a full bar- and delicious drinks as well!",5.0
Amazing!! Went on a Friday night with a couple of friends and we decided on the tasting menu. All I can say is that every plate was licked clean. The only dish we can say was just so-so was the pork sliders but everything else was amazing. Loved loved loved the Tuna Tartare and the Key Lime Pie. Run do not walk to this place.,5.0
"Came here for my sister's birthday. This place is all kinds of delicious. We had the chef's tasting menu. This is very affordable (~45$).  The menu is pretty seasonal, all I can say is, YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE. It is worth calling to make a reservation of your are looking to eat on a busy night. The food trumps the cocktails, but who cares!? The food is so good. I'd rather eat my calories than drink them. Don't have any foodie pictures to share because I was too busy eating to take pictures!",5.0
"The hundreds of Yelpers who have also dined at this restaurant have not lied and neither shall I!  Great, top quality food. Seating is a bit limited so it's best to have a reservation. They also offer a tasting menu if you're feeling overwhelmed by all the options.  Fyi, the sliders were the most amazing thing I've eaten in a long time.",5.0

Im from Miami and my cousin brought me here for a birthday group dinner. Food and drinks were amazingggg!! I love the tapas style of food they have. Alot of small plates and they just keep coming one after the other. Food is creative and were things you wouldn't think of eating or putting together! Love the low key setting and ambiance. Great service and friendly staff. Im always recommending this place to friends and definitely have to come back.,5.0
"You have to go here! Don't hesitate--just go! There are so many levels of flavor in the food! I like that you can share plates, as it certainly creates an experience of enjoying every single bite.

They are truly heavenly. And the key lime pie as well. I will definitely be going back!",5.0
"I have been coming to Traif regularly for the past 1.5 years and after last night's experience I am over Traif.  First we had the scallops with squash, scallops were cooked perfectly but the pairing was a bit off putting. The lamb tenderloin was a failure. The meat was tough to cut and the flavors were horrendous. The pomegranate beef rib was pretty good and the frog legs didn't disappoint. Overall service was borderline average, definitely not what it used to be. We ordered a bottle of wine that was terrible. First the waiter said it was on the house, later on he offered us free dessert as well. Only to come back with the check that clearly charged for the bottle of wine and he apologized for the wine being bad. Had he done that from the get go, and not offer what clearly he couldn't deliver I would have been fine, but flip flopping is just poor customer service. I have had some amazing meals at Traif in the past and this is one of the rare places in Williamsburg that the quality  of their service/meals justified the prices.

"As our super awesome waitress, Kayla, explained, Monday is Funday.  This is the day that the owner of Traif plans to be creative with the menu and the special drink selection to ensure each and every patron starts their week with a bang.  And so, we did.  Imbibe, eat, live.  As a Manhattanite, this restaurant made me love and long for brooklyn so much that after joking with the really friendly wait staff, bartenders, hostesses, etc, I literally rode the taxi home typing away at this review.  And wishing I lived here.Comes down to food, drink and service:Food -- on Mondays, it's all about the tapas and drinks.  We ordered the delicious truffley duck leg ""in mourning"" thanks to Monday's theme of Six Feet Under (my favorite show ever), the scallops on curry risotto, the freakin amazeballs Sweet Potato fries lobster poutine...

Really knocked me on my ass.- Thirteen Buddhas:  Kohaku no Yume Shochu is a great spirit, and to use it in this way in a drink is nice and very different with the marshmallowy-ness- The Zombie, limit one per person, pretty Baller-tastic.  Got me all drunk and in the mood to... Yelp?  Anyway, it was delicious, and is limited to one per person because QUE FUERTEEEE!Service:  Kayla is a Baller, a Shot Caller and a Holler(er?).  Great waitress, attentive, and fun to talk with.  Also, behind the counter, Raymond and Kaitlyn gave us mucho drinko when we left, to top off our nice night.  Very cool.Shiny jacket Kristen... hostess, I also salute you.Zombie kills.  Drink one.  Live longer.  Eat awesomer.",5.0
"I was very excited to try Traif, having heard great things and reading reviews and seeing pictures of the awesome-looking food. Although I'm Jewish, who doesn't like a little traif? =)The place was solid all around. It's got a great look, with the open kitchen and bar on one side you can see the staff doing their thing. Between three people, we ordered about 9 plates - this was plenty, as we were all full by the end of the meal, it was the perfect amount. Short rib sliders, pork belly, tuna tartar, pretty much everything we got was prepared well and tasted great. Our server, whose name I unfortunately did not get, was a very nice bearded gent with glasses who was helpful and informative. Water glasses were always refilled, seemingly instantaneously.Overall, dining with friends, dates, whatever, I recommend 100 percent.",5.0

"As good as it gets when it comes to food.This place should be in every city in this world so people can be happy for a couple of hours and couple of bucks.The food is the most amazing thing that has ever reached my tongue. It's a lot of crazy combinations, pomegranate, passion fruit, cinnamon and ribs, etc. which makes this place so good.The only thing that bothered me a little bit is the fact that they only have two veggie options and no vegan one (although I believe they could definitely make a vegan salad)Our waitress was god herself. She offered to make us non-alcoholic cocktails and also brought us a dessert on the house. She was super kind, super concerned about every detail and incredibly thoughful. I would marry her. Literally.So thanks Traif for making my life so much better.",5.0
"small kitchen but big menu. its a cozy and intimate place great food, friendly and helpful staff. (give them a nice tip). prices are very reasonable. its better to come in group of 3 or more. what liked was the they have tasting menu where you pay $50 for a person and get up to 9 dishes and plus 2 desserts. the food just keeps coming one after another by the time your done you may have to unbutton your pants and maybe go for a long run. but its all worth it. And if you reserve a table they take your  name and number down to call you and confirm. made me feel all special. 4 and half stares. why not 5 stares because they have frog legs and other weird stuff that kind freaky. but friendly staff and great service over all.",4.0
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York state. I give it a 5 start because everything was perfect from the food, to the cocktails, to the service. The dishes were very unique and all perfectly cooked and spiced. The cocktails were equally unique, made with good alcohol and extremely well balanced. All of the waiters were smiling,in a good mood, and happy to talk. I had some good conversation with the lady who was serving us, and she was very helpful throughout our dinner. Two of the people in our group had been there twice before, and the waiters/waitresses remembered and welcomed them very kindly, and offered us a free dessert at the end.The prices are not high at all for what you get, and it is wonderful that the dishes are small and meant to be shared. If you go with a group, its a good idea to order 2 of each dish so that everyone can try it. I'll be going here very often from now on!",5.0

Yelp?  Anyway, it was delicious, and is limited to one per person because QUE FUERTEEEE!Service:  Kayla is a Baller, a Shot Caller and a Holler(er?).  Great waitress, attentive, and fun to talk with.  Also, behind the counter, Raymond and Kaitlyn gave us mucho drinko when we left, to top off our nice night.  Very cool.Shiny jacket Kristen... hostess, I also salute you.Zombie kills.  Drink one.  Live longer.  Eat awesomer.",5.0
"I was very excited to try Traif, having heard great things and reading reviews and seeing pictures of the awesome-looking food. Although I'm Jewish, who doesn't like a little traif? =)The place was solid all around. It's got a great look, with the open kitchen and bar on one side you can see the staff doing their thing. Between three people, we ordered about 9 plates - this was plenty, as we were all full by the end of the meal, it was the perfect amount. Short rib sliders, pork belly, tuna tartar, pretty much everything we got was prepared well and tasted great. Our server, whose name I unfortunately did not get, was a very nice bearded gent with glasses who was helpful and informative. Water glasses were always refilled, seemingly instantaneously.Overall, dining with friends, dates, whatever, I recommend 100 percent.",5.0
"STOP READING, STOP STARING AT YOUR SCREEN & GO EAT!You will not regret anything.You will be addicted.You will think about Traif's food- when you're up, when you're about to sleep, when you wake up.I stopped by last night & I can not stop thinking about this place.Believe it, this spot is official.It is extremely delicious.I will bring everyone here.I mean everyone.They've gained a new regular :)",5.0
"As good as it gets when it comes to food.This place should be in every city in this world so people can be happy for a couple of hours and couple of bucks.The food is the most amazing thing that has ever reached my tongue. It's a lot of crazy combinations, pomegranate, passion fruit, cinnamon and ribs, etc. which makes this place so good.The only thing that bothered me a little bit is the fact that they only have two veggie options and no vegan one (although I believe they could definitely make a vegan salad)Our waitress was god herself. She offered to make us non-alcoholic cocktails and also brought us a dessert on the house. She was super kind, super concerned about every detail and incredibly thoughful. I would marry her. Literally.So thanks Traif for making my life so much better.",5.0
"small kitchen but big menu. its a cozy and intimate place great food, friendly and helpful staff. (give them a nice tip). prices are very reasonable. its better to come in group of 3 or more. what liked was the they have tasting menu where you pay $50 for a person and get up to 9 dishes and plus 2 desserts. the food just keeps coming one after another by the time your done you may have to unbutton your pants and maybe go for a long run. but its all worth it. And if you reserve a table they take your  name and number down to call you and confirm. made me feel all special. 4 and half stares. why not 5 stares because they have frog legs and other weird stuff that kind freaky. but friendly staff and great service over all.",4.0
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York state. I give it a 5 start because everything was perfect from the food, to the cocktails, to the service. The dishes were very unique and all perfectly cooked and spiced. The cocktails were equally unique, made with good alcohol and extremely well balanced. All of the waiters were smiling,in a good mood, and happy to talk. I had some good conversation with the lady who was serving us, and she was very helpful throughout our dinner. Two of the people in our group had been there twice before, and the waiters/waitresses remembered and welcomed them very kindly, and offered us a free dessert at the end.The prices are not high at all for what you get, and it is wonderful that the dishes are small and meant to be shared. If you go with a group, its a good idea to order 2 of each dish so that everyone can try it. I'll be going here very often from now on!",5.0
I've been here so many times. Love this place. It is one of the best restaurants in NYC right now. Highly recommend it and make sure to make a reservation!,5.0
"This best has to be on your bucket list.Suggest on a rsvp or trying getting a table the day of. Luckily we were seated quickly and on the patio.2 places avg for person is enough to get a taste.The strawberry ribs melted into my mouth and fell off the bone. The scallops were made perfectly and were so delicious! Service was attentive and helpful!SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!Had to try the bacon donut and glad I did, something you just have to try. Coffee ice cream and bacon bits go together in high calorie heaven.",4.0
"I am honestly so happy that my boyfriend decided to surprise me and bring me here for my birthday. (Finally writing a review months later.)We were about 20 minutes late for our 9PM reservation, but they kindly sat us at the bar until our table was ready, which took no longer than 10 minutes. But during our wait, I ordered a mojito. Can't quite remember the exact name or ingredients but I remember the taste was very refreshing and delectable. Though it gave me a good buzz, I couldn't taste the alcohol at all, which is always the sign of a successful concoction.The restaurant was small, and a bit cramped, but the food and service definitely made up for it. The light was dim, the tables were candle lit, and the ambience was very trendy and hip. The tables were a bit small, but that didn't really matter since they didn't bring out more than one plate ate once. Meaning, they waited until you were done with each dish before bringing out the next, which I really appreciated. Doing so makes me feel like I'm not being rushed and it gives me time to savor the taste of each dish.After our table was ready, our waitress helped us move our drinks to the table as we got comfortable in the cute little candle-lit arrangement they had set up. First thing was first, she asked if this was our first time at the establishment. Once we said yes, she continued to explain the menu to us and how to order. Generally, we could order separate dishes for ourselves, or 4-5 dishes to share between two people. We decided to choose the latter.First dish was the strawberry cinnamon glazed baby-back pork ribs. We decided to choose this because it was the most-raved about dish on Yelp, and let me tell you. The meat slid off the bone without struggle. That's when you know it was cooked to perfection. And don't even get me started with the taste. The marriage of flavors was absolutely beautiful. It sounds like a bizarre combination, but I can't even stress how amazing it was. Perfect amount of sweet, perfect amount of savory.Second dish was the spicy bigeye tuna, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis. My boyfriend isn't a huge fan of eggplant, but I convinced him to try it, and we were not disappointed. He's not a huge fan of many vegetables in general, but I always told him, ""you don't like vegetables, because you've never had it cooked right."" And can I please tell you this dish was cooked right. It was cooked right, paired right, flavored right; everything was right, and nothing was wrong.Third dish was the crispy soft shell crabs. This dish so so delicious, I was a little sad it only came with two. It was one of those moments where you wish you could eat more because it tastes so good, but you're happy you can't eat more because you might ruin your appetite for more amazing food.Our fourth dish was the day boat scallops. Can I please explain that I've never seen scallops this big, juicy, and delicious. I'm telling you, absolute heaven in my mouth. The texture, the taste, everything was perfection. Just thinking about this is making my mouth water.And our last dish was the icy blue mussels. As you can see, we are a huge fan of seafood. Especially shell-food for that matter. But ooohhohhhohh, the cotdamn orchestra that was playing in my mouth when I took my first bite. I can't even fathom how anyone could speak negatively about any of the dishes I just spoke about.Last but not least, dessert. And what better to order, but the oh-so-popular bacon donuts! I mean, who doesn't love bacon and donuts? If you love both, why not try them together? Let's just say I wish I had room for more, because I would've ordered a second helping.Overall, food was fantastic and to-die for, service was very comforting, the decor was appealing, and the plates were a bit pricey, but completely worth it.Traif is known for marrying bizarre flavors and ingredients together but making them work. It's a hard thing to do, but they've succeeded. This restaurant is absolute perfection.10/10 would come again.10/10 would recommend.10/10 would trek from Queens without a car.10/10 are drooling at the memory of my experience.",5.0
"Myself, my boyfriend, and his mom went here to celebrate a birthday, and because we're friends with one of the chefs.  The food is definitely eccentric, so you need to be open-minded before coming here.  However, it's a great place to try some new things and branch out from the usual, because it's all done so well.  We tried almost 10 dishes from small to more full-bodied plates and all of it was great (except for the foods I'm just personally not a fan of, but I'm sure they were done well for those who are).  Definitely worth trying out if you're in the area.",5.0

"I was pretty disappointed in what turned out to be a mediocre meal after reading all the hype. Granted I dined during their rush, but even considering that.I ordered 6 dishes - none of which were truly excellent. Word I unfortunately have to use to describe my dishes are: oversalted, overcooked, and mushy. Nothing was overtly bad, but I wasn't impressed at all either. Service was decent, but I was never asked how anything was. I'm not the kind of guy to send food back for no reason, but a few dishes were disappointing enough that I would have requested replacements.My dishes:Asparagus: BTuna Tartar: BS&P Shrimp: CBuffalo Frog Legs: C+Pink Prawns: C-Ribs: BI was really hoping for a spectacular meal but everything lacked execution. Doubt I'll go back unless someone I'm with really wants to try. It was very reasonably priced at $90 with a cocktail though.",2.0
"While the food may be good (if you like meat, of course), the service is not.  Unfortunately I even took the time to email the owner to fill her in on the incredibly poor service we experienced and she failed to even grant me a response.  No email, no phone call, no acknowledgement from the owner or the manager to at least apologize for the crappy service we endured.This just adds to the ""we are too cool for even you, Williamsburg"" reputation that Traif already had garnered. I was very disappointed.",1.0
Dined last evening with 5 others The manner in which the food was served bordered on the ridiculousEach of the diners had their own choices and ordered accordinglyOne item was ordered by 2 couples One couple received  that plate within 15 minutes the other couple waited 30 minutes for the identical orderAnd although we understood the sharing concept of the restaurant the dish in question was to small to be shared by 4This set the tenor for the eveningSome reasonable size sharing portions some not but all took an extraordinary time to get to the table1/2 the dishes were fine(pork) the others were passableThe acoustics were such that you could only speak to the person next to you Even those across from you were inaudibleNot the place to enjoy a birthday event,1.0
"Why the F@$k didn't I come to Traif sooner? That was the question rolling around in my head as I dove into dish after dish last night. Traif is an incredible restaurant and definitely does not get the press it deserves. Maybe it's the location or the unassuming awning outside. You really wouldn't know it's a restaurant unless you walked up the door and see it says Traif. Who knows but I am here to tell you that if you want an unbelievable dining experience in a wonderful, relaxing atmosphere get your butt to Traif. The menu changes seasonally, and pretty much daily. Some of the dishes I received seemed to have different ingredients than of the printed menu.I sat at the counter, where you view the chef's cook right in front of you. They were working like a well oiled machine in very close quarters, with the head chef taking care of everything at the fire or stove station, and two sous chefs doing the fry station and a cold/salad station. A woman did an excellent job of expediting as she was teaching some new workers the ropes and how to describe each dish before presenting it to diners. It was a great way to see how a restaurant really operates, as well as get an inside peek at how the chefs prepare each dish. I'm still amazed at how they're able to turn out such beautiful, delicious food is such a tiny working area but somehow they get it done through a stroke of culinary magic.The biggest mistake I made was coming here by myself. This is a place best enjoyed with a group of food loving friends. I wanted to order one of EVERYTHING. They have a 13 course tasting for groups of three or more which I want to try with some friends. This time though, I ""settled"" of 6 dishes. After informing the gentleman behind the counter I intended on ordering 6, his eyebrows raised and he wanred me that depending on the dishes it could be too much food. I said I understood, but I didn't care and continued to rattle off my selections, much to his utter dismay. And the make your own tasting menu began:1. Black nectar pluots, burrata cheese, thai basil, hazelnuts, balsamic- This was a fantastic starter and obviously the lightest of the dishes I order. The burrata was signaturely creamy and milky, while the pluots added sweetness, the hazelnuts crunch and nuttiness, and the balsamic a wonderful acidic tang to pull it all together. Very delicious.2. Hampshire pork belly, hearts of palm, avocado, asparagus. Holy hell, this was freaking incredible. Pork belly is one of my favorite things in the world. Let's face the fact that yes it is on just about every menu these days. But that never prevents me from ordering it. This rendition was easily one of my top 3 ever eaten. The portion was tremendous, basically an 8 x3 inch long of perfectly braised then seared pork belly. Crunchy skin, luscious fatty inside. The asparagus added some freshness to cut through the fat and the avocado somehow worked as well. There was also a squeeze of a sweet red puree drizzled on the plate that was great and wish I had more.3. Strawberry-cinnamon glazed berkshire baby back ribs- After initially thinking of skipping this in lieu of the special pork chop, I went with this based on my servers urging. I'm glad I did. This is one of their signatures, and a must order. Another large portion consisting of 4 meaty ribs doused in the most delicious strawberry and cinnamon infused bbq sauce. Accompanied by a finger bowl after your done. Which I was within 3 mins flat. What a wonderful pairing. It was like french toast flavoring on meat. Innovative and mind blowing.If the menu wasn't so damn mouth watering I would have stopped there and been happy. But I had three more dishes coming as I was starting to feel satisfied..4. Sautéed sweetbreads, roasted asparagus, cauliflower, hon shimeji's, shiitakes, english peas- After the three dishes came out rather quickly, this one took the longest. Thank god cuz I needed the break. The chef first threw all the veggies in a pot filled with some type of glorious liquid sauce I couldn't make out and stews them for about 10 minutes. When theyre ready, he pan sears 4 HUGE sweetbreads and voila. The dish is assembled and wow another freaking mind blower. Top sweetbreads dish I've eaten and certainly the largest. These puppies were on steroids. Everything worked- the sauce was reminiscent of a piccata and was a nice topping for the perfectly cooked thymus glands.Courses 5 and 6 were served together. 5- Seared foie gras, yukon potatoes, bacon, sunny egg, maple, hot sauce. 6- cornmeal-crusted soft-shell crabs, yellow tomatoes, cornichon tartar, chipotle s&s.I won't go into too much detail but this was like Traif's take on surf and turf. Glorious in every way. Again, monster portions for moderate prices. I got 2 generous fried soft shells. Half way through I was ready to tap out, but it was so good I soldiered on and managed to polish off every last bite of both dishes. I left Traif a happy, FULL man!!!",5.0
"My boyfriend and I dined at Traif for his birthday last night. Although the space is quite small, the setting is very intimate and cozy. The menu is extremely comprehensive and they update it daily. The food is served on small plate similar to Tapas, so it's best to order around 6 plates total. The food was very good but I don't recommend getting the buffalo frog legs because it has an unappealing smell to it. The salt & pepper shrimp is a must! It's really flavorful. The Strawberry Cinnamon glazed baby back ribs are also a must! The name alone should persuade you.The service was immaculate! Our waitress was polite and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. And we never had to ask to refill our waters because it was done like clockwork. And the best part of it all was the bill. It was only $65, which is way less than you'd pay for a romantic night out with your boo in Manhattan.Happy stomach, happy wallet!",4.0
"Lovely place with a kind staff. I was there 2 days before just to eat a little bit before going to Williamsburg theater. Hadn't the chance to get back as this place is closed at midnight in week days. But i was sooooo damn good that i decided to get back yesterday, on a date. You *need* to try this place without any doubt (and to make a reservation for it). Their dishes are orgasm for mouths, their cocktails are tasty and well balanced, its staff is kind, quick, and friendly. If you go on a date, ask for the patio, that is more quiet and romantic than the crowded and noisy main room (the *only* bad side). You may think twice looking at prices, because, let's be honest, this place is a bit expensive, BUT that's totally worth it: this is the price of great cuisine. I'm a French Parisian guy, so, we are known for that, and for being picky (unfortunately ^^), but damn, go for it, that is a freaking good.

"Review for Saturday night visit for dessert only. Service:We walked up without reservation. Hostess was friendly and very accommodating in putting us at the bar when the tables were full. However, she miscounted and there were only 3 seats for 4 people. She noted that if something else opened up, she would reseat us. The reseating never happened despite several empty tables over the next 20 minutes. I stood the whole time near the register, constantly twitching to avoid getting in the waitresses' way. Food:1) Panna Cotta- incredibly ordinary. The fresh berries WERE appreciated.2) Bacon doughnut with coffee-llike ice cream- again, ordinary. Ice cream was delish (although ordinary) but the quantity was disproportionately small compared to the amount of doughnut.3) Complimentary watermelon cubes- dabbled with something fancy? Missed the explanation from the server in the loud atmosphere. Was appreciative of the gesture but again- ordinary watermelon.Drinks: Solid and unique mixed drinks although while sitting at the bar and observing the 'tenders- they were very inconsistent mixing the same drinks which could result in widely variant amounts of alcohol in each drink and in the resulting taste.Atmosphere:The atmosphere was incredibly loud and made having a quality conversation difficult. It was also a little uncomfortably warm (and I usually run cold). The back deck looked inviting and cute.Conclusion: Not likely worth a wait if there is one. Potentially good for weekday cocktails on the adorable back deck. However, if you are particular with your cocktail prep or discerning about dessert, this may be disappointing.",3.0
"Delicious food, great service and chill environment.  This has to be one of the best restaurants in NYC.I appreciate the organization this place has.  From the servers who give their orders to a woman who makes sure the chiefs know what needs to get done and in what order.  Our waitress was great! It was our first time there and she explained that it's more of a tapas style restaurant so we might want to order a few plates. We did the strawberry glazed baby back which were finger licking good.  It was followed by the most delicious prawns I've had.  We finished it off with the bacon donuts which was the perfect finale.  This place was just great, especially considering how small it was.  I was blown away by how their tiny kitchen area produced such great dishes in the time that they did.  It's a true gem!",5.0

"Bookmarked on 1/11/2012.Dined in on 4/11/13. What's the point? I've been waiting a damned long time to come here and it failed to meet expectations. I'll tell you why. (skip to service section if you want to go straight to the dirt)Food: The food was good, it just wasn't amazing. Clearly, this is always the hallmark for every restaurant. We had the Truffle Toast, Strawberry Glazed Ribs, Lobster Risotto, and the Porkbelly. They also gave us (and every other table) a complementary red bell pepper soup shooter which tasted like a cold tomato soup and ended the night with a refreshing bite of pineapple molasses with lime zest. Like I said earlier, the food was good. It just wasn't mind blowingly awesome... EXCEPT THE BACON DOUGHNUTS. I never eat dessert.. never.. but.. when I do.. I'll eat bacon doughnuts. Don't be afraid to order two. Three if you feel generous and want to give me one. =DService: This was the failing point. We were sat by the bar which I would recommend as you get an up close and personal view of the chef and his staff. However, over the course of the dinner.. the bartender was making his drinks and had splashed me, my face, my arm, and my shirt three different times. Each time he did not realize, even though I'm sitting there wiping myself down. I'm not opposed to a bartender throwing drinks down my throat. I guess I draw the line when he hits everywhere but. He also thought it was appropriate to provide us with water half way through our meal. I thought it was general practice for restaurants to provide you with water right away but what do I know. I'm not in the restaurant business right? Conclusion:It's a pity. The food is good but my experience was pretty abysmal. I hope I'm not sounding melodramatic but when you get a drink tossed in your face multiple times whether it's done on purpose or by accident.. it's a terribly degrading feeling. I was here with my girlfriend and it took a lot of self-control to not flip a shit. If she had told me she got hit with the drink.. well..

"So on a high level: the food was 75% great, the rest was frustrating. Food: The three stars are for the food. The portions are tiny but really flavorful. The only disappointing dish was the muscles--they were fishy which means they weren't fresh (shame on Traif for trying to get away with that).Ambiance: Maybe the ambiance would be nice inside, but we were stuck on the patio. Sounds nice, right? We were stuck at the table that shares a wall with the bathroom. Through the frosted glass window, a bright florescent light flicked on and off in our faces every time someone used the loo. For the amount we paid for our meal, I shouldn't have to think about someone taking a piss every 5 minutes.Service: Making a reservation here was infuriating.

Breathtaking. Tapas/small plates style, which I absolutely love.

"I first wanted to give Traif 1-2 stars right off the bat because they are so damn difficult to get a reservation with.

It's because they 1)don't use an online reservation system 2) don't answer their emails very fast and 3) they don't answer their phone.......like ever.I tried to call to make a reservation....left 2 voicemails, an email and called without leaving a voicemail at least 15 times throughout the day over a few days... it's 11, maybe they are just walking in the door to prep for the day and will hear my desperate calls for reservations...its 5, surely people are there ready to start dinner service.... My friend those are all pipe dreams. They will not answer your phone call. Since my husband and I live about 10 blocks away, we took a long walk one night and decided to make the reservation in person.

From the get-go Traif impressed all of us with this succulent soup!! 2)bacon wrapped dates & goat cheese :4 stars 3)duck confit with lentils and strawberry sauce: 4 stars. It was a unique dish with a complex flavor of savory, sweet, and tangy. 4) shrimp, sweet potatoes, string beans & pineapple: 4.5 stars. This reminded me of sweet & sour pork, but better. One of my favorite dishes that I ate at Traif that day.5) Seared fois gras with egg & potatoes: 5 stars. It sounded unbelievable and it tasted unbelievable. Pure joy! Did not disappoint! 6) Braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries: 4.5 stars. Very solid, loved it!!

"AMAZING! This place has got to be one of my top 5 favorite places. Located right after the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, it's a perfect location to take a date.

The food is very creative, I just love the way they incorporate flavors you normally wouldn't think of and make it taste so good. Must try the braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries. Best slider I've ever had. I'm drooling a bit just thinking about it. There's a few dishes I always get when I go to Traif and I highly recommend you them try (if they have it on the menu).

"So on a high level: the food was 75% great, the rest was frustrating. Food: The three stars are for the food. The portions are tiny but really flavorful. The only disappointing dish was the muscles--they were fishy which means they weren't fresh (shame on Traif for trying to get away with that).Ambiance: Maybe the ambiance would be nice inside, but we were stuck on the patio. Sounds nice, right? We were stuck at the table that shares a wall with the bathroom. Through the frosted glass window, a bright florescent light flicked on and off in our faces every time someone used the loo. For the amount we paid for our meal, I shouldn't have to think about someone taking a piss every 5 minutes.Service: Making a reservation here was infuriating.

"Thank you for being in existence, Traif.The dishes throughout its menu marries different ingredients together that most people would never think of joining, creating harmonious and effortless unions. I'd love to try everything, all seem (and probably are) fan-effing-tastic. Plus the menu changes weekly, adding to greatness since pleasant surprises are constant. RETURNING TRIPS ARE ABOUND.Highlights (late Jan 2013):- Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs (memorable tastes, included pomegranate seeds which gave it more texture)- Thai Peanut-Caramel Glazed chicken wings, toasted coconut, roasted chile (SCRUMPTIOUS, finger-licking goodness)- Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Sweet Potatoes, Pineapple Haricot, Sriracha Vin (similar to standard sweet and sour shrimp but not as sweet. I'm going to rip this dish off and add sweet potatoes to shrimp. Very comfort-food tasting and I kept wishing I had a small side of rice to enjoy it with)- Seared Foie Gras, Yukon Potatoes, Bacon, Sunny Egg, Maple, Hot Sauce (self-explanatory)",5.0

Lets not forget the bacon glazed donuts. Need I say more? I always take some home for my daughter.Can't wait to go back soon.,5.0
"arranged a dinner for a fairly large party of six here after having heard many rave reviews from friends and yelpers alike. Probably one of the most disappointing dining experiences to date.Let's begin with the dishes: Soft shell crabs - this was my first time eating a whole crab so I cant quite render my expertise. nevertheless, perfect breading, flesh was juicy. Spicy mayo was just, spicy mayo, what else is new? This was probably my favorite dish yet. Toast with truffle, greens, topped with a whole egg - well, it was the first time I had truffle in its whole mushroom form! But you really can't mess up a simple combination of cheese, egg, and mushroom. average.Scallop with risotto - Good, but can you find this in other Italian restaurants? yes. I can't even remember the rest.. perhaps reflecting how unmemorable the dishes were. I was not impressed. And AVOID the restaurant as a first-date choice unless you can score a table in the patio area. Because the kitchen is integrated with the dining area, it was stuffy, hot, incredibly noisy (I was straining to hear my friend sitting merely too seats away from me). All in all, stressful. Did I also mention that we waited 35 minutes to be seated even though I had reserved a table??Will not return.",2.0
About 1 year after I wrote this review we flew into Newark Airport for a long layover and even though we were staying by the airport we got an Uber to take us all the way to Traif and back. It did not disappoint.,5.0
"This was the easiest five star review I've ever given. I've never been so wholly blown away by a restaurant. I simply can't say enough good things about it. But I'll try...Oh I almost forgot, there was something really annoying about this place - I tried so hard for a few days to make reservations and their answering machine did not pick up. It just rang and rang and then some automated thing about calling back another time. It was frustrating because I wasn't about to give up this experience. Finally, on the third day I was able to leave a message and someone called me back in the hour and easily fit me in the next night. PHEW!!! close call. Okay, back to the rave...We arrived about thirty minutes ahead of our reservation (still trying to figure out the MTA) and expected to wait. Instead, we were seated instantly. The place is small and dim and packed and so perfectly warm. Even though it was close quarters I didn't feel uncomfortable. Rather, I felt friendly and welcome. Like I was dining in my best friend's house. The staff was a well orchestrated dance. We never once felt we needed anything. Everyone was in a lovely rhythm of filling the water glasses and clearing the plates. Everything was exceptionally timed. I was just so impressed.Drink options abounded and it was hard to make a decision but I did enjoy the run little piggy. It had a bacon salt rim that was so unique and fun. Loved it. We started with a pear salad. It was freshest of fresh pear, mixed greens, almonds, dried cranberries, parmesan tossed in a vinaigrette. My mother has already duplicated this recipe twice. A truly lovely dish. After that the broccoli rabe over texas toast with a fried egg. We saw the people at the table next to us enjoying this and knew it was for us. Dynamic dish and a brilliant use of ingredients. One can not eat enough broccoli rabe. Probably my favorite part of this meal (aside from everything else) was the salt and pepper shrimp. It was tossed in a sriracha sauce with pineapple and sweet potato chunks. Easily one of the most memorable dishes of my life. So inspired in its simplicity. The shrimp was fried but almost in a tempura way. It wasn't heavy or greasy but just a lovely crisp. Each bite with pineapple cooled the sriracha in a gorgeous way. Just do this. Still delicious but a little less memorable we had the duck confit nestled in a bed of barley and pig cheeks (my favorite pig part). At the end of the meal we loosened our waist bands and allowed ourselves one final indulgence (of the day). The bacon, dulce de leche donuts with the coffee ice cream was dessert bliss. They were very fluffy and yeasty and almost like little bits of sugar air. I just fell in love over and over with every bite. If all of that isn't enough to have you running to Brooklyn's Traif, may I also say that the music was some of the best I've heard in a restaurant. It was a great balance of hits and things you've never heard of. I seat danced the entire time. Traif is perfect. I don't know if you know or not... but seriously, perfect. Go now.",5.0
"Oh God dayummmm, Traif! YOU BLEW ME AWAY!My friend & fellow yelper James S. recommended me that I should come here so I did... Boy, that was a piece of advice that I will love forever!!!Truffle toast: soft yet crunchy... tasty & delicious. Complimented so well with the savory taste of the omelet.Chicken & biscuits: chicken was perfectly crisped yet juicy & tender on the inside. The biscuit wasn't too dry either. & to be paired up wth apples & a sweet gravy? Unique & delish!!!Baked pear pancake: the fluffiest, softest pancake i have EVER eaten. The outside had a slight crunchy texture... It's one of the best pancakes I've had in my life. & the taste of baked pears at the bottom of the pancake. mmm mm good!Bacon donuts: WOWSA! Small bite-size glazed donuts topped with bacon bits?? I hear the angels singing! & the warm softness of the donuts to be complimented with coffee ice cream? Now that's a kick your mouth will love!Staff is great with recommendations.Great place to lounge with friends on a lazy Sunday afternoon.Traif is definitely a hidden gem.

"I saved this place for 400th Review!Since then I've been here twice and love it.  Every person I've brought here says the same thing, ""I gotta bring my family/friends here.""That's when you know a place is great and worthy of sharing with others.So this place isn't a secret anymore and it's not so hard to get a table either.  Service is awesome and plates are served visually stunning and appetizing.  They also got a back yard garden now.  It's very small and quaint, but relaxing to sit next to if you get a table near the back.Each time I go, my purpose is to try something new.  But unintentionally I reordered a few items.  I guess these are my favorites, so give em a try!  4 dishes for 2 people is quite filling, especially if you want to save room for dessert.  They recommend sharing their plates because they are somewhat small for 1 person.  It's a great concept, but keep in mind these servings are also not your typical Tapas size.  Spicy big eye tuna tartare, tempura eggplant, kecap manis - I love how the mildly spicy (could be spicier IMO) sit on top of the puffy pillow like tempura eggplant.  The drizzled reduced balsamic sauce just tops it off.Strawberry cinnamon glazed baby back ribs - A very unusual pairing of seasonings, but it really works!  It's not overly sweet as I expected and the ribs are fall off the bone amazing.  They thought of everything, even a little bowl with wet towels to wash your hands from the saucy mess.  Seared scallops, creamed corn, sage-pistachio brown butter risotto -Maybe it's the risotto that makes this dish extra special.  It's so good, I've attempted to recreate this dish at home.  It's so good that my Fiance who isn't a fan of scallops named it his all time favorite dish at Traif.Every time we visit BK, I want to stop here.  I try and make an excuse to go to WillyB.  I even once considered riding a bike there all the way from Queens.  That's how much I love this place!  I'd make the trek just for the Bacon donuts...*does the Homer drool*  mmm...do'nuts.",5.0

"Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday.  A bunch of us flew out from Cali-for-nay-aye to visit our friend who has since relocated to Williamsburg for work.  She recommended this place and also advised that we all order a lot of little plates to share.  In addition to each of us ordering 1-2 plates each (there was five of us), we also ordered two bottles of wine and three desserts.The whole meal felt like a smorgasbord of shisito peppers, pork belly, five-spice hoison chicken wings, bacon wrapped dates, a cheese plate, soft shell crab, some sort of dessert with black sesame and chocolate pudding, some bacon dough nuts and seriously one of the best panna cottas I've ever had.And wine.  Boy did we have enjoy ourselves some wine.The restaurant is CRAMPED.  We were seated on the patio outside and it still felt a little bit small.  Service was great and I owe our great wine drinking to our server who was able to recommend some great white wines for us.This restaurant is truly a gem in Williamsburg and one of the best meals we had during our short 3 days in New York.  Truly a special place for us to have celebrated our friend's special day.",5.0
Excellent staff and food.   All the food is prepared in open kitchen you can view from the bar.  Definitely  will go back.   Foie grasWas excellent as the salt and pepper shrimp.  A little loud but it's rather tight so on a busy night it's to be expected.  Don't miss key lime pie.,4.0
"Thank you for being in existence, Traif.The dishes throughout its menu marries different ingredients together that most people would never think of joining, creating harmonious and effortless unions. I'd love to try everything, all seem (and probably are) fan-effing-tastic. Plus the menu changes weekly, adding to greatness since pleasant surprises are constant. RETURNING TRIPS ARE ABOUND.Highlights (late Jan 2013):- Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs (memorable tastes, included pomegranate seeds which gave it more texture)- Thai Peanut-Caramel Glazed chicken wings, toasted coconut, roasted chile (SCRUMPTIOUS, finger-licking goodness)- Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Sweet Potatoes, Pineapple Haricot, Sriracha Vin (similar to standard sweet and sour shrimp but not as sweet. I'm going to rip this dish off and add sweet potatoes to shrimp. Very comfort-food tasting and I kept wishing I had a small side of rice to enjoy it with)- Seared Foie Gras, Yukon Potatoes, Bacon, Sunny Egg, Maple, Hot Sauce (self-explanatory)",5.0
Get the tasting menu! Everything here is amazing. Menu often changes so every time I come here there's always something new to try. Never disappointed. Recently chef had fried soft shell crab with was done to perfection.Service is also great. I try to get here right around the time they open so that I can get the garden seat.The cocktail selection is not extensive but I tried most and they are all pretty good. Lets not forget the bacon glazed donuts. Need I say more? I always take some home for my daughter.Can't wait to go back soon.,5.0
"arranged a dinner for a fairly large party of six here after having heard many rave reviews from friends and yelpers alike. Probably one of the most disappointing dining experiences to date.Let's begin with the dishes: Soft shell crabs - this was my first time eating a whole crab so I cant quite render my expertise. nevertheless, perfect breading, flesh was juicy. Spicy mayo was just, spicy mayo, what else is new? This was probably my favorite dish yet. Toast with truffle, greens, topped with a whole egg - well, it was the first time I had truffle in its whole mushroom form! But you really can't mess up a simple combination of cheese, egg, and mushroom. average.Scallop with risotto - Good, but can you find this in other Italian restaurants? yes. I can't even remember the rest.. perhaps reflecting how unmemorable the dishes were. I was not impressed. And AVOID the restaurant as a first-date choice unless you can score a table in the patio area. Because the kitchen is integrated with the dining area, it was stuffy, hot, incredibly noisy (I was straining to hear my friend sitting merely too seats away from me). All in all, stressful. Did I also mention that we waited 35 minutes to be seated even though I had reserved a table??Will not return.",2.0
About 1 year after I wrote this review we flew into Newark Airport for a long layover and even though we were staying by the airport we got an Uber to take us all the way to Traif and back. It did not disappoint.,5.0
"This was the easiest five star review I've ever given. I've never been so wholly blown away by a restaurant. I simply can't say enough good things about it. But I'll try...Oh I almost forgot, there was something really annoying about this place - I tried so hard for a few days to make reservations and their answering machine did not pick up. It just rang and rang and then some automated thing about calling back another time. It was frustrating because I wasn't about to give up this experience. Finally, on the third day I was able to leave a message and someone called me back in the hour and easily fit me in the next night. PHEW!!! close call. Okay, back to the rave...We arrived about thirty minutes ahead of our reservation (still trying to figure out the MTA) and expected to wait. Instead, we were seated instantly. The place is small and dim and packed and so perfectly warm. Even though it was close quarters I didn't feel uncomfortable. Rather, I felt friendly and welcome. Like I was dining in my best friend's house. The staff was a well orchestrated dance. We never once felt we needed anything. Everyone was in a lovely rhythm of filling the water glasses and clearing the plates. Everything was exceptionally timed. I was just so impressed.Drink options abounded and it was hard to make a decision but I did enjoy the run little piggy. It had a bacon salt rim that was so unique and fun. Loved it. We started with a pear salad. It was freshest of fresh pear, mixed greens, almonds, dried cranberries, parmesan tossed in a vinaigrette. My mother has already duplicated this recipe twice. A truly lovely dish. After that the broccoli rabe over texas toast with a fried egg. We saw the people at the table next to us enjoying this and knew it was for us. Dynamic dish and a brilliant use of ingredients. One can not eat enough broccoli rabe. Probably my favorite part of this meal (aside from everything else) was the salt and pepper shrimp. It was tossed in a sriracha sauce with pineapple and sweet potato chunks. Easily one of the most memorable dishes of my life. So inspired in its simplicity. The shrimp was fried but almost in a tempura way. It wasn't heavy or greasy but just a lovely crisp. Each bite with pineapple cooled the sriracha in a gorgeous way. Just do this. Still delicious but a little less memorable we had the duck confit nestled in a bed of barley and pig cheeks (my favorite pig part). At the end of the meal we loosened our waist bands and allowed ourselves one final indulgence (of the day). The bacon, dulce de leche donuts with the coffee ice cream was dessert bliss. They were very fluffy and yeasty and almost like little bits of sugar air. I just fell in love over and over with every bite. If all of that isn't enough to have you running to Brooklyn's Traif, may I also say that the music was some of the best I've heard in a restaurant. It was a great balance of hits and things you've never heard of. I seat danced the entire time. Traif is perfect. I don't know if you know or not... but seriously, perfect. Go now.",5.0
"Oh God dayummmm, Traif! YOU BLEW ME AWAY!My friend & fellow yelper James S. recommended me that I should come here so I did... Boy, that was a piece of advice that I will love forever!!!Truffle toast: soft yet crunchy... tasty & delicious. Complimented so well with the savory taste of the omelet.Chicken & biscuits: chicken was perfectly crisped yet juicy & tender on the inside. The biscuit wasn't too dry either. & to be paired up wth apples & a sweet gravy? Unique & delish!!!Baked pear pancake: the fluffiest, softest pancake i have EVER eaten. The outside had a slight crunchy texture... It's one of the best pancakes I've had in my life. & the taste of baked pears at the bottom of the pancake. mmm mm good!Bacon donuts: WOWSA! Small bite-size glazed donuts topped with bacon bits?? I hear the angels singing! & the warm softness of the donuts to be complimented with coffee ice cream? Now that's a kick your mouth will love!Staff is great with recommendations.Great place to lounge with friends on a lazy Sunday afternoon.Traif is definitely a hidden gem. You gotta try it to believe it.",5.0

"I discovered Traif about 2 months ago and it is a complete shame that it took me so long to write a review! I came across this place here on Yelp while looking for new spots in WBurg.

We wouldn't have ordered cous cous if it wasn't a compliment from the chef (thank you Jason and i will definitely be back!) bakon donuts are really good, but i'm not into the whole doughnut thing in general, so i wasn't blown away. They were great though, so don't get me wrong! One little thing that we weren't too fond of were the drinks. The bar definitely needs a tweak. Compared to the delicious food, beverages fall short. Overall a great experience and i will definitely be back for more!",5.0
"Amazing bacon doughnuts. I actually didn't think I would like it because it's a strange combination but it was so good. I can't stop thinking bout them and am going back next week to have it again.

"I would like to preface this review by saying I am only writing this in regards to Traif's private events. My fiance and I love eating at Traif and frequently bring out of town visitors there since it's one of our favorite restaurants in Brooklyn.

It took months of emails and phone calls for anyone to even respond to me. And ever since then it's been like pulling teeth to communicate with the ""events coordinator."" I have been really disappointed and blown away by their lack of professionalism. I have sent multiple emails pointing out their lack of response & detail and a few times I have gotten a phone call from them as as result, promising to email me detailed information such as pricing. And each phone call has never been followed up with the information that I have been promised. It's like I'm begging them to take $11k+ from me.

"I'll start this review with a TL;DR for anyone who wants it: Traif would have gotten four or even five stars if not for the service. I was there this past Saturday with a group of thirteen people. Our reservation was for 6:30pm, which we made for the most part (there were a few stragglers who showed up about five minutes later). When I arrived, I found out one of my friends could not make it, and so 13 became 12. I informed the waitress and she removed a seat. She then pointed out to me that we might want to get the food started even though there were two more people coming, as there was a two-hour limit to our stay. I obliged, the two other arrived, and the food started coming.We did a tasting menu, which consisted of portions of a bunch of their dishes for everyone to share. Going into the meal, I informed Traif that we would have someone with Celiac Disease, and another with a peanut allergy. They noted both, and said there would be no nuts in any of the courses, and that the other would get a separate gluten-free meal.And here's where the service issues begin. We get to plate four or so of the tasting, and the pork loin comes out with nuts on it. Now mind you, the person in question doesn't have a strong allergy, but it is still an allergy. So she removed the nuts and all was well. When the meal began, the waitress specifically told us there would be no nuts on ANYTHING.Then, once our meal was complete, we immediately received a ""I hope you had a good time, but we have another party coming in and need the tables."" I let her know we'd be ready once all the money was counted up, and the waitress walked away.Less than five minutes later, she returned and once again asked us if we were almost ready. I'll remind you that this was a party of twelve, so of course it would take a little while to count up the money. We once again told her we'd be done very soon; this was at about 8:32. The waitress came back at least two more times before we left at 8:38. Now I understand the need to clear tables for another party, but in the future Traif may want to stagger their reservations a bit to avoid rushing the previous party out the door when they're simply looking to settle the check. Maybe you shouldn't book another big party until a half hour after the previous one? We also waited a decent amount of time for the dessert, so if they were so keen on getting us out of there,shouldn't they have stepped that up a bit and began prepping dessert ahead of time so we would meet the 8:30 deadline?The other thing was that they charged us for the thirteenth person. I get the need to do that since it was a late cancellation, but this was not brought up by our server as a reminder at all as a lead-up to the meal or after the check was presented. Further communication would be appreciated; just because policy is made clear when a reservation is made doesn't mean you should not remind anyone of this at check time, especially when a party is left scrambling to figure out who will be paying the missing person's tab.Finally, a word on addressing the members of a party. Each and every time the server said anything, they said it to me and only me. Yes, it was my birthday (technically a joint-birthday affair with another friend of mine) and I made the reservation, but there were eleven other people there! Talk to them a bit, too! And when they were trying to get us out of there, on more than one occasion they stood and leaned over a friend of mine to talk to me. I can hear you just fine without moving into the space of another person in my party, you know.So yes, the food was as terrific as I hoped it would be. But the service left a lot to be desired. I'll have to come back with a smaller group at some point to compare my experience, but I certainly will not be dining at Traif with a large party again.",3.0

"My girlfriend's friends wanted to meet for dinner and this is place they chose.  There were 6 of us and at least 3 of us eat big.  This is a ""small plate"" restaurant and everything is to share.  The food is decent, but the cost is substantial.  We ordered most of the menu as the waiter told us that we should order 3-4 items per person to satisfy our hunger.  He was right in that we needed to order at least 3 items... with the final bill of $420, two of us walked away hungry.Their strawberry cinnamon ribs are quite good and the meat falls off the bone.  I loved the chirozo in melted munster cheese.  Here's where it gets interesting... we ordered twice: the first main order and then a second one of a couple of our favorites.  One of them was the salt and pepper shrimp.  It's a delightful dish of salt and pepper crusted shrimp over a red sauce.  The first order of it (ordered around 7pm) was awesome, it was easily the best dish we ordered.  The second order of it (ordered around 8pm) was overly salty, so much so that it sucked the saliva from your mouth.  There was little continuity of taste with the dish the second time around.Dessert was also underwhelming.  I don't eat doughnuts but my girlfriend was unimpressed with the bacon doughnuts.  There's little balls of fried dough with bacon bits on top served with coffee ice cream.  The ice cream was good, the bacon bits tasted like bacos... I didn't eat the doughnut as I don't do well with wheat based products.From a place with this type of price tag, I expect their to be the same taste every time I bite into a dish.  If this place were closer to me, I'd give it a second chance for a snack.  With the drive there, street parking and price tag I probably won't return unless dragged.",2.0
"Traif is surprisingly affordable for how great it is. And it is in Brooklyn people! You fall in love with the place almost instantly with very laid back non-pretentious atmosphere, attentive but very down to earth servers and creative yet appealing to the most unsophisticated patrons. The place is has a cool vibe to it, the dishes on the menu are small and are meant for sharing. Almost everything here is inviting you to relax and enjoy your food in a friendly atmosphere. Their menu is changing all the time and trying a chefs menu is a good idea. Where else you have top notch creative selection for $40?! Some things we enjoyed were:-bacon wrapped blue cheese and dates (my favourite dish)-bacon doughnuts-chicken livers on a toast-scallops and risotto (I thought risotto was sub par)The desert selection was excellent too. You have your more simple choices like baby back ribs, wings and sliders and fries which I personally find don't belong to the menu. Traif I love you and will be back for Chef's selection next time.",5.0
"I came here for my birthday dinner and let me say IT WAS DELICIOUS. Funny story, we told the waiter multiple times it was my birthday, and unfortunately no free dessert :(, and when the dessert came out there were two plates... the pie and a single candle melted onto the plate. It was pretty hilarious!It's tapas style/small plates and the waiter did a great job of recommending dishes and helping us navigate the menu. They bring you what looks like a shot of bacon broth as an appetizer of sorts and DAMN was it tasty! (And SO decadent. A good foreshadowing for the meal ahead of us.) This is a good place for 2-4 people, maybe even 6...? I wouldn't come here with a large party, just because it's probably next to impossible to get seating. I feel like 4 would be the PERFECT number. We were the first ones in the restaruant (as we were trying to make a show), but the place filled up fast! If it gets as crowded as it does at 6pm, then I'm sure there's a bit of a wait later on at night.Although you're eating small dishes, you end up leaving stuffed. DO NOT underestimate how full you'll be. I recommend ordering a couple of dishes here and there and holding off until after you've gone through them. You can always order more dishes!  My favorite dish was the Fried Green Tomatos, mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it! My southern roots looooooved it.  My stomach is rumbling as I write this review. I cannot wait until I come back!",5.0

"My girlfriend's friends wanted to meet for dinner and this is place they chose.  There were 6 of us and at least 3 of us eat big.  This is a ""small plate"" restaurant and everything is to share.  The food is decent, but the cost is substantial.  We ordered most of the menu as the waiter told us that we should order 3-4 items per person to satisfy our hunger.  He was right in that we needed to order at least 3 items... with the final bill of $420, two of us walked away hungry.Their strawberry cinnamon ribs are quite good and the meat falls off the bone.  I loved the chirozo in melted munster cheese.  Here's where it gets interesting... we ordered twice: the first main order and then a second one of a couple of our favorites.  One of them was the salt and pepper shrimp.  It's a delightful dish of salt and pepper crusted shrimp over a red sauce.  The first order of it (ordered around 7pm) was awesome, it was easily the best dish we ordered.  The second order of it (ordered around 8pm) was overly salty, so much so that it sucked the saliva from your mouth.  There was little continuity of taste with the dish the second time around.Dessert was also underwhelming.  I don't eat doughnuts but my girlfriend was unimpressed with the bacon doughnuts.  There's little balls of fried dough with bacon bits on top served with coffee ice cream.  The ice cream was good, the bacon bits tasted like bacos... I didn't eat the doughnut as I don't do well with wheat based products.From a place with this type of price tag, I expect their to be the same taste every time I bite into a dish.  If this place were closer to me, I'd give it a second chance for a snack.  With the drive there, street parking and price tag I probably won't return unless dragged.",2.0
"Traif is surprisingly affordable for how great it is. And it is in Brooklyn people! You fall in love with the place almost instantly with very laid back non-pretentious atmosphere, attentive but very down to earth servers and creative yet appealing to the most unsophisticated patrons. The place is has a cool vibe to it, the dishes on the menu are small and are meant for sharing. Almost everything here is inviting you to relax and enjoy your food in a friendly atmosphere. Their menu is changing all the time and trying a chefs menu is a good idea. Where else you have top notch creative selection for $40?! Some things we enjoyed were:-bacon wrapped blue cheese and dates (my favourite dish)-bacon doughnuts-chicken livers on a toast-scallops and risotto (I thought risotto was sub par)The desert selection was excellent too. You have your more simple choices like baby back ribs, wings and sliders and fries which I personally find don't belong to the menu. Traif I love you and will be back for Chef's selection next time.",5.0
"I came here for my birthday dinner and let me say IT WAS DELICIOUS. Funny story, we told the waiter multiple times it was my birthday, and unfortunately no free dessert :(, and when the dessert came out there were two plates... the pie and a single candle melted onto the plate. It was pretty hilarious!It's tapas style/small plates and the waiter did a great job of recommending dishes and helping us navigate the menu. They bring you what looks like a shot of bacon broth as an appetizer of sorts and DAMN was it tasty! (And SO decadent. A good foreshadowing for the meal ahead of us.) This is a good place for 2-4 people, maybe even 6...? I wouldn't come here with a large party, just because it's probably next to impossible to get seating. I feel like 4 would be the PERFECT number. We were the first ones in the restaruant (as we were trying to make a show), but the place filled up fast! If it gets as crowded as it does at 6pm, then I'm sure there's a bit of a wait later on at night.Although you're eating small dishes, you end up leaving stuffed. DO NOT underestimate how full you'll be. I recommend ordering a couple of dishes here and there and holding off until after you've gone through them. You can always order more dishes!  My favorite dish was the Fried Green Tomatos, mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it! My southern roots looooooved it.  My stomach is rumbling as I write this review. I cannot wait until I come back!",5.0
"When Jason Marcus and Heather Heuser opened Traif right on the border of Hasidic Brooklyn and hipster center Williamsburg the name generated plenty of buzz among food critics and bloggers alike. It was one of the few restaurant openings outside of Manhattan that was met with much anticipation.  But even with its cheeky logo of a cute little piggy, Traif wasn't just hype. Working within a small open kitchen, Marcus dishes out plates made for collective foodgasms.If you're a group of 4 or more the Chef's tasting menu is highly recommended. On a recent visit, this feast started off with a seasonal salad and quickly followed by a spicy tuna tartare on a bed of eggplant tempura. The contrast in texture accentuated the flavors of an otherwise classic starter. Some of Traif's signature dishes followed. The seared foie gras with fingerling potatoes, the scallops with apples, and the honey BBQ ribs. Thankfully they adjust the portions according to your party so you won't need to fight over the food. There's also a sweet and sour shrimp with potatoes and pineapple and an equally Asian inspired dish of mussels. The broth is sweet and tangy and contrasted with rice cakes. Marcus' palate is obviously influenced by Asian flavors and it is this that makes the menu more surprising and interesting. Of course, his pasta and pulled pork sandwiches are also excellent. Before you know it you're done with your second bottle of wine. For dessert the tasting menu included a seasonal key lime pie and their famous bacon doughnuts. Chewy bite sized doughnuts coated in caramel and topped with crispy bacon. Delightful! Their cocktail menu is also equally inspired but when the food takes center stage most would prefer a wonderful bottle of wine that would complement the feast.",5.0
"I was really excited to try Traif after all the great reviews. I rarely go to tapas styled restaurants or places whose menu frequently changes so I was a little out of my element. First of all the service and ambiance was near perfect, a fantastic place to bring a date. I enjoyed the open kitchen right by the diners where you can see exactly what's going on. Most of the small plates are around $8-10, and the few larger (non tapas) plates are $14-18. I think sharing 4-5 small plates or sharing 2 plates and getting a large plate is a good way to go (basically figure $40-50pp). The place isn't the cheapest but you get what you pay for here. Oh and don't forget dessert, share a couple plates of that as well to end a great meal. I'll definitely be back to try some of the many dishes I didn't have a chance to try. The dishes I had this past visit were: Salt & Pepper Spicy White Shrimp, Golden Pineapple, Sweet Potatoes: This also came with green beans. The green beans were slightly over cooked but ultimately this was one of my favorite dishes because the shrimp was amazing. The shrimp were fried but the tissue thin crispy exterior was so delicate that I didn't feel like it could really be considered ""fried"", beyond the exterior the shrimp was cooked perfectly, the best I've ever had.BBQ and Pomagrante Glazed Baby Back Pork Ribs: These were also delicious and cooked quite well, they came with 5 ribs which was weird because it's meant to share and it was messy to eat with all the sweet glaze but Traif provides you with a small bowl of warm water to rinse you hands after you're done. They weren't the biggest or best ribs I've ever had and a little more smokiness would have been nice but overall it was still a great dish. BBQ Braised Short Rib Sliders, Sweet Potato Fries, Smoked Paprika Aioli: These were heavanly, really something I took as long as possible to eat so I could savor them. The uber tender shredded short rib meat with a subtle buttery bbq sauce went perfectly with the potato roll. The sweet potato fries were also amazing. Baked Muenster Cheese, Smoked Chorizo, Golden Apples, Crostini: This was sort of a dissapointment. It wasn't quite a meal type dish nor was it a proper fondue. The ramekin of cheese had a lot of butter in it, really overpowering the taste and the little pieces of smoked chorizo buried at the bottom of the cheese weren't strong enough to power through the buttery cheese. There also wasn't enough crostini to deal with the amount of cheese given. I'd pass on this dish in future visits.Bacon Donuts with dulce del leche and coffee ice cream: You get 4 dumpling sized pillows of ultra soft dough drizzled with a sweet dulce del leche sauce and little bacon bits served along side a very flavorful small scoop of coffee ice cream. I thought this was a good dessert but wasn't blown away as much as a lot of other reviews have been. It also would have been good to have less sauce on the plate and a little cup of it to dip into instead. Nutella mousse with pears and chocolate bark: This was basically a mousse dessert with a few little pieces of pears at the bottom of the cup and a couple small pieces of chocolate bark resting on top. I thought the taste was great but the texture was off. I like a firmer mousse and this was a little too soupy for my liking.",4.0
"My friend and I went for dinner, ordered 5 plates, all of which were delicious and filling! The bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates were heavenly! The pork belly was 2nd favorite(cooked perfectly) followed by short rib sliders, ricotta and of course the bacon doughnuts. The coffee ice cream was possibly the best I've ever had, that coming from a serious coffee advocate. Unlike other tapas type restaurants, TRAIF seemed to put thought into the order they brought the food out, they also brought them out with perfect timing to one another instead of bombarding the table with plates. Only complaint would be after tasting 3 different types of white wine, all tasted similar and watered down.",4.0
"I went here last fall for a birthday party with some friends. I had heard good things so I was very excited to get a reservation last minute! The staff was nice but I think they are under a lot of pressure. I got the impression that the dishes are really complicated and the timing is tricky, so it's really hard for them to coordinate the orders with the kitchen... Just remember that when you order! Every dish was super interesting, with a surprise element- and super tasty! We enjoyed the buffalo milk cheese dish and the pork ribs in particular. Fun and cozy atmosphere, good if you want to treat yourself and aren't afraid to spend some money on a fancy night! If you want a more laid back experience with full portions of food you might want to hit a different spot.",3.0

I have to say that though we liked the food and our server... the place was really HOT,  like sweating HOT! They didn't turn on the AC, and since it's a small open kitchen it gets really warm. We were seated in the back of the restaurant where the ceiling and wall are windows (think greenhouse), it was all enclosed so nothing could get in... and thank god because there was an ""unpleasant critter"" munching on some plants or berries right above us!

"I can't even remember everything I had on our 1928874783 course tasting for only $40!!! Ridonks. FYI you need a minimum of 4 people to do the tasting menu. The resto is not that big and their kitchen is open and connected to the bar. Super quaint and cozy. Trying to jog my delicious food and bacon cocktail drunk memory:1. They started us with a curry soup on the house. It was a bit thick for me and I rather save my tummy for the more delicious parts of the meal. 2. A salad of some sorts that I honestly can't remember. 3. BBQ sliders on the softest bun ever. The pork was sweet and tangy and the fries were crispy. 4. Fried quail and biscuits. This one was a take on fried chicken. It was a bit salty for me and the biscuit was too small and soggy for me. The skin and batter on the quail was very good minus the salty part.  5. Pork belly was omg a heavenly bite. A good balance of sauces and combo of juicy fat and flavorful meat. 6. Scallops were seared perfectly. Done. 7. Spicy big eye tuna had large chunks of tuna not the mushy kind you normally find that I become very suspicious of. 8. Warm Munster cheese with bits of chorizo and apples. This was a cute finger food dish. Although if you waited too long the cheese hardens and it's not as appetizing, so eat it fast!!9. Bacon ice cream and donuts. So. Good. Seriously I can't say anything else about this. 10. There was more but I can't remember :( I guess this means I have to go back again :)Portions weren't too large or small. You will definitely be full after the 10+ courses but you won't be too full to the point where you need to unbutton your pants....seriously though - skip restaurant week and spend your $40 on a personal and wide variety meal that will delight your taste buds at Traif.",5.0
"I was going to talk about their silly policy of having people wait out in the cold (even if it is an enclosed area) until the entire party is seated. I was going to talk about the hostess/greeter talking shop to a trainee while I was in earshot (did you know a party of 2 is allotted 1.5 hours at a table?). However...All of that is water under the bridge because the moment we were seated, everything moved so smoothly, from drink service to food service, I forgot about that whole silliness. The food was so damn delicious! I started out with bacon soup (on the house). It was so savory, I couldn't wait to get my hot little hands on my food order.We had glazed chicken sriracha wings (tasty, but not special; bonus points for no breading); strawberry- cinnamon glazed ribs(delicious! Fell off the bone into my mouth); salt & pepper shrimp (juicy, buttery and crispy at the same time); pork BBQ  rib sliders (Amazing! It literally melts in your mouth); and, muenster cheese with chorizo sausage (I don't eat cheese or bread, but this was too delicious to not at least taste. Which I did. A few times.)You would think with all that food they'd have to roll people out the door, but no! The portions are sized just right so you're satisfied without feeling like a pig. If you're the type who believes that a bigger portion is a better meal, I still say give this place a try! The prices are reasonable enough that for less than 100, you and a friend can have a feast. We had already made our minds up after the disappointing drink selection (it was all tailored to complement the meats) that we would eschew dessert and head to another place for drinks. But, she offered us the menu and, curious, we found ourselves ordering the bacon donuts (don't be grossed out - you can barely taste the bacon it's so mild. And actually, unexpectedly delicious!) and the custard dish (the name escapes me right now, but the combination of whipped cream, custard, chocolate, caramel and sorbet was pretty awesome). I must say, I didn't pay much attention to the ambience because I was there to eat, but  the place is cozy with dim but readable lighting and I did notice when they brought out a high-chair for a party with a baby. (Personally, I don't think this place is ideal to bring a baby, but for the most part the kid was quiet, so what do I know? I only mention it in case you absolutely have to get out of the house and can't get a sitter).I will warn you - make reservations. Especially on weekends They are gracious with you being a little late, but anything unexpected and they may turn you away. It's to help the chef - the hostess was talking about it.Will I go back again? That would be a hell to the yeah. As a side note , we were there 1.25 hours.",5.0
"I agree with Matteo, I also thought  five dishes was way too much food for two people.  Dishes do vary on portion so order as you go and make sure you have plenty of water next to you because your taste buds will almost undoubtedly be attacked by salt. I made a reservation at Traif for my pork-loving boyfriend's birthday.  After the glowing reviews from a lot of my pals, I thought yes, I must take my man here to celebrate!  I asked the girl on the phone if they do anything special for birthdays and she said they do put a candle in the dessert if I want and I said that would be great, do I tell the waitress when I arrive or can you note that in the reservation?  She said, no problem, I will note that in the reservation and that would be taken care of.  Great.  That was easy enough!We arrived for our 9:30 reservation about five minutes early and were told our table was almost ready but they were having dessert and would be done soon.  We waited outside with several other people and then when the hostess finally came to get us, it was nearly 10pm. So much for a reservation.  By this time, the restaurant was starting to get less crowded.  I have to say, service was extremely slow and my water glass was constantly left empty as the bus boy would swoosh by our table filling everyone else's glasses but ours.  We did go with five plates but that ended up being more food than was necessary.  We got pig tails, risotto that was supposed to have pork in it, scallops, shrimp with watermelon and pineapple and then some type of pasta with ragu which actually was almost inedible.  It was really more of a macaroni and cheese.  It was a long process dining here. It took a long time, longer than I had anticipated.  I was afraid we'd miss our next reservation which was at 1230 and we actually were late for that, but I couldn't leave without getting dessert with a candle in it for my boyfriend's birthday as I requested.For dessert, we opted for the Key Lime pie, which took an unusually long time to get to us, but that's cool because they were probably looking for candles or something...WRONG.  We did get the pie, sans birthday candle.  Wow, my request was not honored.  This was disappointing but you know what? I had no time to pout, we asked for the check to be brought out with the dessert and tried to get out of there as fast as possible. It was just an okay experience and the food was really just average in my opinion.  In fact  I would recommend going with the seafood selections over any of their pork selections as they seemed to be the winners in our array of plates.  Won't be back.",2.0

"I agree with Matteo, I also thought  five dishes was way too much food for two people.  Dishes do vary on portion so order as you go and make sure you have plenty of water next to you because your taste buds will almost undoubtedly be attacked by salt. I made a reservation at Traif for my pork-loving boyfriend's birthday.  After the glowing reviews from a lot of my pals, I thought yes, I must take my man here to celebrate!  I asked the girl on the phone if they do anything special for birthdays and she said they do put a candle in the dessert if I want and I said that would be great, do I tell the waitress when I arrive or can you note that in the reservation?  She said, no problem, I will note that in the reservation and that would be taken care of.  Great.  That was easy enough!We arrived for our 9:30 reservation about five minutes early and were told our table was almost ready but they were having dessert and would be done soon.  We waited outside with several other people and then when the hostess finally came to get us, it was nearly 10pm. So much for a reservation.  By this time, the restaurant was starting to get less crowded.  I have to say, service was extremely slow and my water glass was constantly left empty as the bus boy would swoosh by our table filling everyone else's glasses but ours.  We did go with five plates but that ended up being more food than was necessary.  We got pig tails, risotto that was supposed to have pork in it, scallops, shrimp with watermelon and pineapple and then some type of pasta with ragu which actually was almost inedible.  It was really more of a macaroni and cheese.  It was a long process dining here. It took a long time, longer than I had anticipated.  I was afraid we'd miss our next reservation which was at 1230 and we actually were late for that, but I couldn't leave without getting dessert with a candle in it for my boyfriend's birthday as I requested.For dessert, we opted for the Key Lime pie, which took an unusually long time to get to us, but that's cool because they were probably looking for candles or something...WRONG.  We did get the pie, sans birthday candle.  Wow, my request was not honored.  This was disappointing but you know what? I had no time to pout, we asked for the check to be brought out with the dessert and tried to get out of there as fast as possible. It was just an okay experience and the food was really just average in my opinion.  In fact  I would recommend going with the seafood selections over any of their pork selections as they seemed to be the winners in our array of plates.  Won't be back.",2.0
"Wow, one of the best meals I've ever had!!Loved the complementary sweet potato soup. If they served it in a bowl and charged $10 for it, I wouldn't complain! We ordered the big eye tuna on top of eggplant tempura, strawberry glazed short ribs, guinea hen on top of radicchio, seared scallops, broccoli rabe with truffled toast, and the pork belly. The only dish that didn't knock our socks off was the hen but everything else was amazing, especially the scallops, broccoli rabe, and tuna.I'm not a huge fan of bacon but the bacon doughnuts were my absolute favorite dish of the night. Perfect little poofs of fried dough (kidney shaped according to my bf) sitting on dulce de leche, sprinkled with crunchy bacon bits on top, with a side of the strongest coffee ice cream I've ever had. I almost ordered another round of these!I'm usually very hesitant to go to restaurants that serve 'small plates' because that usually means we'll have to spend a lot of money to get full. Not the case at Traif! The portions were much larger than anticipated so 6 dishes + 1 dessert was the perfect amount for 2 people.Ambiance was lovely, especially in the enclosed garden area in the back. The wait staff was informative about the dishes and plates were cleared from our table efficiently. I can't find any negatives about my meal here! I will be back!",5.0

Yes! Yes! Yes! This place is pretty incredible. I came for dinner with my fiancé after looking at the food pics posted here on yelp. We pretty much ordered every tasty thing we had seen pictures of and this place did NOT disappoint. Ambiance - a little too dark for me. There is a quaint looking area in the back that is probably a great day spot.Service - wonderful. Attentive staff and great spacing out for delivery of the family/share style menu items.Drinks - creative and well made. I had (in less appetizing phrasing) a smokey orange margarita with a bacon/salt rim. Good stuff.Food - Great!

"The food is just dang good, the portions are smaller than what I'm usually accustomed to, but the qualities and attention to details to each item is apparent. The menu does appear a bit overwhelming, as it is very wordy and took a bit longer than usual for me to go through and figure out what I want. The service is great, waiter was very attentive, there was never more than 2 plates on the table, and empty ones are quick to be gone, my glass was never empty of liquid. Be sure to call ahead and reserve though, the place gets really crowded at dinner, and I almost didn't have a place as a walk-in had I not show up as they opened.I personally recommend the BBQ braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries (the sauce is freaking amazing), Strawberry cinnamon short ribs (sweet gracious), and the Sauteed broccoli rabe with portobello mushrooms and fried egg (it was just delicious!).",5.0

I was little disappointed by how small strawberry pieces were, but the ribs were delicious!  Seared foie gras: yum yum yum, I love foie gras and I love this plate! The taste of foie gras got better when mixed with sunny eggs, the rich fragrance of foie gras was amplified with eggs!  Spicy prawns: spicy and sour and sweet shrimps! very tasty, and I wish the dish was bigger.   Braised short rib sliders:  I am not a fan of sliders, but these sliders were so tasty! the meat was juicy and the sauce was just about right.    Escargots: not bad, but not surprising, came with sausages, wish there were more escargots.    Bacon doughnuts: the bacon came in small pieces on top of small doughnuts, very sweet, came with a coffee ice cream as the side.    Service was good and quick.

"I'm afraid Yelpers, we've got this place all wrong.  I called on a Tuesday and asked how long the wait would be for three people; they said they had several tables available.  We walked in no more than ten minutes later and the wait was now an hour.  Strike one.  We have a seat at the bar, and they say a table actually is just on dessert.  Order a drink, don't order food, and we'll get you seated real quick.  Literally an hour goes by, it's now 10 p.m., and there's no apology.  Strike two. We get seated, order food, and are told we've probably only ordered half as much as we should.  Would we like three or four more dishes?  Let's start with these, thanks.  Okay, but if you don't order now, those later dishes will take 30-40 minutes each to make.  Sorry, what?The food comes out and it's just mediocre.  Burrata that's not that special.  Sliders that look sad.  Pork chops with too much mustard.  And everything oversalted.  We were stuffed (didn't need to order twice as much it turns out) and totally underwhelmed.  Strike three.",2.0

"I love that Traif means ""non-kosher"" in Yiddish. Clever.Traif serves up tapas style dishes that are meant to be shared. Each dish is a bit too small to be eaten on it's own but with such a variety of interesting dishes on the menu, why would you want to only eat one dish? We tried:Strawberry Cinnamon Glazed Ribs (The clear winner. My mom loved it so much she ordered another one after we finished the first)Beet Salad (Great. I love beets and it's hard to go wrong with a beet salad)Blackberry Salad (Good vinegrette, refreshing)Bellflower Shaped Pasta (Amazing. The texture of the pasta and the creaminess of the sauce. Worth ordering just for yourself)Braised Pork Belly (My stepdad's favorite dish. Reminds me of Chinese style slow cooked pork. Falls apart when picked up)Fried Quail and Biscuits (A clever play on fried chicken and biscuits. Interesting but on the heavier side. Glad I tried it, wouldn't order it again)Duck Confit (Decent but duck confits are almost as popular as white bread nowadays)Bacon Doughnuts w/ Coffee Ice Cream (Delicious! More like a light beignet with crunchy bacon bits)Panna Cotta (LOVE! Creamy, light, refreshing)Traif is casual dining with delicious flavors, great service and has a variety of dishes to satisfy any picky eater (except maybe the non-pork eating population). Our bill was under $300 after drinks and we were completely stuffed. Traif is perfect for those who like fine dining without the pretentiousness (or prices!).",5.0
"It's one of those cases where I dedicate a 100-review -- in this case, #1,800 -- to a truly spectacular restaurant.

Looks like it was braised, then cooked on the grill (or might be even broiled) and cinnamon/strawberries were added with a sauce. Meat was tender though.

Not what I was expecting for dinner.  It was more of a brunch menu. Probably my fault though. Very little truffle flavor.New Zealand cockles : D  --way too much bacon in the stock, made this dish inedible.

"Let's be honest - I live on the Upper West Side and I traveled on the J train to the Marcy Ave. stop to get to Traif (3 times now) for this amazingness.

"In a word, spectacular.  My friends took me here for my birthday last week and words cannot express how mouth wateringly (is that a word?) delicious everything was.  We went with our very patient waiter's advice and did the tasting menu, which were about  8 entrees and two desserts.  There were 3 of us and it was more than enough to satisfy us.  Everything from presentation to combination of flavors were amazing and spot on.  A  couple of dishes we had were scallops risotto, tuna tartare on tempura and short rib sliders.  There were all extremely flavorful and just flat out phenomenal - best dining experience I've had in a long time.",5.0
"I'm afraid Yelpers, we've got this place all wrong.  I called on a Tuesday and asked how long the wait would be for three people; they said they had several tables available.  We walked in no more than ten minutes later and the wait was now an hour.  Strike one.  We have a seat at the bar, and they say a table actually is just on dessert.  Order a drink, don't order food, and we'll get you seated real quick.  Literally an hour goes by, it's now 10 p.m., and there's no apology.  Strike two. We get seated, order food, and are told we've probably only ordered half as much as we should.  Would we like three or four more dishes?  Let's start with these, thanks.  Okay, but if you don't order now, those later dishes will take 30-40 minutes each to make.  Sorry, what?The food comes out and it's just mediocre.  Burrata that's not that special.  Sliders that look sad.  Pork chops with too much mustard.  And everything oversalted.  We were stuffed (didn't need to order twice as much it turns out) and totally underwhelmed.  Strike three.",2.0
Went here with a bunch of girlfriends and they seated us outside which was so beautifully adorned with these delicate little lights... Anyway two things should command your immediate attention; bacon donuts and strawberry glazed ribs. That is all.,5.0

"I love that Traif means ""non-kosher"" in Yiddish. Clever.Traif serves up tapas style dishes that are meant to be shared. Each dish is a bit too small to be eaten on it's own but with such a variety of interesting dishes on the menu, why would you want to only eat one dish? We tried:Strawberry Cinnamon Glazed Ribs (The clear winner. My mom loved it so much she ordered another one after we finished the first)Beet Salad (Great. I love beets and it's hard to go wrong with a beet salad)Blackberry Salad (Good vinegrette, refreshing)Bellflower Shaped Pasta (Amazing. The texture of the pasta and the creaminess of the sauce. Worth ordering just for yourself)Braised Pork Belly (My stepdad's favorite dish. Reminds me of Chinese style slow cooked pork. Falls apart when picked up)Fried Quail and Biscuits (A clever play on fried chicken and biscuits. Interesting but on the heavier side. Glad I tried it, wouldn't order it again)Duck Confit (Decent but duck confits are almost as popular as white bread nowadays)Bacon Doughnuts w/ Coffee Ice Cream (Delicious! More like a light beignet with crunchy bacon bits)Panna Cotta (LOVE! Creamy, light, refreshing)Traif is casual dining with delicious flavors, great service and has a variety of dishes to satisfy any picky eater (except maybe the non-pork eating population). Our bill was under $300 after drinks and we were completely stuffed. Traif is perfect for those who like fine dining without the pretentiousness (or prices!).",5.0

Third, the service:I am sad i did not get the name of the waitress.  She deserves five stars in my opinion.  We had friends there from Italy and one of them made the evening difficult because the entire table wanted to do the 50 dollar tasting menu and HE did not want to (because he says NO to everything), so the rest of us were not able to do the tasting because it requires all people at the table to do it.  And truthfully, in the end, it would have been cheaper if he just would have gone along with the tasting.  So, for that he was a jerk.  But, even with him being difficult, the waitress kept smiling, told us we were no trouble at all, and even spoke to the ""difficult"" friend in Italian.  Bravo lady.  We tipped her 30% and probably should have done more.  THANK YOU!!!",5.0

Third, the service:I am sad i did not get the name of the waitress.  She deserves five stars in my opinion.  We had friends there from Italy and one of them made the evening difficult because the entire table wanted to do the 50 dollar tasting menu and HE did not want to (because he says NO to everything), so the rest of us were not able to do the tasting because it requires all people at the table to do it.  And truthfully, in the end, it would have been cheaper if he just would have gone along with the tasting.  So, for that he was a jerk.  But, even with him being difficult, the waitress kept smiling, told us we were no trouble at all, and even spoke to the ""difficult"" friend in Italian.  Bravo lady.  We tipped her 30% and probably should have done more.  THANK YOU!!!",5.0
"Nice restaurant and great food. Order the chefs menu, with different kind of dishes. Very tasty. Unfortunately it was very busy, so they pushed the food too quickly. Luckily we had a very friendly waitress, so we had a great night.",4.0
"fun place very busy, wait staff is nevertheless patient with explaining the tasting menu. they are very cheerful and accommodating. having the tasting menu was fun, waiting to see which culinary surprise showed up. several dishes were really spot -on.  the flavors were interesting and complex and deep. the aioli was delicious with the sweet potato fires. we tried to reproduce the aioli at home ( couldn't get it right no surprise)  the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious and my favorite  ( and I dont normally eat pork belly). Loved the tuna tartare , and the eggplant was delicious and  subtle.even the dishes I didn't love (the sliders and the spaetzle)  were still tasty. the oddest thing was the bacon doughnuts which I thought would be greasy and heavy and weren't. I'm looking for another opportunity to return soon!",5.0
"Ahhhhh...nom nom nom. I've had several meals here in the span of a few months and I really think I can say, this is one of my fave restaurants. Tapas style is really the way to go, giving you the opportunity to try as much of their varied menu as possible.They change the menu seasonally, so I do try to come whenever I can. The staff here is approachable (not snooty at all). And if you have 3+ people, definitely go the way of the chef's tasting menu. It's by far the only way you can try a wide range of dishes and get the most bang for your buck.Every time I have a friend in town...or simply a friend who hasn't been here yet, I love to take them here. Hasn't disappointed yet!",5.0

"All I have to say is wow. Went here randomly expecting the usual tapas. Boy was I wrong. Ordered 8 tapas and I would scale all a 10 out of 10. If you even slightly like pork, you will fall in love with this.

This place is ridiculously good. Just walk in and let your taste-buds be intoxified with flavors you never thought where possible. The sampler menu is a great way to start but you just have to try the whole menu. There is intense thought behind every dish and you just have to prepare yourself for the journey!!!!,5.0
"I came here a couple nights ago for a birthday party and had the best time! We did the chefs selection for a group of four for my friends birthday and our server Stephanie was beyond helpful. She recommended the best cocktails and wine to go with everything we got. We loved the strawberry short ribs and bacons doughnuts, and we left beyond pleased! A great restaurant for a fun party or just a casual date! Everything was great and our service experience was so much better because Stephanie was so accommodating and helpful!",5.0
"This is a cute and quaint side of Brooklyn. I came here from California and my cousin had her birthday dinner here in New York. I was very impressed by ALL of their dishes. We ordered lots of dishes for the entire table to share. A few I remember off the top of my head are the pork rib sliders, the scallops, chicken wings, duck liver, and bacon doughnuts. The waitress was very friendly, which was refreshing since customer service doesn't seem to be of importance in some areas of New York. I would highly recommend Traif to anyone.Keep up the good work.",4.0
Food is incredible. The tuna tar tar was my favorite. Cocktails are also really great. Highly recommend.,5.0
"So this place here was getting 5 stars regardless , just due to the fact that they have the best customer service EVER!  but anywho lets get down to the menu. my group ordered this to share: Strawberry cinnamon glazed baby back ribs (not amazing but they were decent) Sliders ribs with sweet potato fries (tasted great!)salt and pepper shrimp with sweet potatoes (LOVED IT)For Desert, we loved the custard with strawberry n tangerine  and bacon donuts.. We werent really a fan of this bacon sundae thingy they had though. And i didnt really like the cofee icecream.Nevertheless it was a great experience . I'll be back *terminator voice*",5.0
"Everything here is AMAZING - well, perhaps except the sweetbreads.  The sweetbreads were executed perfectly, but I wasn't a huge fan of the asparagus and green garlic sauce.But sweetbreads aside, I had a hard time pausing to breathe in between bites of perfectly seared scallops swimming in creamed sweet corn and sage-truffle brown butter, and savouring explosions of flavour with each bite of the bacon-wrapped blue cheese-stuffed dates.One of my favourites was the ""piperade"": a generous serving of pork belly that was both crisp and fork-tender at the same time, but paired nicely with roasted peppers and an egg full of smooth, yolky goodness, fried wholeheartedly in bacon fat.The confit of duck leg also deserves special mention, as it was hands down one of the most tender, perfectly executed renditions I have ever eaten, and just paired magnificently with sweet chunks of Georgia peaches.  The seared foie was also well prepared, but I think it was just too much fatty richness for us as we neared the tail end of our 10-dish feast.But if I were to construct a list of ""don't miss"" dishes, I would have to add the BBQ braised short rib sliders.  How is it humanly possible to make short ribs THAT succulent and THAT tender?  Not to say that the sweet potato fries were not amazing, but I could barely carry on a conversation, let alone stop to have a fry, after taking my first bite of that perfect concoction of braised short rib.Admittedly, 10 dishes (plus 2 desserts) pretty much put four hungry diners over the top, but I personally felt that the penance I will have to pay for this gluttonous feast will be well worth it.  There were still so many other things on the menu that I just wanted to try, but I think I am equally tempted to just come back and nosh down on plate after plate of sliders, and top it off with a plate of bacon donuts, all for myself.",5.0
"It's been roughly a year and a half since I ate here, so excuse any inaccuracies chalked up to misrecollection. What a hip little Williamsburg restaurant, complete with a cutesy visual identity: a small heart inscribed within a pig. I'd expect no less of Brooklyn.Two words: bacon doughnuts. I was skeptical, and then I became a believer. Sweet doughnuts sprinkled with savory bacon flakes. How could something that sounds so wrong taste so, so right? It just does.The pork belly was another menu highlight for me -- just the right amount of fat, and it all but melted in my mouth. Lord. Also a fan of the strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back ribs; Traif's chefs really subscribe to the sweet-savory / opposites-attract cooking paradigm. Why not put all your taste buds to work in one fell swoop?As others have mentioned, the plates are served tapa style, which can rack up quite a bill. I'd recommend three plates per person, but my entire party was comprised of petite Asian girls, so folks with larger appetites might want to scale accordingly.",4.0

You'll order a bunch of things to share, and your waiter will bring out the dishes one by one in order from lightest to heaviest. It's also a nice touch that they always include a palate cleanser to start and to end. My only caveat is that the first time we went to Traif, our waiter told us that we should order 4-6 dishes for two people. We ordered 3, and that was enough for us -- and my husband is a big eater! Maybe it would be different if we ordered a bunch of salads and cheese plates, but just the sliders and fries were pretty hefty!

They recommend how many to get based on your group size, but it's on the small side if you're hungry or dining with more guys.

"Wow, just an incredible experience. Went with two friends for dinner on Saturday. Their is one chef, 2 sous chefs, and a 6 burner kitchen. That is it. Everything they make is art. We had the strawberry cinnamon ribs which were finger licking good and the pork belly with fruits. The pork belly had a little too much fat but still wonderful. We each ordered a dish for our main meal. One friend ordered the soft shells crabs with papaya. I am allergic to crab but it was beautiful and she said it was great. My other friend had the short rib sliders and chicken wings - man the sauce on those wings was good.However, my dish was the best - grilled broccoli rabe with portobello mushrooms, a thick slice of truffle toast, a fried egg, and pungent cheese. This was the BEST egg dish I have ever eaten. We also had the bacon donuts - can I get an order of that right now?Most dishes are 10 - 15 dollars, and you should get a few to share.

Great meal! My friends took me here for my birthday. We had a party of 8 and they said for large parties they would have to do the chefs tasting menu which was $45/person. About 10 dishes or so and they were savory and delicious. They were able to accommodate for the pescatarian of the group. The pacing of the dishes was just right without long pauses. The only issue that I later found out about was that they refused to serve out the small cake that my friends got for me - not terrible but just to let you know. Our server was awesome.

"Trying to kill some time while kid works on a project at friend's house, we wander this too-hip neighborhood. As the project runs over, we start to get hungry. Not knowing much about Williamsburg,  we sit in a coffee shop and start cross-referencing NY Mag and Yelp... consensus is: Traif.  We're just looking for somewhere decent to relax and eat ... but end up BLOWN AWAY! I wasn't prepared for this place! It's just a boring, rainy Sunday evening and I'm now eating one of the best dinners ever!

"This is arguably the best food I have ever eaten anywhere and anytime. Every single component was executed perfectly, they play awesome alternative/pop/rock music and they have a gorgeously curated garden outback. I am so glad I found and tried this place.We were started off with complimentary amuse bouches - strawberry gazapacho. Very refreshing, and quite tasty.bacon-wrapped blue cheese-stuffed dates, spinach a la catalana: I've had versions of this elsewhere (most specifically Kafana - which was utterly terrible, do not get it there) but this was perfect. The plate came with four pieces, and every component went well with the other. I thought the spinach was delicious too.bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries: Two sliders, completely awesome. Super delicious pulled pork between crisp and fluffy buns, with sweet potato fries fried to perfection; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.Deep fried pork belly topped with pineapples, toasted almonds, and crumbled blue cheese and drizzled raspberry sauce: The fat in the pork belly simply melted in my mouth and I liked the different flavors/textures in the dressing.crispy berkshire pigs tails, honey, curry, peanuts: Omg this was like all the best parts of a pig. The crisp of bacon, the fat of pork belly and the meat of... a pig. It was uber crispy, and then coated with a sweet sauce, and right after you get past that the fat coats your palate. And then you get to gnaw the bony tail and try to nibble any remaining sinew you can. What an experience.baked muenster cheese with smoked chorizo and apples: ohhh maan bubbly cheese with chorizon buried in it. It went very well with the apple slices too.ANNNND the bacon donuts with dulce de leche glaze and coffee ice cream: SO good. I really liked how the coffee ice cream gave it a hint of BBQ smoke flavoring.Got a couple of drinks as well: Red Pearl, a-something (can't remember) spiked with mint, chili and I think lime juice, and Rude Little Pig, a tequila-based drink with a smokey taste and a bacon rimmed glass. Both drinks were pretty cool.Total bill came up to $72 before tip: I would definitely come back here again.",5.0
"It was OK. I've been to both Traif and Xixa, Traif's sister restaurant, and personally think that Xixa is MUCH BETTER. 3.8/5.0, I'd say.We ordered: Salt and Pepper Shrimp - too salty, though it was yummy paired with the sweet potato cubesTuna TarTar on Fried Eggplant- bland, nothing specialBbq Ribs Slider- probably the best of all the dishes we've tried. Very delicate flavor and was not overpowering. BUT it only comes with 2 tiny sliders, so each additional slider will cost you $5.Strawberry Ribs- good and different, worth a trySauteed Broccoli Rabe with toast & fried egg: the thought of it was interesting, but the broccoli rabe was overcooked, which is not how I like the dish. Without the egg, the toast would have been very very bland.Dayboat Scallops with Squash Risotto- Good. Though pieces of the rice in the risotto was still very hard... which is not how Risotto should be like! Lamb Tenderloin- the hummus it came with did not pair well with the dish, making the taste very weird... would not recommendBuffalo Styled Frog Legs- not worth it.. the buffalo sauce overpowered the sweetness frog legs are supposed to have. Maybe they should have diced the celery and placed it on top of each leg instead of randomly throwing 2 thin slices  in there.Bacon Doughnuts- don't know what's the big hype about these.. they're not original and the taste is not over the edge. Many other stores have fried doughnuts with the exact taste as this dish, minus the tiny bits of baconPanna Cotta- such a depressing dish. Panna cotta is my favorite dessert and Traif did not meet my standards in this dish.. it wasn't as light as it should be and was not aromatic. Depressing.",4.0

"Seriously, this place deserves 5 stars because the food is delicious. Luckily, my first experience here was at 11 pm on a cold December night and there was plenty of seating. We came back a few months later- sometime in March- and we weren't so lucky. It was going to be a 2 hour wait to we went to Xixa (which is okay but not the same and the food is heavily salted). Back to Traif- different combinations of sweet and salty were in every dish we had. I can't really remember what we had but it was all delish. I think we started with some brussel sprouts, then short ribs, and some salads. We ended the night with the bacon doughnuts. Holy doughnuts! So good! If you haven't tried Traif yet... what are you waiting for? And for the love of food, make reservations so that you don't get a 2 hour wait time estimate.",5.0
"Great Restaurant for foodies looking to enjoy a bunch of small plates. If your going with a larger group it's definitely easier to order the chefs selection at $50 per person  and let them do the work, but I prefer to pick a bunch of stuff off the menu since there's so much variety. The menu changes day to day but some of my favorites are the short rib sliders, Munster cheese dip and pretty much any version of pork belly they're serving.

"Imagine a delicious, well-balanced, beautifully-plated 10 course tasting menu for $40 in New York. Sounds WAY too good to be true right?  Well, my friends, it is real. And it exists at Traif. My party of 4 opted for the chefs tasting option priced at $40/person. Our lovely waitress told us it would come to be about 8-9 shared plates between the four of us. Reasonable enough, except that I found myself stuffed to the brim after plate 5. Then plate 6, 7, 8, 9 came out and I was in way over my head. And THEN two desserts came out and my friend and I both groaned with desire and anguish. No stomach space...but so much food ...and so delicious...#nothingtocomplainaboutOur entire meal only came out to $80-90 a person which is a complete steal considering we each ordered around 3 really nicely balanced cocktails and ate the equivalent of 3 meals in one sitting. Notable dishes of the night were the beet salad, soft shell crabs over biscuits, and corned beef hash over to-die-for polenta. I've also found yet another drink to add to my ""I could drink this all day all night"" list: the Red Pearl . Chili infused vodka + kiwi + citrus. Amazing. There were actually a couple dishes I didn't love - the glazed ribs and rib sliders, which was really unfortunate because I think the only problem was that the chef had just gotten too heavy handed with the sugar on those marinades. Despite a couple bad eggs, the rest of the menu is filled with stellar plates and I'm always dying to come back to try the new dishes on the perpetually changing menu.  Even if you don't live in Williamsburg, Traif is definitely still worth the visit.",5.0
"Traif provided me and my sister with one of the best meals we have had in our lives last night!!!I brought my sister here to celebrate her birthday. I recommend making reservations because this place quickly filled up! We started off with the Rude little Pig cocktail with the rim coated in bacon bits, that's right, bacon!!! It was delicious. The chef here is a genious. Each dish that my sister ate was amazing! The menu has many choices that are meant to be shared. Between two people it is recommended you order 5 dishes, or six if you are very hungry. Each dish on average costs $10 (for more light dishes) to $19 (for more rich dishes). We ordered: Start off with complimentary sweet potatoe soup shooter (YUM)white fish sauteed in a bacon sauce over a bed of flavorful seaweed salad (YUMMY)Big-Eye Tuna over vegetable tempura with delicious sauce (Whoa, so good!)Bork Belly with potatoe puree, string beans, and grapefruit (WOW, it all came together perfectly)Mussels with shrimp, sausage, in a white wine garlic sauce (salivating just thinking about it)Strawberry, pomegranite, cinammon marinated short ribs (Heavenly, fall of the bone deliciousness)For dessert:Nutella Mousse (light, fluffy and mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm good)Caramel Glazed FRESH DONUTS with BACON, Dulce de Leche ice cream on the side (AMAZING dish to end your meal!)Our waitress and other staff were very courteous and answered all questions we had. Our plates were cleaned off the table as soon as we finished each dish and the waitress seemed to really care that we were comfortable and enjoying our gastronomical experience. Bathroom matched the decor of the restaurant and was very clean. My theory is that the condition of the bathroom is a good indication of the condition of the kitchen ;-)I will definitely be back again.

"""This one goes to eleven[1]""This is how I felt after having dinner at Traif.If you like bold, brash, intense, and unapologetic flavors, this is your place. If you appreciate subtlety, balance, and complexity, you may be disappointed. I felt that my taste buds were subjected to an assault of flavors where I couldn't tell what was in the front line and what was behind that. Like a chorus of marvelous singers, where unfortunately you can hear only one voice, the other ones overwhelmed and muted.The ambiance seems a bit unfocused: warm and welcoming, with a compact open kitchen behind the beautiful, long bar. But why the flat-screen TV with ""Iron Chef"" on, looping continuously in silence? The main room, although intimate and cozy, gets noisy. Moreover, the opportunity to see the chef at work from your table (something I always like) also means that your clothes will smell a bit. Come here in the spring/summer and score a table outside. You will enjoy a wonderfully lush, Amazon forest-like patio.Our evening started with cocktails: both the Autumn Cabin[2] and the Red Pearl[3] were excellent. In fact, I liked these cocktails so much that I would consider coming to Traif even just to kick started the night, while sitting at the bar and watching the chef work his magic.The menu of small dishes, while it encourages sampling and sharing, is deceptive: five dishes resulted in way too much food for two people. Order as you go, since some dishes are larger in size than other ones.The lamb and chorizo meatballs, chipotle cream, and manchego ($7), was perhaps the most subtle dish we had. And I am not being ironic. The meat and cheese were nicely balanced, and you could taste both types of meat.The razor clams with chorizo exemplified what I meant at the beginning of this review: the delicate flavor of the clams was completely overpowered by the intensity of the chorizo. What was left of the clams was only their wonderful consistency. Just the idea of a razor clam, its essence gone.The sautéed sweetbreads[4], artichokes, asparagus, and roast maitake mushrooms ($14) was the dish I enjoyed the most. It was also the most simply prepared one. The sweetbreads were wonderfully crisp on the outside, and nice and soft on the inside.I praise chef and co-owner Jason Marcus for pursuing an idea and bringing it to life with enthusiasm.

The plates would be enough for each person.)After contemplating for a bit, we decided to pick our own plates; this was a great decision.We picked 10 plates (in order of how we were served):We were served curry shots to start, which was surprisinly refreshing.1) Dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, lemon-caper brown butter - This was a bit disappointing as this tasted a like scallops I can have anywhere else.2) Berkshire pork belly, rhubarb, grapefruit, blackberries, sugar snaps - The pork belly was pretty good. Yet, I did not feel the berries worked with the meat.3) Spicy, bigeye tuna, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis - I love eggplant, yet I felt the combination was on par to the other items we ordered.4) Sauteed broccoli rabe, roasted portobella-truffle toast, fried egg - This was surprisingly good, all this works well together5) Bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli - This was one of the best items we ordered. So good, salivating thinking about it right now6) We had a pasta dish served with crab meat. It's a must if you are to come to this restaurant.  7) baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini - This was just okay. Definitely can skip this9) Moulard duck confit, english peas, honshimeji mushrooms, green garlic - This was delicious as the meat was very tender9) Glazed-confit chicken wings, hoisin, five spice, sriracha - This tasted adequate. Nothing you can't get anywhere else. 10) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs - I felt the sweetness did not mix well with the ribsWe ended with the bacon doughnuts, which took half an hour or to be served as the food inspector randomly dropped by at 10pm. The waitress apologized and served us each a complimentary glass of champagne. My friends liked it, yet I thought it was pretty alright. Although, I enjoyed dinner; I was not entirely impressed.

"I don't really care for pork.  Its kinda something people know about me.  People go, do you eat pork, and I go, no...but I eat bacon at IHOP.  It confuses them, but really, have you ever had bacon?  When done right, its great.I had missed the Yelp event where they were giving out bacon donuts.  I had heard amazing things but never got around to going until recently when I finally stopped by for the one thing that jumped out at me:BACON DONUTS!!When I said I wanted to orders to go, they told me they would not give me the ice cream, but rather would give me an extra donut.  Cool.So I waited and waited and waited.  The place was nice.  I finally got my donuts and left with my bag.  I took them to my car.  I could have sat there and eaten them in the restaurant, but I had things to do.  I just wanted to try the donuts.In the car, my curiosity was seducing me so much that I gave in and opened one of the two boxes.  I was disappointed.  I paid 13 bux or so for these little things.  Wth...Then I tasted one.It was so good it made you wanna smack someone's grand momma.  Yeah thats horrible...but thats the point, for a second there I lost my dog gone mind.They were soft...Hot, fresh out the what ever the hell they used to cook them.  Then they had some sort of like caramel sauce on them and then there were bacon bits (as in bits of bacon and not that cheap stuff from the supermarket) drizzled all over them.  They were amazing.  Later that night I was getting some food and I met this nice girl who was also getting food.  I told her I had gotten the bacon donuts and she started asking questions about them.  I have no idea why but I started acting kinda aloof, I kept thinking she was going to ask me to stay and share them with her and that was just too much, even though there was no basis in reality for my belief.  I just felt like everyone was going to be trying to get at me for my bacon.  I excused myself and left.  So lady, if you ever find me, I am sorry.  I was not in my right mind. I was on bacon.At $6, the donuts cost more than crack did in the 80s but you dont have to worry about turning into chris rock's pookie character.",5.0
"I couldn't figure out a place to bring some friends for their first experience of Brooklyn until Traif was brought into the mix. Perfect choice.Everyone writes about Traif. Everyone reads about Traif. Therefore, almost everyone knows something ABOUT Traif and there is good reason. It is a very different take on normal dishes. Since it is 'so known', I had to make my reservation on the Wednesday before the Saturday night, and I was STILL only able to choose between 7:30 and 9:30pm. Quite the popular spot.Walked in and got one of the better tables in the open garden area. In the dining area, it seemed to be 100 degrees with fans blasting in certain areas as well as a much louder environment, but the garden had a nice breeze and for the majority of the meal, we didn't feel the heat.We ordered some cocktails and when they all came, the look of them was nice, but the taste was horrible. Everyone at the table got something different, yet no ones opinion of their drinks were different. They all were pretty terrible. Come for the food, not the alcohol.Strawberry-Cinnamon Glazed Baby Back Ribs: These are a must-have. They aren't THAT amazing, but I think they are needed because of the different tastes that are going on in your mouth compared to what usually happens with ribs.Bacon Wrapped Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates: Amazing. Get them. Deliciousness if you like Bleu Cheese, heavenly if you really like bleu cheese (this guy).Spicy, Bigeye Tuna Tartare: Not too bad. The tuna is very tasty, but it is also one of the more basic plates that we had for the night. It was a nice change.Sauteed Broccoli Rabe, Roasted Portobella-Truffle Toast, Fried Egg: My FAVORITE plate of the night. It reminded me of a great Croque Madame. It was insanely rich and tasty.Thai Spicy-Sweet Chili-Glazed Calamari: SPICY AS SHIT. This will burn your mouth off, however leave you wanting more. We had it almost last and I really wish they brought it out earlier, probably would have had more. Still very tasty.BBQ, Braised Short Rib Sliders, Sweet Potato Fries: Basic. Nothing too fancy here, but they were very good. I thought the highlight of the meal were the sweet potato fries with that DELICIOUS dipping sauce.Mom's Key Lime Pie: I was hoping to order the Bacon Doughnuts, but the Key Lime was the needed sweetness to end the savory meal. It was one of the best Key Lime Pie's I have ever had and I've had some good ones.We had a few more dishes that I cannot remember (like Oxtails and one with Muenster Cheese dip) that were alright. These were my more memorable plates that came out. I can't remember being THIS FULL after a meal, but I was completely stuffed. Our bill came out to $135 between 4 drinks and 9 plates of food. Could I really complain about the price? Absolutely not. $40 in terrible cocktails will do that to you.ORDER THE FOOD NOT THE DRINKS. The food is superb and will leave your taste buds guessing what will come out next. Sit in the garden if you have the chance. Order the Broccoli Rabe plate and Strawberry Baby Back Ribs then finish with the Key Lime Pie. You can thank me later.",4.0

"Came for dinner on a Wednesday evening and the place was pretty full. Started with a drink at the bar then had the tasting menu. For 440 per person, it was a great deal. We got 4 plates of food and dessert. All of the food was cooked and seasoned well with fresh ingredients. Because of the proximity to a subway and the good value for the food, Traif is a place worth visiting",4.0
"Do not miss the hot-cold heirloom tomatoes and creamed corn or the strawberry cinnamon baby back ribs. The latter sounds bizarre but the taste profile is fantastic. The small plates, the beautiful presentation, the great favors all made this a perfect meal. I particularly love a bar that makes an amazing mock-tail! And yes, do not miss the bacon donuts and coffee ice cream",5.0
"What a great place if you're in the mood for good food - tapas style - and a unique wine list.  The pork belly is insane.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful.  It's on the pricey side, but the artful culinary experience is well worth it.",4.0
"I have such a love /hate relationship with this place. Sometimes, the food is stellar, the wine keeps flowing, and I keep smiling, enjoying the company of my bf. Other times the food is a wretched mess. I don't know does this place play russian roulette with my food; oh we shall serve you crap today? I think it has to do with the extensive menu, it's great for the place, but keep your fingers crossed for a good night!!",3.0
"My friends and I came on a Thursday night. We were tempted to try the tasting menu (10 items chosen at random, $40 / person. Two items would be taken into consideration by the chef. The plates would be enough for each person.)After contemplating for a bit, we decided to pick our own plates; this was a great decision.We picked 10 plates (in order of how we were served):We were served curry shots to start, which was surprisinly refreshing.1) Dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, lemon-caper brown butter - This was a bit disappointing as this tasted a like scallops I can have anywhere else.2) Berkshire pork belly, rhubarb, grapefruit, blackberries, sugar snaps - The pork belly was pretty good. Yet, I did not feel the berries worked with the meat.3) Spicy, bigeye tuna, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis - I love eggplant, yet I felt the combination was on par to the other items we ordered.4) Sauteed broccoli rabe, roasted portobella-truffle toast, fried egg - This was surprisingly good, all this works well together5) Bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli - This was one of the best items we ordered. So good, salivating thinking about it right now6) We had a pasta dish served with crab meat. It's a must if you are to come to this restaurant.  7) baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini - This was just okay. Definitely can skip this9) Moulard duck confit, english peas, honshimeji mushrooms, green garlic - This was delicious as the meat was very tender9) Glazed-confit chicken wings, hoisin, five spice, sriracha - This tasted adequate. Nothing you can't get anywhere else. 10) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs - I felt the sweetness did not mix well with the ribsWe ended with the bacon doughnuts, which took half an hour or to be served as the food inspector randomly dropped by at 10pm. The waitress apologized and served us each a complimentary glass of champagne. My friends liked it, yet I thought it was pretty alright. Although, I enjoyed dinner; I was not entirely impressed. I definitely believe my sore throat manipulated my taste and thoughts of the food.",3.0
"Went here at 9 pm and place was pretty packed.  The food's pretty good.I didn't like the glazed-confit chicken wings, hoisin, five spice, sriracha.  Way too salty.

The name itself drew me in but the food is going to keep me coming back. Try the sliders and you will understand what I am talking about. Then go ahead and try those bacon donuts and you'll really get what is happening here. Plus the lively atmosphere and especially our waitress added a great deal to the experience of what I am calling a great first date. Make sure to call ahead for a reservation!,5.0
"I don't really care for pork.  Its kinda something people know about me.  People go, do you eat pork, and I go, no...but I eat bacon at IHOP.  It confuses them, but really, have you ever had bacon?  When done right, its great.I had missed the Yelp event where they were giving out bacon donuts.  I had heard amazing things but never got around to going until recently when I finally stopped by for the one thing that jumped out at me:BACON DONUTS!!When I said I wanted to orders to go, they told me they would not give me the ice cream, but rather would give me an extra donut.  Cool.So I waited and waited and waited.  The place was nice.  I finally got my donuts and left with my bag.  I took them to my car.  I could have sat there and eaten them in the restaurant, but I had things to do.  I just wanted to try the donuts.In the car, my curiosity was seducing me so much that I gave in and opened one of the two boxes.  I was disappointed.  I paid 13 bux or so for these little things.  Wth...Then I tasted one.It was so good it made you wanna smack someone's grand momma.  Yeah thats horrible...but thats the point, for a second there I lost my dog gone mind.They were soft...Hot, fresh out the what ever the hell they used to cook them.  Then they had some sort of like caramel sauce on them and then there were bacon bits (as in bits of bacon and not that cheap stuff from the supermarket) drizzled all over them.  They were amazing.  Later that night I was getting some food and I met this nice girl who was also getting food.  I told her I had gotten the bacon donuts and she started asking questions about them.  I have no idea why but I started acting kinda aloof, I kept thinking she was going to ask me to stay and share them with her and that was just too much, even though there was no basis in reality for my belief.  I just felt like everyone was going to be trying to get at me for my bacon.  I excused myself and left.  So lady, if you ever find me, I am sorry.  I was not in my right mind. I was on bacon.At $6, the donuts cost more than crack did in the 80s but you dont have to worry about turning into chris rock's pookie character.",5.0
"I couldn't figure out a place to bring some friends for their first experience of Brooklyn until Traif was brought into the mix. Perfect choice.Everyone writes about Traif. Everyone reads about Traif. Therefore, almost everyone knows something ABOUT Traif and there is good reason. It is a very different take on normal dishes. Since it is 'so known', I had to make my reservation on the Wednesday before the Saturday night, and I was STILL only able to choose between 7:30 and 9:30pm. Quite the popular spot.Walked in and got one of the better tables in the open garden area. In the dining area, it seemed to be 100 degrees with fans blasting in certain areas as well as a much louder environment, but the garden had a nice breeze and for the majority of the meal, we didn't feel the heat.We ordered some cocktails and when they all came, the look of them was nice, but the taste was horrible. Everyone at the table got something different, yet no ones opinion of their drinks were different. They all were pretty terrible. Come for the food, not the alcohol.Strawberry-Cinnamon Glazed Baby Back Ribs: These are a must-have. They aren't THAT amazing, but I think they are needed because of the different tastes that are going on in your mouth compared to what usually happens with ribs.Bacon Wrapped Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates: Amazing.

"I've been wanting to try Traif since it opened and finally was able to last weekend.So what's all the hype about?!?!?!With all these 5 star reviews, I was seriously expecting to be blown away.  Unfortunately, it was an ok dining experience and have had better food at under-the-radar places in BK and Queens.I will admit what Traif tries to accomplish is very interesting and innovative, but just shies from its full potential.  I have the answer- SALT!!  Not sure if it was the chef of the evening but our food was especially bland.  The individual components of each dish were good but put together the flavors became lost.  Most of the dishes we ordered were also on the sweet side.... and had a lot of cinnamon.Here's what we had:Amuse of red lentil soup- sweet with cinnamonPork Belly with concord grape and pistachios- love all these ingredients but surprised that this fell flat.  Would have been phenomenal if the belly was seared with more salt.Tuna tartar on tempura eggplant- this was pretty good but the eggplant was a little greasy.Strawberry cinnamon baby back ribs- a bit too sweet considering the rest of the meal.Scallops on butternut squash puree with huckleberries- there was cinnamon in the puree.  Scallops were good on their own.Sweetbread schnitzel with sunchokes and brussels sprouts- I couldn't finish this.  The sweetbreads were too greasy and the dish too sweet.The Bacon donuts were good but the bacon flavor gets lost in the dolce de leche.  The smoky/salty bits were better when they fell into the coffee ice cream.   We also had an anejo tequila drink that was nice.No complaints about the service, which was pretty awesome.",3.0

"First a complaint: they don't answer their phone. So if you want to find out whether they have room for you at the last minute, you cant. Luckily when we showed up anyway, they did have room and we weren't disappointed. I had a salad with greens, radish, cherry tomatoes, bacon bits, thin slices of pear, and a dusting of grated gorgonzola. It was very refreshing and the bacon was not overpowering.  I thought it was slightly overdressed. This was followed by foie gras with egg, potatoes and maple syrup. The foie was a good size and was perfectly cooked, but I thought the maple syrup ruined it and made it just taste like breakfast. The third and final dish I had was the lamb confit, which was very rich and delicious, and which I'd definitely have again any time I didn't mind eating that much fat!So 5 stars minus 1 for the phone policy, minus 1/2 for the maple syrup, and minus another 1/ 2 because 3 dishes shouldn't have taken well over an hour to be served.",3.0

"I went there with my boyfriend for dinner on Saturday. Their dinner starts at 6 and the place was filled quickly. We sat in the outdoor portion of the restaurant and it was really nice. You sort feel like you are sitting in a garden with the leaves and flowers above and behind you. The waitresses and servers are nice and tentative. We were told that a party of 2 usually shares 4-5 of there small plates. We decided to get only 3 plates, which was the perfect amount. We ordered the Soft Shell Crab with cucumbers and asparagus. The dressing for the vegetables were amazing and the crab was very fresh and crispy. The crispy pork belly was a tad bit hard, but the fat melts right inside your mouth. The cantaloupe side was delicious. The sauce that is was sitting in gave it a tart beginning but sweetness if the fruit slowly comes out. The short rib sliders with sweet potato fries was heavy, but yum. The meat is pulled onto buns that are warm and soft. Delicate little burgers. My boyfriend loved the crunchy sweet potato fries. It hardly felt oily like other fries, but it was too heavy for me. Traif specializes in small plates. The 3 I ordered, had two pieces of soft shell crab, around 4-5 cubes of pork belly, and two sliders, per plate. They also will give out free samples of items for you to try. We sampled a watermelon gazpacho, which was actually not that great. I had a great time with all the delicious food. 4.5 stars.

Pretty much an alcoholic apple cider. *shrug*Food: (1) Tuna tartare. Very refreshing and fresh. Tasty. (2) Broccoli rabe with truffle toast and fried egg. Very heavy but delicious. Indulgent. (3) Short rib sliders. MMM. That bread was buttery and soft, and it went perfectly with the sweet short ribs. Sweet potato fries were amazing too. (4) Seared Foie. Had to get it again. I love it with the fried egg. Another rich and indulgent dish, but they sear the foie so well. (5) Softshell crab. Not pieces, but the entire small softshell crab with a delectable avocado mixture. I love softshell crab, and I love avocado. Perfect dish for me. (6) Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. I have yet to want to try another dessert dish because this dish is always such a great choice. Crispy bacon bits. Fluffy, fresh doughnuts. Mmm. Can't go wrong. All in all, I love the shared plates concept because I love to try new dishes, so let me retract my previous statement.

"It took me a while to finally try Traif, but one night we were lucky enough to get seats at the bar. It was very noisy, but was there with just one person, so no worries. Standout dish was the tuna tartare on panko eggplant. Only one dish disappointed, which was the broccoli rabe. I don't get the hype over the bacon doughnuts. Tasted like a regular, fresh made donut. Overall, definitely recommend a visit. I will be back",4.0
Went to Traif with a group of friends and got to experience the tasting menu. The chefs cater the tasting menu to your diet and will incorporate picks from the menu you are dying to try. My favorite was the tuna tartare. The dishes kept coming out to the point my group was so full that we weren't speaking to each other! ( Not complaining- just a worry when you are going to get tapas you'll be a bit unsatisfied when you leave). We all left full and happy. Drinks were good too-try the Red Pearl!,5.0
"First of all, great date spot! After making a reservation for 2 at 8pm Friday, my GF was running super late. I explained this to the hostess and she gladly advised they would hold the table for me and to enjoy a beverage at their sister restaurant a few doors down (XiXa). After my GF arrived at 8:30, we were sat immediately. The waitress was very attentive and super helpful advising that usally its good to oder 4-6 plates for 2 people. The food was AMAZING. Complementary tasting of the bacon infused soup, a beautifully prepared tuna tartare, fried green tomatoes, super tasty cut of pork belly, and the extra tasty bbq short rib sliders!

"I recall reading the New York Times review of Traif in 2010, with the thought of visiting on my mind since then.  One of the reasons the name stuck with me is not because I understood it, but as Yiddish slang for non-Kosher foods, it achieved mild infamy, probably by being located in a neighborhood with a large Hasidic Jewish community, although it matters not at all.  The buzz about Traif has always been positive, and after finally visiting in 2012, I discovered what a loss it was to have waited so long to experience it.  Just across the way from the Williamsburg bridge, Traif is narrow, with seats on a long bar overlooking the open kitchen, and on tables opposite the bar.  The space is contemporary, sleek pale woods against dark walls and flooring.  The ceiling above the bar is painted in festive, colorful swirls.  Prettier is the stone-paved back room that overlooks a garden, evoking a glasshouse effect with glass-paned walls and ceiling.  The one-page menu changes frequently, and in no-frills fashion, simply lists ingredients in a dish, lead by the main ingredient if there is one.  Diverse foods and ingredients that takes influences internationally, with an ever-so-slight tilt toward Asian.  Choose libations from a wine list or test out their competent cocktail chops, via house list or by request.The food is wonderful, with assertive and interesting flavors, and skilled prep.  The dishes can be pleasingly unusual.  Blistered shishito peppers, a favorite bar snack enjoyed at a dozen other places, here adorn a piquant salad of cantaloupe, feta, and marcona almonds; the marriage of flavors and textures was vibrant and surprisingly good.  Bellflower pasta with lobster was deeply flavorful and savory.  Muenster is melted over smoked chorizo in a tall ramekin, served with sweet apple slices and crostini.  Two fried soft shell crabs faced off with capes of pineapple sambal and crushed avocado, perhaps for the chunks of papaya between them.  A foie gras dish recalled steak and eggs for brunch, just messier, richer, and flecked with fried ham chips, maple syrup, and hot sauce.  Fatty, tender pork belly contrasted with the sweetness and crisp of sugar snap peas, the tart of rhubarb and grapefruit. There were more, but ultimately, there was hardly a miss among any dish tried.  Indeed, the only letdown were the renowned bacon doughnuts, fried dough puffs topped with bacon bits, atop dulce de leche, served with coffee ice cream.  They are precisely as described, but strangely didn't make the impression expected.Traif is surely one of the best restaurants in Williamsburg, with interesting and well-executed fare.  It is very reasonably priced for the level of cooking.  It is without airs, feels like a local restaurant, and easy to visit often.  Reservations best, and a must for a group.",4.0
"Apparently Traif means everything other than Kosher... hence pork and seafood! Oooohhh...I get it now! :pThis place definitely served up a solid brunch! I'm definitely a fan of small kitchens and big turn outs :) The ""Eggs in a Nest"" and the Chicken and Biscuits were definitely my top choices of the afternoon, then top that off with some bacon doughnuts and you get a little voice in your head that said YUM!The Eggs in a Nest was so cute...the brie and mushrooms in the toasted bread were oozing out of the hollow middle where the fried egg laid to rest and yet this middle cut-out was not wasted and served as great decor :D.",4.0
"Traif, good job getting into my pants last night.  I'll drop to my knees and obey your every whim if you keep serving me your lucsious pork and shellfish and other delicious deliciousness.  No, really, I'm all yours, forevers and evers and evers, for life.  What do you want me to lick?

"Traif means serious business. This place is one of my favorite I have been to. I have been to Traif five times with my boyfriend and I leave full and happy every time. The first time I came here we ordered different platters such as the frog legs, soft shell crab, muenster cheese dip, strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs, sliders and finally the bacon donuts. I was impressed with everything the first time especially the muenster cheese and the ribs. The next four times that we came I made sure to order the ribs and muenster cheese again. They are by far my favorite thing on the menu. I used to hate BBQ ribs but when I tried the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs from Traif I could not get enough. I could eat two orders on my own. The service at Traif is great as well everytime we came, except for the last. We came with a group of 12 people about two weeks ago and they told us they can seat 8 people at one table and 4 people at another table, but they tried to get us to do the chefs tasting menu. We wanted to sit at the table of 4 with two of our friends and have a separate check because we wanted to order what we like.  When we asked our waiter to do a separate check for the four of us instead of combined with the other 8 people that came with us. The waiter had a bit of an attitude because we wanted our own check. It did not make much sense for us to pay the tasting menu when there is only four of us. The waiter then went to the manager and told her what we wanted and she was not too pleased, In fact she said a rude remark loud enough behind us so that we could hear her. Other than that night, our service was always great. I was a little surprised about how the acted towards us, but that won't stop me from coming back to Traif and eating again. I most definitely recommend everyone try this place. The food is out of this world!!",5.0
"O DAYUM! Ok, so just go knowing you'll either have to eat again after this (pricey + small portions), or just eat something small before you go and prepare for a food gasm. This food is amazing. The flavors, were masterfully married together, the experience was amazing. I ate here like 5 months ago and still remember the flavors. Can't wait to try their sister restaurant Xixa.",5.0

"Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first!If I had eaten the dessert, the glorious bacon donuts with dulce de leche and coffee ice cream, first, I would not have eaten another bite of anything else. The waiter delivered our bacon donuts to us and I was still eating the cinnamon-strawberry spare ribs. As the other Yelpers dug into the dessert, I asked how it was.Cassy S. answered, ""It's terrible! Awful! Don't even bother trying it. I'll eat yours for you.""At that, I immediately stopped eating my dinner and my fork flew to the soft pillowy donut that was bathing in sweet heavenly dulce de leche, dotted with very crispy bacon. I scooped some of the rich coffee ice cream with the donut. OH, HEAVENLY NIRVANA. I saw stars. I saw light. I saw truth. I saw a thousand wonders of the world. If you are lost and weary, feeling forsaken, EAT THIS for this must have been the apple of knowledge that is in the bible. You will never look at dessert the same way again.When the other table got their bacon donuts, our entire table yelled out in chorus, ""It's really really terrible. Bring it here. We'll save you the trouble.""Will C. immediately attacked a donut. After eating his dessert, he wandered over to our table looking a little annoyed at us because we tried to trick him out of this delectable treat. Yelpers are generous people. We love to share and there's nothing more than what we love to do than share good food. But the bacon donuts are just that wonderful. We do not want to share. Oh, no! Go get your own. Actually don't. Leave them all for me, please? PLEASE! I only have 6 months to live! DON'T TAKE THE DONUTS!!!!!!!!!***********What is Traif? Traif comes from treif, which is Yiddish for torn. It refers to all forms of non-kosher meat, pork being famously one of them.Traif serves all different manners of delicious ""dirty"" non-kosher meat. They also have meat that could be kosher (beef), but I'm sure they cooked in delicious non-kosher ways. Traif serves up incredible gourmet delights in small plates with generous serving sizes, so that a table a four could comfortably have a really good taste of a dish. Best of all the prices are incredibly reasonable, nay cheap, for food of this quality. If you're looking to impress on a budget, you can do no better than Traif. This isn't good food on budget. This is GREAT food that just happens to be very budget friendly.I enjoyed my little bites at Traif. They were very tasty, but the style at Traif is not quite my thing. If you love offal, Traif would be the first place that I would recommend. Knowing that you're doing something illicit, forbidden, and dirty makes the act just that more thrilling, daring, and fun. Sinning never tasted so good.",4.0
"It took me a while to finally try Traif, but one night we were lucky enough to get seats at the bar. It was very noisy, but was there with just one person, so no worries. Standout dish was the tuna tartare on panko eggplant. Only one dish disappointed, which was the broccoli rabe. I don't get the hype over the bacon doughnuts. Tasted like a regular, fresh made donut. Overall, definitely recommend a visit. I will be back",4.0
Went to Traif with a group of friends and got to experience the tasting menu. The chefs cater the tasting menu to your diet and will incorporate picks from the menu you are dying to try. My favorite was the tuna tartare. The dishes kept coming out to the point my group was so full that we weren't speaking to each other! ( Not complaining- just a worry when you are going to get tapas you'll be a bit unsatisfied when you leave). We all left full and happy. Drinks were good too-try the Red Pearl!,5.0
"First of all, great date spot! After making a reservation for 2 at 8pm Friday, my GF was running super late. I explained this to the hostess and she gladly advised they would hold the table for me and to enjoy a beverage at their sister restaurant a few doors down (XiXa). After my GF arrived at 8:30, we were sat immediately. The waitress was very attentive and super helpful advising that usally its good to oder 4-6 plates for 2 people. The food was AMAZING. Complementary tasting of the bacon infused soup, a beautifully prepared tuna tartare, fried green tomatoes, super tasty cut of pork belly, and the extra tasty bbq short rib sliders! The clear cut winner for dessert was the Bacon Donuts with Coffee Ice Cream and wow they will not disappoint! Thank you for a wonderful evening Traif and see you soon!",5.0

"Traif was amazing.  The food was really good.  The service was fine.  Two of my friends and I indulged in the following:-Butterfish carpaccio with pickled blackberries, mangos, black sesame The pickled blackberries were fantastic and refrigeration may have been a slight issue as this dish also should have been colder.-Seared foie gras with fingerling potatoes, ham chips, fried egg, maple syrup and hot sauceReally?  Need I say anything further?  It was absolutely sublime.  The earth shook beneath us as we devoured the dish.  Amazeballs.-Pork belly with feta and sweet cantaloupeSucculent, seared cubes of pork belly were nicely complemented by the sweet cantaloupe and salty feta.  A restaurant that flaunts itself as a celebration of pig should be able to nail a pork belly dish.  That it did.-Spicy-sweet chili chicken wingsWe really enjoyed this dish and I intend to try and replicate it come football season...-Gorgonzola stuffed dates wrapped in baconSimple and well-executed.  Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, delicious...-BBQ Short Rib Sliders with sweet potato friesA bit on the sweet side but the chipotle aioli was solid and rounded out everything else.  Smokey goodness.-Bacon doughnuts, dulce de leche with coffee ice creamThis may be a perfect dessert; it was wickedly decadent.  Guilt and gluttony were suddenly nowhere to be found...Overall, we had a really nice meal and the chef clearly loves the pig.  The food speaks for itself and Brooklyn continues to impress me.  It's worth the trip in from Manhattan.  Hello, BACON DOUGHNUTS!?",4.0

"This one is dedicated to Cassy S. the current duchess of Traif and amongst many of my Brooklyn friends that have tormented me with rave reviews here .. a place not easily accessible to a car-less Queens girl like myself*. However on the first chilly October night after an Indian summer, the moon aligned with the northwest star and two Queens girls found themselves in Brooklyn to finally have a taste from this Yelp mecca.Set on providing a good base for our stomachs prior to attending a booze filled soiree, my date and I decided to share a few plates, despite me having eaten only 2 hours earlier. After choosing a couple of potent cocktails and struggling to narrow down our choices from a long list of enticing dishes, we were ready to indulge our tastebuds.The delicious amuse-bouche of Carrot Yogurt Soup quickly set the tone for the plates to come. Next up, the salad with brussel sprouts, cherry tomatoes, rice crisps, grapes, & mint, a grown up fruit salad, was pleasing as a light starter. Then came the big guns.. a new addition to the menu - melted, bubbly muenster cheese with smoked pork belly hiding underneath to spread on garlic toast. As I found myself going for the last piece of toast, I had thought for sure I couldn't go on any further. I felt the cheese sink to the bottom of my stomach. These were not dainty small plates but generous portions made to share. Thankfully the Hamachi Carpaccio with grapefruit, & avocado arrived next and served well as an intermission before hitting up the the savory, rich meatballs to come. The Lamb & Beef tender, succulent meatballs sealed the deal. I was satisfied, full and completely done... that is, until dessert arrived. Donuts are not something I go gaga over though the infamous Bacon Donuts here were everything the traditional donut was not. Light, pillowy round balls, topped with dulce de leche sweet but not too much to make my teeth hurt. The bacon provided just enough smokiness without including too much unnecessary salt. Part of me wished I wasn't sharing. As the last lick of coffee ice cream disappeared we were already preparing what to eat upon our next visit and pondering when that will be. With satisfied bellies and an acceptably small dent in the wallet, Traif easily makes the list of recommended nosh spots worth traveling out of your comfort zone for. ------------------------------------*The MTA doesn't support the idea of easy access between boroughs",5.0
"""You've never been to Traif?! Oh, you're going to love it!"" And just like that I was whisked away to Traif along with about 20 other yelpers after the elite event at BK Winery. The restaurant was smaller than I thought it would be, but they managed to accommodate our large group by splitting us up into two tables. We ended up ordering quite a lot of food. They have 20+ small dishes on the menu and everything sounded so good that I had a tough time picking what to order. The following are the dishes I tried...BACON BROTH - Wow, what a great way to start the meal! The bacon broth had a great smokey flavor and it was rich without being oily.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…HAMACHI CARPACCIO - I'm so predictable. If there's raw fish on the menu, I'll probably get it. I loved the combination of the avocado and grapefruit with the hamachi.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…CRISPY PORK BELLY - Not bad. I usually prefer pork to be on the tender side rather than the crispy side, but the lentil and noodle stew made the dish for me.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…SEARED SCALLOPS - The scallops were seared perfectly and the butternut squash sauce was a delicious compliment.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…COCKLE CLAMS - Can't go wrong with clams in a flavorful broth.BACON DOUGHNUTS - This sounded suspicious to me, since I'm not a huge fan of savory/sweet desserts, but after trying the bacon doughnuts I'm now a believer. This was surprisingly good, especially with the ice cream.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…The chef also sent out some pineapples with pomegranate sauce as a last little dessert tidbit. They tasted like gummy bears! The bill was a shocker as well. For the amount of food we ordered, the bill was surprisingly low split up between all of us. Delicious seasonal food, gorgeous presentation, and reasonable prices. My yelp friends did not lead me astray. I was told I would love Traif and I do! I can't wait to go back and try more of the food.",5.0
"we're not usually ones to make reservations but it was high time we tried traif.  i've been hearing great things about it since it opened but the past couple of times we'd stopped by for dinner, the wait was out the door. so, i finally bit the bullet, made a reservation and invited a few close friends to enjoy the experience with me.at first view of the menu, i was reminded of alta, the great tapas restaurant in the west village. there was a sampling of cuisine from all over and the waitress recommended sharing a number of items for the table. fair warning, it's hard to ignore your gut when it begs you to get crazy and just order one of everything... we restrained though and settled for eight of the small plates and 4 of the more robust dishes.  it was the right amount for six people; that paired with cocktails and bacon covered donuts for dessert, we were definitely content when we were finished.we started with roasted brussels sprouts, a roasted carrot and sunflower seed salad, seared scallops and salt & pepper shrimp. the dishes flavors didn't in any way tie together, other than the fact that they were all incredibly delicious. the portions weren't large but when each bite explodes with flavor, all you really need is a taste.we moved on to my personal favorite; the sauteed broccoli rabe with portobella-truffle toast, a fried egg and parmesan on top. i'm telling you, this one dish will make your night, don't skip it! after that, we indulged in pork cheeks in a creamy polenta (who knew i liked these?), strawberry glazed baby back ribs, quail served atop biscuits with bacon gravy and short rib sliders served with sweet potato fries and a spicy chipotle sauce.the menu rotates relatively frequently but regardless when you go, i'm sure you won't be disappointed.  we were surprised at how reasonable the cost was as well.  we had a six-top table and ordered two bottles of wine as well as a few cocktails and paid $65 per person. the service was warm and friendly, the atmosphere was laid back and comfortable and most importantly, the food was spot on. love, love, love traif.",4.0
"Spectacularly good food: bring a group of friends and I promise you - you'll have a blast AND get points for your impeccable taste. Not easy to do both. All dishes are meant to be shared, which is a problem if you're a slow eater. Everything is so mouthwateringly good that before you know it you'll be licking your plate clean. Or someone else will. Either way, nobody will care because the vibe is so low-key you can get away with pretty much anything.Food rundown: get the glazed baby back pork ribs (best I've ever had), the duck confit, anything with the word ""pork"" in it... the only thing we didn't call in love with was the budino for dessert: the mousse was way too salty. We couldn't get a table on a Friday night, so we sat at the bar. This had its pros and cons. Cons: the bar far from comfortable to sit at for 2 hours. Pros: watching a kitchen the size of a closet at Eleven Madison produce dishes that rival the aforementioned restaurant. Just don't expect valet parking.",5.0
"The only thing getting in the way of Traif's excellence, is the uber high standard they have set for themselves!  Their food is really amazing and despite the fact that their chef Jason didn't win Chopped, he was clearly the most talented chef on the episode and totally should have won (although we didn't get to see what he would've made on the dessert round, but I just think he would've taken it).   I've been to Traif on date nights and with friends, and both experiences are equally amazing.  Not too good for large groups due to the space, but four people is great so you can order a ton of the food and share.  Traif have a lot of small plates that are great for sharing (except some portions leave you wanting a little more) and they also have larger entree plates as well.  What I love to do, actually almost anywhere I eat, is to SHARE!  If I go with someone, I like to get like 3-4 small plates and an entree (if you read my reviews, you know I love to eat a lot)! I've eaten a good number of their dishes and the standouts to me are as follows (note:  their menu changes somewhat regularly):-lamb tenderloin medallions were perfectly cooked, succulent and juicy, with i think a pistachio crust or something that gave it a great texture and crunch, along with a hummus puree or something, and a fruit compote on top...this is an aphrodisiac.  If you want to score on a date, order two of these dishes and watch the magic happen.  It is that good. -seared foie gras:  I feel bad for the goose that get overfed to stuff their liver for our guilty little pleasure, but OMG, this is soo good.  Perfectly seared and served with a great mix of hot and sweet, with an egg...this is delicious! I just realized that I could go on and on writing about how much I love so many of their dishes, but what I would encourage you to do, is GO, look at the menu, see what you like, and order liberally.  The food is amazing!  Their drinks are also masterfully crafted, so don't skip the drink menu either.  The ambiance is somewhat dark and moody, usually with lively banter in the background from the packed house (I've never seen it empty), and the best part - they have an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs do their art.  I sat at the bar once and was amazed at what all they could do in the space they had, and I think one night I softly applauded as their dishes went by me.  And last of all, the wait staff are extremely attentive and courteous, and they will be more than glad to make suggestions and answer any questions about the dishes they serve so feel free to ask them.Please enjoy!",5.0
"FOOD CRAWL STOP #8:10 food crawlers began the day at 10:30am, and 13 hours later, we wound up at Traif for our 8th stop.  Already pretty full at this point, it was time to just be gluttonous - and let's face it, with a mantra like ""Traif,"" isn't that the goal?I indulged in carpaccio, tartare, and chicken wings, but my pals went way more overboard with the pork-goodies, going so far as drinking out of bacon-rimmed glasses and desserting with bacon donuts.  It was the perfect way to cap our journey.14 hours, 8 stops, 7 miles walking, 25 miles by subway, 6 miles by cab and with all meals and transportation included under $100 later, we left not just full for the day, but probably full for the week....that is, until we hit Flushing's Chinatown the next day!  To be continued...",5.0
"This place is no joke.  If I could, I would give Traif 8 stars.  This place is by far top 5 on my list of favorite restaurants.  I would eat there everyday if I could.  MUST TRY: munster cheese and chorizo sausage dip, strawberry or pomegranate and cinnamon ribs, frog legs, pork belly, and last but not least, DULCE DE LECHE DONUTS, WITH BACON AND COFFEE GELATO.  I walk out of this place with the biggest smile on my face every time.  I came here the first time with my brother for dinner.  He was very excited to bring me here and I quickly learned why.  Since then I have been back more than five times and bring different friends with me every time.  Each person is always over joyed and satisfied with the meal.  Every person also at some point or another said that this might be the best meal they ever ate.  Like I said, Traif is no joke.  The food is top of the line.  The staff is great, and the place is super cool.  You can see the entire kitchen which is located behind a bar.  One time, the waitress told me the kitchen was closed and i could not order the donuts.  It was 1:45 AM.  While waiting to use the bathroom, which is next to the kitchen area, I told the chef how he is one of my favorites and cooks up some of the best things I have ever ate.  I also told him I was upset my friends could not try the donuts.  He apologized and turned the friers back on.  I felt bad but was excited at the same time.  Within 5 min there was a order of donuts on our table.  They also gave it to us on the house.  This sort of service assured me that this place is by far my favorite restaurant.",5.0
"Traif was amazing.  The food was really good.  The service was fine.  Two of my friends and I indulged in the following:-Butterfish carpaccio with pickled blackberries, mangos, black sesame The pickled blackberries were fantastic and refrigeration may have been a slight issue as this dish also should have been colder.-Seared foie gras with fingerling potatoes, ham chips, fried egg, maple syrup and hot sauceReally?  Need I say anything further?  It was absolutely sublime.  The earth shook beneath us as we devoured the dish.  Amazeballs.-Pork belly with feta and sweet cantaloupeSucculent, seared cubes of pork belly were nicely complemented by the sweet cantaloupe and salty feta.  A restaurant that flaunts itself as a celebration of pig should be able to nail a pork belly dish.  That it did.-Spicy-sweet chili chicken wingsWe really enjoyed this dish and I intend to try and replicate it come football season...-Gorgonzola stuffed dates wrapped in baconSimple and well-executed.  Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, delicious...-BBQ Short Rib Sliders with sweet potato friesA bit on the sweet side but the chipotle aioli was solid and rounded out everything else.  Smokey goodness.-Bacon doughnuts, dulce de leche with coffee ice creamThis may be a perfect dessert; it was wickedly decadent.  Guilt and gluttony were suddenly nowhere to be found...Overall, we had a really nice meal and the chef clearly loves the pig.  The food speaks for itself and Brooklyn continues to impress me.  It's worth the trip in from Manhattan.  Hello, BACON DOUGHNUTS!?",4.0
"Stunning... one of the best meals I have ever had in my entire life.Highlights: pork belly, salt and pepper shrimp, porcelet, bacon doughnuts.Do yourself a favor and go there before TOO many people find out how ridiculously good it is.",5.0
Came here on a thursday night. Decor is nice and simple. Drinks were blah. The tuna tartar was one of the best I've had. The duck confit was also good. The pork cheek was disappointing. Their menus change every day.,4.0
"This one is dedicated to Cassy S. the current duchess of Traif and amongst many of my Brooklyn friends that have tormented me with rave reviews here .. a place not easily accessible to a car-less Queens girl like myself*. However on the first chilly October night after an Indian summer, the moon aligned with the northwest star and two Queens girls found themselves in Brooklyn to finally have a taste from this Yelp mecca.Set on providing a good base for our stomachs prior to attending a booze filled soiree, my date and I decided to share a few plates, despite me having eaten only 2 hours earlier. After choosing a couple of potent cocktails and struggling to narrow down our choices from a long list of enticing dishes, we were ready to indulge our tastebuds.The delicious amuse-bouche of Carrot Yogurt Soup quickly set the tone for the plates to come. Next up, the salad with brussel sprouts, cherry tomatoes, rice crisps, grapes, & mint, a grown up fruit salad, was pleasing as a light starter. Then came the big guns.. a new addition to the menu - melted, bubbly muenster cheese with smoked pork belly hiding underneath to spread on garlic toast. As I found myself going for the last piece of toast, I had thought for sure I couldn't go on any further. I felt the cheese sink to the bottom of my stomach. These were not dainty small plates but generous portions made to share. Thankfully the Hamachi Carpaccio with grapefruit, & avocado arrived next and served well as an intermission before hitting up the the savory, rich meatballs to come. The Lamb & Beef tender, succulent meatballs sealed the deal. I was satisfied, full and completely done... that is, until dessert arrived. Donuts are not something I go gaga over though the infamous Bacon Donuts here were everything the traditional donut was not. Light, pillowy round balls, topped with dulce de leche sweet but not too much to make my teeth hurt. The bacon provided just enough smokiness without including too much unnecessary salt. Part of me wished I wasn't sharing. As the last lick of coffee ice cream disappeared we were already preparing what to eat upon our next visit and pondering when that will be. With satisfied bellies and an acceptably small dent in the wallet, Traif easily makes the list of recommended nosh spots worth traveling out of your comfort zone for. ------------------------------------*The MTA doesn't support the idea of easy access between boroughs",5.0
"""You've never been to Traif?! Oh, you're going to love it!"" And just like that I was whisked away to Traif along with about 20 other yelpers after the elite event at BK Winery. The restaurant was smaller than I thought it would be, but they managed to accommodate our large group by splitting us up into two tables. We ended up ordering quite a lot of food. They have 20+ small dishes on the menu and everything sounded so good that I had a tough time picking what to order. The following are the dishes I tried...BACON BROTH - Wow, what a great way to start the meal! The bacon broth had a great smokey flavor and it was rich without being oily.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…HAMACHI CARPACCIO - I'm so predictable. If there's raw fish on the menu, I'll probably get it. I loved the combination of the avocado and grapefruit with the hamachi.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…CRISPY PORK BELLY - Not bad. I usually prefer pork to be on the tender side rather than the crispy side, but the lentil and noodle stew made the dish for me.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…SEARED SCALLOPS - The scallops were seared perfectly and the butternut squash sauce was a delicious compliment.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…COCKLE CLAMS - Can't go wrong with clams in a flavorful broth.BACON DOUGHNUTS - This sounded suspicious to me, since I'm not a huge fan of savory/sweet desserts, but after trying the bacon doughnuts I'm now a believer. This was surprisingly good, especially with the ice cream.yelp.com/biz_photos/qLLx…The chef also sent out some pineapples with pomegranate sauce as a last little dessert tidbit. They tasted like gummy bears! The bill was a shocker as well. For the amount of food we ordered, the bill was surprisingly low split up between all of us. Delicious seasonal food, gorgeous presentation, and reasonable prices. My yelp friends did not lead me astray. I was told I would love Traif and I do! I can't wait to go back and try more of the food.",5.0
"we're not usually ones to make reservations but it was high time we tried traif.  i've been hearing great things about it since it opened but the past couple of times we'd stopped by for dinner, the wait was out the door. so, i finally bit the bullet, made a reservation and invited a few close friends to enjoy the experience with me.at first view of the menu, i was reminded of alta, the great tapas restaurant in the west village. there was a sampling of cuisine from all over and the waitress recommended sharing a number of items for the table. fair warning, it's hard to ignore your gut when it begs you to get crazy and just order one of everything... we restrained though and settled for eight of the small plates and 4 of the more robust dishes.  it was the right amount for six people; that paired with cocktails and bacon covered donuts for dessert, we were definitely content when we were finished.we started with roasted brussels sprouts, a roasted carrot and sunflower seed salad, seared scallops and salt & pepper shrimp. the dishes flavors didn't in any way tie together, other than the fact that they were all incredibly delicious. the portions weren't large but when each bite explodes with flavor, all you really need is a taste.we moved on to my personal favorite; the sauteed broccoli rabe with portobella-truffle toast, a fried egg and parmesan on top. i'm telling you, this one dish will make your night, don't skip it! after that, we indulged in pork cheeks in a creamy polenta (who knew i liked these?), strawberry glazed baby back ribs, quail served atop biscuits with bacon gravy and short rib sliders served with sweet potato fries and a spicy chipotle sauce.the menu rotates relatively frequently but regardless when you go, i'm sure you won't be disappointed.  we were surprised at how reasonable the cost was as well.  we had a six-top table and ordered two bottles of wine as well as a few cocktails and paid $65 per person. the service was warm and friendly, the atmosphere was laid back and comfortable and most importantly, the food was spot on. love, love, love traif.",4.0
"Spectacularly good food: bring a group of friends and I promise you - you'll have a blast AND get points for your impeccable taste. Not easy to do both. All dishes are meant to be shared, which is a problem if you're a slow eater. Everything is so mouthwateringly good that before you know it you'll be licking your plate clean. Or someone else will. Either way, nobody will care because the vibe is so low-key you can get away with pretty much anything.Food rundown: get the glazed baby back pork ribs (best I've ever had), the duck confit, anything with the word ""pork"" in it... the only thing we didn't call in love with was the budino for dessert: the mousse was way too salty. We couldn't get a table on a Friday night, so we sat at the bar. This had its pros and cons. Cons: the bar far from comfortable to sit at for 2 hours. Pros: watching a kitchen the size of a closet at Eleven Madison produce dishes that rival the aforementioned restaurant. Just don't expect valet parking.",5.0
"The only thing getting in the way of Traif's excellence, is the uber high standard they have set for themselves!  Their food is really amazing and despite the fact that their chef Jason didn't win Chopped, he was clearly the most talented chef on the episode and totally should have won (although we didn't get to see what he would've made on the dessert round, but I just think he would've taken it).   I've been to Traif on date nights and with friends, and both experiences are equally amazing.  Not too good for large groups due to the space, but four people is great so you can order a ton of the food and share.  Traif have a lot of small plates that are great for sharing (except some portions leave you wanting a little more) and they also have larger entree plates as well.  What I love to do, actually almost anywhere I eat, is to SHARE!  If I go with someone, I like to get like 3-4 small plates and an entree (if you read my reviews, you know I love to eat a lot)! I've eaten a good number of their dishes and the standouts to me are as follows (note:  their menu changes somewhat regularly):-lamb tenderloin medallions were perfectly cooked, succulent and juicy, with i think a pistachio crust or something that gave it a great texture and crunch, along with a hummus puree or something, and a fruit compote on top...this is an aphrodisiac.  If you want to score on a date, order two of these dishes and watch the magic happen.  It is that good. -seared foie gras:  I feel bad for the goose that get overfed to stuff their liver for our guilty little pleasure, but OMG, this is soo good.  Perfectly seared and served with a great mix of hot and sweet, with an egg...this is delicious! I just realized that I could go on and on writing about how much I love so many of their dishes, but what I would encourage you to do, is GO, look at the menu, see what you like, and order liberally.  The food is amazing!  Their drinks are also masterfully crafted, so don't skip the drink menu either.  The ambiance is somewhat dark and moody, usually with lively banter in the background from the packed house (I've never seen it empty), and the best part - they have an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs do their art.  I sat at the bar once and was amazed at what all they could do in the space they had, and I think one night I softly applauded as their dishes went by me.  And last of all, the wait staff are extremely attentive and courteous, and they will be more than glad to make suggestions and answer any questions about the dishes they serve so feel free to ask them.Please enjoy!",5.0

Our menu was as follows:-red lentil soup-macintosh apples, greens, cranberries, bacon, blue cheese, dijon vin.-strawberry-cinnamon glazed berkshire baby back ribs-baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini-bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli-seared scallops and tuna tartare -sweetbreads schnitzel, cinnamon spaetzle, parsnips, haricot, paprika, sherry            -quail 'n' biscuits: buttermilk-crust, sausage gravy, bacon-corn biscuits, honey-braised hampshire pork cheeks, long-cooked broccoli, creamy parmesan polenta-bacon donuts-pane cotta Just rereading that is making me hungry. One of the best meal's I've ever had. I can't recommend it more highly.",5.0
"Easily best dinner of 2014 so far!  A friend and I went last weekend, and every single thing was amazing, from the friendliness of the staff, the decor and the best food ever.  Our server told us that 5 dishes would be perfect- but we couldn't decide- so we went for 7.  It was hard to choose a favorite, but I think it was the tuna tartar with the Japanese eggplant. Or the Pork Belly. Or the mussels. I can't really decide. The bacon doughnuts were spectacular. Will be returning... probably a few times!Delish!",5.0

"I've been to Traif twice for brunch, both wonderful experiences. The menu is small, but you can find your choice of delectable sweet or savory entrées as well as a few stiff drinks. The first time I came here I thought I entered another dimension with how incredible the bacon doughnuts were. Everyone rants about them, and for good reason. It is a delicate dough, glazed with dulce de leche (which I had initially thought was maple glaze) and topped with crumbled bacon bits with a scoop of coffee ice cream on the side to wash it down. The combination is unlike any other. After the first bite I stared at my best friend sitting across the table from me with a dreamy, glazed look in my eye because I was melting from its unbelievable combo. I thought about these doughnuts non-stop for much longer than I'd like to admit. I also had the mimosa of the day, which was splendid, just the way I like it, with only a splash of OJ. My entrée was the chilaquiles (which I did not see on the menu the second time I visited, so this must mean some items come and go). I found these quite tasty and enjoyed their choice of mexican cotija cheese, the spicy green salsa and especially the nice crisp in the tortillas, which too often come soggy in this dish. My first experience was a home run, including service. The second time I went, everything was also irreproachable, I had round two of the bacon doughnuts and also the chicken and biscuits, which was exactly what I wanted. Both times my best friend had the egg and bacon belly sliders and those are delicious, but my favorite part of that dish is the sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo. HUGE FAN. My only complaints: if you order drinks, it can get a bit pricey since they're each about $9. Additionally, I ordered a Mexican Michelada the last time and thought it was too much like a bloody mary, please skip the soy sauce or whatever you put in it. My friend also commented on how the pork belly in her sliders was mostly fat the second time around and she ended up not eating one of the sliders.  I would still come here any day of the week, unless I got tired of the menu, which is small like I said. I would never not order the bacon doughnuts, that's just not right. I am looking forward to coming to check out their lunch/dinner menu since that is something I have not yet experienced. If you are looking for simple, clean flavors and pairings with a slightly new composition, this is the place to go. It's the definition of ""new"" American cuisine as far as I'm concerned.",5.0
"I'm not giving Traif one star for the food.

"Came here for Judgement Day for what could have been our last meal on earth and all the positive reviews did not disappoint. I liked the colorfulness of the interior, the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff, and the tapas-style menu, because I got to taste 5 different dishes (including dessert)!First, they served us a little cup of pea soup. It was very green and a bit intimidating, but surprisingly tasty. It's not something I would want to consume in large quantities, but it was still a pleasant surprise, as we did not expect to get anything more than we ordered.The spicy sweet chili-glazed Calamari was wonderful. My only complaint was that there was too much sauce and it was a bit overpowering...it also made our calamari a bit soggy.Our salad was awesome! I couldn't taste the first couple bites because my senses were altered from the spiciness of the calamari. The salad included asparagus, edamame, pistachios, etc. I liked the croutons because it was very crispy, which was a perfect addition to the salad.Mmm the bone marrow! This may have been my very first time trying bone marrow. The dish came with something which I had no idea what it was, but it was ridiculously delicious on the little pieces of bread they also provide you with. Our oversized rigatoni with crabs and mushrooms was pretty good, although it tasted too much like the pea soup we got at the beginning of our meal. FINALLY...THE BACON DOUGHNUTS! It looked like turds but tasted like heaven! The bacon pieces were perfect on the soft, cushiony  doughnuts, and the coffee ice cream went so well with it. To finish off our meal, the waitress gave us small pieces of pineapple with caramel (?) on it. It was the most delicious pineapple I've ever had with the perfect consistency.Overall we were pleased with our meal at Traif. Unfortunately, I had been looking forward to eating here for several months expecting a 5-star meal, so it bothered me when I did notice some imperfections with our dishes. That is the only reason why I am giving it 4 stars. If I knew nothing about this place and had zero expectations, I probably would've given it 5 stars. Also, we were very cramped in our seats...It sucks to not be able to slouch when you're ridiculously full!",4.0
very good service and an experimental menu - frankly some of the dishes were much better than others but the overall experience and quality of food is worth the trip out to Williamsburg,4.0

"This is one of those places where you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything I had was really well balanced in flavor. The style is tapas, small plates so I would recommend three or more plates per person. If you share everything, as you usually go, the ""bites"" are prepared accordingly. This is especially true (and I highly recommend this) in the chef's-choice-tasting-menu which includes 9 courses plus 2 dessert courses for $40/person. Oh and bacon bits on donuts bites, amazing.Check it out.",5.0
"Big thumbs up. In general, this place can do no wrong. I recommend a small group (and a reservation!) and order as much of the menu as you can. Drinks are very unique, very original--they're definitely doing smart things over there. Tuna, scallops, foie gras--eat those.",5.0
"Wow. Delicious food. Had waiter order 4 best courses for us.  All were just great! Tuna tartare, seared scallops , ribs in strawberry glaze and foie grois served with a fried egg. Shockingly good n dessert matched the meal. Bacon doughnuts with peanut butter sauce. A perfect key lime pie and an on the house peanut butter sorbet with banana whip. Mmmm.  Had drinks and an app or two :) at sister restaurant chicksa which was equally as tasty.",5.0
"Delicious and creative food.. the menu changes daily, but the main components of most of the dishes remain consistent throughout the changes (which are mainly just changes in preparation and accompanying flavors)Our waitress explained that the menu is arranged from lightest to richest and that all the dishes are meant to be shared. The two of us ordered four dishes all together. About two minutes after we ordered, the waitress told us ""your food is on the way!"" lol, talk about efficiency. Then we realized why, she meant our complimentary amuse bouche: little shots of watermelon gazpacho. Wasn't a fan because it tasted like lukewarm tomato gazpacho but it was on the house so not gonna let it affect my rating. Anyways, on to the main event. We expected the lighter dishes we ordered to come out first and heavier dishes to follow but it ended up just the opposite. Our richest selection was the sautéed veal sweetbreads w/ artichokes cherry tomatoes and picholine olives, and that was actually brought out first which was strange but it tasted divine so no complaints. They also brought out the next richest dish early in the game, and that was also very yummy: sautéed broccoli rabe topped w/ roasted portobella-truffle toast (basically a very thick and savory texas toast) and a fried egg. After we devoured both dishes, there was about a 10-15 minute wait and we were anxious to see if they were gonna bring out the sliders next or the burrata salad. Ended up being the burrata, which was beautifully arranged w/ speckled plums, mint, tomatoes, and what appeared to be micro greens. The flavors complimented each other well. At this point I was getting stuffed because my friend didn't know what sweetbreads were and when I told him he gave up immediately so I had to finish the plate myself. Finally we got the short rib sliders, which came with perfectly cooked sweet potato fries and a smoked paprika aioli which went well w/ both the fries and sliders. I pretty much give a thumbs up to everything we tried but a thumbs down to the order in which they came out because my stomach did not agree.Next we got a dessert menu. Neither of us eat pork so the ever popular bacon donuts were a no-go. Instead we selected the vanilla panna cotta w/ berries and the chocolate parfait topped w/ brandied cherries and black sesame ice cream. Both were very good. Our waitress brought out our check along w/ an after-dinner snack: One-bite cubes of watermelon w/ a slight drizzle of pomegranate molasses and lime zest. Looked plain and simple but tasted amazing and complex! Sweet refreshing end to a fantastic mealOnly cons are really that they brought out the heaviest dishes first and that the main dining area was super noisy which kills the ambiance. Tables are way too close together and space to move about is pretty much none. I did ask if we could sit in the back garden area while making reservations but they said there's only 4-ppl tables back there. When I went to the bathroom I saw that they were right about there only being 4-seat tables however most if not all the tables had a party of two sitting at them.O RLY?

"Since my first visit in June 2010, Traif was always on my mind.  I finally made my second visit this last Sunday.  As I predicted Traif has become so huge by 6:30 it was packed (back in June it was less than half full on a Sunday evening...).

"I came here on Saturday night for a nice birthday dinner.  It was just the two of us and  did not know what to expect.  First off, make sure you have the right address in your GPS because there are a few similar addresses that can make finding this place extremely confusing.We ordered the chef selection (basically a tasting menu) so that we could try everything.  Moreover, it was impossible to decide what we wanted from looking at the menu.Started off with an arugula salad with nuts and fruit - this was the first arugula where i didnt not have a hint of a bitter taste in the arugula.  DeliciousNot going to lie, I do not remember all the courses because all were delicious and there were so many.Here are the ones I do remember - Fried soft shelled crabs - slight asian flavor, perfect.Pork belly - the perfect amount of fat v. meat on this thick slab of baconish goodness.foie gras - cant go wrong with foie gras on perfected toasted toast points - i would have paid extra for more of this course.pulled rib sliders w/ sweet potato fries - delicious to a point where it was uncalled forpasta with smoked salmon - the only dish that did not wow, felt a little olive-garden-ish.two desserts - all i can say is that thank god i am not a dessert person so i did not feel the need to finish the two because we were full beyond belief.I would definitely come back here, especially now that I know exactly where it is and will not be driving to the middle of Park Slope or Prospect Park.Happy eating, suckers.",5.0

Overall, great dining experience but my only complaint would be the order in which the dishes came out. The waitress explained that they like to start you out with something light and progress to the heavier dishes. So I was confused when the pork belly (the heaviest/fattiest dish) came out first. Oh well! It didn't matter much. I also have to give points for ambiance. It was POURING out when we got there, but still got to sit outside in the enclosed patio.

"Having been a resident of Williamsburg for nearly 2 years and tried nearly everything around, Traif is my favorite place here, if not in all of NYC.The place serves mostly small dishes, it is great for small groups so you can try a variety of dishes.  The dishes are all individually unique with flavor combinations you have perhaps never dreamed up of.  My favorite was the bacon covered dates which in and of itself was not unique to trait, but was spectacularly done.Highly recommended - promise you will not be disappointed.",5.0
"How does one even begin to describe a place like Traif. It's not so much a hidden gem, but a gem in its own respect in that it offers some of the most creative food in Williamsburg. It's a small and unseeming place for a large get together at first glance, but the interior is amazingly cozy as they sport one of those rare New York pseudo gardens. Moving on to the food, I was never one big on sharing and tapas style cuisine since I never find it filling. At Traif it makes total sense since you want to try EVERYTHING on their menu. As a pretty conservative eater, I tend to stick to safe food items that know a restaurant can't get wrong: chicken, salads, etc...but was blown away by the inventiveness of every dish and how well it was crafted. You'll be sitting there in amazement forcing your friends to try whatever you just had. Bacon donuts have to be on the top of my list. I was never a big fan of pancakes, but they execute it so well here, I don't know how else a place could sell a $15 stack of flour and buttermilk.

"I have no idea if Traif is so named because of it's proximity to a massive Hasidic community or whether the name and adjacent community are simply happenstance. Either way, because this place sits right next door and is so egregiously non-kosher, it's possible that it's the first stop on some sort of ""Underground Railroad"" for bacon-loving Hasids.Name aside, I thought that the over-the-top bacon worshipping movement had moved beyond it's nadir and, perhaps, arrived at ""jumped-the-shark"" status but I was wrong. Not that Traif is all about the bacon but it, along with shellfish, are unabashedly featured on the menu and the result is both creative and wonderfully delicious. The pork belly is an absolute treat -- packed with a sumptuous smoky flavor and so tender that your knife need never leave the table. As good as the pork belly was, it was the foie gras hash that was undoubtedly the highlight for our table. For one, you can't really go wrong with a properly cooked piece of foie; it sits comfortably atop the pyramid of meat deliciousness. And the foie here is expertly seared and paired with some of the best potato hash I've tasted. Top it all off with a sunny-side-up egg and serve with maple and hot sauce. It's rich, decadent, and everything you'd ever want of a breakfast...or lunch...or dinner. Hell, you could serve this dish at any time of day, in any place and it's totally appropriate.Our group ended up sampling a large portion of the menu and I'd suggest this strategy in general. Traif is a fine place to go with one other person, but it shines as a family-style, share-it-all type place and the greater variety you get, the happier you are likely to be. Prices are very reasonable given the quality -- our group of 4 got two dishes each and we drank throughout the meal and the total tab was right at $200.

"What's a nice kosher* vegetarian-ish girl like me doing in a place like Traif? More importantly, when can I come back??Came here last weekend for a good friend's birthday brunch and was immediately shocked by 1) the gorgeous garden patio and 2) the sparsely filled tables. After eating, I'm even more surprised this place isn't mobbed, but that might be because it's only a couple of months old.Though I unfortunately cannot eat any bacon or shellfish, I will note I enjoyed my asparagus, artichoke spinach egg scramble very much. The side salad and toast it came with was drenched in truffle oil, too rich for me. But onto the stuff the rest of you care about. My friends ordered:- Egg-in-a-nest - egg and portabello sandwich- Braised bacon in soba noodles (the noodles are really spicy)- The Costanza: scrambled eggs with lobster- Chicken 'n' biscuit with watermelon salad - the chicken is deboned and deep fried and comes on top of a big biscuit swimming in a creamy sauce- For dessert: Bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream (see photo)Sweetbreads are also available during brunch, according to the waitress but we did not order any.Everyone freaked out about their food. Freaked. Out. Especially about the bacon doughnuts. Though I liked my egg scramble my personal freakout came with the strawberry cobbler dessert. Served in a ramekin, the cobbler is simple but decadent; creamy, sweet and fresh, I would have gladly had another!Also try the silky and chocolaty Viennese iced coffee. A friend had two very refreshing Moroccan Whiskeys, while I suggest avoiding the iced mint green tea -- had almost zero flavor. I think it's funny they offer He'Brew Messiah Gold as one of their beers but they have a nice seasonal list too.The owner said the chef likes to use seasonal ingredients and is more than willing to be flexible for vegetarians.

"Sure, the food was good, especially considering it came from a poorly marked Brooklyn hole in the wall, but I just can't quite figure out the hype surrounding this restaurant.

Even worse, this tiny box of a restaurant has diners sitting on top of each other (I don't recommend squeezing out of your chair to find the restroom unless you want to irritate neighboring diners) and right next to the chefs and the stove over which they cook. As a result, my boyfriend and I both walked out of Traif drenched in sweat.

"Having been a resident of Williamsburg for nearly 2 years and tried nearly everything around, Traif is my favorite place here, if not in all of NYC.The place serves mostly small dishes, it is great for small groups so you can try a variety of dishes.  The dishes are all individually unique with flavor combinations you have perhaps never dreamed up of.  My favorite was the bacon covered dates which in and of itself was not unique to trait, but was spectacularly done.Highly recommended - promise you will not be disappointed.",5.0
"How does one even begin to describe a place like Traif. It's not so much a hidden gem, but a gem in its own respect in that it offers some of the most creative food in Williamsburg. It's a small and unseeming place for a large get together at first glance, but the interior is amazingly cozy as they sport one of those rare New York pseudo gardens. Moving on to the food, I was never one big on sharing and tapas style cuisine since I never find it filling. At Traif it makes total sense since you want to try EVERYTHING on their menu. As a pretty conservative eater, I tend to stick to safe food items that know a restaurant can't get wrong: chicken, salads, etc...but was blown away by the inventiveness of every dish and how well it was crafted. You'll be sitting there in amazement forcing your friends to try whatever you just had. Bacon donuts have to be on the top of my list. I was never a big fan of pancakes, but they execute it so well here, I don't know how else a place could sell a $15 stack of flour and buttermilk. At the end of the day, the food does come out to be a little pricey and not as filling, but I prefer to think of it more as a tasting experience than a place to gorge yourself, like Vanessa's Dumplings.  Advice: Bring a group of 4-5 and try everything on the menu.",5.0

We arrived half an hour early (whoop, no traffic!), but they seated us right away. So, basically Traif serves small plates to share. Our waiter recommended 4 plates for 2 people, but we're fatties and got 5. (^.^) We ordered the salad with berries, but they screwed up our order and gave us the butter lettuce with fig. No matter - it was delicious! Next was the pork belly; I'm not usually a fan of pork belly in general, so I was whatever, but he seemed to enjoy it. We tried the strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs due to the many praises on Yelp. I don't disagree, but I'll refrain from further praise because I didn't think it was outstanding. I loved the scallops with corn! It had really good flavor. The last dish was the seared foie gras, sunny side eggs with maple and hot sauce - interesting combination of sweet and spicy... I don't know if I would get it again, but I definitely recommend that it should be tried once. One thing to note is that all the meats were slightly over-cooked. Not enough to ruin the meal altogether, but definitely put a damper on the night. Even the scallops - the two smaller ones were a bit tough (the larger was perfectly cooked - thank goodness.) A, who'd been here a few weeks prior, said his first time dining there, he didn't notice... So hopefully they were just having an off day. For dessert, we had the bacon doughnuts. Bacon + doughnuts - is it possible to go wrong with this? I don't much like sweet things, so I thought the salty meat balanced the sweetness pretty well.

"Sunday brunch at Traif outside in the enclosed patio with the view of the garden - Priceless.We got there at 11:30am right when it opened and got seating no problem at all. The enclosed patio is nice because the restaurant had the portable heaters on so you can still enjoy being ""outside"" without being too cold. I wanted a light brunch so I ordered the Egg-in-a-nest (brie roast portabella grilled cheese and truffle cream). Let me tell you something. It was not light.  It was amazing because it seemed like they grilled on butter and the whole sandwich was oozing with delicious butter. The texture on the grilled cheese was like a bit crunchy, a bit creamy, and savory. It was perfect. E had the chilaquiles. It was very filling and creamy but the taste got tiring if you are eating the whole thing. We also ordered bacon doughnuts with the coffee ice cream. I was a bit disappointed in it as i was expecting this strong bacon taste with the donut. It seems that they just glazed it with the slight taste of bacon and added bacon bits.",4.0
"This place was great. Friendly service, great (and creative) food, good music. Everything was delicious but not too heavy where it felt like you were getting too full. My favorites were the pork belly and burrata cheese/avocado mousse. For desert, the bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream were great but the key lime was a little sweet for my taste but I still ate it all.Also, a cool but small cocktail selection included a chilli infused vodka that was spicy and yummy.",5.0
"LOVE Traif! I went last week some friends. The 6 of us were encouraged to order around 18 dishes so there was ample food for all of us and boy was there enough food! My favorites were the sliders, strawberry and cinnamon ribs, tuna tartar, soft shell crabs, muenster cheese with chorizo, and the bacon doughnuts! I wasn't a fan of the prawns as they were super fishy! The vibe was great and our servers were really nice. For all of the food and drinks it only cost us $56 each. Definitely will be coming back here in the immediate future!!",5.0
"I was expecting a great meal, but nothing was very memorable.I had the bacon cocktail. It was really smoky and salty, too much for my tastebuds. I also had a Pimm's Fizz, which was bland, but refreshing after the first cocktail.The amuse bouche was a spicy pumpkin curry soup. I can't handle spicy foods, so obviously I didn't like it. All I tasted was fire in my mouth.I had the pork cassoulet, mussels, pork belly with peppers, and short rib sliders. The cassoulet looked and tasted like mush. The mussels were nothing special. The pork belly came in very tiny, very fried pieces so you couldn't really taste the meat. The sliders just tasted sweet.It was a pretty unfulfilling meal. I heard great things about the bacon donuts, but even those were a disappointment. The actual donuts were a bit on the salty side and did not have the sweetness to balance the bacon bits.

"Sunday brunch at Traif outside in the enclosed patio with the view of the garden - Priceless.We got there at 11:30am right when it opened and got seating no problem at all. The enclosed patio is nice because the restaurant had the portable heaters on so you can still enjoy being ""outside"" without being too cold. I wanted a light brunch so I ordered the Egg-in-a-nest (brie roast portabella grilled cheese and truffle cream). Let me tell you something. It was not light.  It was amazing because it seemed like they grilled on butter and the whole sandwich was oozing with delicious butter. The texture on the grilled cheese was like a bit crunchy, a bit creamy, and savory. It was perfect. E had the chilaquiles. It was very filling and creamy but the taste got tiring if you are eating the whole thing. We also ordered bacon doughnuts with the coffee ice cream. I was a bit disappointed in it as i was expecting this strong bacon taste with the donut. It seems that they just glazed it with the slight taste of bacon and added bacon bits.",4.0
"This place was great. Friendly service, great (and creative) food, good music. Everything was delicious but not too heavy where it felt like you were getting too full. My favorites were the pork belly and burrata cheese/avocado mousse. For desert, the bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream were great but the key lime was a little sweet for my taste but I still ate it all.Also, a cool but small cocktail selection included a chilli infused vodka that was spicy and yummy.",5.0
"LOVE Traif! I went last week some friends. The 6 of us were encouraged to order around 18 dishes so there was ample food for all of us and boy was there enough food! My favorites were the sliders, strawberry and cinnamon ribs, tuna tartar, soft shell crabs, muenster cheese with chorizo, and the bacon doughnuts! I wasn't a fan of the prawns as they were super fishy! The vibe was great and our servers were really nice. For all of the food and drinks it only cost us $56 each. Definitely will be coming back here in the immediate future!!",5.0
"I was expecting a great meal, but nothing was very memorable.I had the bacon cocktail. It was really smoky and salty, too much for my tastebuds. I also had a Pimm's Fizz, which was bland, but refreshing after the first cocktail.The amuse bouche was a spicy pumpkin curry soup. I can't handle spicy foods, so obviously I didn't like it. All I tasted was fire in my mouth.I had the pork cassoulet, mussels, pork belly with peppers, and short rib sliders. The cassoulet looked and tasted like mush. The mussels were nothing special. The pork belly came in very tiny, very fried pieces so you couldn't really taste the meat. The sliders just tasted sweet.It was a pretty unfulfilling meal. I heard great things about the bacon donuts, but even those were a disappointment. The actual donuts were a bit on the salty side and did not have the sweetness to balance the bacon bits.

Big eye tuna tartar that sat on top of tempura eggplant - I wish there was more tartar and less eggplant (and I think the tempura eggplant took away from the flavor of the tartar) but overall it was good.2. Chicken liver that came with bread drizzled in balsamic vinegar.  OMG.  If you like chicken liver like BC does, this is a must have.  It was the smoothest chicken liver I ever had... it wasn't the thick pate consistency, it was lighter and more spreadable.  So goood.3. Seared scallops and creamed corn.  This needs no explanation.  It was delicious.4.Seared foie gras with fried egg and fingerling potatoes.  Generous portion of foie gras and when you get the perfect bite full with potatoes, some egg with runny yolk and a bit of foie you get a rich lil party in your mouth.5. Duroc pork over foie gras risotto (waitress told me it was braised in milk and AWESOME, she was totally right).  The pork was sooo tender and soo flavorful. Yummm!6. Key lime pie for dessert.  BC and I are huge fans of key lime pie so we've had key lime  pie from all over the city and this was probably one of the best slices we;re ever had.The damage? $120ish before tip.  We also had 2 glasses of wine.Mmmm.  Can't wait to go back!",4.0
"This is that kind of place. The kind I've been missing in New York since moving here from San Francisco. The kind with the menu printed on a sheet of paper with date on it. The kind where you feel so happy you can order several small plates to share, and that way you get to try more of their creativity. Most incredibly of all, the kind where prices are decidedly un-New-York.We had three dishes: bigeye tuna on tempura eggplant (five-star item, hands down), fricasse of escargot (five stars as well), and pork belly croquette on Israeli cous-cous, which despite being a specialty, we both thought was mediocre - a three. In the nicest of touches, Taif also brings small watermelon gazpacho cups for starters, and pineapple with sauce at the end. Our only complaint - and it's a big one - is that gazpacho can't be ordered as a menu item. I almost considered rating Taif with one star instead of five, because we loved it so much, we were ready to steal the plastic tub of it from the bar counter and chug it all straight up.",5.0
There's a reason Traif has an almost perfect 5 star Yelp rating - it really is that good. I don't have much to add on top of what others wrote but definitely try the  tuna tartare atop tempura-fried eggplant. I don't eat meat but I still enjoyed the non-meat dishes thoroughly.,5.0

"It rivals Vinegar Hill House as my favorite restaurant in NYC right now.  If you can (and while you can), eat in the back on the patio.Unbelievable food and good service.  Worth the trip to Brooklyn, particularly for the meatballs, calamari and bacon doughnuts.",5.0
"This place is retarded. We ate $70 worth of food. Decided to get the dessert to go: donuts with coffee ice cream. We get to the car, ice cream isn't there. Went back for it. They said  they don't serve the ice cream to go.  They should tell you that, before you pay for it. Assholes. I would give zero stars if Yelp allowed it. Never coming back.",1.0
"First visit was New Year's Eve and I had the flu so I couldn't eat much (which was a total waste since we got the prix fixe menu).  I just remembered how awesome everything on the menu sounded and whatever I managed to eat was delicious, even with the dead taste buds because of all the awesomeness that comes with the flu.This time it was round two and I can recall with clarity everything I ate since I didn't have foggy flu brain.1. Big eye tuna tartar that sat on top of tempura eggplant - I wish there was more tartar and less eggplant (and I think the tempura eggplant took away from the flavor of the tartar) but overall it was good.2. Chicken liver that came with bread drizzled in balsamic vinegar.  OMG.  If you like chicken liver like BC does, this is a must have.  It was the smoothest chicken liver I ever had... it wasn't the thick pate consistency, it was lighter and more spreadable.  So goood.3. Seared scallops and creamed corn.  This needs no explanation.  It was delicious.4.Seared foie gras with fried egg and fingerling potatoes.  Generous portion of foie gras and when you get the perfect bite full with potatoes, some egg with runny yolk and a bit of foie you get a rich lil party in your mouth.5. Duroc pork over foie gras risotto (waitress told me it was braised in milk and AWESOME, she was totally right).  The pork was sooo tender and soo flavorful. Yummm!6. Key lime pie for dessert.  BC and I are huge fans of key lime pie so we've had key lime  pie from all over the city and this was probably one of the best slices we;re ever had.The damage? $120ish before tip.  We also had 2 glasses of wine.Mmmm.  Can't wait to go back!",4.0
"This is that kind of place. The kind I've been missing in New York since moving here from San Francisco. The kind with the menu printed on a sheet of paper with date on it. The kind where you feel so happy you can order several small plates to share, and that way you get to try more of their creativity. Most incredibly of all, the kind where prices are decidedly un-New-York.We had three dishes: bigeye tuna on tempura eggplant (five-star item, hands down), fricasse of escargot (five stars as well), and pork belly croquette on Israeli cous-cous, which despite being a specialty, we both thought was mediocre - a three. In the nicest of touches, Taif also brings small watermelon gazpacho cups for starters, and pineapple with sauce at the end. Our only complaint - and it's a big one - is that gazpacho can't be ordered as a menu item. I almost considered rating Taif with one star instead of five, because we loved it so much, we were ready to steal the plastic tub of it from the bar counter and chug it all straight up.",5.0
There's a reason Traif has an almost perfect 5 star Yelp rating - it really is that good. I don't have much to add on top of what others wrote but definitely try the  tuna tartare atop tempura-fried eggplant. I don't eat meat but I still enjoyed the non-meat dishes thoroughly.,5.0
"This place is so amazing. Very cozy, comfy and intimate. We decided to ask the waiter to surprise us and bring us whatever she liked. The TUNA TAR TAR was orgasmic! Then they brought a bacon broth shot it was so cute and yummy. The rest of the meal was so good. We kinda went into a trance and totally forgot what everything was called. The key lime was amazing. In love with this place and will be back soon.",5.0
"Came for a late Saturday afternoon brunch. They serve brunch until 3:30 when they close and reopen for dinner at 6. Very unique, cutting edge brunch menu. It was hard to choose because there were so many things that looked interesting. We both started with the special pear ginger mimosas ($8). The fruity mimosa was effervescent and not too strong. Went down fast. After going back and forth I ordered the intriguing bacon, egg and cheese sliders ($8). It was two tiny sliders with blue cheese, eggs and crispy pork belly served on a White Castle type bun. The sliders themselves were tasty, but not very filling. The real hit were the sweet potato fries with smoked paprika aioli. They were awesome. I was still a little hungry so I went with the bacon doughnuts ($6) served with a small scoop of coffee ice cream. Nice presentation, but nothing outrageous. The munchkin size donuts had a few pieces of crunchy bacon sprinkled on top lying in a sticky syrup glaze. It was something different. My friend is Jewish and she mentioned the word Traif is Yiddish meaning not Kosher which is fitting because their menu is filled with bacon items.  Cool spot for brunch with fast, attentive service. Heated outside seating and an open kitchen which gave my friend ample time to check out the chef who she had the hots for..  3.75 stars.",4.0
"We got off to a rocky start with Traif, but all was settled once we sampled a number of delicious dishes from their very well balanced menu.The place is not very big, and fills up quickly with reservations as well as hopeful walk ins. We settled for a 6pm rez, when the other option was 9:30pm....we were traveling with a pregnant friend. 9:30 just wanted a viable option. At any rate, my wife and i made the relatively painless jaunt over the river from Jersey City to meet our friends. We showed up at 5:20...They informed us that they didn't open til 6. No biggie, we actually found a great joint around the corner called Post Office. Be sure to check it out for drinks if you are in the area. Worth the trip itself. Back to the rocky start. After enjoying a libation, and feeling totally relaxed from the chill ambiance of Post Office we returned to Traif about 2 minutes before 6, only to be rudely met at the door with the a curt message that they don't open til 6. C'mon! Give me a break. What was funny it turned out that the rude young lady that greeted us ended up serving us. She was no more polite as a server. Not to mention they were very concerned about turning over the table. I would go so far as to say we were rushed, but we definitely knew under no uncertain terms when it was time to leave.We are now exiting the rant part of my review, and entering the rave part. The food! The food! The food! What a great menu with amazing flavors, and almost flawless execution. I would say if you are there with a group of 4 or more go for the $40/person chef menu. They portion everything out for you, and you get a true sampling of what they offer. We went a la carte, but would strongly suggest going for the $40 set up next time.Everything we ate was cooked beautifully. The flavors were so perfectly balanced, and complimentary of one another. I found myself savoring every bite, but excited as I thought about the next dish. The only flaw again was the service. The dishes seemed to come out a bit haphazardly. There wasn't a whole lot of rhyme or reason to it, and at a few different points in the night some of us didn't have food while others did. I think another reason to go with the $40 deal.Here were our highlights, and what I think were must haves...chopped chicken livers: The odd service almost ruined this delectable dish. They really rushed it off our table, and I found myself grabbing it back from the waiter. Lame, but I probably would have bitten this guy's hand off as it was really good.spicy, big-eye tuna, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manisstrawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs: perfect balance of spicy and sweet, and the meat melted off the bone and into your mouthbbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli: these were the highlight for me. I could have eaten a dozen of these.bacon doughnuts, dulche de leche , coffee ice cream: Everyone wants to put bacon on sweets these days, but it's not always appropriate or done well. They totally pull it off in such a subtle way here. These were an awesome finish to a tasty meal.Once we were seated, enjoying each others company, and sampling some great food....I found that I could forget about the service for the most part.

"It is absolutely very good - but the best restaurant ever? Favorite in the city? Not so much.

It is a very heavy meal and many of the menu items are seriously heart clogging. I do not suggest ordering the broccoli rabe which is nothing special at all (soggy bread over bitter broccoli with a fried egg). The foie gras that everyone raves about was very greasy and the predominant taste of the dish was fat/lard.

"What are you paying for at Traif?  Is it the food, the service, the ambiance, the Williamsburg cache, just a good time...or what?I've been twice and the common theme and what I've loved between both visits has been the food. The odd combinations of quality ingredients, the consistent, and ""as-intended"" cooking technique,  the smaller plates = you/your party-can-sample-more-variety allure...all amount to uncommonly delicious, satisfying food.So why the two stars?  Last year I went for my birthday with my girlfriend and this year, did the same. However, both experiences were incredibly different, like night and day. Last time, our waitress was attentive, considerate, willing to sweeten up a cocktail if too boozy, and on top of the order of plates. We sat right by the entrance, right by the constant flow of patrons moving in or out and yet that never seemed to become a distraction. This time was just a little different. You might think I'm fussy or spoiled based on my complaints and I might understand but let me just tell you how even if the food is amazing somewhere, the service can suck, and the experience overall can be mixed at best and at worst...well...at worst, the service can make appreciating what should be appreciated difficult, if not impossible.We were seated in the back left of the main room, right next to a table of I think eight. Our waitress, Whitney, was ok, but it seemed liked she was the point person for every table in the entire room, like as if THAT was her shift. Not the back garden area, the entire room inside. Maybe 20 to 30 customers, that's all?! Sure, there were servers refilling water glasses, taking away menus, dropping off plates, literally running beside tables to do any of these things, and bumping into my girlfriend or anyone else to get to another table nearby but poor Whitney was the one to take orders, deliver drinks, and oversee tables.  We ordered the second item on the menu, a ""tricolore"" salad, among five other things and it arrived first. But you know what arrived second? Basically a pork entree that should have been last...and it was delivered by one of the servers who obviously didn't look at our table and realize that a salad was there and that we were at the beginning of the meal, not the ""crescendo"". So reader...do you tell them to send it back or do you roll with it? We rolled, since we were baffled and starving. Thing is, when you roll, sometimes you regret. And I regretted because we missed our opportunity to question what the servers or Whitney or Traif were doing. Why should it be our job to manage the order of the plates? Why should I have to politely tell them they screwed up, which I should have, or say whatever other possibly annoying shit to the waitress when we're there to pay to experience pleasure by eating food prepared and delivered  by professionals in presumably a certain order?During and after that bit, the food itself was outstanding, which because of the service annoyances became a fight to realize. The service never really recovered either. No waiter or server acknowledged the pork entree's premature appearance, I ordered a French 75 and was told they couldn't make it because they didn't have pineapple juice (!) even though they ended the meal with pineapple chunks (?), I had to tell a server not to take away the container with the Chicken Liver because I wasn't finished, and a waiter in a rush angled around another table to throw bacon donuts on our table. Delicate, right?There are just too many servers trying to drop/take away plates or pour water than there are waitresses or waiters to pay careful attention to you or the quality of your experience. And there are too many tables crammed inside together, which makes bumps and jostling a stupid reality between patrons and staff. With just one waitress to manage all tables, we were genuinely asked how things were going at the beginning of the meal and the end and that's it. Traif has a food-concept which it does execute well, but you might later realize it's also executing a business plan underpinned by what seems like a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. No, I don't blame Whitney or the servers, I blame the owners and the work environment they've created. Why are servers just trying to expedite the flow of everything? Why did it seem like only one waitress was taking orders, delivering drinks, and checking up on a room full of patrons on a BUSY Friday night (May 23rd)? Why are there so many tables crowded in one room with just one waitress? Have the owners earned their investment in the restaurant back yet...cause if they have, why don't they slow down the pace in the kitchen, take out a few tables in the main dining room, and hire a few more waiters or waitresses? Also, why are only larger tables sitting outside in the garden area -if Traif makes more money off of presumably larger parties, are they just more valuable to them and therefore more deserving of a better seat?",2.0
"I personally would like to rent space out in this restaurant. I would like to be served breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is that GOOD. I plan to go back until I've eaten every last damn item on the menu. Shoots I hate key lime pie and Traif has turned me into a believer more like an addict. I mean panna cotta is my favorite dessert it would have been the last meal I would ask for if I were to ever be in that position but damn the key lime pie makes you want to holler. I swear somebody's grandma is behind the conspiracy. Ok let me move on to the other small plates the pork belly, prawns that i ate like i was at home, fingers dirty and all ... who needs a knife & fork i am not trying to impress anyone.

"Had the tasting menu for a friend's birthday and really all the food was a treat. I particularly enjoyed the strawberry glazed ribs, pork belly sliders, and as a true southern boy fried chicken is always welcome. Docked 1 star because they consistently couldn't figure out that the plates with 5 servings should go the table with 5 people rather than one of the others when you have a long table of 14 people... I mean really, having to trade & pass every course is not the most conducive to enjoying an otherwise quality meal.  Then it took about 30 minutes to run the cards which wasn't  so fun either, but otherwise a great meal!",4.0
"AH-mazing.  Absolutely fabulous! Extraordinary!We went here for a friend's birthday with a group of 9 of us.  They did a 'tasting' menu for us that was seriously unbelievable.  I was a little worried with such a meat centric menu (traif meaning dirty in yiddish also didn't help) but they made some amazing vegetarian and non-pork or shellfish options including stingy nettle pesto pasta, munster cheese with crostini, sweet potato fries, etc., etc. etc. And my 'dirty food' enjoying friends indulged in amazing scallops, strawberry pork ribs and bacon wrapped yumminess. Not to mention the desserts... oh the desserts! I can sometimes be a little hesitant about the tasting menu idea (everybody usually seems to leave hungry) but we were so full after this meal, we couldn't even finish.In addition, this place is somewhere you can send the whole day and night and the service is just beyond.A must try.  Must.  MUST!!!!",5.0
Sorry but I don't know what all the hype is about this place. This place is a converted diner. The chef cooks on a griddle behind the counter. Our server was nice but not savvy.  I asked her for a bottle of wine that was full bodied and robust and she said she had the perfect one for us. Needless to say that was the cheapest and thinnest wine I have ever tasted. I would probably go back to try some other dishes on the menu but there's no rush.,3.0
"I'm amazed at the amount of high quality food that comes out of the tiny kitchen that's in view for all diners to see.  I knew there were great reviews for this place, but our experience here definitely exceeded my expectations. I booked this place for my hubby's birthday dinner on a recommendation from a friend since we had a big group and wanted to stay in Brooklyn.  When you have a large group, it's mandatory to accept the chef's tasting menu.  I usually don't mind getting the chef's tasting menu because it's supposed to be the best of the best when you go to a good restaurant.  We were especially happy to agree to it since it was only $40!  I had to ask the lady on the phone twice because I thought I was hearing her wrong.  This included 11 dishes total I believe and 2 of them are dessert.  Highlights:Bigeye Tuna on top of tempura eggplant.Short rib sliders with sweet potato fries.Seared scallops.Moulard Duck Confit.Soft Shell Crab.Panna Cotta with berries.Bacon Doughnuts.All the other dishes we had were also excellent.  In addition, I was very pleased with the service (email/telephone correspondence with Kristen: she was very nice and responsive to all my questions and requests).  It's always a good sign when you leave a restaurant and you're already talking about what you'll order the next time you go back.",5.0
"It amazed me how EXACT a ripoff Traif is from my favorite restaurant, Animal, in Los Angeles. Don't get me wrong, the food at Traif was good.....just not as good......and seriously wow a blatant copy. Even the way the menu is formatted is the same. Near exact flavor combinations as well. In order of best items I had to not best items. - bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates - ridiculous- sweetbreads - maybe my favorite thing to eat so i liked these much more than everyone else. these were excellent though. - broccolli rabe portabella truffle toast + egg - one of the favorites of the group.- braised short rib sliders - better than i thought they were going to be. still no pork belly sliders from Animal though. - pork belly - i'd get it again. not too much to say. good pork belly.- duck confit lettuce wraps - not bad, nothing special- foie gras dish + maple syrup and an egg - extremely similar to one of my all time favorite dishes at Animal. this combo did not work for me here. - bacon donuts - meh. - some type of clams casino type thing - didn't like the clove or whatever similar seasoning was included- hamachi carpaccio - i did not like the combo of flavors and the fish was fishy. It makes sense to copy such a successful concept and bring it to NY however I guess I am just a little offended that Traif is such an exact copy concept wise.......except with cheaper prices. Most expensive dish is like $18. I feel like the quality of ingredients is maybe not there and thats part of what was missing.......and also why they can keep cost down. I forgot about a few items we had but total meal out the door was like $250. Same meal at Animal would be $400.....but way better.",4.0
"I'll keep this short and sweet, the experience was out of this world. loved it from the shot of soup they started us with to the check, honestly!We were a party of two and decided to treat ourselves on a Thursday evening. made reservations and went to the restaurant, small, cozy and hidden. we ordered four plates, the shrimp (spicy, tasty, flavorful with yam and pineapple), the scallops over lentil, so good, pork belly, another delicious dish and the beet and goat cheese, my least favorite because of the goat cheese, but it's my taste, also not ""beet-y"" enough for me. we had to order the bacon donut dessert and coffee ice cream. and it was my first time having bacon in my dessert, and now i just realized how much I've missed!! they gave us a cube of watermelon, tiny but sweet, and really just a great way to end the meal. we ended up being very full, paying ~34 a person, and for that experience, i think it was well worth it. that was last week, and I'm going back with more friends this week!!",5.0
"It was good but I dont think it was truly great. Many of the dishes seemed a bit to disparate - tons of different ingredients thrown together and not always working in total harmony. The dishes were properly cooked and served in a timely fashion, the drinks were outstanding and the service was good. I just think they reach a bit too high and dont let the signature ingredients speak for themselves as much as they should. Overall I liked it but I dont think its quite 4 stars, but Im glad I tried it and its definitely one of the better restaurants in the area.",3.0
Took the boyfriend here for our one year anniversary.I want to eat comfortably and not have to over dress like some place require you toRead about this tapas style place and had to goI was so happy that the tapas were a decent size unlike other tapa places and not as expensive. There is something for everyone on that menu.I will come here again! I'll recommend the scallop dish if they still have it so fresh and darn tasty. Had a great time thereMake sure you make a reservation. They fill up fast!Thank you!,5.0
