"Fast food at its best.  The selection of food here is simple and straight to the point.  What ever you see, you're bound to be in  for a treat.  They truly have the best chicken stew.  I always get it.  I love their rice with peas as well as the mac and cheese too.  Friendly staff and clean establishment!  Will return again and again.",5.0
"I had the pleasure of visiting Fisherman's Cove after shopping at Target. I do appreciate that this location is very large and spacious.I also love the fact that after paying for your food, you receive a ticket with a number and wait your turn until your food arrive.This restaurant isn't necessarily disorganized but they need more people to handle the food. There's one person making every customer's order while the other workers are standing around talking.Now to the food, my curry goat was slightly burnt. It was spicy but the gravy was rather thick and I believe the food was not fresh and had been sitting there for a few hours. The cabbage was okay. The plantains were over ripe. I really wish restaurants would stop serving over ripe plantains. I know the difference! Lol anyways, the rice and peas were pretty much standard and dry. The large plate was $9.50.I waited about ten minutes for my food. The macaroni and cheese was also very dried up. I think I'd order another dish from this location aside from the Jerk chicken as that's freshly grilled. Other than that, try another location instead or try coming when the food is just cooked (lunch time). I came in the evening. I will try their food again to give it another shot.",3.0
"I thought I had reviewed this place but I guess not. Afterall, I have been eating here for about 50 times in the past 3 months. Yeah, not good. Wait, SO GOOD. I strolled into this place one day and I ordered chicken but they gave me goat. I was not happy about that. I ate the goat anyways, that's when I accidently discovered how good it was. I dragged a friend with me to get lunch here. Let's just say, we've been here way too many times in the past couple of months. This location offers some breakfast options, which I have not tried yet but looks reasonably priced and just throwing it out there. Jerk Chicken - You get a whole leg and thigh. This is what I usually get when I eat at the premises. I ordered this to go once, about 1 hour away, it didn't taste as good. Don't do it. They usually offer hot sauce, jerk sauce, or BBQ sauce. I like mine with no sauce. Curry Chicken - My second option when I want chicken with some sauce. I've had my share of curry chicken in different types of cuisine and who doesn't love some curry chicken? Super tender and juicy! Curry Goat - very tender, and not tough at all. I thought I was going crazy but I tried it more than once, the curry goat is in fact way more spicier than the curry chicken. I'm a weakling when it comes to spice so I'm ready to cry whenever I crave for this deliciousness. It's worth tearing and sniffling over. Oxtail - I love oxtail in almost every way, let's just leave it at that. The sauce was more on the sweet side though, but who doesn't love some oxtail gravy? Stew Chicken - The way this chicken is prepared is quite similar to the oxtail. The sauce has sweeter notes. I love my Jerk chicken and curry chicken though so I've only had this once. I just have to mentioned that I love the over done cabbage. I shouldn't be eating too much cabbage or in fact too much of this but I can't help myself. The rice and peas might be too dry for some. I've haven't tried the plantains, mac and cheese, and other items I have not mentioned. All the chicken and goat is very tender and juicy and just falls right off the bone when you poke at it. They have great lunch specials starting at $5.50, so worth it. Usually a ""small"" (lunch special) will fill me up for lunch. The small comes is a nice portion with an option of one side (plantains or cabbage) and your choice or white rice or rice and peas. Medium comes with two sides and a nice hefty portion. My usual order: ""Jerk Chicken small, rice and peas, cabbage with oxtail gravy."" $5.50. (the oxtail gravy goes over the rice and peas to make it less dry) The service could really use some work but I can really understand when I see them dealing with some of these customers in there ... but hey, I wasn't a difficult customer, a smile or some manners would be nice.",4.0
Authentic Jerk chicken. A good amount of seats inside but I took it to go. Make sure to try the jerk sauce and barbecue sauce! Chicken was juicy and tender and fell right off the bone. Got a big plate of rice and beans and a lot of chicken for only $8 (medium). Definitely coming back if im around the area.,5.0
"Right when you get off the subway 2 line. Get off on the last station, Flatbush, right by Brooklyn College. It opens past 12. The line dies down of course late at night but the selection is fewer.I had a very memorable time in my early 20s in Jamaica, and had a life changing event happened during that period. So to me, anytime when I get to have Jamaican food, my heart skips a beat or two and I have flashback to when I was barely 22 and was set to become a diplomat's wife in Jamaica. Sometimes life is stranger than fiction. Decades later, and at the end of the day, the only thing we have left are memories, specifically, food memories. This place, for that reason, hit that memory spot. I'm interested in their salted fish and that was only available over breakfast. I opted to get curry goat. It's boney and good. Jerk chicken is super yummy. I think it's a very authentic experience in this part of neighborhood where it's filled with Western Indians. I liked my meal, and plan to come over in the morning to grab some salted fish for breakfast. $5.",4.0
"This place has earned its stars !!!!My new favorite spot because the Jerk chicken meal is a great bang for your buck ! When I tell you it is one of the best places to go for jerk chicken I mean it ! I got a medium meal that came with HUGE portion of chicken and three sides. I chose plantains, rice and beans, and cabbage. $8 and I couldn't even finish it !!! felt bad for my friend that got the large.The quantity is soooo awesome since the food itself is so flavorful. It is a fairly large place with lots of seating but it gets packed quick. Such an amazing deal for great food. It has to go on you to-try list!",5.0
"Want some really good jerk chicken? This is your spot!I've tasted lots of jerk chicken, fishermans cove wins!! Come here for the JERK CHICKEN! I mean the mac and cheese NOT WORTH IT! So dry and not gueey and cheesy just not worth it, WASTE OF MONEY. The sides that the jerk chicken comes with ie; cabbage and rice is bland (they give you so much of it)...but the jerk chicken is cooked on a grill fresh in front of you. They grill and cut it right in front of you. The man slams some jerk chicken  on the wooden cutting board and gets to chopping!! Its not overly spicy so you don't die of burning mouth or free cleansing of sinuses. Its like the perfect mixture of not overly spicy and still jerk chicken and so tender just so so tender. I added that jerk chicken sauce and it was amazing!!  The oxtail was very good just a bit chewy. Since it was my first experience with ox tail I'm not sure if that is usual.GO FOR THE JERK CHICKEN.",4.0
"While out near Flatbush Junction recently one rainy evening, I was fortunate enough to be famished and needing to eat before my commute from Brooklyn. My friend quickly walked me to Fisherman's Cove. Being a local resident of the neighborhood I had the upmost trust in my friend who definitely didn't disappoint.Man! The only thing I got, ...the jerk chicken, ...fantastic! Okay, now let me give you a play-by-play.Walked in, ...straight ahead.A few people were in line.Got behind them.Looked at the menu.Saw the medium jerk chicken.It was $8.50 (comes w/ two slices of bread).Ordered it!Got my numbered ticket.Turned around and went back near the entrance where the man was with the big knife and all the chicken spread out across the huge grill.Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!He slammed the knife down with authority into the chicken. He slid the chopped pieces into the container.A deep Jamaican accent called out the number on my ticket.I raised my hand.I walked forward.Deep Jamaican accent again, asked what type of sauce.I said half jerk, ...half bbq.Got container.Went to a seat on opposite side of restaurant.Told friend goodbye.Chucked up the deuces (made a peace sign with my fingers and threw said hand in the air to symbol to my friend good evening, peace, love, and soul).Sat my tail in the seat.Opened container holding the hot juicy chicken that smelled glorious.And the rest is history!I apologize for not being able to continue the story. I think I might have blanked out from ecstasy and have no idea what words to use in describing the rest. All I can say is, ""Good Stuff!""I do happen to recall snippets of the aftermath. A bare container sat in front of me with a bit of ravaged looking bones. They looked as if a savage had gotten ahold of them. (shrugs) I'm not sure what happened.",5.0
"The line here is usually waaaay too long so I don't even bother during the weekdays. It is especially crowded because Brooklyn College is around the corner so the lunch rush is NUTS. I see why though because the food is so damn good. It reminds me of my grandma's cooking as a kid which is a plus all the way. I don't really buy Jamaican food often because I can cook it myself but sometimes I need a break. Anyway on to the review...I don't remember what I had the first time but the last time I went I ordered Escovitch fish with rice and peas with stew fish gravy on top, and macaroni instead of salad for just $9.50. The menu is very small which is great because you won't be overwhelmed with options. Its basic Chicken or Fish with rice and peas and a choice of side. My server was nice and the line was short (I went near closing yuusssss). When I got home my box felt heavy and I realized that my server put two whole fish in it instead of one. Jackpot! I saved the second fish for my lunch the next day so I was a happy camper. The system they have going at Fisherman's Cove is also perfect because you order and they give you a number on your receipt to avoid confusion. I would recommend this place to anyone craving a good ol' Jamaican dinner. BTW for those who are not familiar our food is pretty damn heavy so be prepared to save half of it for the next day or split the meal with your friend haha.",5.0
Not the best jerk chicken. I've had better but it's not bad at all. The place is usually crowded so be prepared to wait a bit. The place is clean so that's a plus. I was expecting the jerk chicken to be hot but it's on the mild side so be sure to have them add alot of jerk sauce. If you're in the area I would say go for it but nothing to go crazy over.,4.0

The prices are pretty good, and they are NOT skimpy on the food! They ram it in the container for you! The place is most famous for their Jerk Chicken as you can smell it on Flatbush Ave and see it in the window. My only complaint about it, is that sometimes the Jerk Chicken is a bit dry.

"Succulent! Savory! Scrumptious! Divine! Euphoric!! Those are the adjectives to describe my eating experience at Fisherman's Cove.

The meat was extremely tender, juicy, and nicely seasoned (jerk chicken may be a bit spicy for some). Portion was abundant even if it was a small. And, the price is very decent.Every time I go visit Target, I always see the line out the door. And I always wondered if the food served there was that delicious.

"Amazing Food!   I've only tried the jerk chicken but it has to be the best that I've tasted.   Almost on an orgasmic level!  This location is an newly  expanded one from a few doors down and quite roomy.   Even though every equipment is new and the dining area is  fully renovated, it still seems as though something is missing cause, there are so much room and empty space behind the counter and kitchen.   Well no matter, cause it's all about the food.      The charred boiled Jerk Chicken is so tender and juicy, it's additive!  I've had it 3 times this week and it's consistently good.   The chicken comes in 3 sizes.    The lunch special at $5.50 comes in the smallest Styrofoam container imaginable and it comes with a 1/4 chicken and a side of choice.   It is not a good value  because of the portion.   The Meal, which I think gives you a 1/2 chicken and 2 sides.  ( did not have it)      The best option is the large chicken only size portion.     You get about a whole chicken chopped up in large pieces and drenched in the sauces of choice.  It seems to weigh about 2 lbs, I kid you not.      I put on the BBQ, Jerk sauce and the hot sauce.    Very very tasty and succulent!   Also at only $10 , this is the best value and will feed almost an entire family if you order the sides.     I had the rice and peas/beans which was very good and also the excellent side of salad.    The staff is always on point.   They looked exhausted, probably because of all the heavy business they are doing but they are always very helpful and friendly.   The casual manner they interact and serve customers is very good for the neighborhood.     They may need a different uniform because the company T-shirts does not make them look very professional.        The ambiance is always different depending on the time of the day you go. In the early hours and mid-day, the tables and chairs are filled with locals and students from BC enjoying their meal in the very casual setting.   But be careful after sundown.    The local trouble makers begin to hang out inside and sometime start trouble with the patrons or the staff.    The staff to their credit, don't take no Sh*t from them and lay down the law but I could see some trouble brewing down the line.        Overall, the highest praise for the food.   I'm glad they moved into the larger space, so us newbies can try out this exquisite restaurant without waiting an hour in line in their old location.",5.0

"This place is a small spot, a hole in the wall type of place.   I forgot how I heard about this place or what I heard about it but when I walked by, I notice a good amount of people were waiting in line for food.  I decided to go in after I stopped off for some coffee before heading home.   When I went in, there were about 8 or more people already waiting in line.   The space was really small.   There is a tiny table with maybe 2 chairs but I cant see anyone able to sit comfortably and enjoy their meal.  I ordered two medium jerk chicken meals, which were $7.50 each.  It came with rice and peas and I guess either a choice of cabbage or salad.   I chose cabbage.  They had other sides but I didn't know if you could substitute it or not.   They had mac and cheese, plantains and some kind of greens.   The chicken wasn't done cooking yet, I had to wait a few minutes for it to finish cooking, no problem.  (Oh yea, they have a grill to the front of the store, you can see through the window where the chicken is being cooked)I guess this small spot is a good place to get food.  There was a steady stream of people coming in to order food.   As soon as they finish serving a person, another person would come in.  The jerk chicken had a nice smokey flavor to it, the rice was just right but I would have preferred it just a tad bit softer.  I added the jerk sauce to one of the containers of chicken.  (I was afraid the sauce would have been too spicy for my sis-in-law's liking).  In my opinion, the chicken wasn't that spicy at all but most of the sauce had fallen to the bottom of the Styrofoam container.  I'm not a jerk chicken expert and it's not the same as the chicken that I got from a jerk hut in Jamaica, (Riu, Ocho Rios) but I will be returning to get jerk chicken or try any of the other items they have. Ie: curry goat.",4.0

In the early hours and mid-day, the tables and chairs are filled with locals and students from BC enjoying their meal in the very casual setting.   But be careful after sundown.    The local trouble makers begin to hang out inside and sometime start trouble with the patrons or the staff.    The staff to their credit, don't take no Sh*t from them and lay down the law but I could see some trouble brewing down the line.        Overall, the highest praise for the food.   I'm glad they moved into the larger space, so us newbies can try out this exquisite restaurant without waiting an hour in line in their old location.",5.0
Good food but staff needs more training on professionalism. They spend too much time talking and chatting amongst themselves and customers instead of doing the work. New place has much more room they need to make better use of the space. Potential for excellence if they tighten up,3.0
"This place is a small spot, a hole in the wall type of place.   I forgot how I heard about this place or what I heard about it but when I walked by, I notice a good amount of people were waiting in line for food.  I decided to go in after I stopped off for some coffee before heading home.   When I went in, there were about 8 or more people already waiting in line.   The space was really small.   There is a tiny table with maybe 2 chairs but I cant see anyone able to sit comfortably and enjoy their meal.  I ordered two medium jerk chicken meals, which were $7.50 each.  It came with rice and peas and I guess either a choice of cabbage or salad.   I chose cabbage.  They had other sides but I didn't know if you could substitute it or not.   They had mac and cheese, plantains and some kind of greens.   The chicken wasn't done cooking yet, I had to wait a few minutes for it to finish cooking, no problem.  (Oh yea, they have a grill to the front of the store, you can see through the window where the chicken is being cooked)I guess this small spot is a good place to get food.  There was a steady stream of people coming in to order food.   As soon as they finish serving a person, another person would come in.  The jerk chicken had a nice smokey flavor to it, the rice was just right but I would have preferred it just a tad bit softer.  I added the jerk sauce to one of the containers of chicken.  (I was afraid the sauce would have been too spicy for my sis-in-law's liking).  In my opinion, the chicken wasn't that spicy at all but most of the sauce had fallen to the bottom of the Styrofoam container.  I'm not a jerk chicken expert and it's not the same as the chicken that I got from a jerk hut in Jamaica, (Riu, Ocho Rios) but I will be returning to get jerk chicken or try any of the other items they have. Ie: curry goat.",4.0
Food is good customer service is terrible and they always seem disorganized.  No type of service system what so ever. No proper managerial direction. Everyone seems like there in their own world. The employees act like you're doing them a favor. And you wait forever. Sad.,2.0
"Everything in this place is delish, higly recommend. My 3 favortie dishes are jerk chicken, oxtail and stewed fish. Thenfood jslust melts in your mouth. However the service needs to be improved, i understand its island food but in New York we are not on Island time -)",5.0
"Way better then the one on Newkirk! Their set up is a good idea. You order and pay first, then wait on line. The line is a little long which is expected although it goes pretty fast. The food is great!!",5.0
"I love this place and only wish there were more locations, particularly in the Bronx. I went here  one day before going to Riis Beach and I'm so glad I did. For just $5 I got Jerk Chicken and a side of Plantain, which was a pretty decent size. The Jerk chicken was cooked well and had just the right amount of spice. I will definitely recommend it if you're looking for cheap Caribbean food and look forward to trying out other things on the menu whenever I'm back in Brooklyn!",5.0
Best Caribbean food in the area.  That is saying a lot because the area is the capital of Caribbean food.  Sort of pricey for a large order but it's packed tight with yummy food!,5.0
"This place has some of the best jerk chicken in Flatbush. Usually people make the jerk with too much spice and it overpowers the food, this place has the right balance between hot and flavored. Very well done. Only setback is the lengthy wait during rush hour...and being that it's right next to the train it makes matters worse.Oxtail is good too and they accept cards so you know in happy. Sidenote, when you walk in be sure to ask who ordered. People tend to hover while waiting for their food and they hover on the wall -_-.",4.0

"It's always crowded here with long lines during lunch time because of their lunch special. When you see a restaurant with a lot of people, you know their food must be good! As soon as you open the doors, it smells like beautiful meaty goodness! Despite that, I stayed like plain Jane and ordered a side order of Mac and cheese (it was huge and made me really full). The cheese is not consistent through the macaroni. There are some parts that are extra cheesy and others that have no hints of cheese whatsoever. But, somehow it all evened out in my mouth lol. I give this place 4 stars because I will be returning - they have good food, a clean restaurant, a good reputation and Fisherman's Cove is such a catchy name, so why not?! :))",4.0
Had lunch. Sugary taste. Nothing special and pricy. I went there because of low grade lines but don't know why.,2.0
"I ordered food Friday after leaving a doctor's appointment at 1130 I grabbed this on my way to work.  I ordered oxtails and rice and peas, cabbage. The oxtails were the toughest I've had in my life. The rice was good, cabbage could have been cooked down more, and plantains weren't sweet enough. I most likely won't be coming back here, pissed that I was to far not to take this right back where it came from",1.0
"I wish I could feel the same love and rapture everyone else has when it comes to this place. I tried them before out of curiosity and it was nothing special so when they bought out the space on Nostrand that Popeyes had once occupied (to my disgust and anger but that's another story for another day) I figured I'd try them again. Now Flatbush is rife with Caribbean food, curry and jerk chicken but I figured as this place ALWAYS seems to have a crowd there must be something good about it.  Don't let the crowd throw you off course, the food is prepared very quickly. Simply order it then go down the other end of the store to pick it up and the staff seems efficient so no qualms there. I spent about $16 bucks for some Jerk Chicken and Curry Goat and was able to pay with my card.  I was given a nice amount of jerk chicken but boy was I disappointed. For one, I saw the young man pour jerk sauce on my chicken but my chicken while moist, didn't have much flavor & definitely lacked any jerk or spice to it. Then the peas and rice it came with needed salt and was simply dry.  Just like my previous experience with their chicken there was NOTHING memorable or special about it.  Moved on to  my goat curry.........nothing to see there either. It was typical and didn't leave any lasting impression. This place in my opinion has a lot of hype but I will never understand why especially with so many other similar food spots in the area. For delicious curry and spicy jerk chicken I will always go to MC Beans Restaurant which is about 2 blocks away; their food is something I always have a hankering for.",3.0
Well the food was good a medium size will feed 2 people. Both times I went it wasn't too crowded. The service was fast and the workers are nice. Not full blown smile nice but cordial. Will go back again after class whenever I'm craving comfort food,4.0

The staff was awful not welcoming and the restaurant lacks signs and direction so for a person visiting  for the first time you are completely lost and on your own! The cashier was unaware of the use of open ended questions to aid in pleasing customers ; and as a tool to inform customer what they have as to give choices! They all had terrible attitude and that alone made the food hard to digest! Ugly character In a person affect what ever they produce I didn't enjoy the oxtail it was pure fat and the rice and peas was dried out overall a failed attempt at  an edible lunch!

Great food especially the curry goat however this place is best known for their jerk chicken.
