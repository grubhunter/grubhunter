"The food and service was amazing! We started with the oysters, which were one of the freshest and delicious oysters we've had, we ended up ordering a few more of these once we tried the first batch. My husband had the fried chicken with mash potatoes and kale salad - absolutely devine! I had the lamb shank with polenta and an array of vegetables, very tender and delicious. To top it off the pinot noir suggestion was one of the best, crisp, light wines (as we prefer) we've had of pinot noir. The only downside was I was famished and the portions are a bit on the smaller side. All in all definitely worth a try at this quaint, cozy restaurant.",5.0
"Delicious food and awesome service! I came here for brunch today and although they said they weren't taking reservations, they still held a table over the phone for my dad and I since we would be there soon anyway. It's a cute spot right in the heart of Park Slope. We started with kiwi mimosas - I've never heard of such a thing - and they were amazing! We each got a $2 scone to start, which were delicious. I ordered the eggs florentine with the hollandaise on the side. When I received it, there was hollandaise sauce on it. Although I was going to suck it up and just eat it anyway, the waitress reassured me that it was not a problem and my correct order would be out soon. In less than 5 minutes, I had the correct order. It was fantastic!! The yucca fries are great too. I was really happy with the service already, but a few minutes later, the waitress brought out a free dessert for us to apologize for the inconvenience! I was so happy. They didn't have to do that and it was such a kind gesture. I've never had something like it either, it seemed like a meringue shell with whipped cream in the center and topped with fruit. So good!Needless to say, I will be returning!",5.0
"On a rare Saturday when neither the man nor I were working we decided to check this place out for brunch. We called ahead & were told there was no wait, score or red flag, not sure. Brunch is cash only, major . Decor is really cute & quaint, no wait time was true. Food:-scone: very small but delicious, homemade jam was great-eggs Benedict/eggs florentine: eggs were good but I thought l the hollandaise was a bit to mayoy, the potato hash was kinda burnt. I got the ""fries"" instead of the hash but really they were baked potato wedges, not into it. -pork sliders: the bc said they were amazing, so good in fact that he had one before his eggs & another one after the eggs for dessertThe brunch was kinda underwhelming overall. Atmosphere is cute though & I would probably see what they offer for dinner before making my final decision on this place.",3.0
"Kiwiana is very artful with their plating. We started with a watermelon salad with featured five rectangular prisms of watermelon stacked on top of each other like logs and sprinkled with feta cheese, edamame beans, mint leaves, and ground black pepper. It was presented nice, but there wasn't anything impressive about the tastes.We also had the whitebait latkes which came with grilled lime and tartar sauce. I'm not entirely sure why the lime was grilled. It didn't add a char flavor. The latkes were were more like deep fried patties than traditional latkes; there was much more breading.Lastly, we had fettuccini with a beet sauce for dinner. I like the creaminess of the sauce yet it was much lighter than typical white sauce like alfredo. All in all, I liked the artisanal presentation, but I wasn't impressed by how flavor was developed in the dishes.",3.0
This place is awesome. I love how they incorporate spices into their breakfast dishes. This totally beats regular brunch/breakfast spots. CASH ONLY! Here's what to get:1) Scones - $2 each (nice way to start your meal)2) Chai-spiced french toast - a nice twist to your french toast (comes with 2)3) Potato hash - can I get the recipe for this so I can make it every morning? I usually don't eat any type of potatoes that come with my breakfast but my is this amazing. Must try for sure!I'll definitely be back here.,4.0
"Unexpectedly good late night dinner. We had kind of crashed early evening after a long day of drinking and activities, so we were hungry and just looking for a good meal. Kiwiana delivered that and more.The restaurant was mostly empty by the time we got there, and it was a nice, cozy space, great for a date. It's hard to categorize the cuisine. Supposedly the food is New Zealand-inspired, but it seems very diverse. We ordered a scallop ceviche dish that was a special that evening. It came nicely presented in a scallop shell and was garnished with a lot of garlic and a juice that I couldn't identify. It was kind of tangy, sweet, but also salty and altogether delicious.For the mains, we were considering the lamb and the burger, but our server kept telling us how huge the lamb dish was and it could easily be shared, so we thought it might be too much food and nixed the burger and got the beet and pecorino fettuccine instead.Just FYI - the lamb is NOT too much food. We could have managed the burger, which looked great. Although if we had, we wouldn't have even considered the pasta, which was absolutely wonderful. It's actually fettuccine made out of beets - not just a sauce like the menu says. The slightly sweet, chewy texture of the pasta combined with the creamy beet and pecorino sauce and toasted pine nuts was fantastic, plus it made for a very pretty dish. The lamb was also delicious, with Moroccan spices and rice and yogurt and little toasted cheese balls. We finished with the lemon and poppy seed panna cotta, which was good but nothing special. Service was great throughout the entire evening as well. Overall a great place and we'll be back and try the burger (Well, maybe. I still want more of that fettuccine.)",5.0
Probably one of the worst burgers I've had all year and by far the worst fries I can remember. It was literally a potato cut into fourths. Service was friendly.,2.0
"Let me tell you something about Kiwiana. It was the first business I ever bookmarked on Yelp. Unfortunately, it just kind of fell down my list of to-do's, and it took about 4 years to make my way over. But yes, it was worth the wait.Started out with the scallop ceviche (served in a scallop shell), which was incredibly fresh even though we were maybe their last table of the night.Followed it up with the beet pasta and the rack of lamb. The beet pasta was actually made from beets, and not just pasta with beets mixed in. This gave the pasta a sweet taste, and it was a nice light dish. The lamb was decided not light, but was cooked perfectly medium rare over rice pilaf and a great yogurt sauce with goat cheese balls. Great for sharing.Finished off with the lemon poppy seed panna cotta, which was a nice tart dessert to close out the night. Probably not everyone's cup of tea if you have a severe sweet tooth.All in all, I really enjoyed Kiwiana, and wish it didn't take me so long to get there!",5.0

"My friend and I came here after spending a day in Prospect Park. We were hungry and just looking for something to eat, and I'm so glad we decided to go here! First off, the decor is cute. There are plants all around, and there are even fresh flowers on the tables. The tables may be close together, but I didn't feel that I was on top of anyone. We were able to be seated pretty quickly, and it didn't take long for us to get out $7 glasses of prosecco and appetizer. The food? SO GOOD- Yuca Tots: I wish they were just a little crispier, but the inside was so tasty and smooth. It came with 3 sauces, one of them involving bacon! - Horopito Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Kale Slaw and Garlic Mashed Potatoes: it came with a drumstick and 2 large pieces of chicken that were fried to perfection. The meat was still super moist and juicy. Tasted even better with the truffled honey! I loved the mashed potatoes and even though I don't typically like salads, the slaw was just what I needed to lighten the dish - I only had one of the pieces of lamb, but it was cooked properly and super flavorful Service was also solid! They checked on us at the beginning of our meal, were friendly, refilled our water before it was empty. I appreciate them giving us plates and utensils and clearing the table at appropriate times. They were able to anticipate our needs, and did not take too long when we were paying our bill.",5.0
"If I come back here, I don't think it will be for brunch, but rather dinner. The service is very strange, not in a bad way, but it's weird because everyone is helping every table and also everyone is doubling as a hostess but then there are some people that just stand in the background. There was a point where I was clearly looking around for our server, or any server, for that matter, and the ones that weren't busy were just kinda standing there. Their brunch menu is very limited, especially for vegetarians. I got the poached eggs veggie dish - eggs were a little watery tasting. Oh also - their freshly squeezed OJ will be mostly served in a cup of ice. Would you like some OJ with your ice?",3.0
"I remember Kiwiana fondly for two things:1. Their cheese board with ANZAC biscuits. This appetizer was unexpectedly the best part of our meal. There were cheddar, jack, and blue cheeses, accompanied by toast, the lovely oatmeal-cookie-like ANZAC biscuits, blood orange marmalade, and ricotta with cashews. The ANZAC biscuits were delicious and I still think about them. If I had an ounce of baking skill I would attempt to recreate them, but instead I dream and scheme to go back. Every other accompaniment went with the cheese perfectly. This is a must-try.2. Outdoor seating on a sunny day. Beautiful way to spend your afternoon in Park Slope.As for dinner entrees, they were passable. My husband's Kiwi burger was less than he hoped for: the meat didn't seem well seasoned and the fried egg didn't add much. I liked my buttermilk fried chicken, and the honey went well with it, but it didn't blow me away. The kale seemed more of an afterthought. In any case, the cheese board, convenient location and nice outdoor seating was enough to convince me to come back and try the ribs. Or the brunch. Or a plateful of those delectable ANZAC biscuits.",4.0

"Stopped by here for brunch w my sister. We tried the oysters, pulled pork w poached eggs and the smoked salmon w asparagus. We thought the smoked salmon was gonna be the lox kind but it was an actual salmon thats seared. Tasty tho and paired nicely w asparagus. The pulled pork was very tender and moist. No complaints abt the food. Service was decent as this couldve been they were workin w a baby shower party indoors. We had to ask several waiters/waitress for things before we got it. Hopefully this was jus on a rare occasion. Btw, wkend brunch is cash only! Will visit again!",4.0
"Celebrating my first birthday since having a kid, I was looking for a place that was (a) in our neighborhood, (b) good for groups/took reservations, and (c) welcoming to kids. I found all that, PLUS delicious food and an incredibly nice and helpful chef/owner in Kiwiana! I had originally made a reservation for a party of 10 but the guest list fluctuated a number of times and Chef Mark was patient and accommodating. Since the party was so large, he asked if we could go to a prix fixe menu which I appreciated because it made everything easier and more streamlined. He even included an unlimited (nonalcoholic) drink option of fresh juices, teas, and coffees that was a huge hit. On the day of the brunch I was delighted to see he'd even made personalized menus for our party.Everyone had a wonderful time at the simple, classy brunch. We had about 3 of the servers devoted to our table (we took up ~30% of the restaurant!) and they were all great. Highly recommend this place!",5.0
"I held a bridal shower for my friend here. Mark was very helpful with the menu and changed it according to our needs. We wanted a more brunch-y menu and he was able to accommodate us. He told us the price per person would be $25. And I'm not sure if he over charged me in the end bc when one of the server gave me the receipt in the end, he told me $30 per person and I had to tell him, no, Mark said its $25. Then he said okay it's $25 but I don't think he went back to correct the receipt. But I'm thinking, it's an extra $5 per person, if they wanted unlimited non alcoholic beverages but not everyone ordered seconds. So shouldn't only certain guests be $30 cuz of the unlimited drinks instead of everyone?The whole group and I didn't like how the two workers were standing downstairs in the wine cellar staring at us the whole time. We were an hour early to decorate and they were standing there watching us decorate. This made us very uncomfortable. The food was really good. I love the yucca tater tots. They were my favorite. And that was the only item that stood out. The place was very nice and big and Mark had no problem with us having only ten guest. I would definitely recommend this place to others for baby shower, celebrations, birthdays and bridal parties etc. Minus one star for the workers who were downstairs the whole time staring at us!",4.0
Kiwiana is an incredible dining experience where you can taste New Zealand cuisine in its full glory. It's a cute and cozy restaurant that's great for a group of friends or a date. The cocktails were expertly crafted. The farmer's daughter is a nice concoction as well as the Kiwitini. The nice wine selection has a lot from the Australia region.The chilled corn and crab soup with pop corn and chili were a nice way to start.Food wise my top pick was the smoked and pickled mussels. By itself it's already good but combined with the butter and bread it becomes mind blowing -- it's unlike any other seafood dish I've ever had. The lamb was perfectly prepared -- tender and well seasoned. The yuca tater tots were nice -- a more starchy and flavorful version of American tater tots.The ribs were also tasty and had an interesting combination of manuka and marmite which came out surprisingly well. The service was top notch -- friendly and fast. I'd come back here again in a heartbeat.,5.0

"Sometimes you can appreciate simplicity. Sometimes you can appreciate complexity. The brunch at Kiwiana is a perfect demonstration of how to elevate simplicity to complexity without overdoing it. My boyfriend had the kiwi burger with a sunny side up egg, pineapple, beetroot and arugula with hand cut fries. The flavor of a simple burger was perfectly accompanied and balanced by richness of the running egg yolk, sweetness of the thin pineapple slice, earthiness of the beetroot and slight bitterness of the arugula. The hand cut fries were potato wedges which is how we like it. The highlight of the whole dish was the condiment. The mayonnaise that came with meal was no ordinary mayo. It was bacon infused with a hint of herbs that resemble pepper and rosemary (our bold guess). It was so good that my boyfriend asked for seconds and the server was super accommodating. I got the Fry Up which includes eggs any style (I had it sunny side up), bacon, sausage, toast, roasted tomato and potato hash. It reminded me of a full english breakfast without the baked beans and mushrooms. It might seem like a just large plate of breakfast food; however, all the components are paired up seamlessly for me. The eggs with toast. The bacon with tomato. The sausage with potato hash. The block of potato hash was my favorite. It was crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. You can also taste a splash of cumin in the seasoning which is quite unique. The service was ok but the ambiance and decor was refreshing. Daisy on the wooden table and plants hanging from ceiling. The whole space is cozy. Cash only for brunch and I can't wait to go back and try their dinner.",5.0

Fresh ingredients and the veggies were bursting with flavor especially the string beans and corn. Tasted like it was straight from the farm. Wonderful bratwurst that had a nice crisp and spice to it. Go for the scone as well. Fresh butter and buttery soft scone texture. The cherry compote accompanied it well. I'll be back again.,4.0

Brunch is cash only!Also, there are no ridiculous lines or waits, which is really weird since this place is really good. Also not super crowded or loud so you can actually carry a conversation.",5.0
"Came for an early dinner on a Tuesday afternoon around 5:30pm. It was empty so we just sat anywhere we wanted. My friends and I ordered 2 tater tots, latkes, and edamame to share. For what it is, it's really expensive. The latkes is 10+ and only comes with 4 TINY pieces. The tater tots were small too but ""fancier"" than regular tots. I ordered the ribs for my entree. They were so soft and fell off the bone. My friends ordered the fried chicken and didn't really like it. They said the batter was kinda weird. They couldn't put their finger on it but didn't like it. The chicken also came with a kale salad which I got to try and that was good. It tasted like a pickle, soury.  Overall, I give dinner 4 stars because service was good and they didn't mind that we were loud.",4.0

"While the food was good, the staff was incredibly not baby friendly for the first 45 minutes of the experience. Finally they came around. No high chairs, no stroller around anywhere...this is park slope for brunch people.",3.0
"We took some out of town family here for dinner. Their beer and wine selection is fantastic and featured a couple New Zealand beers I didn't recognize but definitely enjoyed trying. The food is amazing. We each got a different meat dish (pork, lamb, beef) and all were absolutely delicious. There is no questioning the talent of this chef and his crew. If you can, save room for dessert because each of them will only further affirm how delightful this place is.The atmosphere is low-key and calming. We arrived at 7, shortly before the rush and it was quiet and intimate. Even when the restaurant is packed full later on, it doesn't interfere with the experience.Overall, nothing short of exceptional and I wish I could eat here every day.",5.0

"Stopped in for a bite with a gal pal on the evening of 11/9/15 - we started with the steamed edamame with kelp salt, both had the burger and a cocktail:  I had the Clear Conscience (a gin-based drink with a lovely hibiscus flavor), and my pal had the Cheap Date (a bourbon-based drink that was warm and a little spicy).  Everything was delicious, and the service was great.  I'll return for brunch at some point.",5.0
"It was nearly impossible to find a place in Park Slope for brunch without more than an hour's wait! We settled on coming here on a freezing Sunday. It was packed and 6 of us had to squeeze onto two tables but we were just glad to be indoors. Our waiter was very nice and kept coming to check up on us and was able to expand our area to include another table later on.We were given warm, fresh scones with butter and blueberry jam on the house which was so nice of them! They were delicious! I ordered the Kiwi burger... Served on a wooden plank thing with a fried egg on top and potato wedges. The burger was good, the bun was nice and buttery..though I missed the pineapple. There was definitely a beet in there. It was cooked just as I asked and it was quite good. My boyfriend had the steak and eggs. There was a lot of fat on the steak but it was a decent size, but the toast the eggs were sitting on was almost burnt black! But overall a nice restaurant for brunch.",3.0
"This is such a cute little restaurant in the heart of Park slope. I've never had New Zealand cuisine before and was super excited to try it. We started off with the heirloom tomatoes with feta and a chilled corn soup with crab and popcorn. Both were amazing! The tomatoes were so fresh and the soup was very smooth and creamy and the corn and popcorn added a great bite. For our entrees, we ordered the duo of lamb, the braised spare ribs and the beet infused fettucini. I'm not a lamb person b/c I don't like the gamey-ness but my friend said it was very good. I'm normally not a fan of beet but I had the fettucini and it wasn't too bad. My ribs were falling off the bone, delicious!! I barely had to touch it with my fork and the meat just fell right off. It was also flavored wonderfully. This is definitely a great dinner place. And Plus, there's a plethora of fabulous dessert places in the neighborhood as well.",4.0

I ain't about dat waiting in lines lyfe.Restaurant is spacious and comfortable. We sat right by the window and had a pretty view of the quiet park slope brownstone streets.The food was amazing here. The spare ribs were definitely one of the best I ever had - incredibly tender, falls right off the bone, and very flavorful.My boyfriend had the lamb chops and those were also amazing. The spices were perfect.For the appetizer we had dates with feta cheese.  It was good, but not sure the value was there.For dessert we had something called pavlova the waitress explained it very well - it had the consistency of a meringue.

I came here last night for a private dinner holiday party. The decor is so relaxing but the place is literally the size of my living room. The staff there were awesome and very attentive. And chefs ! Kudos to all of them. Now the food - HALLELUJAH- ! I had the vegan 'Jerusalem Artichoke Soup' for a starter and the salmon with roasted  cauliflower and leeks dill in buttermilk sauce for my main dish . My mouth is watering while writing this. I never had vegan anything in my life and that soup was on point! For desert I had a pumpkin spice with caramel glaze cake and a side of Breyers ice cream (yall ain't low with the Bryers ice cream) lololOverall an excellent restaurant - definitely try it out!,4.0
"My husband and I have been here a couple of times, and the food and service were always great. So we decided to celebrate his birthday at Kiwiana this year. I gotta say, this was the best birthday (food-wise) he'd ever had. I called two days prior to make a reservation, not having my hopes up since it also happened to be Valentine's Day. Chef Simmons picked up the phone, and told me that he was in a meeting at that moment, but he was pretty sure he could arrange something for us in the wine cellar. He took down my information, and e-mailed me a few hours later with the photo of the cellar, and a confirmation on availability. He answered all my questions (with great sense of humor, too), and took down my husband's name to put on the menu. The day of, we arrived a few minutes late, and were promptly directly to the basement wine cellar. Our lovely waitress let us know that this was a recent addition to the restaurant, and it really looked like it. It's very modern, and cozy at the same time. There's a large restroom on the same floor, which is a huge plus. At the end of the night I was even more glad that we ended up in the wine cellar because it was very quaint, and our toddlers could run amok without disturbing other diners.  I ordered a couple of starters, while we waited for the rest of the party to arrive. We got yuka tater tots with bacon aioli (they were gone pretty quickly), green leaf salad with cashews and blueberries (unique and delicious), and baby beets with ricotta (beautifully plated). By then everyone was already there, and seated. Our waitress took down our drink orders, appetizers, and one picky eater's order (Kiwi burger without any toppings. Was still rated ""good"" by said picky eater). I got pickled green lip mussels, which I've never had before. They were so good, and the portion size was enough to share between 3 people. It same with toast and butter. We then asked for more toast because it was so good that our 2 toddlers ate most of it. For main course I got baby back ribs, which were so tenter, they were almost falling off the bone. The manuka and marmite glaze was not overly sweet, and complemented the pork perfectly. I also got a taste of my husband's salmon. Hands-down the best salmon I've ever had. It was perfectly crispy on the outside, yet juicy and tender on the inside. I was told the lamb was amazing too. And I believe it because it was gone within minutes. For dessert I got bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream, which was sweet enough to de a desire, but not overly sweet. My husband and a few others ordered the rice pudding, which was actually a possibly poached pear on top of a little bit of rice pudding.We though there's more pudding inside the pear, but it was just an empty pear. I think they should probably change the name of the dessert to something more fitting. This is the only thing that was a little ""off"" that night. Last, but not least, the service was stellar. Our waitress, whose name I forgot (sorry! it's the Russian girl), was very patient with us (and two toddlers running around), and answered all of our questions. She even got me a name of the bakery where they order their bread, and explained some items on the menu in our native tongue. So thank you, Kiwiana for making my husband's birthday special! We'll be visiting more, and so will our very-impressed friends!",5.0

The combination of flavors just worked really well together! The lamb chops were also really delicious, so were the tater tots and green salad with blueberries and peanuts. Great coffee and very good dessert. We tried the Pavlova dessert witch was a very light. Easy on the stomach, delicious to the taste and very pretty to look at.

"I was excited to try Kiwiana after months of saying ""We should try that place!"". Unfortunately I left underwhelmed by the appetizers and main course. The New Zealand inspiration was not as clear on the menu as I'd hoped, and the flavors echoed that. The picked muscles and yuca tots both needed some flavors and/or textures to kick it up a notch.

The whitebait latkes were small but good. I didn't like the baby back ribs. It was something about the flavor that was off putting.

"My boyfriend and I were trying to find a place to eat while checking out some open houses in the area.  If he was going to buy in the neighborhood, you should get a feel for what's good and what could be come your go to spot.  Unfortunately this won't be it.  We came in around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and while the place isn't big there were plenty of seats.  We sat down right away.  The server came over and greeted us and brought us water.  Fantastic, things are going great.  We needed a minute and when she finally came back we ordered.  My boyfriend ordered a salad (the dressing was great) and a garden omelet.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The food came out rather quickly.  His eggs looked fake and he said his omelet had no taste.  He did like the amount of spinach that was given.  The brioche bun that my eggs were on were delicious.  The hollandaise sauce, way too lemony.  The potatoes were also bland.  I'm not someone who over seasons or salts their food, but I needed something on these bad boys.  We also ran out of water and we were never checked on again.  We were quickly finished and we were just sitting there.  We hadn't picked up our forks in a solid 10 - 15 minutes and no one came to take our dishes away.  Finally when the bus boy came over we asked for our check.  It came we paid and left.  As we walked out the door we said ""well I guess we won't be going back there.""It was fine, nothing terrible, maybe it was an off day, but the food was bland and the service was mediocre at best.",2.0

"Such a pleasant surprise! Kiwiana has comfortably settled into one of those all-too-ubiquitous ""cursed"" Park Slope storefronts. Unlike previous businesses at this address, they've been thriving over the past 2 years, for good reason. Prices are average, but the lovely casual meal would make you feel like this is what paychecks are for.The interior is like a warm bistro that's grown up and mellowed out a little (I can't see them in Williamsburg, for example). Our server was excellent, had tons of explanations and recommendations, and clearly knew the menu inside and out. Toward 8pm on a Saturday the small dining room had become crowded, so he had his attention divided, but still our group of 5 was totally taken care of. The concise menu is familiar, with a bit of quirk:- Fiddlehead and fingerling potato app (off-menu special): Amazing. I usually hate dill, but loved it in conjunction with the smokiness of the potatoes. The fiddleheads were fatter than I've ever seen and cooked so they still retained a little crunch. I feel like an asshole chiming in to the fiddlehead fern frenzy (and it's ramp season soon, oy), but this plate is enough to make any vegetable lover swoon.- Atlantic salmon: The best piece of salmon I've ever had at a non-Japanese restaurant. Well-salted, gently seared outside, ridiculously velvety inside, cooked to a perfect medium at my request. Sat on a creamy mix of pickled vegetables.- Kiwi burger: A more inspired spin than usual on the common burger, with a fried egg on top and pineapple/beet tucked beneath the burger patty. Served on a wooden board for that extra carnivorous feel, with hand-cut potato wedges and whole grain mustard/bacon aioli. All delicious.The desserts were great also - get the pavlova!! This graceful meringue with an exterior as crisp as paper fully lives up to its eponym, the Russian prima ballerina (FYI, it's not a Russian dessert but a thoroughly New Zealand one). Both the date cake and pecan cake were pleasant ends to a meal, but it'll be awhile before I have pavlova that delightful again.Many of their ingredients (especially spices) are imported from New Zealand. I'm not sure that's great for either global petroleum reserves or Kiwiana's bottom line, but dang it makes for good eating. They have a long list of (bottled) NZ beers and wines, as well. These touches of the chef's* homeland make the restaurant name perfect - there's Kiwiana all throughout the menu.

"Being Aussies expats, we were excited to see a burger on the menu of a kiwi restaurant that has pineapple and beetroot. So, the burger comes out and my husband noticed there were no pineapple, went to look for the waitress (as we were sitting outside and they don't come out to check on us once they put our food down), she said she'll bring the pineapple out on a side plate...ok...she then comes back out and said they are out of pineapple!? How can you be out of pineapple?! And did you just serve a dish without a key ingredient, hoping your customers won't notice?! Very disappointing service! Oh and despite some apologies, we got billed the full amount while the table next to us got complimentary scones, just because...not coming back!!!",2.0

"A belated post, with the best of intentions.  I went to this event that was held in a retail store(don't recall what it was for), and they happened to be serving these divine hors d'oeuvres and amazingly delicious kiwi cocktails.  I took note of this restaurant with the intention of dining there.  Fast forward to a year later, and I'm planning a surprise engagement/wedding send-off brunch for my best friend and her husband.  I immediately recall that September night where I had filed Kiwiana into my foodie brain, and contacted the chef, Mr. Mark Simmons. After some email correspondence, I worked out the date, pre-fixe price per head and custom menu(including unlimited drinks) for our party of close to 30.  Since it is a small space, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves for the duration of the event. The staff was so helpful and generous with the time we spent there; I was thoroughly impressed. The scrumptious scones and the ribs were a delicious hit, as were the kiwi cocktails.  We were never rushed out; plenty of time was given to our guests of honor for mingling and creating memories.  When they ran out of the kiwi mimosas, they offered up regular ones down to the very last minute.  The chef came out to greet us afterwards which added a more personal touch.

This is a GREAT restaurant! Great find in Park slope! Super cute inside and cozy and just lovely. Incredibly friendly wait staff. My husband got the burger with a friend egg on top and loved it and I got the roasted beet fettuccine. It was incredible.

"My boyfriend and I were trying to find a place to eat while checking out some open houses in the area.  If he was going to buy in the neighborhood, you should get a feel for what's good and what could be come your go to spot.  Unfortunately this won't be it.  We came in around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and while the place isn't big there were plenty of seats.  We sat down right away.  The server came over and greeted us and brought us water.  Fantastic, things are going great.  We needed a minute and when she finally came back we ordered.  My boyfriend ordered a salad (the dressing was great) and a garden omelet.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The food came out rather quickly.  His eggs looked fake and he said his omelet had no taste.  He did like the amount of spinach that was given.  The brioche bun that my eggs were on were delicious.  The hollandaise sauce, way too lemony.  The potatoes were also bland.  I'm not someone who over seasons or salts their food, but I needed something on these bad boys.  We also ran out of water and we were never checked on again.  We were quickly finished and we were just sitting there.  We hadn't picked up our forks in a solid 10 - 15 minutes and no one came to take our dishes away.  Finally when the bus boy came over we asked for our check.  It came we paid and left.  As we walked out the door we said ""well I guess we won't be going back there.""It was fine, nothing terrible, maybe it was an off day, but the food was bland and the service was mediocre at best.",2.0
"Solid 4-star place. I have now been for both brunch and dinner, and while brunch was nice, the dinner experience was much more memorable for me. The fresh scones were the only standout item we ordered for brunch, everything was standard/expected fare. For dinner, the standouts were the yuca tots and bacon aioli (GUH, so good!), baby beet salad, as well as the fried chicken and baby back ribs. Beyond the food, the atmosphere was really nice and intimate, and the service was top-notch.",4.0
"Such a pleasant surprise! Kiwiana has comfortably settled into one of those all-too-ubiquitous ""cursed"" Park Slope storefronts.

Everything surpassed my expectations.We got there around 12:30 and were able to sit down right away. They manage to fit quite a bit of seating in. Some of the tables are a little close to one another, but that's Brooklyn. It was comfortable and bright, with a small vase of flowers on the table.I ordered the chai spiced french toast and a side of bacon. The bacon was perfectly cooked and really tasty and the chai added a new flavor to the french toast that grew on me over the coarse of eating it. Mix in a little whipped cream and berries, which come with it, and it's delightful. Boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles and was in heaven. (No sooner did he say he was a little disappointed that they had no waffles on the menu than we overheard the waitress mention this special and his face lit up.) I got a few tastes and I could see why. The chicken was flavored well and the combination of sweet and salty with the maple syrup is just great. The waffle was fluffy and soft, which is just how I like it. It comes with the equivalent of about half a waffle, which I think was good portion-wise, but I could see others wanting a little more. All around, though, no complaints.Service was impeccable. Everyone was incredibly friendly and we weren't rushed or held up waiting.

"I ate at Kiwiana for the first time during a recent business trip to NYC. From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted warmly by the staff. The dining room is lovely - with original tin ceilings and lots of greenery (hard to believe that Park Slope is right outside the front door). The menu posed a few challenges - because I wanted to try everything! I finally opted for ($1!) oysters followed by the 'Lamb two ways with minted peas and couscous'. The oysters were incredibly fresh and delicious and the lamb was beautifully paired with the peas. I tried the lamb chop first. It was perfectly medium rare and well seasoned. The braised lamb medallion was 'melt in your mouth' delicious. Despite my protestations, we ordered two deserts for the table: poppyseed pannacotta and the pavlova. Both were fresh, delicious and great to share.Chef Mark stopped by during dinner to greet us and ask for our thoughts. We also talked about Rugby (my son is a Rugby player in CA)!  The staff at Kiwiana was also attentive without being intrusive.The whole experience was memorable and authentic. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Kiwiana and to trying some of their other dishes!",5.0
"I found this restaurant which has a great dessert while I was looking for a place to eat dinner randomly on Union Street, Park Slope. Since I've never heard there was a New Zealand restaurant in New York, I jumped into the restaurant without any hesitation.Although they had a nice open terrace, I couldn't sit there because a T-storm was coming, according to the weather forecast. As soon as I went into the restaurant, the waiter lead me to a table cheerfully and introduced his recommendation. I asked him to tell me the most typical New Zealand style food, and then I ordered some of those dishes. He was very nice and I felt cozy, although I went there alone. The starter was ok. It was something like apricot and cashew nuts on cottage cheese with strawberry sauce, but I forget the name. Maybe I'm not used to eating cottage cheese, so I didn't think it was very tasty.Then, the main dish came. I had ordered in English, so after seeing and tasting the dish, I knew it was Hangi, which is a traditional food of the Maori (aboriginal people in New Zealand). I ate it when I was in New Zealand. The tender braised ribs didn't havea strong taste but they really went well with the Manuka (honey) sauce.Read More... tabelog.us/reviewers/dta…",4.0

Having been there for a corporate event we could also hang out in the wine cellar downstairs, and it was just a really nice atmosphere. Do try one of their amazing kiwi wines selection. The location is extremely convenient. Highly recommend Kiwiana!",4.0
"Loved it!!! Had the kiwi burger and never looked back. It was delicious! Looks exactly as the pictures posted here. My friend had the fried chicken entree and he loved it too, couldn't stop licking his fingernails. The portion size is big, I couldn't finish my burger and fries and he barely finished his. Service was excellent, really nice and pleasant staff and food came within 15 minutes. Bathroom was nice too ;-)",5.0
"Sort of disappointed. I liked my lamb burger, which was med rare but how come there weren't juices all dripping out of it once I bit into it? Very strange. It should be juicy and making my mouth water now even thinking about it. I had a strange cocktail which tasted like one of my disgusting, but heathly green smoothies. I make these for myself at home. Maybe I should start adding vodka? I'll live forever.",3.0
"I ate at Kiwiana for the first time during a recent business trip to NYC. From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted warmly by the staff. The dining room is lovely - with original tin ceilings and lots of greenery (hard to believe that Park Slope is right outside the front door). The menu posed a few challenges - because I wanted to try everything! I finally opted for ($1!) oysters followed by the 'Lamb two ways with minted peas and couscous'. The oysters were incredibly fresh and delicious and the lamb was beautifully paired with the peas. I tried the lamb chop first. It was perfectly medium rare and well seasoned. The braised lamb medallion was 'melt in your mouth' delicious. Despite my protestations, we ordered two deserts for the table: poppyseed pannacotta and the pavlova. Both were fresh, delicious and great to share.Chef Mark stopped by during dinner to greet us and ask for our thoughts. We also talked about Rugby (my son is a Rugby player in CA)!  The staff at Kiwiana was also attentive without being intrusive.The whole experience was memorable and authentic. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Kiwiana and to trying some of their other dishes!",5.0
"I found this restaurant which has a great dessert while I was looking for a place to eat dinner randomly on Union Street, Park Slope. Since I've never heard there was a New Zealand restaurant in New York, I jumped into the restaurant without any hesitation.Although they had a nice open terrace, I couldn't sit there because a T-storm was coming, according to the weather forecast. As soon as I went into the restaurant, the waiter lead me to a table cheerfully and introduced his recommendation. I asked him to tell me the most typical New Zealand style food, and then I ordered some of those dishes. He was very nice and I felt cozy, although I went there alone. The starter was ok. It was something like apricot and cashew nuts on cottage cheese with strawberry sauce, but I forget the name. Maybe I'm not used to eating cottage cheese, so I didn't think it was very tasty.Then, the main dish came. I had ordered in English, so after seeing and tasting the dish, I knew it was Hangi, which is a traditional food of the Maori (aboriginal people in New Zealand). I ate it when I was in New Zealand. The tender braised ribs didn't havea strong taste but they really went well with the Manuka (honey) sauce.Read More... tabelog.us/reviewers/dta…",4.0
"Came here for brunch on Sunday. Disappointing to say the least- bloody Mary and a mamosa- ordered chicken & waffles special- eggs Benedict- lattePositive- food tasted good- attentive staffNegative- The brioche for the eggs Benedict was barely toasted.

No crunch at all and it was only 2 quarters of a small waffle. - chintzy servings of chicken, bony thigh and small drumstick.-Latte came out as a cappuccino, although it was the first day for the person who made it.Another case of inflated reviews on Yelp.

"If it wasn't for the unprofessional attitude of one of the staff members, I would have given this place a 4, at most 4.5.The food was delicious. The place is a bit small so they had us in the basement/cellar to hold our big party. I didn't mind it, except for the staircase, which is a serious hazard, even with the sign that warns them to watch our heads. Which was why I originally wanted to give the place a 4.5. However, towards the end, I saw a female staff member do a rude gesture to express her feeling of being uncomfortable with a romantic moment of a man giving his bride-to-be a bouquet of flower. Literally, she turned around and made a gagging gesture. She hoped no one but her fellow coworker to see it, but I saw it. It was rude, unnecessary, and unprofessional. It was my first time here, so it left a big impression that the staff members weren't trained properly to act accordingly a do/or professionally while in front of guests/customers. However, the other waiters and waitresses were nice, helpful, and friendly...even though one of the waitresses was clumsy. The place only has one good staff and that was the guy who served us and took our orders most of the time.Overall, food is delicious. Staff needs better and proper training. Place is simple and a bit small, but they have 2 tables set up outside for customers to dine outside. The staff members, except for one, basically left me a bad impression of this possibly-wonderful place to eat. I would recommend this place for their great dishes, but would kind of not because of service quality.",3.0

"We wanted to show my mother-in-law a nice evening out. She was all wrapped up in her home clothes, but we wanted her to try Kiwiana. She was *so* happy to have made the effort to get semi-dressed and come out to enjoy Kiwiana. Momma was so pleased... she said ""damn! that man can cook!"" Kiwiana now has a liquor license with a full bar (and happy hour until 7:30 pm) and the two cocktails they have right now are dead on- DELICIOUS! The Farmer's Daughter (gin, cucumber, elderflower, lime, sugar, mint) and the Kiwi (rum, ginger, lemongrass) just really lovely combinations.We tarted with oysters (wow! salivacious!), the beets/lavendar infused goat cheese with pecans, and the salmon ceviche (pure genious! the textures are amazing and it's extremely flavorful).for the mains: I couldn't resist the fried chicken again- and I swear it tasted better than I remember (I wish we could get a WHOLE corn on the cobb! I don't know how he makes corn taste so flavorful!) Momma and hubby had the lamb burger. Now, hubby and I took a New Zealand roadtrip and the best lamb burger (we thought) we had in life was in this tiny town there... but this lamb burger beats THAT lamb burger. Momma was so happy, and that- is priceless. For dessert- couldn't resist the passion fruit flan again (damn that's the perfect way to end any night!) and this time we were early enough to try the Raspberry lamington (they ran out last time we came) and it was so yummy! Light/airy/flavorful... WOW!!!",5.0
"The atmosphere is very nice, albeit toned down, and the service is excellent. Everyone was very nice and friendly. The food was imaginative, but didn't quite hit the mark for me. It's only based on my opinion, but I thought the fried chicken had strong flavors at first, but lost a good bit of it's flavor. I wasnt a fan of thet Truffle oil honey. It was interesting at first, but I think i've just been burned out on seeing truffle oil at every restaurant. The Kale salad and mash was nice, but the fried chicken itself wasn't that good for me. I see most people love it, so it's either not my thing or I just had bad luck on the way it was spiced. We had the seasonal New Zealand veggies, described to be sort of like asparagus. It was very crunchy and much too bitter to be compared to asparagus. The potatoes and peanuts it was served with balanced it out nicely, but the veggie itself wasn't that flavorful. the Foie Gras was very rich, i would suggest that to anyone who likes Foie Gras. My wife had the burger and loved it. I am sure I would love other things at this place, the beer selection was great and the service was amazing, but I wanted to try some great fried chicken (since everyone loved it so much) and it just missed the mark for me. Again, I'm sure it's just my taste, people really seem to love it.",3.0

"I'm so glad that Mark Simmons opened up his place here in Park Slope!  I enjoyed his cooking from Melt so I knew that Kiwiana would be a great hit!  We were lucky enough to get dinner reservations for opening week back in August. To start off, we had the smoked and pickled green lip mussels with bread.  It was a nice delightful surprise because I never had pickled mussels before - in fact I really liked the different flavors mixed together.  Then we ordered the west coast oysters, as well as the salmon ceviche with wasabi avocado puree and lump fish caviar, which were both delicious and fresh.  My favorite appetizer was definitely the baby beets with lavender ricotta.  Who would have known something so simple could taste so delicious!The appetizers were a nice prep for the real deal, the entree! The manuka and marmite-braised baby back ribs with squash puree were oh so amazingly tasty and delicious. I had something similar when Mark Simmons cooked for my family when I had my bridal shower at Melt. I also tried my hubbie's entree, a milo-rubbed venison, which was also just as good!  I never had venison before (always too scared to try it) so I'm glad I had it for the first time at Kiwiana.Lastly, for dessert we had passion fruit and coconut cream caramel and chocolate molten cake!

It was good in a cold way.... I thought ALL molten cake were served warm... it was a tad bit warm on the outside but the inside was cold...

"I always get excited for Dine in Brooklyn, the restaurant choices are great and it's not overrated like NYC-RW. I picked Kiwiana as I heard good things about them. It's a low-key, cutely decorated restaurant on Union St. Not surprised that it was a full house even on a weeknight. Their Dine in Brooklyn menu offered great choices, it included the famous baby back ribs and fried chicken so that's exactly what we ordered as our entrees. For appetizers, we shared the squash soup, roasted beets and mixed greens salad - all delicious with the salad being light, simple and the best. Chef Simmons added a special touch by bringing out all the entrees himself. The entrees were great and he did not skim on portion size. The skin of my fried chicken was very flavorful though I would've preferred it crispier and the food hotter. Finally, we shared a bread pudding and raspberry lamington as desserts. It's a solid 4 star restaurant, we glanced over their regular menu and everything was reasonably priced. Will likely return and recommend.",4.0
"Dinner impressionFirst off,  the decor here is soooo  precious. The warm green tile, green plants and NZ memorabilia make you feel like you are dining in an intimate kitchen.On to food. The buttermilk fried chicken was fantastically made, very crunchy. Even tastier with the truffle honey. The inside was a little pink for my liking but overall i loved the dish. The lamb was very well seasoned with the NZ spices and the meat was falling of the bomb. I was kinda sad that the portion was on the small side for $26.For dessert, we shared the bread pudding. OK nothing to talk about.The service here was outstanding. Many visits to our table were made to make sure we were comfortable. The attention really felt genuine.One drawback besides the high prices was the flow of the place. It's just so small. Hard to navigate in/out of your seat during busy hours.Overall, a solid place. the lamb burger and short ribs are on my list to try",4.0
"What a fun night! Kiwiana is a cute, quaint and lovely restaurant with a mountain of charm.  The space is small yet sufficient and is a bit rustic, country and elegant. I noticed someone had there wedding reception here and I could easily see it being the perfect space for a small brunch reception. The food is simple but exceeds your expectations with every bite.  On my visit, my date and I had the soup of the day, butternut squash. It wasn't atypical but lovely nonetheless. The white bait with lemon and tarter was a treat.  The malpeque oysters tasted as if they were directly from the sea.  The star was the fried chicken dish which came with three perfectly seasoned and crispy pieces.  I looked over the dessert menu but couldn't force another bite.  It looked amazing and my eyes wandered down to the date sticky toffee so now Kiwiana is on the top of my ""go back for seconds"" list.  The service and ambience is cool and I would highly recommend for a casual dinner night. I don't know what it is, but Kiwiana makes me wanna smile.",4.0

Everything we ate here was phenomenal (get the yuca tater tots!) and the service was perfect. I would recommend making a reservation if possible. The restaurant is small and the bar area has just 4 seats I think so if it's packed there isn't much space to just hang out and wait.,5.0
"I always get excited for Dine in Brooklyn, the restaurant choices are great and it's not overrated like NYC-RW. I picked Kiwiana as I heard good things about them. It's a low-key, cutely decorated restaurant on Union St. Not surprised that it was a full house even on a weeknight. Their Dine in Brooklyn menu offered great choices, it included the famous baby back ribs and fried chicken so that's exactly what we ordered as our entrees. For appetizers, we shared the squash soup, roasted beets and mixed greens salad - all delicious with the salad being light, simple and the best. Chef Simmons added a special touch by bringing out all the entrees himself. The entrees were great and he did not skim on portion size. The skin of my fried chicken was very flavorful though I would've preferred it crispier and the food hotter. Finally, we shared a bread pudding and raspberry lamington as desserts. It's a solid 4 star restaurant, we glanced over their regular menu and everything was reasonably priced. Will likely return and recommend.",4.0
"Dinner impressionFirst off,  the decor here is soooo  precious. The warm green tile, green plants and NZ memorabilia make you feel like you are dining in an intimate kitchen.On to food. The buttermilk fried chicken was fantastically made, very crunchy. Even tastier with the truffle honey. The inside was a little pink for my liking but overall i loved the dish. The lamb was very well seasoned with the NZ spices and the meat was falling of the bomb. I was kinda sad that the portion was on the small side for $26.For dessert, we shared the bread pudding. OK nothing to talk about.The service here was outstanding. Many visits to our table were made to make sure we were comfortable. The attention really felt genuine.One drawback besides the high prices was the flow of the place. It's just so small. Hard to navigate in/out of your seat during busy hours.Overall, a solid place. the lamb burger and short ribs are on my list to try",4.0
"What a fun night! Kiwiana is a cute, quaint and lovely restaurant with a mountain of charm.  The space is small yet sufficient and is a bit rustic, country and elegant. I noticed someone had there wedding reception here and I could easily see it being the perfect space for a small brunch reception. The food is simple but exceeds your expectations with every bite.  On my visit, my date and I had the soup of the day, butternut squash. It wasn't atypical but lovely nonetheless. The white bait with lemon and tarter was a treat.  The malpeque oysters tasted as if they were directly from the sea.  The star was the fried chicken dish which came with three perfectly seasoned and crispy pieces.  I looked over the dessert menu but couldn't force another bite.  It looked amazing and my eyes wandered down to the date sticky toffee so now Kiwiana is on the top of my ""go back for seconds"" list.  The service and ambience is cool and I would highly recommend for a casual dinner night. I don't know what it is, but Kiwiana makes me wanna smile.",4.0

"I was visiting NYC (BK specifically) this past weekend and Kiwiana was my last formal dinner stop of the trip. I made the mistake of trying a martini (dirty mussel variety) that I thought would be a fun drink, it ended up not being for me to say the least. I'm sure for someone it would be a grat drink but it turned out to be a flavor that my taste buds did not agree with. Upon moving the drink on the table, the front end manager (Emma) quickly noticed I wasn't touching it and offered to change it out for another drink. I have never sent a cocktail of drink back, I normally find it to be disrespectful, but Emma made it clear it was not an issue and she happily got me a porter (from NZ) which was more my style! It was delicious too! Hanna(h), our server, was also very attentive and kindly explained the specifics of several entrees on the menu. I opted for a braized lamb rib and it was DELICIOUS!! Cooked to perfection, and complimented by a great potato au gratin! long story short the service and cuisine was above par and I recommend the stop if you can make it in! you wont be disappointed!

A cute little gem in The Park Slope. Definitely a hit of a brunch venue it always seems to be closed for some birthday party event. A clean and quaint interior it is absolutely lovely. Everything we ordered was perfect except that I had to ask for cream for the scones. Any kiwi/aussie in NY knows you have to have cream with your scones. The burger with everything (aka fried egg) was fantastic except the wood board it was served on had dried egg on it. We didn't bother getting it changed out because we were in a rush and didn't really care. But it was a little gross. Aside from these minor issues it is probably the best cafe in the area hands down.

What I really enjoyed at Kiwana was actually the appetizers: sweet corn soup and pickled mussels! The sweet corn soup was a cold dish with a hint of spice. I was surprised to find popcorn in the soup but it worked so well. My boyfriend was literally licking the plate. The pickled mussels were interesting and definitely a first with me. On the menu, it may not seem that appetizing but once you have a bite of it, you'll understand why it's a popular dish to order. There are various types of mussels (out of shell) that are pickled in a mason jar. The pickled taste wasn't that strong and really worked well with buttered (delicious!) bread. We also had the braised baby back ribs and the Tamarind-glazed lamb rump and chop. I have to say that both were cooked perfectly but I did enjoy the lamb rump and chops a lot more because of how crispy the outside was and how perfectly medium rare the meat was.  The other components to the dish like the yuca tots were surprisingly delicious and sweet.",4.0

"4.5 starsI've never had Zea Zealand cuisine before. Loved the creativity of the dishes. Was able to dine here for Dine in Brooklyn 2012, so a three-course meal for about $25 dollars. It was a great deal. I highly highly recommend the marmite braised baby back ribs and the fettucini with roasted beet sauce. The former is heavier, but the pork is sooo tender you really don't need a knife. I wasn't as familiar with marmite as my boyfriend, but the flavoring was deep but not overpowering or rich. The fettucine was the more creative dish, I felt. I was surprised by that the noodles themselves were beet-colored. Again, not too rich, and the beet flavor was subtle and a little sweet (in a good way). Portions are just right: not too stingy, not too heavy. I was a little disappointed by the lamingtons and molton cake. The former had really cute presentation, but it was a little dry. While the milo brought back childhood memories, the cake itself wasn't anything special. I'd recommend the cake over the lamingtons though.",5.0

"**Before VEGAN pledge**I have no clue who celebrity chefs are and honestly couldn't care less. Fame and fortune does nothing for my mind, heart or belly. But if you whip up a good, tasty meal with excellent hospitality, then you have won me over, oh, and dashing handsome good looks help too. I learnt about this place after there was a yelp event here a few months ago. I, unfortunately, didn't get in, but promised myself I would make my trek here to New Zealand cuisine. Well hello Kiwis!! Salt and pepper hair on a man melts my heart and we were so lucky to have TWO of them in our presence (note to self:  plan next vacation to New Zealand pronto).The place has a minimalist feel, elegant, classy and  romantic. I remember candles and clean stream-lined tables and chairs. We came a couple of months ago and I was still eating seafood. For appetizers, we started off with fried oysters. The cute waitress asked how many and I said, ""One please."" My date just laughed at me and proceeded to order six. Well it was a good move because we devoured them quickly. Tender and breaded to perfection is what I remember. It was a special, so not always on the menu. My date had the fried chicken special and I had the Kiwi vegetable pie with plum ketchup and chips. I remember my date wanting white meat instead of dark meat, but they couldn't make the substitution. Either way, my date definitely enjoyed the plate and had no complaints. My vegetable pie was similar to a shephard's pie minus the meat. The plum ketchup tasted weird, but it might just be some sort of acquired taste like Marmite or Vegemite. Comfort food on a cold, winter day really hits the spot! I think what really is UNIQUE about this place was their AMAZING KIWI DESSERTS! We sampled the raspberry lamingtons and also the pavlova with kiwifruit. The lamington is a sponge cake and it was very light and not too sweet. Excellent texture! My Asian family would love this dessert. The pavlova is a meringue-like dessert and also very light. The desserts aren't heavy, but were a wonderful way to end dinner. I especially liked the authentic NEW ZEALAND desserts. That way, I don't have to travel half way across the world to try motherland food. But if this place is any representation of New Zealand (with their beautiful people), I am booking my flight out immediately!",5.0
Came in for dinner. Kind of an Australian outback feel to it. Nice ambiance. Ordered the pickled mussels to start. It was different but a good different. Didn't go with the bread though.

"I have been looking forward to hitting up Kiwiana on a Wednesday for dollar oyster night for some time now (I think they might do the buck oysters on Sunday too).  It was around 9 PM when I decided to pop in, and I assumed we'd have missed the special.  But I was happy to learn that the dollar oysters last all night!  My partner and I took down a dozen and they were delicious.  We decided to stick around for a meal, and we shared the lamb, chilled corn soup, and, kale slaw.  I was very impressed by the flavors of the lamb, and though the 4 pieces weren't huge, they were nicely cooked to medium rare.  The pea puree underneath was interesting, but the peas were a bit mushy and the yuka tots on the plate were unremarkable.  That said, I really did like the lamb itself and enjoyed it alot.  The chilled corn soup was also delicious, and we were scraping the bowl.  Unfortunately, the kale slaw wasn't amazing (though it was solidly average). I like the simple decor of the place, and the service was attentive and friendly.  They forgot to bring my drink, but I didn't mind because I ended up not really wanting to drink (and they didn't charge me for it by mistake).  I think overall, it is a very nice place to have a meal.  It is also a good date spot for the 27 (or so) and up crowd who want a nice meal. (I don't think it is a good first date spot because the entrees a little pricey).  In terms of nice places to eat in the hood, I would rank it below Kaz Au Nu and Talde, but I would certainly put it in the top 5-10.  I will be back.",4.0
"This is a solid SOLID five star review.  In fact it is so solid, I really urge everyone and anyone who lives in the area to go check it out.  If you don't love it PM me and we'll talk.(No, I do not have shares in the place, personally know the chef, owner, any of the employees, proprietors etc)Now, the venue is gorgeous, and although small is quite spacious.  I have been quite a few times since it opened and the food is consistently perfect.  The beet salad with lavender and ricotta is nothing short of genius while the soup, oysters, and tartares are creative and push the bounds of interesting flavors. The lamb burger is succulent and saory.  The ribs are meaty and sweet, while the red snapper has just the right amount of heat to it.  The lamb loin is sensational and the fried chicken is some of the best I have ever had.  The desserts are whimsical and inventve with the bread pudding being intensely creative with the use of orange and lemon zest. Kiwiana is one of those places that I am thrilled opened near the house and I want the world to try so they can see what I mean!Maybe I should book a weekly table for a year before posting...",5.0
"While reading this review, please keep in mind that I might be biased because I am a little bit in love with Mark Simmons. As the old adage goes, the way to my heart is through my stomach; when I taste the food at Kiwiana, I want to run into the kitchen and give the chef a hug. If he didn't have ready access to very sharp knives, I might have even tried.The man just knows how to cook. The corn and crab soup is rich and delicious, and will warm you up as the weather grows cold. The scallops are nothing short of incredible; they quickly converted my girlfriend who occasionally likes to pretend she doesn't like scallops. I wanted to savor every luscious bite of the manuka and marmite-braised baby back ribs, but I'm afraid I took them all down in minutes. The lamb is so tender it's absurd, and the fried chicken is about as good as fried chicken gets.If you're feeling a bit adventurous, check out the smoked and pickled mussels. They arrive in a jar of the pickling liquid, and are served with a nice sourdough and house-churned butter. I must admit I'm more partial to mussels served hot, but even so, we were basically drinking the juice after quickly polishing off the shellfish. They were pleasantly tart and briny, and like nothing I've had previously.Kiwiana is not big by any means, but I think the manageable size keeps the quality high. The small room gets nice and lively, but the soft candlelight and warm atmosphere makes it perfect for a date. The staff is friendly and attentive; by their recommendations, you can tell that they enjoy the food immensely as well.On my last visit, I think Mark somehow deduced it was my birthday, and he sent out a glass of champagne and came by to say hi as well. It's this kind of personal touch that takes Kiwiana up a notch. With such well-executed food that is unique not only to Park Slope, but also to NYC, I plan to be here often.",5.0
"I went there about 2 weeks ago and not only me but my dear friend after the dinner said it was best meal we had in NY since we have moved here years ago. Simple high quality, flavor, presentation. Can't say how happy I was by picking fish special Cod, and looking on the wine list... there is plenty wines by the glass. But not only my cod was done perfect but my friend's pasta dish in beet sauce/muse type of thing was outstanding but dessert Panna Cotta was just a bomb. I'm coming back for sure!

We sampled the raspberry lamingtons and also the pavlova with kiwifruit. The lamington is a sponge cake and it was very light and not too sweet. Excellent texture! My Asian family would love this dessert. The pavlova is a meringue-like dessert and also very light. The desserts aren't heavy, but were a wonderful way to end dinner. I especially liked the authentic NEW ZEALAND desserts. That way, I don't have to travel half way across the world to try motherland food. But if this place is any representation of New Zealand (with their beautiful people), I am booking my flight out immediately!",5.0
Came in for dinner. Kind of an Australian outback feel to it. Nice ambiance. Ordered the pickled mussels to start. It was different but a good different. Didn't go with the bread though. Ordered the fried chicken and the Atlantic salmon. Wasn't blow my mind amazing but definitely worth a try and I suggest everyone should to.,3.0
"I have been looking forward to hitting up Kiwiana on a Wednesday for dollar oyster night for some time now (I think they might do the buck oysters on Sunday too).  It was around 9 PM when I decided to pop in, and I assumed we'd have missed the special.  But I was happy to learn that the dollar oysters last all night!  My partner and I took down a dozen and they were delicious.  We decided to stick around for a meal, and we shared the lamb, chilled corn soup, and, kale slaw.  I was very impressed by the flavors of the lamb, and though the 4 pieces weren't huge, they were nicely cooked to medium rare.  The pea puree underneath was interesting, but the peas were a bit mushy and the yuka tots on the plate were unremarkable.  That said, I really did like the lamb itself and enjoyed it alot.  The chilled corn soup was also delicious, and we were scraping the bowl.  Unfortunately, the kale slaw wasn't amazing (though it was solidly average). I like the simple decor of the place, and the service was attentive and friendly.  They forgot to bring my drink, but I didn't mind because I ended up not really wanting to drink (and they didn't charge me for it by mistake).  I think overall, it is a very nice place to have a meal.  It is also a good date spot for the 27 (or so) and up crowd who want a nice meal. (I don't think it is a good first date spot because the entrees a little pricey).  In terms of nice places to eat in the hood, I would rank it below Kaz Au Nu and Talde, but I would certainly put it in the top 5-10.  I will be back.",4.0
"This is a solid SOLID five star review.  In fact it is so solid, I really urge everyone and anyone who lives in the area to go check it out.  If you don't love it PM me and we'll talk.(No, I do not have shares in the place, personally know the chef, owner, any of the employees, proprietors etc)Now, the venue is gorgeous, and although small is quite spacious.  I have been quite a few times since it opened and the food is consistently perfect.  The beet salad with lavender and ricotta is nothing short of genius while the soup, oysters, and tartares are creative and push the bounds of interesting flavors. The lamb burger is succulent and saory.  The ribs are meaty and sweet, while the red snapper has just the right amount of heat to it.  The lamb loin is sensational and the fried chicken is some of the best I have ever had.  The desserts are whimsical and inventve with the bread pudding being intensely creative with the use of orange and lemon zest. Kiwiana is one of those places that I am thrilled opened near the house and I want the world to try so they can see what I mean!Maybe I should book a weekly table for a year before posting...",5.0
"While reading this review, please keep in mind that I might be biased because I am a little bit in love with Mark Simmons. As the old adage goes, the way to my heart is through my stomach; when I taste the food at Kiwiana, I want to run into the kitchen and give the chef a hug. If he didn't have ready access to very sharp knives, I might have even tried.The man just knows how to cook. The corn and crab soup is rich and delicious, and will warm you up as the weather grows cold. The scallops are nothing short of incredible; they quickly converted my girlfriend who occasionally likes to pretend she doesn't like scallops. I wanted to savor every luscious bite of the manuka and marmite-braised baby back ribs, but I'm afraid I took them all down in minutes. The lamb is so tender it's absurd, and the fried chicken is about as good as fried chicken gets.If you're feeling a bit adventurous, check out the smoked and pickled mussels. They arrive in a jar of the pickling liquid, and are served with a nice sourdough and house-churned butter. I must admit I'm more partial to mussels served hot, but even so, we were basically drinking the juice after quickly polishing off the shellfish. They were pleasantly tart and briny, and like nothing I've had previously.Kiwiana is not big by any means, but I think the manageable size keeps the quality high. The small room gets nice and lively, but the soft candlelight and warm atmosphere makes it perfect for a date. The staff is friendly and attentive; by their recommendations, you can tell that they enjoy the food immensely as well.On my last visit, I think Mark somehow deduced it was my birthday, and he sent out a glass of champagne and came by to say hi as well. It's this kind of personal touch that takes Kiwiana up a notch. With such well-executed food that is unique not only to Park Slope, but also to NYC, I plan to be here often.",5.0
"I went there about 2 weeks ago and not only me but my dear friend after the dinner said it was best meal we had in NY since we have moved here years ago. Simple high quality, flavor, presentation. Can't say how happy I was by picking fish special Cod, and looking on the wine list... there is plenty wines by the glass. But not only my cod was done perfect but my friend's pasta dish in beet sauce/muse type of thing was outstanding but dessert Panna Cotta was just a bomb. I'm coming back for sure! PS would like maybe a bit light on the lightning for dinner time, it was on the bright side.",5.0
"Hot damn that is some good-ass fried chicken.If you were from the South, as I am, you'd think you knew everything there was to know about fried chicken and the best ways to prepare, serve and accessorize it. It's most likely that someone from New Zealand wouldn't use the phrase ""good-ass"" on a regular basis, as NZ native chef Mark Simmons (from Top Chef fame) could probably tell you. But when you run into somewhere like Kiwiana, that throws the whole idea on its head, and presents you with a new, delicious way to do up something that I was firmly convinced I knew best how to do already, well, good-ass is the right way to describe it.There's lots of other good stuff here: the ceviche was really tasty, and I liked the corn chowder soup. But the starters here are pretty small (though beautifully delivered) so keep that in mind.Service is fantastic, and our server was the perfect amount of attentive and leave-us-be and the prices are firmly reasonable, especially on a date.But make sure and try the fried chicken. It'll make you wanna slap yo' pappy's face it's so tasty.",4.0
"Stopped by for dinner on a Friday with a friend, and we split the pickled mussels with bread and butter, which was quite briney and great for anyone that likes pickles. I had the the manuka and marmite-braised ribs, which were quite tasty and prepared well. We split the pavlova for dessert, which was pretty good but not for someone that's not a big fan of whipped cream.Overall, the food and ambiance were nice but the service a bit lacking (server unsure of what each of the ingredients was and had to refer to her notes). Probably wouldn't make a special trip out here for it but would consider eating here if in the area.",3.0
"Can someone explain to me why one can experience Brooklyn's Restaurant Week for $25 a pop, but in Philadelphia it costs $10 more? Unfair.I was very lucky to experience ""Dine In Brooklyn"" last weekend at Kiwiana, at the recommendation of my BFF, Maddie O (Yes, she's Elite). Amber C and Kyle L even schlepped all the way down from Greenpoint to join us!This gorgeous Park Slope restaurant is tiny and bright, with small glasses of fresh flowers covering all surfaces. So cute. The fresh and homey decor made me want to Pin it for all the world to see! Our server was super likable, with a casual yet professional attitude (wanna be friends?) Now, the food. I started with the seared sea scallop on top of cauliflower and bacon mash, which was served on a giant scallop shell (I didn't even know the shells were that big!) It was gorgeous. For my main I chose the fried chicken, which Maddie O had gushed about. I never order fried chicken. Ever. I don't usually eat dark meat (upon cutting into the thigh, I had to ask my dining mates ""is this done?"") but I should more often. Juicy and delectable, this chicken was drizzled with TRUFFLE HONEY and served alongside a crisp kale salad and mashed potaters (which were unfortunately room temp, dammit). I simply could not decide on a dessert so I was more than happy when our four-top agreed on getting four different menu items and sharing. We tried the molten chocolate cake, the bread pudding, a lemon mousse and the ""pavlova,"" which is a meringue filled with whipped cream and topped with fresh fruit. Totally stole the show, in my opinion.Can't wait to go back.",5.0
"3.5 stars!Went on a cold Thursday night where there weren't many patrons Decor/ambiance - really nice, cozy and quiet (but not awkwardly quiet)Service - very attentive Food/drinks:Electric blanket (waitress recommended) - a mix a mulled wine and pomegranate that was not tasty for me...

"WTF kiwianaive wanted to go to you for five years or more.  having lvie din NZ for a little while I had a hankering for those very particular and wonderful foods and flavors.  I FINALLY had a good excuse to go--a friend in town--and was excited.IT was FINE.  thats it.  Which would be ok for a neighborhoody place if it wasnt so damn expensive.

"My friend and I went here the other week.  I live on the same block and have been eager to try it since I first moved here 4 months ago.  First of all, the waiter was so knowledgeable he helped make the experience.  I had never had New Zealand cuisine and he explained everything.  I love learning so this waiter rocked.  We ordered the cheese plate to start and the New Zealand biscuits (ANZAC) we learned about actually taste like an oatmeal cookie.  We were also treated with complimentary soup from the Chef.   It was some sort of cold clam soup with popcorn- delicious mix for the palate.   I ordered the lamb which was cooked to perfection as my friend ordered the fried chicken.  We were both satisfied.  We sat outside and had such a nice and relaxing time.  I highly recommend this place for a date or special dinner.",5.0
"4 stars for lovely food, 1 star (seriously) for the service.  I won't allow the service to negate how delicious the meal was, but really, the service is just terrible.  We had the fried oysters (nice, but lacked something special) and smoked/pickled mussels (really terrific - just the right level of pickling, and perfectly married with the butter) to start, followed by the ribs (no hint of marmite at all, which was disappointing) and the fried chicken (the accompanying truffle honey should be bottled, it is so incredibly crack-like!).  Desserts were pavlova and lamingtons, both of which were well done.The staff, however, failed at every single possible turn.  From taking our drink orders (we had to flag them down when there were 3 other tables in the restaurant after sitting there for a good 10 minutes) to never once refilling our water without asking (we watched them take a bottle, walk to one table in the restaurant, never make eye contact with any other table, and walk straight back to the bar with 3/4 full pitchers at least a dozen times during our meal), to again requiring flagging down to order dessert, clear our plates (we sat after our mains with dirty, empty dishes for 15 minutes!) get the check and pay.  We were having a casual meal and wouldn't have minded a bit of time, but it really was kind of ridiculous, and noone likes to sit with dirty, unappetizing plates after they are finished eating.  Seriously amateur hour - it is as if none had ever waited tables before ever!  One final thing: FIX YOUR BATHROOM DOOR.  I closed the door firmly as requested, locked it and still got walked in on.  Just fix it. It clearly doesn't work properly - no excuse for that.Overall, we'd definitely recommend for the lovely food, particularly if the service improves.  I do hope the will, as this is a lovely additional to a neighborhood lacking in options of this caliber!",4.0

"Came here from the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and we were so hungry after walking around without our morning coffee. But came along this New Zealand restaurant that has this small country house feel. The servers were pleasant and accommodating, kind of like someone coming into their home for a meal. I saw a couple of people coming in to eat alone, so I'm going to assume this is like your neighborhood place. All the food was light and delicious. Everything had a delightful freshness to it and you didn't feel like I ate a pound of food.What We Ate:Homemade scones with boysenberry jam and vanilla butter Prefect amount of sweetness and a nice combination of the boysenberry jam and vanilla butter, I want to recreate this so I can bring it to work every day!  Oysters with champagne mignonette and cocktail sauce Good oysters served on top of a mound of salt... at first I thought it was ice but then realized it was salt, interesting. The champagne mignonette was light and not too strong. Good but not amazing app.Chai-spiced French toast, maple syrup, whipped cream and fresh berries My friend got the French toast and the fluffiness of the French Toast was amazing! I'm use to French toast being heavy and greasy and leave you feeling blah. NOT THIS ONE! This is the best French toast I have ever tried and the chai spice was a great addition! Whipped Cream tasted homemade as well. Really great dish!The Fry Up:  Eggs any style, toast, bacon, sausage, roasted tomato and hashReminds me of an English Breakfast, I didn't feel overly stuffed afterwards, which I love! Very simple meal with hash that had cumin in it and maybe a purple potato? The hash I didn't quite recognize at first because I was expecting home fries, but after taking a few more bites I began to enjoy the hash, it has a very earthy taste to it. What we Drank:Passion fruit Mimosa: A little on the sweet sideKiwi Mimosa: Definitely get it! Has a fresh taste and it's not too sweetBlood Mary: Seems watered down and bitter, something was missing...This place was a pleasant surprise with their flavors and presentation of their food. I found myself expecting something but getting a whole different experience. The food was very familiar but had a small New Zealand twist, that I really enjoyed and appreciated.

"3.5 Stars really.  The butternut squash soup was tasty and had a real earthy tone given the walnuts.  My NZ venison was cooked perfectly, spinach seasoned well, and sesame potatoes were interesting.  What topped the meal was a NZ type of dessert with fruit, cream, and a light cookie thingy on the bottom.  What's not so great was flat/ expired diet coke from a 2-liter bottle, the table setting (tiny place and I was stuffed in the back), and the noise level was extremely high - table to the left had middle aged men and women discussing orgies and table to my right had a woman talking about hours of make out sessions and slutting it out.  Classy, but I suppose it was better entertainment than dining with an ex.If you follow Top Chef alum Mark Simmons go for it, but this ""mediocre"" review is totally for the poor front of the house execution.",3.0

I've been in the service industry for seven years, I've been a hostess, server and a bartender, I understand you want to go home, believe me, I do, but when the waitress PHYSICALLY stops me from entering the restaurant with her arms spread eagle, rushing to the door from the middle of the restaurant, the understanding stops there. When I asked her what time they close on Sundays, (because the website said 10pm) she said ""Well, technically it's ten but when it's slow we close early."" She then told us the kitchen closes in a minute and we would have to order right away. Okay, so first you're closed, but now we can stay only if we order right away? Honestly, after realizing the restaurant was empty and knowing they probably wanted to go home, I wouldn't have stayed. A good server/  good restaurant takes people who come in at 9:59 and treats them the same way they would be treated if they came in 2 hours earlier. Really disappointed. This totally turned me off from ever wanting to return.",2.0
"Came here for a small birthday party and most items were good, but it didn't necessarily make a last impression on me.  I tried the steak tartare, salmon ceviche, and snapper with risotto. I was disappointed that they ran out of oysters by 7:30PM.1. )The tartare was good but the Worcestershire flavor was a bit too strong2.) The salmon was also good, but was microscopic in size and tasted mostly of avocado3.) The snapper was well executed, but the risotto was a little bit flat for having chorizo and saffron in it4.) The service was pretty goodThanks about it.",3.0
Oh My...!!!!! The food is soooo good here. The chef inspired dishes will not disappoint. I had the salad with garam cashews which was very good. And the icing on the cake was the bread pudding! I gotta tell ya... This was the best restaurant I've eaten in in park slope and I will be returning.,5.0
"Yessssss!! Mark Simmons is officially in a class by himself! So proud of him and how far he has come to finally call Kiwiana home. I love his food, his personality and I especially love that he treats my friends and I like ROYALTY.My friends and I were invited by Mark to a pre-grand opening for a private dinner.  And Jane, the bartendress and manager, couldn't have been more gracious.  5 courses of delectable food with a special wine pairing.  Chilled corn soup with popcorn and annato oil, Salmon ceviche with wasabi puree, salmon roe and endive, Horopito and buttermilk fried chicken with kale slaw and truffled honey, Manuka and marmite rubbed pork ribs with potato salad, and to finish, passion fruit and coconut creme caramel with fresh berries.  These are just some of the items that will be on the menu.  I STRONGLY URGE you to get to Kiwiana as soon as the doors open on August 22nd*.   Inspired by his grandmother, Mark promises to transport you to a place that makes you feel like after a long day of work, look forward to getting home and unwind with a great bottle of wine and a scrumptious meal.For further deets, check this out....http://www.kiwiana-nyc.com*If you remember, mention my name, trust me, he and Jane will love you for it.",5.0
"Came here from the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and we were so hungry after walking around without our morning coffee. But came along this New Zealand restaurant that has this small country house feel. The servers were pleasant and accommodating, kind of like someone coming into their home for a meal. I saw a couple of people coming in to eat alone, so I'm going to assume this is like your neighborhood place. All the food was light and delicious. Everything had a delightful freshness to it and you didn't feel like I ate a pound of food.What We Ate:Homemade scones with boysenberry jam and vanilla butter Prefect amount of sweetness and a nice combination of the boysenberry jam and vanilla butter, I want to recreate this so I can bring it to work every day!  Oysters with champagne mignonette and cocktail sauce Good oysters served on top of a mound of salt... at first I thought it was ice but then realized it was salt, interesting. The champagne mignonette was light and not too strong. Good but not amazing app.Chai-spiced French toast, maple syrup, whipped cream and fresh berries My friend got the French toast and the fluffiness of the French Toast was amazing! I'm use to French toast being heavy and greasy and leave you feeling blah. NOT THIS ONE! This is the best French toast I have ever tried and the chai spice was a great addition! Whipped Cream tasted homemade as well. Really great dish!The Fry Up:  Eggs any style, toast, bacon, sausage, roasted tomato and hashReminds me of an English Breakfast, I didn't feel overly stuffed afterwards, which I love! Very simple meal with hash that had cumin in it and maybe a purple potato? The hash I didn't quite recognize at first because I was expecting home fries, but after taking a few more bites I began to enjoy the hash, it has a very earthy taste to it. What we Drank:Passion fruit Mimosa: A little on the sweet sideKiwi Mimosa: Definitely get it! Has a fresh taste and it's not too sweetBlood Mary: Seems watered down and bitter, something was missing...This place was a pleasant surprise with their flavors and presentation of their food. I found myself expecting something but getting a whole different experience. The food was very familiar but had a small New Zealand twist, that I really enjoyed and appreciated. This place was a pleasant surprise! Reminder: Brunch is CASH ONLY!",4.0
"3.5 Stars really.  The butternut squash soup was tasty and had a real earthy tone given the walnuts.  My NZ venison was cooked perfectly, spinach seasoned well, and sesame potatoes were interesting.  What topped the meal was a NZ type of dessert with fruit, cream, and a light cookie thingy on the bottom.  What's not so great was flat/ expired diet coke from a 2-liter bottle, the table setting (tiny place and I was stuffed in the back), and the noise level was extremely high - table to the left had middle aged men and women discussing orgies and table to my right had a woman talking about hours of make out sessions and slutting it out.  Classy, but I suppose it was better entertainment than dining with an ex.If you follow Top Chef alum Mark Simmons go for it, but this ""mediocre"" review is totally for the poor front of the house execution.",3.0
"It was just okay.  I had high hopes after seeing everyone talk up the fried chicken, but its not going to be a serious contender on my fried chicken list.  The lamb was pretty good, as I'd hope a NZ restaurant would be, but I'm not sure I really see myself going back.",3.0
"Yummy Kiwi burger, delicious yuca tots and a tasty beer. Pretty much all I need for a low key weekday dinner!The place isn't too large so it can get full pretty quickly (even on a weekday). The servers are attentive and the general atmosphere is pretty friendly. Must come back for brunch!!!",4.0
"It takes ALOT of perfection to get a full 5 stars whole-heartedly from me. Chef Mark Simmons and the Kiwiana Staff on 5/4/2013 was absolute perfection and for a large party of 12, no less! From making the reservation to the prefixe menu (with enough tastes for ANY and ALL picky eaters) to the evening itself - absolutely the best birthday celebration to history. Table(s) were ready at our arrival, complimentary glass of bubble was enjoyed thoroughly, and hungry stomachs were filled. Between 12 of us - we got to try almost everything on the menu, so here goes: Appetizers: Slow poached baby beets with lavender infused ricotta and almonds -- so fresh and big enough to shareSalmon ceviche with wasabi avocado puree  -- very very fresh and great presentationCorn and crab soup with pop corn and avocado -- unbelievable combination of tastes!Green leaf salad with garam spiced cashews, shallots and blueberries -- perfect amount of dressing and very fresh mixed of greensEntrees:Seared N.Z salmon with brussel sprouts, gala apple and lardons -- perfectly glazed and delicious, even for people who werent salmon fans.Cherry- and chili-glazed rack of lamb with flageolet bean cassoulet and spring vegetables -a MUST try, from the crust and well marinated meat to the veggies, so yum.Black angus sirloin with parsnip and horseradish puree, peppered spinach - large portion of well marinated and juicy meat; Horopito and buttermilk fried chicken with kale slaw and truffle honey - from the look to the taste - delicious and juicyDesserts: --all were hits, the lamington was a personal favorite!! Lemon and poppy seed panna cotta with strawberry gazpachoMolten chocolate cakeRaspberry lamingtons Classic New Zealand pavlovaCan't say enough about the entire evening and will be back (frequently) for sure!",5.0
"I'm gonna go ahead and not reinvent the wheel here.  Most other reviews have probably covered the basics.  The one thing I'll stress is that it is extremely loud.  Like echo-chamber-what-the-hell-did-you-just-say loud.  Not really sure why, since there was no music playing.  Guess the dimensions of the room and acoustics just make it so.  Hearing impaired guests, take note.Starters:  Butternut squash soup with sage vs. Slow poached baby beets with lavender infused ricotta and almonds.  Winner, baby beets.Mains:Fettuccini with roasted beet and pecorino sauce, rocket and pine nuts vs. Manuka and marmite braised baby back ribs with squash puree and broccoli.  Tie.Side:Cauliflower puree with bacon something.  Win.Dessert:Milo-chocolate molten cake with whipped cream vs. Bread pudding with butter pecan ice cream.  Winner, molten chocolate cake.Overall, everything was delicious.  The execution was spot-on, presentation was impressive, flavor profiles were unusually creative and everything just worked.  I was particularly impressed with the fettuccini, which was basically beet ""ink"" died, with the essence of beets throughout.  Very cool and unique dish, and absolutely tasty.  The service was excellent, so much so that when we had a little hiccup with one of our drink orders, they replaced it to our satisfaction without question, protest or otherwise.  Classy move and a classy place.  I will definitely return.",4.0

"After spending an hour on yelp searching for a brunch spot, Kiwiana came forth victorious. First off, I have to say, I really liked the ambiance. The place is small but the tables were spaced just enough where you're not rubbing elbows to the person next to you and eavesdropping into their conversation. The tables were clean, the wallpaper was a nice touch and there were fresh flowers on every table. So, several items on the menu piqued my interest but ultimately, I settled for the eggs benedict only because it was served with braised pork belly! I also ordered the butternut squash soup and a passionfruit mimosa. The soup came within 5 minutes and I probably finished it in 2. Topped with crushed walnuts, the soup was sweet and creamy. Right after I was done with my soup, they served my eggs benedict but still no drink. The waitress has forgotten my mimosa. When I got my eggs benedict, I was disappointed. The hollandaise sauce was so thick, the braised pork was bland, and the brioche was chewy. I enjoyed the side of home fries more than the star of the dish itself. The three items totaled $30 and that is without tax and tips - a bit pricy for brunch and it is cash only.

"Kiwiana was our choice for Dine in Brooklyn this year. My husband and I never ventured into New Zealand cuisine, so we really looked forward to the dinner. It did not disappoint.I had a butternut squash soup, which was creamy and light, and my husband had a mixed greens salad, and found the dressing to be superb. I had the Marmite and Manuka braised ribs for an entree and they were some of the best pieces of meat I ever had. Tender and with an interesting ""kick"" to them. I wish there was a bit more of squash puree that accompanied the meat - it was also very good! My husband had the roasted Atlantic salmon which was served with with grilled brussels sprouts, apples and bacon mix. It was a very interesting dish to say the least. For dessert, we had rasberry lammington and caramel pudding and they were both very delicious. However, I was a bit disappointed that the signature dessert - Pavlova - was not offered.We will definitely be back at Kiwiana! It's a small restaurant with a homey feel and great tasting food.

"I had a special eggs benedict special, it had seared salmon. For some reason I was thinking of smoked salmon but that's my fault.

"I was here last weekend and have really mixed feelings about our meal.  The Atlantic salmon was a small portion ( a 3 inch square of fish) although beautifully presented on some of the tastiest morsels of Brussels sprouts, lardons, and chopped apples that I have ever tasted. The fish was undercooked at the center but I was so involved with the mix under it that I ate around the raw sections and went back to the medley. One of my dinner companions had the buttermilk fried chicken. I think this is when I felt a little jipped. They were given 3 pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes, and some type of greens. Oh how I wished I had ordered that for $6 less than my 3 inch salmon. The short ribs were also plentiful. Boy, did I make the wrong choice that night. Prices are a little high but the place is charming. Dark and candlelit, it attracts a good crowd, lots of couples , and many groups of friends. Once they get their portions in line with their prices I am sure to give them another chance to cook my fish through as long as it comes with those tasty morsels of goodness. :)",3.0

Nice spot for the early Sunday night dinner we ate here. It was freezing outside and the hot spiced apple cider (alcoholic or virgin) really hit the spot. The starter salad was a good size and had some unique elements and three of us greatly enjoyed the beet pasta.

In line with the overall theme, they've managed to infuse kiwi into several of their menu options. Seems to be working out pretty well for them; I Ioved the kiwi mimosas.

I had a salmon entree (from what I remember) and I couldn't find any fault with it. For dessert I had a scrumptious and delightful berry pavlova. Pavlova's are definitely a British (hence N.Z.) thing, so I was happy to have something different other than your standard chocolate lava cake. Delicious. I'll be back.",5.0
"Hi, Mark at Kiwiana. At first I thought it was pretty cool that you answer the phone at your still relatively new Park Slope restaurant. I watched '""Top Chef."" I rooted for you.Maybe you remember me? I'm the one who had the AUDACITY to call on a Wednesday at 7:30 to ask if I could make an 8:15 reservation. ...I know!For the record, an appropriate answer would have been, ""I don't have 8:15, but I do have 9:15. Would you like it?"" To that I would have thought, ""Wow. Good for Mark! Those Marmite ribs really MUST be good! I've got to try this hot new restaurant!""So I thought it was kind of unnecessary when instead you said - with nothing less than disdain - ""Did you ACTUALLY think I'd have anything earlier than that?""The answer is: yes. I ACTUALLY thought that. That's why I called.I came in for brunch and even though we were the only ones in the restaurant and the service was slow, I've been rooting for you. Again.But you know who's nicer than you? al di la. And Franny's. And Applewood.So congratulations, Mark. I'm glad that business is so good for you that you can afford to actively alienate customers.

(I found it less flavorful than expected - though still delicious and satisfying - but I was in the minority with that mild complaint.) We will come back here again for a casual but slightly out of the ordinary meal.,4.0
"Came here with group of ladies for a book club/brunch. The service was awesome. Everyone was very accommodating and friendly. The staff didn't even complain when we stayed longer than our reservations were for (they were setting up for a private party). The food is also pretty good. In line with the overall theme, they've managed to infuse kiwi into several of their menu options. Seems to be working out pretty well for them; I Ioved the kiwi mimosas. My eggs benedict was delicious. Several of my friends had the french toast and had great things to say about it as well. So, there you go.",4.0
"Came for an early Sunday brunch, so there were seats to spare. Started off with the homemade scone which was crispy and tender. A good start. I order the Eggs Florentine which came with the traditional spinach, brioche and hollandaise sauce. However, the plate did include a hash-potato-fried-cake-square-thing (yes that's how I would describe it). It intrigued me but I found out to be over fried and couldn't really taste potato. The eggs florentine was good, though I thought it was too egg-y and not enough punch from the spinach an hollandaise.",2.0
"This was another great find for me in Park Slope, a neighborhood brimming with great restaurants!  I came here on Christmas Eve as it was one of the few restaurants that were open in the area that was not Asian food - so it was nice and quiet, which helped as I had amazingly attentive service.  But really, it was the food that got me.  Everything we ordered was simply delicious - and I loved how the menu seemed quite unique and creative, different from your usual American fare - with a nice New Zealand touch to it.  I definitely want to come back to try brunch, as that seems to have some rave reviews.",5.0
"I thought this place was absolutely amazing! We both had the $35 prix fixe menu, which is a real bargain considering the quality of the food, service, and ambiance.First, the restaurant itself is very cute. I loved the decor and the homey English-cottagey vibe (not a favorite of my husband's though). Next, the meal we had was pretty damn tasty. I had a salmon entree (from what I remember) and I couldn't find any fault with it. For dessert I had a scrumptious and delightful berry pavlova. Pavlova's are definitely a British (hence N.Z.) thing, so I was happy to have something different other than your standard chocolate lava cake. Delicious. I'll be back.",5.0
"Hi, Mark at Kiwiana. At first I thought it was pretty cool that you answer the phone at your still relatively new Park Slope restaurant. I watched '""Top Chef."" I rooted for you.Maybe you remember me? I'm the one who had the AUDACITY to call on a Wednesday at 7:30 to ask if I could make an 8:15 reservation. ...I know!For the record, an appropriate answer would have been, ""I don't have 8:15, but I do have 9:15. Would you like it?"" To that I would have thought, ""Wow. Good for Mark! Those Marmite ribs really MUST be good! I've got to try this hot new restaurant!""So I thought it was kind of unnecessary when instead you said - with nothing less than disdain - ""Did you ACTUALLY think I'd have anything earlier than that?""The answer is: yes. I ACTUALLY thought that. That's why I called.I came in for brunch and even though we were the only ones in the restaurant and the service was slow, I've been rooting for you. Again.But you know who's nicer than you? al di la. And Franny's. And Applewood.So congratulations, Mark. I'm glad that business is so good for you that you can afford to actively alienate customers. Tell me: is business this good when it's not restaurant week, too? The bottom line: [read in same tone you used with me:] Welcome to the neighborhood.ERF",1.0
It's nice to have a Kiwi restaurant in the area. Foie gras was melt in your mouth scrumptious. Ribs were fall off the bone lick the bottom of the plate goodness. Rack of lamb was cooked to perfection. Welcome to the neighborhood.,4.0
"so... this is a tough one. went for the fried chicken because I am now on a hunt to find the closest GOOD fried chicken to the apartment. read about this one and had to give it a try. the four stars are deserved, the kale slaw and mash that the chicken came with were DELISH and the chicken was cooked pretty decently, BUT, they lose a valuable star for only serving dark meat. I know, I know... you all are saying ""YOU are crazy! dark meat is the most delicious of the chicken meats! the most flavorful! the most juicy! you are the problem here!"" Perhaps. but you know what, this crazy lady only really likes the white meat and I basically left one of the three pieces allotted uneaten because I just cannot stomach the thigh. sorry folks, but it's true. I'll totally go back for brunch though or the chicken again and just ask for the drums cause I cannot stomach that thigh again.thanks for listening.",4.0
"Planning an event in this restaurant is a joke! Im still shocked after my last conversation with the chef/owner or whatever he is. Mark is very rude and unprofessional. Because I asked him 3 questions regarding planning an event at his facility he responded that ""I was getting carried away"", that he ""didnt want to go back and fwd with me or bargain with me"". One of the questions I simply asked was if i could bring white tableclothes for the event since he didnt provide them. And I'm getting carried away?!?!?!  When I responded to his email telling him that as a host I had the right to ask this type of information (ummm yeah!.....not like im not paying him!) he responded that he simply didnt want to host my event and to go elsewhere. (Seriously?!?!)  Well Thank you Mark! Because I'd be thoroughly embarrased to bring guests to a place where the owner is rude & nasty like You and ruin the whole event. So please for those of you that are planning an event dont be fooled by the restaurants website or the reviews (that are probably written by friends & family). Mark is not a person you want to make business with. If your party is less then 35 people call Gonzalo at Santo Palo. He truly is a pleasure to work with.",1.0
"Kiwiana is crazy delicious.  My family had Sunday evening reservations and the restaurant was busy but not totally packed.  We ate the following:Steamed edamame with kelp saltJerusalem artichoke soupWarm salad of poached octopus, frisee lettuce, smoked potatoes with chorizo dressingFettuccini with roasted beet and pecorino sauce, rocket and pine nutsHoropito and buttermilk fried chicken with kale slaw, mashed potatoes and truffled honeyManuka and marmite braised baby back ribs with squash puree and broccoli New Zealand snapper with saffron and chorizo risottoI can honestly say everything but the snapper was stellar.  In fact, our whole group agreed that the Jerusalem artichoke soup was the best soup we've ever had (and we are foodies).  I could eat it every day and never grow tired of it.  THAT good.  As for the snapper, it was a bit over-cooked and under seasoned but that shouldn't take away from the rest of the meal's amazingness.We also shared a wonderful bottle of wine.  When we couldn't decide between 2 bottles on the  menu, the waitress was kind enough to bring us glasses with a taste of each so we could decide.  Thinking of dessert might make me cry it was so good - Chocolate cake, Pavlova & Bread Pudding.  So, I guess this review is a long way of saying: EXCELLENT food, EXCELLENT service.  I will definitely be back and I strongly recommend that all of you Foodie Yelpers check out Kiwiana at your earliest convenience.  I am selfishly thrilled this gem is right in my Park Slope backyard. Thank you Chef Simmons and your entire staff for a lovely, memorable evening.",4.0
"Definitely try the braised baby back ribs they were really really good.  The seared diver scallops were also worth the trip.  Kiwiana is a relatively new addition to the neighborhood, but I hope that it stays for a long time.  It really is that good.We will be back!",4.0
"I've been (non-creepily-I-swear) following Chef Simmon's career for several years, and I am overjoyed that he has found his niche just blocks from my apartment. We opted to share a few plates, and the stand out was definitely the truffle-honey fried chicken. I had sampled this dish a few months ago at a yelp event, and have woken up every morning since, weeping in frustration, having dreamed of this golden substance that still eluded my taste buds. This is a MUST TRY.The beets on fluffy lavender-ricotta are nothing to sneeze at either. I could easily eat this by the boatful.While the food was amazing, the service made the evening really special. Our adorable waitress was spot-on with her suggestions (Thanks for introducing me to the Innis & Hen brew, delicious!), patient with our anxiety over ordering the perfect dish, and even commiserated with our complaints of boys who do not have adventurous palates (my ladies like a little spice).I must mention the music selection. It was played at an appropriate volume, and offered a fun, eclectic selection that pleased both my folk-lady loving self, and my hip-hop only GF, Jillian H.  A delicate balance to strike, but they pulled it off.To top off the evening, Chef bought a round of champagne for the entire restaurant to celebrate their newly minted ""A"" grade from the DoH. To an A+ evening all around, cheers, Kiwiana!",5.0
"Been wanting to try Kiwiana for months and finally made it in last Friday night for dinner. Everything was superb. The special cocktail (called the ""muffin top"") tasted like a sophisticated lemon poppyseed muffin in a highball class. Doesn't sound as appealing as it was-it was amazing. The butternut squash soup was deliciously smooth and original. We had the fried chicken and the salmon entrees, both great. We were too full for desert but look forward to coming back to try some next time.It was a bit loud but the kind and attentive service and the great food more than made up for that.",4.0
"The food here is most certainly praise-worthy, but I am continually blown away by the warmth and precision of service here. At dinner last night, my friend and I ordered the lamb and the ribs. We weren't much in the mood for starters as I was exhausted and wanted to keep dinner relatively short. Shortly after we ordered, our (incredibly handsome) Kiwi server (sucker for accents) brought out the slow poached baby beets served over lavender ricotta and almonds. He explained that the lamb would take a while to cook, so the beets were compliments of the chef. Sean, who does not like beets, loved these beets.I could further extoll the virtues of the fall-off-the-bone Marmite ribs and the brilliance of the fresh curried peas and yuca tater tots for quite some time and in meticulous detail, but I'll leave that to others. What compelled me to finally write a review for this place was that as we were finishing up, the chef came out and personally greeted the diners, asking how their meal was and thanking them for their patronage.Having been a regular Kiwiana bruncher for some time now, I've sampled everything on the brunch menu and it's all been delicious. Sometimes I'll just sidle up to the bar and have coffee and a lime and cheddar scone with that delicious chunky jam, some bacon, and coffee, chatting with the friendly servers. Other times, I'll still sidle up to the bar (best seats in the house, folks) but we'll order a spread - standouts being the NZ salmon that was on special one week, ANYTHING that comes with the potato cake, french toast with fresh whipped cream and berries (and I'm not a sweets for breakfast kind of gal).You brunchy boozehounds should also know that (1) they believe mimosas should be mostly bubbly with a touch of OJ - and they use Simply Orange, my fave, and (2) the bloody mary will exorcise any hangover you throw at it - get it with gin.

Be ready to hear your neighbors' convos and don't discuss anyhting too personal.  I really wanted to be wowed by the food but was disappointed.I started off with the Ricotta and Beets. It was bland and didn't have any contrast in the sweetness of the beets to the nuts and ricotta. For my main, I had the lamb burger. Wasn't impressed. It wasn't very flavorful and a tad bit gamey.An average place that didn't do much for me. Sorry, Mark Simmons.",3.0
"This place is excellent, and excellent value to boot. Disclaimer: the chef is a friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend, and my girlfriend and I emailed one link of the chain to get tips on what to order. The end result was that we may have gotten ""VIP"" treatment -- although nothing excessively fancy. We were served a complementary aperitif of house champagne when we sat down and we got a nice table by the window. They also threw in an amuse bouche of sorts, a salad of pea shoots, fiddleheads, and almond which was served alongside our apps (and which, incidentally, was delicious). I'm not sure if the latter touch is standard or not, but I could tell from watching other diners that the champagne was not standard. Cocktails (roughly $10 apiece): while figuring out what to order we decided to have some drinks. I followed the modern wisdom of Tyler Cowen and ordered the least appetizing sounding one. Namely, I got a Gibson, a gin-based classic made unique by being enhanced with the juice of pickled ramps. (Ramps are a type of onion.) This was a very savory libation, and to be honest I expect the flavor is too strong for many palates. Nevertheless I found it interesting if not particularly refreshing. My companion had a passionfruit and vodka-based cocktail (""Cheeky Kiwi"") which was more run-of-the-mill but quite tasty. Appetizers ($7-12): In addition to the aforementioned fiddlehead salad -- very enjoyable -- we had a frisee salad with octopus, chorizo, and smoked potatoes. The latter were the most interesting element of the dish, the smoke flavor being surprisingly prominent. We also had an app of tasty, toasted bread served with ""house-churned butter"" (A+) and pickled mussels. These may sound like an unusual ingredient, but they were smoky, briny, and delicious; this dish is definitely recommendable. The portion was also very generous. Entrees ($15-26): I had lamb rump and chop, served with a tamarind glaze, curried chickpea biscuits, and a minted pea puree. I have absolutely no complaints, the entire dish having been executed perfectly. My girlfriend had (at the recommendation of our ""in"" with the restaurant) the buttermilk-fried chicken with truffled honey, mashed potatoes, and some greenery. The bite I had was expertly seasoned, crisply fried but not dry, and very tender.  I'm personally not truffle-obsessed but the truffle honey won rave reviews.Coffee: perfectly competent. Dessert: We shared the pecan bread-pudding which was nicely salty, and reminiscent of an especially fine cinnamon roll. The ice cream with which it was served was lovely. A very small complaint: the sauce on the plate did not taste much like the advertised ""whiskey caramel"" -- no real whiskey flavor was detectable. Still, the dessert as a whole was great and we left no crumbs behind.Ambiance: Comfortable and lively on a chilly Brooklyn evening.Overall: Highly recommended. I would gladly return, especially to sample the wine list and some of the entrees I didn't get to try (many of them under $20, which is always nice).",4.0

"Pretty disappointed with my experience here. The menu was extremely limited and over-priced, and even though we visited early on a Sunday evening, service was quite slow. Our water glasses sat empty for long stretches at a time, prompting my dining companions to request more water several times. Our server was polite but mumbled and was very inarticulate and unhelpful when we inquired about certain menu items. In addition, the tomato salad we had was an odd amalgamation of chopped bits of sub-par plum tomatoes, complete with pieces of core. It wasn't seasoned at all either, and didn't seem to go along with the random few soybeans and pieces of basil.",1.0
"Kiwiana seriously knows how to bring NZ back to the states.

Will be making a return backTip: Great date spot",4.0
"Kiwiana incites a lot of contradictory feelings in me that makes me feel a little torn towards it. When Kiwiana does something right, it's perfect, but when they do something wrong, it's quite wrong.First up, I really enjoyed the ambience. It's not a place that you have to wait in line for for a Saturday brunch, so thank goodness for that. Every one of the wooden tables has a little mason jar of a single yellow rose tinged with red and some tiny purple filler flowers. Quite pretty to look at.To start, I got the scones with strawberry jam. The jam was less like a jam than a compote; the amount given was also quite stingy. I feel like if I were paying $2 for a lump of dough, I should at least be getting more jam. Next I got the eggs benedict. This eggs benedict held surprises on two levels: first, a slice of pork belly was embedded into the brioche toast, underneath the poached egg. It was quite heavenly to bit into the melting piece of meet. The second surprise was that the hollandaise sauce tasted very strongly of mayo. I couldn't bear it and it ruined my experience of the dish for me. I also really enjoyed Kiwiana's reinterpretation of hash, which was fried to an airy crisp. Imagine a rice krispy, but made with thin slices of potato. That's what the hash was like. It's not very good for sopping up sauce, but I didn't want to sop up the mayo-hollandaise anyway. I also tried the steak and eggs, and the steak was quite gorgeously cooked.So... I guess you'll just have to cross your fingers and hope your dish is good, or at least, has redeeming qualities. (P.S. Cash only for brunch.)",4.0
"Brunch review.Eggs benedict with pork belly was great.  Eggs were perfectly benedicted - yes, i'm making up words now. Their take on a hashbrown frittata thing-a-ma-jiggy was really cool and tasty.  Bloody mary was excellent.  $3 for a side order of toast - oh come on' now! A bit excessive dontcha think? I LOVE the music they play here.  Right when you walk into a place and you hear Bizarre Love Triangle playing, you know you've stumbled across somewhere special. !!",4.0
"I first came for a Yelp event and had an amazing time. Returned tonight with two girlfriends and the evening was just as good. Our friendly, laid back server recommended her favorite beer, which we happily ordered (and loved), and promptly brought out champagne for everyone in the restaurant celebrating Kiwiana's newly received 'A' restaurant rating. A+.Finely liquored up, the three of us ordered family style: beet appetizer, prawn massaman curry, fried chicken, a pureed squash side, and the chocolate cake dessert.All great, but the biggest standout was the chicken. This bird is served with truffle honey sauce which is perhaps my favorite flavor...ever. Split it with a friend or date and order an additional entree for the full experience.",5.0
"I came to this amazing restaurant because of the reviews my fellow yelpers have given this place and they were not wrong.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.First, its a small restaurant with fantastic music.  The people who work there are very nice, efficient, answer questions, and the chef's wife (owner I assume) and the chef come around to talk and check on everything.My husband and I started with the steak tartare app and the pickled mussels.  I have to say, the mussels were a surprise.  They were served in a jar with homemade butter and little pieces of bread...amazing!!  I have never had mussels this way but I will be back to have them this way again.  The steak tartare was perfect, presented with a cracked egg with the yolk in it to mix in, tremendous.Next, my husband had the ribs and I had the scallops.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the ribs were some of the best ribs we have ever had.  We ordered a side of hand cut fries which were again amazing but served with three homemade sauces.  My too favorite were the plum ketchup and the bacon something...let's call it bacon delicisioness (however you would spell that).We finished this off with a bread pudding that had a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a slight orange marmalade in it.  The total bill was around $160 with tip and drinks, a little pricey but I would pay it again!Overall this is such a nice addition to the slope and desperately needed.  You have to try this place, believe me you won't regret it.",5.0
"I have been avoiding this place, rather ignoring it, because the awning is very off-putting and it just looked a little too garish.  But it's a rainy night, and I looked at the menu online, so why not?It's much cozier and nicer when seated inside.  I will give it that. However, the acoustics are not great if you actually want to hear your dinner partner(s).  That said, a lot of the noise was coming from one table of 3, who had a myriad of people sitting with them, then getting up and leaving, changing seats, going into the kitchen. it was like a staff meal gone wild. I overheard a waitress explaining to another table that the guy at the table was ""sometimes a chef there"".  Great. So by all means give your part time staff the head table on a Saturday night so he can hold court, make out with his obnoxiously loud girlfriend and order bottle upon bottle of champagne.  The only food item I saw on their table the entire time we sat there was a piece of chocolate cake--split three ways.  Fine, do that, but don't seat those people at the front of the restaurant.Other than that bit of annoyance, the food was ok.  The chilled corn soup is quite heavenly, though the popcorn topping is cute, i get it--50 Shades of Corn, but really jarring to the senses.I had the fried chicken which was also really good.  Not as crisp as I would have liked, but still quite flavorful and tender, and above all not too salty. I did some research on the Horopito pepper before I got there, and did detect a nuanced flavor in the breading, and it was good, but I could have dealt with a bit more of it.  The kale slaw was really great, too.  Perfectly dressed, with tiny matchstick pieces of apple and carrot. A compliment to the silky potatoes that were not too heavy.  In short, my meal was very good. My partner had the salad, which was ok. Just ok. A little boring.  The main of snapper was really tasty, but the consistency of the ""risotto"" was all wrong. It was a little too loose like an Uncle Bens mix, and WAY too much saffron was involved.Our servers were very friendly and nice, and the only infraction was taking away my dining partner's plate while I was still eating.  Why this still happens is beyond me.  But thanks young miss for making me feel like I was gorging on fried chicken while someone watched and sipped water. Overall, it was a fine experienced, somewhat marred by the kids at the head table who were clearly taking advantage of the boss being away or maybe the staff discount?  I might go back, but not any time soon.",3.0
"OK, you win Kiwiana, like i knew you would. Yes you have the best fried chicken on planet earth. Now I knew this from going to the Yelp Elite event a month or so ago. In fact, it was the reason for my prompt return. But after trying it again this past Saturday, the only questions in my mind are, so when am I going back to get more?! Not to mention the master chef was so kind as to send out some delicious salmon tartar as an appetizer, just for us to try out. What a stand up guy...I can go on for days about the fried chicken or instead, you could just take my word for it and go eat it. Do it now.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I dined here for the first time this evening. It's my birthday and I work just across the street. The two of us met in NZ and have always had a fondness for all things Kiwi. So since he's in town for the event, I immediately thought of this place. We showed up early bird and were welcomed with a lovely wait staff. The food was really delicious! We started with the green lipped mussels (which was our first date meal in Havelock on the S. Island.) We shared the squash soup and had the baby back ribs and snapper for our mains. Everything was very tasty. Finishing everything off was a lovely chocolate cake, topped with a bday candle :)I'd only thing I do was add a few new NZ wines to their list and all would be superb. Glad to know this place is nearby and I'll definitely be coming back!",4.0
We have been here for brunch and also came here during dine in Brooklyn week for dinner.  Both were excellent experiences.  Everything was wonderful and the portions were just right for BK week.  We usually don't enjoy dessert but we sure did love the raspberry cake.,4.0
"Pretty disappointed with my experience here. The menu was extremely limited and over-priced, and even though we visited early on a Sunday evening, service was quite slow. Our water glasses sat empty for long stretches at a time, prompting my dining companions to request more water several times. Our server was polite but mumbled and was very inarticulate and unhelpful when we inquired about certain menu items. In addition, the tomato salad we had was an odd amalgamation of chopped bits of sub-par plum tomatoes, complete with pieces of core. It wasn't seasoned at all either, and didn't seem to go along with the random few soybeans and pieces of basil.",1.0
"Kiwiana seriously knows how to bring NZ back to the states. A bit pricey, but the food was worth the trip out to BK.Do Try:The NZ Salmon with peas and potatoesThe Raspberry lamingtonThe menu changes frequently with the seasons so this one definitely earns my 4 stars. Will be making a return backTip: Great date spot",4.0
"Kiwiana incites a lot of contradictory feelings in me that makes me feel a little torn towards it. When Kiwiana does something right, it's perfect, but when they do something wrong, it's quite wrong.First up, I really enjoyed the ambience. It's not a place that you have to wait in line for for a Saturday brunch, so thank goodness for that. Every one of the wooden tables has a little mason jar of a single yellow rose tinged with red and some tiny purple filler flowers. Quite pretty to look at.To start, I got the scones with strawberry jam. The jam was less like a jam than a compote; the amount given was also quite stingy. I feel like if I were paying $2 for a lump of dough, I should at least be getting more jam. Next I got the eggs benedict. This eggs benedict held surprises on two levels: first, a slice of pork belly was embedded into the brioche toast, underneath the poached egg. It was quite heavenly to bit into the melting piece of meet. The second surprise was that the hollandaise sauce tasted very strongly of mayo. I couldn't bear it and it ruined my experience of the dish for me. I also really enjoyed Kiwiana's reinterpretation of hash, which was fried to an airy crisp. Imagine a rice krispy, but made with thin slices of potato. That's what the hash was like. It's not very good for sopping up sauce, but I didn't want to sop up the mayo-hollandaise anyway. I also tried the steak and eggs, and the steak was quite gorgeously cooked.So... I guess you'll just have to cross your fingers and hope your dish is good, or at least, has redeeming qualities. (P.S. Cash only for brunch.)",4.0
"Brunch review.Eggs benedict with pork belly was great.  Eggs were perfectly benedicted - yes, i'm making up words now. Their take on a hashbrown frittata thing-a-ma-jiggy was really cool and tasty.  Bloody mary was excellent.  $3 for a side order of toast - oh come on' now! A bit excessive dontcha think? I LOVE the music they play here.  Right when you walk into a place and you hear Bizarre Love Triangle playing, you know you've stumbled across somewhere special. !!",4.0
"I first came for a Yelp event and had an amazing time. Returned tonight with two girlfriends and the evening was just as good. Our friendly, laid back server recommended her favorite beer, which we happily ordered (and loved), and promptly brought out champagne for everyone in the restaurant celebrating Kiwiana's newly received 'A' restaurant rating. A+.Finely liquored up, the three of us ordered family style: beet appetizer, prawn massaman curry, fried chicken, a pureed squash side, and the chocolate cake dessert.All great, but the biggest standout was the chicken. This bird is served with truffle honey sauce which is perhaps my favorite flavor...ever. Split it with a friend or date and order an additional entree for the full experience.",5.0
"I came to this amazing restaurant because of the reviews my fellow yelpers have given this place and they were not wrong.  This was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.First, its a small restaurant with fantastic music.  The people who work there are very nice, efficient, answer questions, and the chef's wife (owner I assume) and the chef come around to talk and check on everything.My husband and I started with the steak tartare app and the pickled mussels.  I have to say, the mussels were a surprise.  They were served in a jar with homemade butter and little pieces of bread...amazing!!  I have never had mussels this way but I will be back to have them this way again.  The steak tartare was perfect, presented with a cracked egg with the yolk in it to mix in, tremendous.Next, my husband had the ribs and I had the scallops.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and the ribs were some of the best ribs we have ever had.  We ordered a side of hand cut fries which were again amazing but served with three homemade sauces.  My too favorite were the plum ketchup and the bacon something...let's call it bacon delicisioness (however you would spell that).We finished this off with a bread pudding that had a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a slight orange marmalade in it.  The total bill was around $160 with tip and drinks, a little pricey but I would pay it again!Overall this is such a nice addition to the slope and desperately needed.  You have to try this place, believe me you won't regret it.",5.0
"I have been avoiding this place, rather ignoring it, because the awning is very off-putting and it just looked a little too garish.  But it's a rainy night, and I looked at the menu online, so why not?It's much cozier and nicer when seated inside.  I will give it that. However, the acoustics are not great if you actually want to hear your dinner partner(s).  That said, a lot of the noise was coming from one table of 3, who had a myriad of people sitting with them, then getting up and leaving, changing seats, going into the kitchen. it was like a staff meal gone wild.

We sent it back, got the check, and bounced.I am giving Kiwiana two stars because the staff was really nice. they cant help it if the food sucks or the portions are tiny.Wouldnt bother going back.

"Kiwiana is a surprise found.  We were trying to find a lunch place before we went to Brooklyn Museum.  Egg benefit is very special here.  It's doesn't have the smoked salmon.  It's made by braised pork belly, poached eggs, brioche and hollandaise.  Kiwi mimosa is special and delicious as well.  The price is very reasonable.  I am looking forward to visit them again soon.",4.0
"WOW.  As a neighbor of Kiwiana, I'm excited to have acquired an uber-local restaurant that joins the ranks of Rosewater and Palo Santo.We stopped in for dinner on opening night, but (impressively) the only hint of prematurity was the lack of libations, which we purchased from around the corner upon sitting down (they held the table - bonus points!).The manuka (an herb) and Marmite-braised baby-back ribs are aMAzing. They arrive falling off the bone, bursting with flavor, and deliciously accompanied by a sweet squash puree.The New Zealand snapper was absolutely delicious, but admittedly only won its praise after we'd licked the ribs' plate clean.  The tomato and chili sauce is delicately complex, the braised fennel subtly brined, the snapper skin lightly crisped, and everything perfectly seasoned.Fear not, drinkers, I think Kiwiana fully opens with a selection of wine and beers in just a few days.  We'll definitely be going back soon.  For sure.  YUM.",4.0

"Solid food.  Chef Mark Simmons does a mean mesquite and manuka honey baby back rib that falls straight off the bone.  The veggies accompanying the entree were a little uninspired, however - boiled broccoli and spaghetti squash, with very little seasoning if any.  My girlfriend got the buttermilk fried chicken, which was nice but not mind-blowing.  Dare I say it?  Popeye's is better.  The skin of the chicken was well-rubbed with spices and herbs, but the chicken itself lacked salt, a problem only exacerbated by the sweet honey dipping sauce (which, by itself, was delicious).Regarding the appetizers, the very awesome peaches was just not my thing.  The peaches were strangely dry and unsweet, and the ricotta cheese was similarly flavorless (neither salty nor sweet).  The one redeeming feature of the plate was the jam on the side, although as a whole, it was very refreshing on a humid summer's day.  The other appetizer we shared was the chili corn cold soup, which was quite nice.  Generous lumps of crabmeat and little crunchy popcorn really topped the entire dish off.Came here on a Sunday night for dinner and it wasn't crowded around 6pm.  Spent $69 (including tax/tip) between two people, ordering two entrees and two appetizers.  Very reasonably priced!",3.0
"We finally made it into Kiwiana last night to check up on my former co-worker, Chef Mark, in his new place.  Truthfully, I don't usually write reviews, but after dinner last night I felt that I must....Decor: Super cute.  It's homey.  It's comfortable. Well done.Drinks: Our cocktails were delicious- ""The Farmer's Daughter"" is great.  I had a passionfruit, vodka something that was super tasty.Service: Spot on.  We really appreciated that the servers were all working together to make sure everything got done as it should.  Food: The chilled corn soup is seriously super tasty.  It seems so simple, but a lot of places screw up edamame- mine here was perfectly steamed and seasoned/salted.I also tried a nice summer squash special with a delicious, curry type sauce.Then the NZ Snapper- fantastic with a flavorful risotto and peas...My Hubs had:  Oysters and Steak Tartare.  He LOVES this steak tartare.  Then he had the lamb.  His comments, ""That man really knows how to cook lamb.""  Then while enjoying his bread pudding with whiskey caramel sauce, he commented on the whole meal by saying, ""I sure have missed Mark's food in my life!""Can't believe it took us so long get here.  It was fantastic.

"Solid food.  Chef Mark Simmons does a mean mesquite and manuka honey baby back rib that falls straight off the bone.  The veggies accompanying the entree were a little uninspired, however - boiled broccoli and spaghetti squash, with very little seasoning if any.  My girlfriend got the buttermilk fried chicken, which was nice but not mind-blowing.  Dare I say it?  Popeye's is better.  The skin of the chicken was well-rubbed with spices and herbs, but the chicken itself lacked salt, a problem only exacerbated by the sweet honey dipping sauce (which, by itself, was delicious).Regarding the appetizers, the very awesome peaches was just not my thing.  The peaches were strangely dry and unsweet, and the ricotta cheese was similarly flavorless (neither salty nor sweet).  The one redeeming feature of the plate was the jam on the side, although as a whole, it was very refreshing on a humid summer's day.  The other appetizer we shared was the chili corn cold soup, which was quite nice.  Generous lumps of crabmeat and little crunchy popcorn really topped the entire dish off.Came here on a Sunday night for dinner and it wasn't crowded around 6pm.  Spent $69 (including tax/tip) between two people, ordering two entrees and two appetizers.  Very reasonably priced!",3.0
"We finally made it into Kiwiana last night to check up on my former co-worker, Chef Mark, in his new place.  Truthfully, I don't usually write reviews, but after dinner last night I felt that I must....Decor: Super cute.  It's homey.  It's comfortable. Well done.Drinks: Our cocktails were delicious- ""The Farmer's Daughter"" is great.  I had a passionfruit, vodka something that was super tasty.Service: Spot on.  We really appreciated that the servers were all working together to make sure everything got done as it should.  Food: The chilled corn soup is seriously super tasty.  It seems so simple, but a lot of places screw up edamame- mine here was perfectly steamed and seasoned/salted.I also tried a nice summer squash special with a delicious, curry type sauce.Then the NZ Snapper- fantastic with a flavorful risotto and peas...My Hubs had:  Oysters and Steak Tartare.  He LOVES this steak tartare.  Then he had the lamb.  His comments, ""That man really knows how to cook lamb.""  Then while enjoying his bread pudding with whiskey caramel sauce, he commented on the whole meal by saying, ""I sure have missed Mark's food in my life!""Can't believe it took us so long get here.  It was fantastic. You should go eat there.Kudos Chef Mark!",5.0
"What can I say?!  Every visit here is just a climatic experience!  I've not gone and had a bad experience, I leave each time feeling like it was my first.  This is one place I hope to be experiencing for years to come!This review is from Feb. 2012..seems I nevered posted it.  Doesn't matter however sentiments are still the same today.  Seriously...I was just there again Sunday.  I think I'm a semi-KIWIANA addict!  I don't want any intervention though, just let me be!!!",5.0
"Fantastic accidental experience as an alternative to the 40minute wait for Rosewater down the street.  Quaint and clean interior with excellent service.  The only downside I can think of is that there is only one bathroom, so plan your break wisely during a crowded day.  Now for the food.My friends ordered the vegetable pie with pear chutney which they gave an excellent review.  The Eggs Florentine I experienced literally gave me a food orgasm.  The most divine flavor I've tasted in a breakfast dish, and the portion was just right.  If you want an experience like that, go now.BTW they offer you booze in the morning, so if you need a little hair of the dog during Sunday brunch, look no further.",4.0

"I'll admit that we went to Kiwiana mostly because we're total Top Chef dorks and wanted to see what Mark Simmons was up to since Season 4.  Lucky us, he made us some of the best food we've had in awhile!  I was there with three other people and I can say that we all loved our food.  We got appetizers (beets and mussels), entrees, and desserts (molten cake and raspberry lamington) and everything was delicious.  I had the fried chicken and it was incredible.  I didn't love the kale slaw, but that's probably just me.  My husband loved the baby-back ribs.  The butter that came with the mussels and bread could have been eaten with a spoon... yum!  Same goes for the honey with the fried chicken.  The place shouldn't be listed as American food, though, because it is a New Zealand place and features a lot of spices and ingredients unfamiliar to the American palate.  The waiter was great answering questions and brought us over the spice containers so we could see and smell things before we ordered.  The service, across the board, was fantastic.   We had tiny complaints about the potatoes that came with the veggie pie (a little bland and unnecessary... another vegetable would have been nice) and the relatively small size of the snapper, but they didn't change our overall opinion of the place.  We will definitely be back, many times.  Thanks, chef!",5.0
"We came here last Saturday because I really wanted pavlova, and Kiwiana completely met my expectations on this front. In fact, all three desserts we tried - the pavlova, the panna cotta, and the raspberry lamington - were gorgeous. They were fruity and fresh and light and wonderful. The mains were only okay, though. My husband had the lamb, which he saw was middling, and the bean cassoulet that came with it he described as ""like eating pork and beans, without the goodness of the pork."" So there you have it. I had the venison osso bucco, which we both liked, although I discovered I prefer pork or beef to venison, which tasted a bit too much like animal for me. The appetizer we had - beets with riccotta - was good, better than mediocre, but nothing mind blowing.",3.0

"Very nice.  I came in and immediately got a table at 2 pm on a Saturday.  Amazing! Of course, we went for brunch.  I got the fry up($16) and my friend decided on the Angus Steak and eggs( I enjoyed eating the delicious brownie(home fries), bacon, sunny side fried eggs, and toast with sausage.  It was so good.  I enjoyed it greatly.  I am delighted by the size of the Angus steak and eggs that my friend ordered.  It was a juicy steak for medium well.  Our waitress was funny, humble, and hilarious.  I would definitely come back.  The establishment is also adorable with the oldies music playing the background.  I also enjoyed the tea that came in a cute teapot.  It was quiet charming way to enjoy one's warm beverage.  I got Earl Grey and it came with carafe of milk.  I thought all the waitresses were all nice and asked us if we needed anything.  They took care of us.  I felt that the meals came after 20 minutes after we ordered, which is very reasonable.

They're actually served cold and brined in a jar, which I wasn't expecting, but it was a great sweet n salty combo. The ribs fell right of the bone and had a delicious sweet and tangy sauce. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and cooked. DEFINITELY try it! Overall, 5 stars for the food!SERVICEService was impeccable, yet warm. The waiters/ waitresses were very attentive and carefully explained the menu. My water glass never went empty, and my waitress checked in on me regularly throughout the meal. 5 stars!AMBIANCE Ambiance was a mixed bag. The decor is very homey and even a tad romantic. There were fresh roses and a candlelight on each table and the tables and chairs looked like they were out of the 50s. Felt like I was eating in a warm kitchen. The setup, however, was pretty awkward. Tables were WAY too close together (as in 2"" between tables), and I was able to hear the conversation of a lady 2 tables down! In addition, because the tables were so close together, you couldn't walk around your table, so if you needed to step to the bathroom, you had to ask your neighbor to slide out of the bench. AWKWARD. 3 stars, and thats only because of the decor. OVERALLOverall, I enjoyed my dining experience. I'll return because the food was really well done, but I do wish they'd rethink their setup.

"The food here is absolutely incredible.  The chilled corn soup with some sort of spicy oil, plus super fresh avocados and a few kernels of popcorn, is the best summer dish I've had in a while.  But really, what I have to come back for again and again is the fried chicken with the spicy truffle honey.  It's just unreal how good the flavors are in this chicken.Kiwiana also just seems so special -- every detail of the place was chosen by Mark Simmons, the amazing chef.  It has a vintagey feel (down to the 1950s wallpaper), but one that isn't trying too hard -- everything about the place feels genuine and homey.  A wonderful addition to Union Street!",5.0

"I just got back from an excellent meal at Kiwiana, and highly recommend it. Appetizers - mussels were so good that I ordered them twice (the second batch I ordered when I was halfway through my entree). The juice they're in is so tasty that I drank it straight from the jar - it'd make a really interesting cocktail if mixed with vodka. As others have mentioned, the soup is really good as well. Steak Tartare - this was good - I liked the presentation with the egg yolk in the shell on top, but not as tasty as the apps mentioned above. Note - it was angus steak, not wagyu which is listed on the website. Mains - Ribs are fantastic. Melt in the mouth, absolutely delicious. You wil not regret ordering them. Chicken - a superb example of fried chicken, made even better by the truffle honey. So so good. Desserts: the must order is the Lamingtons. Absolutely divine, and really brought back memories of New Zealand. Passion fruit flan was excellent, as was the milo molten cake - which had a slightly salty edge to it; not a bad thing in this dessert. Pavlova not on menu currently - I look forward to trying that when they start serving (something to do with the oven I believe) in a week or so. Service was excellent - likely helped by the fact that the restaurant wasn't as busy as it deserves to be. The head chef Mark came around and visited each table - a super nice guy, and really deserves to succeed with this restaurant. Note: Currently is cash only. BYOB for the next few weeks - 7th Avenue wine store around the corner has a good selection; I had the Oyster Bay Pinot Noir, to fit in with the New Zealand theme. I look forward to when they get their liquor license and have steinlager pure, great NZ wines, and 42 Below on the menu. Minor nits: Felt rather warm, could do with the AC up. Front door doesn't open/close that easily, not a big deal. I don't understand the person that gave this place 1 star - I'd rank it 4.5 stars overall, but am rounding up for the fantastic meal and very fair prices.",5.0
"Just had my first dinner at Kiwiana with a group of 5 diners.  We shared a few appetizers-the squash soup, pickled mussels, and the salad with grapes and cashews.  All unique and with great attention to presentation.  For the main course, three of us chose the fried chicken with truffle honey, grilled corn, and kale slaw.  Super crispy and the honey is a fantastic touch.  The grilled corn on the cob has a spicy butter, and the kale slaw is a crunchy, tangy contrast to the sweetness of the other components.  The short ribs with marmite were falling off the bone tender, and the lamb with bubble and squeak was a beautiful dish with perfectly cooked lamb.The portions are sane, which leaves room for the amazing desserts. We chose to share one of each-the molten chocolate cake, passion fruit flan, and the raspberry lamington.  The lamingtons are light as a feather-perfect pink delights, and the molten chocolate cake was dark and warm and delicious.  I would not have ordered the flan if I had not read other reviews, as I am usually not a big fan, but this was such intensely flavored and creamy-ended up being my favorite of the three.  I am going to be dreaming about that one.  Wine was reasonably priced, and the service was knowledgeable and attentive.  Warm and cozy vibe-loved it.",5.0

"My friend and I stopped by for a leisurely brunch after a trip to the Brooklyn Botantical Garden and the food was delicious! We started off by ordering a scone, which was perfection.

I ordered a side of bacon and the Chai-seasoned French Toast, which was perfect. The french toast was very thick and fluffy and really did taste like the spices used in making masala chai. It came with fresh whipped cream and a blend of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and kiwi - basically all my favorite fruits. We ordered 2 rounds of drinks - and had the kiwi mimosa (good, and a nice mix of sweet and tart), and the passionfruit mimosa (good, but a bit too sweet for me), and a bloody mary, which was too spicy for my friends liking.

"My new favorite brunch spot (and dinner is great, too). This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. I've been for brunch a couple of times so far and plan to go back many more.  The french toast actually tastes like it has egg in it (instead of tasting like bread fried in butter, like many places serve), the potato hash is amazing, and the sliders are a nice savory option.  Friends have had pretty much everything else on the brunch menu and have seemed to really think it was all great. The ribs on the dinner menu are some of the best I've had.  They just fall off the bone and melt in your mouth plus they are seasoned well.  I've had trouble ordering anything else after trying the ribs, but my boyfriend and friends we've taken there assure me it's all awesome.  The flan and chocolate cake are also excellent.",5.0
Incredible food that is worth trekking to Brooklyn for. The cold corn soup is a perfect summer treat. The buttermilk chicken is not to be missed--the truffle honey makes it even better. And the ribs are so tender they fall off the bone. My recommendation for dessert is the passion fruit flan--but i would be willing to bet they are all fabulous.    So good I'll definitely be back!

"I really wanted to like this place! The decor and atmosphere are great, very laid back and pleasant. But I didn't like the food, who knows maybe I ordered the wrong things? Everything we had was just so salty! Granted one of the items was fried but still even that was overly salted in comparison to the plethora of fried foods I've enjoyed in my lifetime. The one item I liked was the side of kale slaw, it was really fresh tasting. I also enjoyed one of their beers I had never tried before. It's called Innis & Gunn and it's aged in run casks. Who knows maybe ill give this place another shot some day, like I said before I really wanted to like it!!!",3.0
"Visited last night with a party of seven and therefore able to sample almost the entire menu. Not one morsel of food was less than delicious.  The smoked pickled muscles were unique in flavor, but not overpowering so definitely worth sampling and getting out of your comfort zone. The octopus was expertly cooked so that it received a nice char on the outside but still retained its moist inside. Paired with chorizo and frisee it was a great appetizer to whet your palate.  The soup was thick and creamy and devoured by all at the table.  We got a plate of the raw oysters and they had a briny taste particular to LI shellfish and were plump and accompanied by a tangy mignonette. Then came the entrees and we all lost our mind. Each one of us put all civility to the side and were practically engaged in fork duels just to get another bite off of each others  plate. Everything was perfectly cooked, I actually loudly exclaimed ""oh my god!"" when I took my first bite of the scallops.  It wasn't just seared to perfection, the expert chef in the kitchen created this salty thin crust that was a stellar match for the creamy cauliflower underneath and sprinkling of fried kale bits on top. Each dish held its own and offered a layering of flavor, texture and whimsy. The venison was purple, seasoned well and juicy. The fish - flaky and atop a creamy risotto. The lamb was paired with smashed curry peas that left my friend who's an incredible Indian cook ask ""what have I been doing wrong in the kitchen?""  Even the lamb burger was brought to the next level with a dense brioche bun able to handle the juicy meat and a layer of beet root that gave it a crunch with every bite. Then came dessert. So typically I love sharing dessert with a friend to absolve my sweet craving but not get so full that i have to be carried out of the restaurant.  But, with every dish being so stellar we decided to get one of each dessert and throw care to the wind...I mean how hard could it be to waddle home ten blocks? Again, the collective moaning of how good everything tasted began and was only interrupted by more forkfuls to the mouth.  The pecan bourbon bread pudding was studded with caraway that gave it a nice spice that counterbalanced all the sweet ice cream and caramel drizzle. The molten chocolate cake was rich and oozed fudge, even the passion fruit custard was exciting. A tropical escape with each bite.Go to Kiwiana!!! The food is amazing! The service is laid back but attentive. The decor is intimate and studded with authentic NZ nostalgia. Even the wine and beer list rocks.",5.0

"We were very excited to try a new cuisine in the Slope on our monthly tour of Park Slope Restaurant, and as an added bonus, we were excited to find out it was Mark Simmons' (Top Chef) restaurant.  If this is authentic New Zealand cuisine, then we think everyone at our table who dined at Kiwiana would be quite happy to live in New Zealand just for the food!  We had a range of dishes and all were delicious.  The lamb burger with the fried egg on top of it was such an intense burger, I personally will be coming back for that again.  Another person at our table ordered the tilapia and claimed ""it melted in her mouth"" and that this is how fish should be prepared.  Another had the diver scallops and we believe she's still dreaming about how yummy it was.  We also ordered a beet salad, salmon ceviche, and edamame--all delicious.  To add to our dining experience, the Chef Mark greeted not only our table, but all the tables at the restaurant and thanked us for coming to his restaurant!  Overall, this place has amazing food start-to-finish in a very casual, comfortable atmosphere.  We all took a glance at the brunch menu and I know a few of us were already thinking of making a trip back to his place to try brunch.  Also, this place is BYO for the time being so go around the block to the wine shop, pick up a bottle of New Zealand Pinot for $15 and bring it to dinner!  This place is a must try in the slope!-Larry (on behalf of the Park Slope Dinner Club)",5.0

Overall a cute, clean spot with good food and  pleasant service. I will definitely be back!!!",3.0
"Great food, great wine, and great service!! We went here after searching for a place we had not been to before on Yelp. What a wonderful surprise!! Beets, beets, and more beets. I  highly recommend the fettuccine with beets- I am still thinking about this. We will definitely go back- one of my top 10 places to eat in Brooklyn!",4.0

"Only came for dessert, it's a lovely place with very attentive and dedicated staff. Me and my friends tried all of the desserts, and I have to say, it is hard to say which one is the best, for me it's a tie between the milo molten cake and the raspberry lamingtons, which were surprisingly light and delicious.",4.0
"We were very excited to try a new cuisine in the Slope on our monthly tour of Park Slope Restaurant, and as an added bonus, we were excited to find out it was Mark Simmons' (Top Chef) restaurant.  If this is authentic New Zealand cuisine, then we think everyone at our table who dined at Kiwiana would be quite happy to live in New Zealand just for the food!  We had a range of dishes and all were delicious.  The lamb burger with the fried egg on top of it was such an intense burger, I personally will be coming back for that again.  Another person at our table ordered the tilapia and claimed ""it melted in her mouth"" and that this is how fish should be prepared.  Another had the diver scallops and we believe she's still dreaming about how yummy it was.  We also ordered a beet salad, salmon ceviche, and edamame--all delicious.  To add to our dining experience, the Chef Mark greeted not only our table, but all the tables at the restaurant and thanked us for coming to his restaurant!  Overall, this place has amazing food start-to-finish in a very casual, comfortable atmosphere.  We all took a glance at the brunch menu and I know a few of us were already thinking of making a trip back to his place to try brunch.  Also, this place is BYO for the time being so go around the block to the wine shop, pick up a bottle of New Zealand Pinot for $15 and bring it to dinner!  This place is a must try in the slope!-Larry (on behalf of the Park Slope Dinner Club)",5.0
"Very good but rich food, not very many vegetarian options",4.0
I have to Kiwiana twice. Both times I truly enjoyed myself. The space is nicely decorated and very peaceful. The Chef was nice and very friendly. The staff are great too. The food is excellent. I love the eggs Benedict with pork belly. It was so perfect. The fried chicken and the ribs are both exceptional. I can think of nothing to complain about.,5.0
"If this is New Zealand cuisine, slap me on the ass and call me a kiwi. The food here is absolutely fantastic and the service is very good as well. We had four items; the beet and ricotta salad, the smoked pickled mussels, the babyback pork ribs and the fried chicken. The beet salad was tasty but nothing worth writing home about. The mussels though, served in a tiny jar of pickling juice, were absolutely a taste explosion. I woke up thinking about them, and I'm thinking I might just have to get some ""to go"". My only regret was that the bits of toast served with them didn't add anything, and might as well have been left off the plate. The ribs were absolutely fantastic - served as a semi-rack in a rich ""marmite"" (don't let that dissuade you) barbecue sauce that was perfectly balanced with sweetness and spice.   The chicken was delicious, moist and cruncy, and served with a sweet honey sauce (the chef definitely likes his sweet-and-salty combinations). The desert - a bread pudding, was somewhat disappointing but perhaps only in contrast to the rest of the meal.The prices here are a little high, but not our of line with other restaurants of this caliber; most appetizers around $10, many entrees between $20-$25. Overall a very good restaurant that I will be returning to.",5.0
