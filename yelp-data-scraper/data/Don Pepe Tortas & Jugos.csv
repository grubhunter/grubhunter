"Don Pepe's has what I want in a food joint: amazing food, lots of options, and great value. As their name suggests, they specialize in tortas (sandwiches) and jugos (juices). There are literally dozens of menu items of both. There are even large pictures of each torta on the wall to help you decide on what you want. The tortas are huge. Really, take a look at some of the photos, they're packed with layers of meat and cheese and guac and whatever else you might want. These delicious sandwiches can qualify as enough for 2 meals and yet they range from $8-9. The juices are made to order from fresh ingredients and, as with the tortas, there are a TON of choices. The place itself is set up like a convenience store and in a way it is. They offer various Mexican snacks and beverages. But the back of the store is where the sandwich counter is and a few tables and chairs for eating in. The walls in the back are lined with colorful antiques and decorations that are for sale and add a bit of charm to the restaurant. This place is tucked away on 5th Avenue in Sunset Park, but if it were in an area with more exposure like Manhattan, I'm sure it would blow up and become incredibly popular. But I like it this way, a gem of a place that I can go back to over and over.",5.0
"This place is so indiscretely amazing. It is in the back of a convenience store, but they make amazing tortas. I ate the al pastor torta and will definitely be back again.Well done!",5.0
"I was starving after a soccer game and stumbled across this place with a bunch of friends. I ordered a Torta de Milanesa de Res and some lemonade.  The Torta was bigger than what most places give out so that was nice,  but for me the torta wasn't all that good, it wasn't bad either but I've certainly had better ones before. The lemonade was delicious and very refreshing something I definitely needed after a game. I won't let that torta cloud my judgment on the place,  I'll just try out something different from their selection of tortas.",4.0
"I've been eating a lot of sandwiches lately. And by lately, I mean the last 30 years or so. And I can honestly say that I've never had a sandwich like the tortas they've got here.These things are just stacks on stacks on stacks of FLAVOR. I got the Hawaiiana: carne enchilada, jamon, tocino, piña, queso fresco, quesillo (doble queso).For you gringos: spicy pork, ham, bacon, pineapple, and cheese (these are all my favorite things).My friend got the Espagnola: salchicha, jamon, tocino, huevo, queso fresco, quesillo, papas de casa. I'm not going to translate that one, because you should have learned Spanish by now. We split them, and I must tell you, both of these tortas were massively, painfully delicious. So many flavors. So much happy. Downsides: 1. You've got to wait as they stack these things. All good things take time. 2. Eat the whole thing, and you will destroy your entire day. And possibly your health. But as they say, if you haven't got a torta from Don Pepe, you haven't got anything.",5.0
"Great deal for sandwiches and smoothies. The smoothies are fresh and the food is good. Hawaiian sandwich is good and my dad liked the Cuban sandwich, a lot of meat. There is some seating. I definitely want to come back and try the other types of sandwiches. My only complaint is the wait. it's a long one. I know they're making all the sandwiches fresh bus how would they deal with multiple customers?  Everyone is friendly. The island blast smoothie is good.",4.0
"the tortas from Don Pepe are large and delicious. I haven't had any of the juices yet, but judging from the sandwiches I've had here these guys easily get 5 stars. the sandwiches take a while, but that is what it takes to make a well-prepared, well-constructed, 100% excellent torta.",5.0
"Honestly, I came here hoping that I could find a chamango/magoneada. Nope, they didn't know what I was talking about. They had something similar, Mango Chili smoothie. Okay, I got that instead. I should've gotten the regular to share because that actually looked like a normal sized Medium drink. What was missing in this were chunks of mangos (which is what a Chamango has) But nonetheless it was really refreshing, spicy and sour and GREAT. The tamarind straw was a bit too thick and chewy in my opinion. Now onto the torta. Lord almighty, they have so many options... it's overwhelming! Everyone here mentioned it already, but I'll mention it to in case it's not expressed enough... You have to wait a long time for the torta to be stacked. This sandwich is not a joke. It's good for two people to share ($9). I believe we had the De La Casa. It's cheesy, meaty, bursting with flavaaaa. Get it, it's bomb. Enough said.",4.0

"this place was recommended to me by a friend and the torta was amazing. I got the chorizo with potato and jalapenos and it came with some Mexican cheese. I also ordered a green juice, a bean and cheese burrito and chx empanadas. I would stick with just the torta and the empanadas next time. The Burrito was very dry for $8. So 1 torta, 1 empanada, 1 burrito and 1 green juice ended up being $25 so it's a bit pricey.but it's a nice set up and there's little tables or you can eat or take your stuff to the park.",4.0
This place is simply nasty. I just ate two bites of a torta arabe and it was horribly salty. I tried to exchange it for something else and the guy behind the counter said I should just get my money back. He said he was worried I would also return that. Not much confidence in his food. They also put a ton of sugar in their juices and i wanted to exchange that and the lady was rude so I got my money back and split. Fuggedaboutit.,1.0
"Since my foray into veganism, I have been severely limited on options for takeout in Sunset Park. I knew this place sold juice, but given the area, I doubted they meant the healthy kind. They did. Lol I come here often, but not too often, as they are pricey for the juices for non organic produce. They do offer some big sizes though so that is a perk, the large is great for breakfast! I also like that they offer a huge selection of juices compared to other places, and they are nice and let you even pick 4-5 of the ingredients available to make your own custom juice! That is the biggest plus to me and why I come here. The guys are all friendly and service is quick. Never had a torta here but this is the closet to a health food spot in this neighborhood. They sell some unique protein and granola bars and other healthy on the go options like yogurt and fruit/veggie salads. Again, a bit over priced for being non organic (they cost the same as organic fruit/veggie salad in Whole Foods!) but fantastic when I'm at home or going to work and want takeout. Definitely stop by, they also have smoothies and juices made with mostly fruits if healthy and green isn't your thing ;)",4.0

"I finally had an opportunity to try the food, courtesy of my husband who wanted empanadas. so of course, in true greedy girl fashion, I couldn't JUST get empanadas.  I got 4 chicken empanadas, tacos arabes (roasted pork with onions and chipotle sauce served with radishes) and a cubana torta (their best seller).  Everything was good.  The chicken in the empanadas was so juicy is was practically spilling down my arm.  Even stayed juicy the next day!!  As I was leaving, the guy at the counter told me to try the cheese empanadas.  You know I'm game!!",5.0

The tortas (and smoothies) are freshly crafted while you wait at tables in the back. If you are up for a meat experience, order the Toluca torta.

One side note- if you expect fast food or if you are looking for vegan or vegetarian tortas, Puebla Mini Market is not the place for you. Friends have witnessed customers upset about the time it takes to freshly prepare/cook the tortas (perhaps they'd prefer day-old tortas?) and I've heard of a few incidents where customers requested vegan tortas despite the very clear meat/cheese-centric menu.

After reviewing Puebla's wide selections of tortas offered, I still stuck to the Hawaiian one (spicy pork, ham, pineapples, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes). It was so delicious!!

Even Mexico doesn't have the best tortas, because their ingredients are subpar - and California doesn't have the best tortas because they're too stoned to make them right. ZING!If it were physically possible, I would order everything on that menu and eat it all at once like Kobayashi. Their fresh fruit smoothies are also amazing, you MUST try them.  UNG!i'm pretty sure these guys were sent down to Brooklyn from the Mexican Mount Olympus, by the Mexican Zeus. He said, go forth, my minions, and make the best mo'phoken tortas in the world! Hot Damn!  it's like they sprinkled crack cocaine on them b-words...

"A sign saying ""TORTAS"" was enough to get me in the door. The guy behind the counter asked me whether it was my first time there. He proudly showed me a framed article from TONY about the place when I said it was. He then proceeded to make two of the best overstuffed Mexican sandwiches my wife and I ever had. It was a little tough to choose, as they make 32 varieties, but the al pastor and the steak were both excellent. The steak was like a Mexican version of a Philly cheesesteak. The al pastor was very good, but I disagreed with the pineapple salsa on it. Not that it was a bad choice, but the fruit was unnecessary - the meat had plenty of flavor to carry the sandwich.The front counter makes fresh juices, which were good also. The rest of the place is a Mexican market, selling groceries, knick-knacks and pinatas. I'm kinda torn between four and five stars here. The prices are fair, the staff are friendly, the tortas are great, the portions generous and the place is charming as all get out. The food is a little on the heavy/greasy side, but the juices feel healthy. I'll give them four stars for now, but will be back before too long.",4.0

"This review is for Tortas A La Plancha Don Pepe.  Like many other bodegas/mini markets, the restaurant is in the back.After reading the Village Voice's review about this place (blogs.villagevoice.com/f…), I knew I had to try it.Now I'm not going to go as far into depth as the Voice reporter did, nor am I going to reiterate.  That's just pointless.  But what I will do is say that I think the Voice speaks a bit too highly of the place.  And before I get into its shortcomings, let me say right now that the torta was pretty good.  In many places, this would probably be an amazing torta, and something worth going out of your way for.  But here in the Sunset Park/South Slope area, it didn't win me over.Bread - I believe that tortas should have a nice, soft roll.  Maybe a little bit crusty on the outside, but be very easy to bit through and soak up some of the flavor of the torta, and be griddled.  Don Pepe's bread is pressed in a machine, similar to how a Cuban sandwich is done.  Nothing wrong with that in the abstract, but it's now how I want my torta.Mess - The torta was also too neat.  There were very distinct layers of the torta.  It was almost like a torta parfait.  Some people like this kind of cooking, but I subscribe to the torta theory of ""If It doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face"".Carne Asada - The end of it was a bit tough.  They served it in as a long piece, which works if it's high quality beef, but what I got was simply average.I also tried a taco al pastor, which was good, though pretty greasy.Again, I know I sound harsh, but when a place gets the ""best"" title thrown at it, I felt it necessary to deflect.",4.0
"This place used to be outstanding, probably the best tortas in New York,  maybe 5 years ago. However as they got mas popular they sold out, raising prices, remodeling, and hiring new staff. These days the scent of nostalgia dominates the old dining area",3.0
"This is a small little unassuming food market that sells chips, candy, canned goods etc. What you don't expect is in the back of the store there is magician capable of making your taste buds do the merengue by combining meats, avocado and bread together. I decided to step into this store one day to try the tortas. Couldn't hurt right? The store is brightly lit, slightly kitschy but extremely clean. I ordered the number 24 (torta de casa?) with my roommate and took it to go.It consists of avocado, spicy pork, beef, egg, bacon, beans, turkey mozzarella and cheese. The smell of the sandwich was intoxicating. Once we got home, we ripped open the bag and took a bite. At first bite it was like a flavor pinata exploded my mouth. The meat was tender and flavorful, quite possibly one of the best things I've had in a while. I'm already planning my next trip back. I think if you love meat and if you love spending less than 10 dollars this is the place for you.Also if you love guacamole, they sell the best avocados. They're about 2.50-2.75 each and I'm pretty sure they're the same avocados used at Rosa mexicanos or Dos Caminos. I used these to make the best guacamole ever.",5.0

"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have more than one review (this would be the 2nd one) After seeing this place in TimeOut NY I decided to hit this place up to try and the infamous torta's. It's labeled one of the 10 Best Sandwiches in NYC. Puebla Mini Market is a typical mexican style grocery store. They have all the essentials that you need. Canned goods, candy, drinks, pinatas and other goods that you find at your local ""bodega"". What is different about this place is the food that they serve in the back of the store. The TORTAS! A torta is a Mexican Sandwich that consists of assorted meats with onion, lettuce, avocado, beans and queso. The possibilities are endless. I got the #14 which consists of the ingredients above with ham, bacon and beef. They stack the torta good with lots of ingredients. It's really big that I would need to stretch my jaw to get a good bite of everything. It hit the spot good. The prices are good. The average price is about $6 or 7 for a torta. This beats Subway's $5 footlong any day.",5.0

"Wow Hombre, this place is the bombdigadocious for real.  People need not front any longer, and give this place some straight up 5 star reviews. UNG!I've been all over the world, and this place has by far THE BEST tortas, hands down. Even Mexico doesn't have the best tortas, because their ingredients are subpar - and California doesn't have the best tortas because they're too stoned to make them right. ZING!If it were physically possible, I would order everything on that menu and eat it all at once like Kobayashi. Their fresh fruit smoothies are also amazing, you MUST try them.  UNG!i'm pretty sure these guys were sent down to Brooklyn from the Mexican Mount Olympus, by the Mexican Zeus. He said, go forth, my minions, and make the best mo'phoken tortas in the world! Hot Damn!  it's like they sprinkled crack cocaine on them b-words... ZING!There is no other place like this in NYC, because only one can be the Best.  WHAt!!??",5.0
"A sign saying ""TORTAS"" was enough to get me in the door. The guy behind the counter asked me whether it was my first time there. He proudly showed me a framed article from TONY about the place when I said it was. He then proceeded to make two of the best overstuffed Mexican sandwiches my wife and I ever had. It was a little tough to choose, as they make 32 varieties, but the al pastor and the steak were both excellent. The steak was like a Mexican version of a Philly cheesesteak. The al pastor was very good, but I disagreed with the pineapple salsa on it. Not that it was a bad choice, but the fruit was unnecessary - the meat had plenty of flavor to carry the sandwich.The front counter makes fresh juices, which were good also. The rest of the place is a Mexican market, selling groceries, knick-knacks and pinatas. I'm kinda torn between four and five stars here. The prices are fair, the staff are friendly, the tortas are great, the portions generous and the place is charming as all get out. The food is a little on the heavy/greasy side, but the juices feel healthy. I'll give them four stars for now, but will be back before too long.",4.0
"What a little gem, seems like sunset park has a bunch of these little culinary gems. but even this one stands out a little more.Basically like a Rutgers food truck in back of a mexicatessan. And I mean that in a good way.They make any kind of sandwich. Just ask. And then they grill it. The Al Pastor with melty cheese was just plain ol good.This place was a good find and fairly cheap. Thanks again yelp for pointing me in the right direction.",4.0
"Yeah the sandwiches are awesome, but the empanadas are to die for !!!!!!  Chorizo, beef, chicken and cheese !!!!  2 bucks each jam full of filling fried golden and delicious.",5.0
"This review is for Tortas A La Plancha Don Pepe.  Like many other bodegas/mini markets, the restaurant is in the back.After reading the Village Voice's review about this place (blogs.villagevoice.com/f…), I knew I had to try it.Now I'm not going to go as far into depth as the Voice reporter did, nor am I going to reiterate.  That's just pointless.  But what I will do is say that I think the Voice speaks a bit too highly of the place.  And before I get into its shortcomings, let me say right now that the torta was pretty good.  In many places, this would probably be an amazing torta, and something worth going out of your way for.  But here in the Sunset Park/South Slope area, it didn't win me over.Bread - I believe that tortas should have a nice, soft roll.  Maybe a little bit crusty on the outside, but be very easy to bit through and soak up some of the flavor of the torta, and be griddled.  Don Pepe's bread is pressed in a machine, similar to how a Cuban sandwich is done.  Nothing wrong with that in the abstract, but it's now how I want my torta.Mess - The torta was also too neat.  There were very distinct layers of the torta.  It was almost like a torta parfait.  Some people like this kind of cooking, but I subscribe to the torta theory of ""If It doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face"".Carne Asada - The end of it was a bit tough.  They served it in as a long piece, which works if it's high quality beef, but what I got was simply average.I also tried a taco al pastor, which was good, though pretty greasy.Again, I know I sound harsh, but when a place gets the ""best"" title thrown at it, I felt it necessary to deflect.",4.0
"This place used to be outstanding, probably the best tortas in New York,  maybe 5 years ago. However as they got mas popular they sold out, raising prices, remodeling, and hiring new staff. These days the scent of nostalgia dominates the old dining area",3.0
"This is a small little unassuming food market that sells chips, candy, canned goods etc. What you don't expect is in the back of the store there is magician capable of making your taste buds do the merengue by combining meats, avocado and bread together. I decided to step into this store one day to try the tortas. Couldn't hurt right? The store is brightly lit, slightly kitschy but extremely clean. I ordered the number 24 (torta de casa?) with my roommate and took it to go.It consists of avocado, spicy pork, beef, egg, bacon, beans, turkey mozzarella and cheese. The smell of the sandwich was intoxicating. Once we got home, we ripped open the bag and took a bite. At first bite it was like a flavor pinata exploded my mouth. The meat was tender and flavorful, quite possibly one of the best things I've had in a while. I'm already planning my next trip back. I think if you love meat and if you love spending less than 10 dollars this is the place for you.Also if you love guacamole, they sell the best avocados.
