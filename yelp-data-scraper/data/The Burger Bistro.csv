"Cute little burger spot. My husband and I took a stroll (a 20 block stroll) to this place on a nice Sunday afternoon. We were the first customers so we got to sit right by the window. I enjoyed the unique way of ordering from their menu, using a red pencil to check off what we wanted. A fun interactive way to place our orders. I ended up ordering the lamb burger, medium well with goat cheese, in a wrap. My husband ordered the Kobe beef burger with cheddar on a bun. Oh and buffalo tator tots were a must order!!When presented with our burgers, I noticed mine was a bit too well done (my knife would not cut through the meat). I asked the waiter politely if my burger was over cooked and if she could check to make sure that my order was placed correctly. She apologized profusely and told me she would replace it. 10 minutes later, a beautiful and medium well lamb burger was sent to my table. The waiter checked in on me several times to make sure everything was okay. Oh and of course my husband wasted no time devouring his Kobe burger before my replacement burger arrived. We finished off our meals by sharing an oatmeal cookie with vanilla bean ice cream sandwich. Overall amazing meal, and awesome service :)We will definitely be regulars at this spot!",5.0
Was not impressed by the place. My gf and I tried it today. Subpar service. Decent starters but very average burgers. Good music Not planing to come back.,2.0
"My boyfriend and I love to try new places and enjoy the experience. This time however, we did not enjoy this place for the most part. The starters were okay; bf loved them but i did not. They do not mention that they are on the spicy side even though i did ask if they are, the waitress said ""eh, not really"". Burgers: NOT a fan. My bf and I both have stomach aches now (about 4 hours later) and I began to have a stomach ache as soon as we started eating. He got one after we walked out. The sides were not good at all. We did not get dessert only due to the fact that i wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.Also, the waitress was not good either.. no excuse me, no ""sorry"" when a few pieces of our starters fell on to the actual table top as she was placing it on the table. Nothing at all. When we got the check, my bf paid and she stayed there and watched him as he looked over the bill and got his card out. Just to be polite, she should have a/turned around or b/walked away altogether. One nice thing was that the chief did come out to ask how the appetizers were but in respect, he was walking outside as he saw us eating. In conclusion- we will NOT be coming back. p.s music was nice too. made us feel comfortable and we enjoyed it",2.0
"Are the burgers here great? Yes. Are there better burgers to be found? Absolutely.This place is definitely a great spot but it's a little to hyped up for my liking. I came here expecting a great experience (expectation was still low because it's a burger place) and left only 3/4 satisfied. Between the unenthusiastic wait-staff and loud pop music I was already a little let down. Additionally, I've had much better burgers so don't let the Zagat rating convince you of something supreme. Give it a shot but remember that hype is one hell of a drug.",3.0
"If you want to run away from adult responsibilities and feel like a child again, Burger Bistro might be a good place to start.The menus lets you personalize your burgers/meals with a crayon! This makes the communication between the wait staff and customers much easier.I got the groupon deal $10 for $20. Ordered a Veggie burger with guacamole. Heads up though, most of the toppings, there's an extra charge. Extra charge on cheese, onions, even sauces!I was really excited to try the seasoned fries but when i asked the waitress, she told me there was only regular fries.bummer.Veggie burger was good, nothing too extraordinary. If it wasn't for the groupon deal, i dont think i would return.",3.0
"We went here when we first moved to the neighborhood, almost 3 years ago.  Definitely were not a fan then; it wasn't bad, but it was overpriced and the service was terrible. Found a groupon last month and we decided to give it another go.  SO glad we did!  Our server was outstanding, the burgers were perfect, and the fries were okay (honestly, NYC doesn't really seem to know how to make fries. I'm a fry connoisseur, and New York has been nothing but disappointing in this area ;) )  We'll definitely go back, and it won't take us 3 years to do it.",5.0
"We've been here a few times and wanted to come back because we had good memories here.  On this particular visit, however, the burgers weren't as good as we remembered them to be.  We came with a group of 5 on a Sunday afternoon so it was quite easy to get a table.  Thanks to the owners for having unlimited refills on sodas, and thanks to the staff for being on top of their game.  We were quite thirsty from paintballing so we downed countless sodas.As for the food, we started with buffalo tater tots and they were delicious!  Good appetizer for a small group to share.  Then came out burgers which we all went with beef instead of other meats.  Toppings were plentiful since they do have over 2 million combinations possible!  Everyone ordered something a little different such as bacon, mushroom, onions, pineapple, jalapeno, and others.  They certainly do not cheap out on the toppings at $1.50 each. The only issue we had were with the cooking temperature of the burgers.  Everyone who ordered medium got theirs rare.  Rare to the point where we had to use forks to rip the meat apart instead of biting through it.  Those who ordered medium well had a leather puck!  The meat was so overly cooked that it was dry and hard to eat.  We had to lather the burger in ketchup in order to make it edible.  Though the temperature was off, at least the flavor was good and the patties well seasoned!We wouldn't write off the Burger Bistro, we just probably caught them on a bad day.  We'd still come back.",3.0
One of the dopest burger spots! I'm a turkey burger/chicken breast kinda girl and the chicken breast is so on point! They give you like 2 or 3 pieces of chicken breast with all the topping you want! Amazing! It's also pretty neat and creative the menu with the crayon and the check boxes of what you want to order! Decently priced and clean! Parking can be an issue depending on the time of day but service is great and this is definitely a spot that I find myself craving! We also ordered for delivery and the order came rather quickly so no complaints here!,5.0
Great place great atmosphere never packed. The ordering procedure is cool I really just don't have any complaints about this place I've been here twice before and plan on being a real regular. -very clean-very inviting staff-nice music fun and relaxing-nice sangria,5.0
"We went for a late lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was somewhat empty. The service was fine but I felt like they were rushing us. The burgers weren't horrible but they are way too overpriced for what you actually get. I got a burger with cheddar cheese, guacamole, pickles and chipotle mayo with no sides and it came out to $15. Our fried artichoke appetizer was $9. An artichoke probably cost a dollar at the store. The guacamole was not fresh guacamole. It definitely came out of a tube. The only plus was our red sangria was very tasty. I would never go back. You're better off going to The Lock Yard nearby and get an awesome burger for under eight dollars.",2.0
"I came here with my wife and son for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. For an appetizer I ordered the fried corn. It was so gooood. I liked that you can build your own burger. I built mine taller than Dikembe Mutumbo. I had a beef burger with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bacon and a fried egg. I asked for my burger medium rare and it came out cooked perfectly. My wife also ordered hers medium rare but it was closer to the rare side. I also ordered tater tots for myself which were really good as well. My son had the kids burger and fries. I left this place feeling so full and satisfied. But my pockets felt kinda light. Two adult burgers with fries, one kids burger with fries, three drinks and the corn appetizer came out to a little over $70. Add the tip and if came out to over $80, ouch. The food was really good though. So bring your appetite and bring your rent money, it's worth it.",5.0
"Cute place.  We've been here a few times. Great burgers (cooked exactly the way you order them.) good sweet potato fries,friendly service & decent price on a glass of white wine ($8.)  The wedge salad is very good too.  Lots of choices of toppings available. They have an $11 lunch special which includes one topping & one side.",4.0
"I've been here three times - each time on a Saturday.  The first time I had a burger and fries.  The burger was good and juicy I was impressed, I would give it 4 stars because for the price, it wasn't a great value.The second time  I brought my father and had a burger and sweet potato fries.  The burger was good and juicy I was again impressed and the sweet potato fries were outstanding, My guest also had a burger plus onion frizzle which he enjoyed.  Another strong 4 star performance.The last time (January 2016), I brought my family and my father.  I had to have the sweet potato fries and again they were killer, unfortunately the burger was partially raw.  I like a rare/medium rare burger but order medium just to be safe.  This was not even rare.  My daughter had a chicken sandwich that was dry and really small.  The rest of the family said their burgers were fine.  One was over-cooked and another under-cooked.  I don't know if it was a new cook or what but this experience was really poor.",3.0
"I'm glad to have found a good place where a meat eater and a vegan can both enjoy a meal together with neither having to compromise. I really like the veggie burger. Having eaten the token vegan item at many places because it was the only thing available to me, I can say that Burger Bistro's veggie burger is not an afterthought. It's fresh and moist yet holds together well. It does not taste like a Dr Praeger's or anything from the freezer. The only vegan-friendly bun is the whole wheat, and that's good too. I also particularly like the deep-fried corn on the cob appetizer, the freshly made potato chips, and the sweet potato fries. There are no vegan dessert offerings though, so I recommend walking a couple blocks to Shangri-La (yelp.com/biz/shangri-la-…) for their yummy vegan ice cream.The simplicity of ordering is great: just check off items with a dry erase marker on a plastic menu. I tend to stick to the extras on the menu that give the most bang for the buck, such as the portobello mushroom--deelish on a veggie burger! Toppings add up fast, and IMO most just aren't worth the cost. For example, I think $1.50 is a lot for 2 tablespoons of guacamole. FYI, if you get the deep-fried corn, it comes with chipotle mayo, so save that for your burger rather than pay $1.50 additional for it as a topping.The wait staff have all been very friendly and helpful. They're attentive to the extras that make a meal relaxing, such as offering to refill drinks and bringing napkins without having to be called over. The music tends to be alternative rock & grunge, fine by me. The rest room is clean and well-stocked. Burger Bistro participates in many coupon programs so it's definitely worth doing a quick online search. Last time I ate there I used an Amazon Local deal.",4.0
"I give this place 4 stars for the cleanliness, service, variety, and flavor of a burger joint.Burgers are fresh and they understand the difference between rare,medium, well, etc.Their buffalo tater tots are interesting (good)Nothing was greasy or felt heavy.They Also serve liquor.The only downside are the prices... A burger can run from $9 (very basic) to over $20 depending on how you dress it. Nonetheless, you leave feeling full!",4.0
"After eating here several times I can honestly say it's the best burger joint in Brooklyn. Service is great. Everything on the menu is chargrilled. You have a multitude of meat choices, cheeses, toppings, dressings, breads and sides. It's a ""have it your way"" burger spot. I especially love the grilled chicken on a brioche bun topped with fresh guacamole with a side salad or sweet potato fries. Yum! It's definitely worth a few more visits. Lunch specials every day $11 and they serve some great sangria, wine and beers .Haven't tried the dessert yet, but they all sound scrumptious.",4.0
"The burger is why everyone comes for. It's a little expensive, but the quality is perfectly reasonable. They give you a lot of options to mix and match, a turkey burger with Gruyere cheese is one of many delightful surprises.",4.0
"I probably end up coming here like at least once a week so I can say I'm a fan. I have to start off by saying that this place can be pretty pricey so the best times to come are for lunch -- check out their lunch specials; it changes occasionally, but on a typical day you can get a good meal for under $15, tax/tip included. This place is more or less ""build-your-burger"" place and they charge per topping and per side. So be mindful, it could get pretty expensive quick without you noticing. Their lunch specials however, allow for 1 choice of meat, bread, cheese, sauce/topping, and fries for under $15. The sweet potato fries are my favorite, the Kobe beef wasn't worth the extra money, and I don't know why but their diet coke is on point! Definitely swing by if you work in the area!",4.0

Front seating is a little small, but the back is beautiful. Will 100% be back. Best burgers in the neighborhood and a much needed breathe of fresh air.",5.0

"EXPENSIVE! That is really my only complaint. The beer is cheap, which is great, but the a la carte method of ordering adds up very quickly.

Only lettuce, tomato, onion and ketchup are free. I got the Kobe burger, which when all was said and done, cost about $15.00. A side of onion frizzles (aka onion rings) jacks that up to $20.00. Add a couple of beers and you're at $32, not including tax or tip. So, a pretty darn good burger, onion rings and a couple of beers easily hits around $40.00. That's pretty outrageous.

"I really wanted to like this place more but a few factors did detract from it. I ordered the Kobe beef burger with their regular tater tots. The problem with everyone's order who ordered tots/fries was that they were badly overcooked. The oil used was old and had an overwhelming scent. It also left this weird aftertaste. Had to douse my fries and tots in chipotle mayo and ketchup to cover it up. Everyone noticed this though at our table, how did they not?My burger was overcooked the first time, I asked for medium rare and mine came out with no pink at all. But the waiter was nice enough to take it back and have another put onto the grill. They were good with the refills on the drinks and generally friendly and smiled. Except for one waitress who must've been near the end of her shift because she was downright cold.. Didn't smile once and just stood there waiting for us without much positive reciprocation when we did talk about the food. That's just weird when we had a table of 5. The place is rather small and narrow. Ok place if you're in the neighborhood but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Overall, it's a 3 star place. Ok, but we've all had better. They just need to pick up the quality and consistency.",3.0
"Been wanting to come try this place for awhile.  Happen to be in the area, so there is no question in my mind that this will be the place that I will be coming for lunch.  The place was smaller than i expected but they have a decent amount of seatings.

You mark what you want directly on the menu.  Start off by picking appetizer, then on to the different type of burger patty, cheese, toppings, sauce, bread, and sides.  We had the turkey burger, kobe beef burger sliders, and the lamb burger with a side of tater tots.  The turkey burger was not too memorable and probably could skip.  Lamb burger was good and juicy but didn't taste too special.  The kobe beef burger slider was amazingly good and melts in your mouth. The only thing i didn't like about the slider was that you could not pick the type of bread the slider came with.  The slider bread reminds me of school cafeteria bread.  The tater tots came in a generous portion.  It was nice and crispy.  Overall, the service was excellent. The food was just ok only the kobe beef stood out.  Think shake shack prob would have tasted about the same and a cheaper price tag.",3.0
"Good burger joint with a lot of options to customize your burger. However, almost all of the options are add ons at an extra price. Toppings are $1.50 and the sauces are $1.50 (which is way too high just for sauce). The price is way to steep for a burger joint in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. The burger itself is a bit on the oily side, a mixture of oily and juicy but the oil definitely turns you off. The sides are okay, also a little on the oily side which of course is understandable because they're tator tots but oily sweet potato fries just don't taste good. The pineapple definitely balances out the meat and tastes surprisingly good with the burger. I definitely recommend adding pineapple.",3.0
"Oh bother, how I wanted to love this place. I was drawn in by the build-your-own burger style that is perfect for multiple eating styles and those with allergies- they even have a separate gluten-free fryer. However, the price is way too high. $60 for tots, 2 burgers (only 1-2 toppings each) with fries, and 1 beer? Oh, let's not forget the $1.50 I was charged for hot sauce. I do not think the experience justified that. For starters, the bench seating definitely needs a cushion for the back considering you're forced to lean forward because of the mirror at shoulder/head level. Imagine sitting like an upside down #7... Not too comfy. The tables are pretty small as well, which I could have dealt with. However, they are soon crowded with condiments, glasses, a water bottle, and plates. Speaking of plates, way too small for the satisfying portions, so much so that my toppings and fries constantly teetered on the precipice and eventually slipped off the edge to no man's land. The crispy sweet fries were coated in a tempura batter and yummy in that fried-way. The regular fries are thick cut and clearly real potatoes, though definitely lacking in seasoning. The good- servers were very friendly. Homemade (in the LES) veggie burgers, fluffy gluten-free bun, and outstanding buffalo tater tots satisfied my taste buds. Portions are large.Overall, great concept; poor execution. I think I'll give them another try.",3.0
"I like the place. Been there twice, once with a group once alone. The food: above average burger (got MR cooked correctly both times, friends got R and M also cooked the right way). Average sides and toppings  (good but nothing you can't get elsewhere). Desert is ice-cream. I don't get ice cream my lunch and this place is totally lunch. The service: Perfect. Been there twice and both times the server rocked. Prices: above average but I don't judge a restaurant by their prices (unless they sneak costs). Glad I finally walked in here",5.0
"Now this is a place that I used to go to enjoy a great burger and fries but to be honest after a few years this place had just gone down!! The burgers are small, their fries are just ok. Their dessert are frozen like the ice cream they charge u $7 for a small ice cream where u an get the same in a deli for 2.50$The service and atmosphere is ok... Not the best place. Is small and the prices are $$$$$$ not worth my money!! I will not go again!!",1.0
"If you want a classic beef burger with American cheese, look no further. Burger Bistro does an excellent job of making quality burgers even without the frills. I've only ordered delivery from here so I can't say much about their dining -in experience. But even with delivery, they were very quick and the burgers were not soggy or lukewarm by the time they arrived. The good thing about their burger is that they are not greasy, unlike Shake Shack or Five Guys. The only complaint I have is probably their salad appetizers.  For a small salad, it costs a pretty penny ($9) and that's without adding any meat to it.",4.0
Wow.....! No like seriously! This place is awesome! The venue is small but they really make up for it in service and flavor! It's really nice for intimate dates. The service is really great and super attentive without being intrusive! As for the menu it's interactive. They give you a grease pencil and let you go to town and pick what you want. It's easy to go crazy with it but trust yourself and know it's always better to keep it simple. For starters we each ordered one I had the fried artichoke hearts and my boyfriend got the famous buffalo tater tots! This was both a blessing and a curse... They were both absolutely delicious and addicting! I couldn't stop picking at them and the portions were huge!! Definitely made for sharing! When our burgers came we could only eat half as we had already gorged ourselves on the appetizers. After that and the beer specials we were way too full for the deserts! We vowed to come back except next time one appetizer for the both of us and we're definitely getting desert!,4.0

"Good burger joint with a lot of options to customize your burger. However, almost all of the options are add ons at an extra price. Toppings are $1.50 and the sauces are $1.50 (which is way too high just for sauce). The price is way to steep for a burger joint in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. The burger itself is a bit on the oily side, a mixture of oily and juicy but the oil definitely turns you off. The sides are okay, also a little on the oily side which of course is understandable because they're tator tots but oily sweet potato fries just don't taste good. The pineapple definitely balances out the meat and tastes surprisingly good with the burger. I definitely recommend adding pineapple.",3.0
"Oh bother, how I wanted to love this place. I was drawn in by the build-your-own burger style that is perfect for multiple eating styles and those with allergies- they even have a separate gluten-free fryer. However, the price is way too high. $60 for tots, 2 burgers (only 1-2 toppings each) with fries, and 1 beer? Oh, let's not forget the $1.50 I was charged for hot sauce. I do not think the experience justified that. For starters, the bench seating definitely needs a cushion for the back considering you're forced to lean forward because of the mirror at shoulder/head level. Imagine sitting like an upside down #7... Not too comfy. The tables are pretty small as well, which I could have dealt with. However, they are soon crowded with condiments, glasses, a water bottle, and plates. Speaking of plates, way too small for the satisfying portions, so much so that my toppings and fries constantly teetered on the precipice and eventually slipped off the edge to no man's land. The crispy sweet fries were coated in a tempura batter and yummy in that fried-way. The regular fries are thick cut and clearly real potatoes, though definitely lacking in seasoning. The good- servers were very friendly. Homemade (in the LES) veggie burgers, fluffy gluten-free bun, and outstanding buffalo tater tots satisfied my taste buds. Portions are large.Overall, great concept; poor execution. I think I'll give them another try.",3.0
"I like the place. Been there twice, once with a group once alone. The food: above average burger (got MR cooked correctly both times, friends got R and M also cooked the right way). Average sides and toppings  (good but nothing you can't get elsewhere). Desert is ice-cream. I don't get ice cream my lunch and this place is totally lunch. The service: Perfect. Been there twice and both times the server rocked. Prices: above average but I don't judge a restaurant by their prices (unless they sneak costs). Glad I finally walked in here",5.0
"Now this is a place that I used to go to enjoy a great burger and fries but to be honest after a few years this place had just gone down!! The burgers are small, their fries are just ok. Their dessert are frozen like the ice cream they charge u $7 for a small ice cream where u an get the same in a deli for 2.50$The service and atmosphere is ok... Not the best place. Is small and the prices are $$$$$$ not worth my money!! I will not go again!!",1.0
"If you want a classic beef burger with American cheese, look no further. Burger Bistro does an excellent job of making quality burgers even without the frills. I've only ordered delivery from here so I can't say much about their dining -in experience. But even with delivery, they were very quick and the burgers were not soggy or lukewarm by the time they arrived. The good thing about their burger is that they are not greasy, unlike Shake Shack or Five Guys. The only complaint I have is probably their salad appetizers.  For a small salad, it costs a pretty penny ($9) and that's without adding any meat to it.",4.0
Wow.....! No like seriously! This place is awesome! The venue is small but they really make up for it in service and flavor! It's really nice for intimate dates. The service is really great and super attentive without being intrusive! As for the menu it's interactive. They give you a grease pencil and let you go to town and pick what you want. It's easy to go crazy with it but trust yourself and know it's always better to keep it simple. For starters we each ordered one I had the fried artichoke hearts and my boyfriend got the famous buffalo tater tots! This was both a blessing and a curse... They were both absolutely delicious and addicting! I couldn't stop picking at them and the portions were huge!! Definitely made for sharing! When our burgers came we could only eat half as we had already gorged ourselves on the appetizers. After that and the beer specials we were way too full for the deserts! We vowed to come back except next time one appetizer for the both of us and we're definitely getting desert!,4.0
"After coming here a handful of times, I think a review is long due. The place is very modern and classy looking. Came here just in time to catch lunch special. $11 for a burger, cheese, topping and side order.The burger tasted so good. Very mouthwatering. Every bite I took, I just wanted to take another. The side orders are so generous. Most of the times I don't finish it! Soda is $3 a cup with free refills! They also have a decent variety of wine but I'm no expert.The waiter/waitress is a hit or miss. Mostly a hit for me, very attentive and helpful. If you have questions, they are more than happy to help.One of the top choices for me to get lunch.",5.0

Bought a groupon and had a positive filling experience. you get a crayon and a plastic laminated menu. You circle or check that which you want on your burger and how you likeit cooked so there is zero chance of miscommunication or annoying wait staff who I have met who insist on NOT taking any notes by writing down the order and just memorizing it. There is zero chance of that happening. I really loved the freshness and the burger quality and the clarity of communication by having the menu maked with my crayon. Highly recommend.,5.0
"I'm not quite sure what they're going for with this place -- it's basically a food truck with a waiter. PROS: - Burger was very tasty, if a bit undercooked (we both ordered medium and they were on the rarer side of medium-rare). - Tots were crunchy and delicious. - Plenty of customizations. - Good beer selection.CONS: - All add-ons are $1.50, which means a burger can quickly hit $20+ -- how can pickled jalapenos cost the same as cheese and bacon?? - My slice of smoked gouda was cold and unmelted. - Lettuce, tomato, onion were underneath the patty; not sure this is a bad thing, but odd. RECOMMENDATIONS:- Shredded lettuce... just no. Especially not on a burger. - ""Kobe beef"", please, have some self-respect and remove this nonsense from the menu.- Create some pre-configured burger combinations- Get rid of table service (waiter was friendly but unnecessary).FINAL RESULT: 2.5 / 5 Would recommend Bark, Frites and Meats (truck), Sheep Station instead.",3.0
"I've been here a few times, good burger but not the best. I do love the choice of sides, sauces, and the vibe of the place. The tots here are pretty solid but I wouldn't go all in for the kobe beef, I ordered the normal beef patty and it came out better. It's good but not the best.",4.0
"A loves this place so that means an automatic five stars. We went back just a week after trying it out and got the same thing again - kobe beef burgers and buffalo tots, which are so delicious.

"Last night I decided to order a big juicy cheeseburger and fries so I could kick back and watch the Mets/Cubs game 4. I live down the block from this place and have never checked it out, so I decided to give it a shot. When I called to place my order, the guy said the food would be ready in like 10 mins. This ended up being fairly accurate (as I had time to walk down the block to the store and then stopped in to pick up my order). I asked the guy for spicy or brown mustard when I called in and also for ketchup to be put on the meat. When I picked up the order, I got what I thought was a fairly light feeling bag. Not that I'm complaining...just from the pics, I expected the food to be bigger/heavier. Either way - I probs didn't need anything huge anyway. As I walked back to my place (literally 1 min from this place) I immediately opened the bag and opened the plastic container the fries were in. I don't like soft fries so I didn't want the moisture to build up and make them soggy. Of course after opening them I had to ""try"" a few. Have to say...the fries....while they could have been crispier...were spot on with taste. Kudos on that (b/c I am super picky about fries). Then as I started unpacking things at my kitchen table, I realize that while they did give me mustard and ketchup, neither was on the burger and the ketchup was kind of a cheap, no name brand packet. The burger had cheese melted on it (mmmm) and was actually cooked medium rare, the way I asked. However, I noticed the burger was SUPER thick and small in size. I thought that was kinda chinsey since the burger alone was $9 (plus another $1.50 for the 3 pickle chips I got added). The taste of the burger was actually just so-so. Didn't detect any seasonings that would make the burger really stand out and also noticed that they just used regular shredded iceberg type of lettuce, a tiny tomato slice and an onion slice that was literally like 1 inch thick! So the proportions were kinda off and just made it awkward to hold/eat. My recommendations would be: 1) season up your meat a bit2) when you pack fries to go - maybe use a small paper bag with the top rolled open so the fries can stay hot and crispy (not get moisture on them and soggy) - In fairness....I want all places that deliver fries to do this. 3) maybe keep the same quantity of meat for the burger, but make it thinner and larger vs. thick and small. Helps with the cooking as well. 4) step up your ketchup and lettuce game. If I'm gonna pay $9 for a burger (plus $1.50 for every additional topping) I should at least get something better than iceberg and no-name ketchup. I would have even been fine with the packets if they had been Heinz. But prefer something in a container like what you did with the mustard. So overall...just kinda ""meh."" Nothing outstanding that would bring me back. I will however, order a side of fries again in the future.",2.0

"I've been coming to Burger Bistro for years and it remains one of my favorite burger spots. Pros:You essentially custom build your own burger. They have a vast meat selection that you won't find at many places: beef, kobe beef, lamb, turkey, chicken, tuna, veggie... you want it, they have it. They also have about a dozen types of cheese to choose from as well as a large selection of toppings. In addition to the typical bacon, onion, lettuce, tomato choices, they also offer things like fried egg, guacamole, pickled jalapenos, etc. Their sauces are delicious (my favorite is the honey mustard) and so are their rolls (again, there's a few to choose from, but I usually go with the potato bun). Everything is aways fresh, cooked how I've specified, and delicious. For drinks, this place is pretty standard with soda, beer, and wine. Also, they have deals for each day of the week, which is nice.Cons:The place is pretty small and can get crowded during peak meal hours. Also, while they have a great selection and the food is cooked well... it is a bit pricey. The toppings are ""1.25,"" which is standard, I guess... but if you look closer, a lot of toppings are actually more than that. For example: guacamole, Canadian bacon, and portobello mushroom on top of your burger will run you 2.25 each; and that's pretty pricey for the small portion you get. The same goes for the sauce; it's 1.25 per sauce but you get a really tiny cup of it. The side order and dessert sections aren't as impressive as the burger section (makes sense though, their specialty is the burger itself). Side orders are 4.25 each and again, the portion size is pretty small. Their fries are delicious; when they reach your table, they are hot and crispy; you can tell they are fresh. Bottom line: This place makes a mean burger and I will continue to be a customer; there are few places I can think of that have burgers as good as Burger Bistro. I don't come as often as I would if they weren't as pricey; the bill is never outrageous, but it is more than I'd spend on a weekly basis. To give you an idea, I went there last weekend with a friend and we each had a burger, a soda, and we split an order of fries. With tip, the bill came to $40 even.",4.0

"Everything was good from the service to the food. Started with the Buffalo tots. Which were perfectly spicy and crispy. Had the turkey burger with smoked gouda, bacon and fried onions. This is where they loose the star. The turkey was soooo bland. And they give you a measly amount of crumbled bacon bits. I would have preferred strips of bacon. My boyfriend got the beef burger with American cheese and bacon and devoured it. Ended the night with a chocolate chip and chocolate ice cream sandwich which was alright. Everything is kinda pricey for the portion size they give you. Beware the toppings definitely add up.",3.0
"Good experience at their restaurant. Delivery has improved since I have started ordering from them last year. The deliveries are generally very quick, and the fries arrive nice and warm. Just be wary of a few of the toppings, as they can be very meager like the portabello mushroom option - it's 2.50, and they give you a very small (about half the size of the beef patty) mushroom cap. Also, try not to order 45 minutes or less before closing - they may send you a well-done burger instead of a medium/med rare like you asked!Otherwise, I'd say it is a solid burger spot.",3.0
"The burger tasted delicious, customizing you burger is better than having a set choice. The service here started off very well but the group of friends I were with started to feel a bit ignored by the waiters. We were the first to arrive and a couple of other customers showed up after we had ordered but they ended up getting their food first and drinks (water/free refill beverages) before we even got anything on our table, no water, nothing. When the food came it was good. Towards the end when we got our checks he has messed up our bill but it wasn't something we could of fixed amongst ourselves.",4.0
"Love the burgers here...get the Kobe beef, it's the best!  Make sure they cook it to your request- once, mine was overdone.  Frizzled onions are delicious as were all other sides that I tried.  I like that the waiter offers a free refill on soda rather than me having to ask.",4.0

"This spot was great for a last minute dinner decision. I love the menu, just having to mark what I want with a sharpie was cool.  The waitress whose name I didn't get, was very nice and super quick. The place looks very clean and I know there's seating in the back but not open because of the weather.  My burger was juicy and I loved it.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I think they could use more options on the menu. They have guacamole but not avocado and it wasn't the best and they have a rather small selection of drinks and deserts. But I was satisfied and will def return.",4.0
Good burgers. I like the lamb burger and tater tots are a cool menu item. Nice selection of toppings for the burgers. You have a million combos of meat bread and toppings for the burgers. I would say on the higher end price wise but you get what you pay for.,4.0
"A nice place to have a burger, it's pretty huge and the toppings were nice. I got the beef burger with portabella",4.0
This place is quite good and awesome.  You could build your burger as crazy as you want.  Just need some extra money for that.  They have some good drinks here.  They have some good tater tots!,4.0
"I'm not really a burger fan but they have really good burgers here. Me and my friends were looking for a place to eat and they found an offer on groupon so we came here. The food is good quality but the thing is you get charged for everything you put on it besides for the basics like lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup so it can end up being pricy. The place is pretty small so there is a wait about 30 minutes.",4.0

"This is one of those build your own burger places wherr u get to pick your own meat, bread, toppings, cheese and sauce. When everything adds up, it comes out a little pricey, but i feel like the food is worth it. It also makes for a fun experience cuz there's so many combos u can do. I went all out n got the egg, portobello and jalapeno. Then there's a jalapeno mayo dressing. Turned out great for me!What I love love LOVE about this place is that they make the meat to order. I love my beef med-medrare and they got it cooked just the way I like it. They have a kobe burger which is a must try.The fried corn appetizer is absolutely delicious.  It's lightly fried on the outside so that the outside is crispy. But the kernels inside are juicy! And so sweet! Comes with a drizzle of chipotle sauce. Yumyum!!I cant wait to come back again.",5.0
"Things have slightly changed since the last time I've been here! * their menu sheet has changed, and looks much better and more understanding * I believe their price has also increased. I don't remember being charged an extra dollar for mushroom as a topping. And their lunch special used to be $10, now it is $11. Nonetheless, their burgers are still fantastic. Though, this time around when I ordered the fries as a side dish it was very very salty. The tator tots are much better! If you want to build your own unique juicy delicious burger, this is the place to come! Especially on a Tuesday special :)P.S. Get your bread as sliders!

Everything about burger bistro is pretty awesome. Burger is always cooked how u request it. Medium rare is actually medium rare and medium well is actually medium well. A lot of places I've frequent always mess it up. Love their service. They're always pleasant and attentive without being over bearing or make u feel rushed. The meat is fresh and u can definitely taste it in the quality of the burger. Love the different options u have. You can create the simplest burger to the most complex burger (which can end up pretty pricey) since you pay for each addition (besides lettuce/tomato/raw onion). The sides are always crispy! Especially the tater tots and it doesn't taste greasy. They have specials depending on which day u visit (love the free topping days) and I tend to watch out for groupon deals too (50% off) which is pretty epic. Purchased and used 3 of them already. Oh yea don't forget the frozen sangria. It's pretty awesome!,5.0

I love how this place allows you to create your own burger, you can bring out your creativity. For my burger, I got chicken burger with mozzarella cheese, lettuce, tomato, and raw onion (free of charge) egg, and seasoned fries. The seasoned fries are good, it's barbecue flavor. The tater tots are also amazing. My boyfriend ordered chicken burger with pepper jack, lettuce and tomato, raw onions, pickled jalapeno, and tater tots.

My husband and I went for lunch. We split an order (2) of Kobe beef sliders with fries. We got the zesty smokehouse Barbecue sauce and Chipotle mayo. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had.

My burger was perfectly cooked but my girlfriends chicken burger was a little dry. Overall it was a good meal but they could definitely make some improvements.,4.0
Great burger spot but be prepared to break out the wallet. It's so overpriced for what you get. 75 bucks for 3 people on a Tuesday and I didn't even order a drink. Not a place you can go to on any given weekday and expect a decently priced meal. For that I'd rather get a sushi boat and spoil myself. I ordered a medium burger and it came out pretty close to well done. On top of that they got rid of all their specials. Luckily I had a groupon that took off 10 bucks but with tip I pretty much spent that and more. I wish I could go there more often but there are better bang for buck elsewhere in Bay Ridge.,3.0

They also have $11 lunch specials and daily specials for each day.",4.0
This is the 2nd time i came here.....1st at night. ...today a bit earlier..... the food here is great as always....this time around i came with my family and they all enjoyed their orders.....what really stood out to me however....was the customer service....the waiter's name was John.... (i asked right before i left)....he seemed to be the only waiter....but he was good enough....he was serving 5 tables including the table outside (didn't even know there was an outside until today) and still managed to check up on every table at the perfect moments and always had positive attitude..... Well done!!! I love this place and will continue coming here!!!!,5.0
"I can't think of many places that are better than this for burgers in Brooklyn. It's in my top 3 favorites along with Pipen's Pub and the 12th Street Bar and Grill.It's slightly on the expensive side for burgers because the sides add up quickly (sauces like BBQ sauce or chipotle mayo are $1.25!!), but it's totally worth it.Obiously the plain beef burger is where it's at. Very large patty, juicy and delicious. I've also had, and loved, the lamb burger and veggie burgers. Both are extremely good. I should add that every time I've gotten the veggie burger I get it with a portobello mushroom on top which goes together so well.I love the multiple choices of rolls because I'm not always in the mood for the same thing. And the appetizers are very good too. I suggest the buffalo tater tots and the fried artichoke hearts.Don't leave without getting a dessert either as their ice cream sandwiches are amazing. My favorite is the snickerdoodle cookie with cinnamon ice cream. Yum!",5.0
"Perfect place for a midweek date night especially with the daily specials they run. It's a nice relaxed atmosphere, a little on the small side but friendly enough where you can feel comfortable in anything from semi-formal wear to yoga pants. The build your own burger part is pretty awesome and the staff are incredibly patient while you decide what to get. Overall it's a nice casual restaurant my only gripes are that its a little small so if you have a loud table near you hearing their conversation is unavoidable and parking is a little rough.",4.0

Medium rare beef burger with mozzarella and a portobello mushroom with all the fixings on a brioche. The burger is a decent burger and always leaves me in a food coma. It's just so darn good! They used to have seasoned fries which was the bomb dot com, however they discontinued it; now I just get the tater tots with chipotle mayo which is spicy and has a good kick. They also have $11 lunch specials and daily specials for each day.",4.0
This is the 2nd time i came here.....1st at night. ...today a bit earlier..... the food here is great as always....this time around i came with my family and they all enjoyed their orders.....what really stood out to me however....was the customer service....the waiter's name was John.... (i asked right before i left)....he seemed to be the only waiter....but he was good enough....he was serving 5 tables including the table outside (didn't even know there was an outside until today) and still managed to check up on every table at the perfect moments and always had positive attitude..... Well done!!! I love this place and will continue coming here!!!!,5.0
"I can't think of many places that are better than this for burgers in Brooklyn. It's in my top 3 favorites along with Pipen's Pub and the 12th Street Bar and Grill.It's slightly on the expensive side for burgers because the sides add up quickly (sauces like BBQ sauce or chipotle mayo are $1.25!!), but it's totally worth it.Obiously the plain beef burger is where it's at. Very large patty, juicy and delicious. I've also had, and loved, the lamb burger and veggie burgers. Both are extremely good. I should add that every time I've gotten the veggie burger I get it with a portobello mushroom on top which goes together so well.I love the multiple choices of rolls because I'm not always in the mood for the same thing. And the appetizers are very good too. I suggest the buffalo tater tots and the fried artichoke hearts.Don't leave without getting a dessert either as their ice cream sandwiches are amazing. My favorite is the snickerdoodle cookie with cinnamon ice cream. Yum!",5.0
"Perfect place for a midweek date night especially with the daily specials they run. It's a nice relaxed atmosphere, a little on the small side but friendly enough where you can feel comfortable in anything from semi-formal wear to yoga pants. The build your own burger part is pretty awesome and the staff are incredibly patient while you decide what to get. Overall it's a nice casual restaurant my only gripes are that its a little small so if you have a loud table near you hearing their conversation is unavoidable and parking is a little rough.",4.0

"This place is great in the summertime - you can sit out on the back patio. They have specials every day (free toppings, half-priced beer, etc) and the burgers are delicious. Some things to note though:1.) Always ask them to cook it a step up from what you are used to (ie: if you want Medium, ask for Medium Well). The burger is always undercooked.2.) You have to pay for cheese and extra toppings besides tomato, onion, and lettuce. I think that's a little excessive but it is a build-your-own-burger place which is standard.3.) Sides are big enough portions for two people. They got rid of the seasoned fries (RIP they were the bomb), but tater tots and fries are easily share-able and delicious.",3.0

This was a great burger experience.  I came here on Friday night during restaurant summer stroll.  We ate outside and our waiter was exceptional.  I had a burger with smoked gouda and fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  The garlic bun that the burger came on was also amazing.  The bun is just as important as the burger in my opinion.  It wasn't soggy and came out perfectly toasted.  I will definitely be returning to this spot every time I have a burger craving.  I can't wait to try their ice cream sandwiches as well.  Unfortunately on this occasion I was too full to have dessert.,5.0
"I like the burger bistro. Its certainly something different than anything else in Bay Ridge. The food is not greasy which I like. Its kinda like a ""build your own burger"" place which is cool but beware you will pay the price. They charge extra for everything from cheese to the side sauces. Before your know it your eating a $16 dollar burger. The fries are good and so are the frizzled onions. The spicy mayo is to die for! But Beware of the chopped salad its seriously gross! Other than that everything else is good I would say its a must try!",3.0
"After years of trying, I think I've figured out how to tell I'm in the ""local"" Brooklyn and not the ""hipster"" Brooklyn.  It's all in the music.  If a place plays trip-hop, it's meant for the big glasses crowd.  If a place plays rock music that hipsters listen to, it caters to people whose diaspora to Brooklyn predates the 21st century.  The Burger Bistro is the latter.Tucked away in a small (seriously, it's about ten feet wide in here) corner of Bay Ridge, this place has a great atmosphere.  The staff is social and interacts with the crowd like they're regulars (and, perhaps, besides my lady and I, they all were). And I love the way food is ordered here.  At most burger bars I've been to, you order either on paper or through the staff.  There's just something more fun about actually writing *on the menu* with dry erase markers like the Burger Bistro has you do.The problem is the actual product.  At least the veggie kind.  Their veggie burger was surprisingly average.  I ordered mine with cheddar and they just slapped on a slice of non-melted cheese.  And even that sharpness didn't add much flavor to the patty (which seemed to be mostly corn).  Their spicy fries also needed quite a bit of mustard before they were spicy.  The produce on the burger was fresh - we actually saw them wheel in potatoes while we were there - and I did really enjoy their tater tots though.We hit this place during lunch and their $10 lunch special for a side, a topping, and a burger.  But ordinarily, it seems like it's kind of pricey here.  And I usually don't pay just for atmosphere.  Even if that atmosphere involves a waiter singing along to She Wants Revenge and losing hipster points along the way.",3.0

Great food and service. They actually listened to my order and made my burger as requested. The waitress was more than happy to modify the chopped salad as well.

"Kobe burger (medium) + egg + bacon. Considering there was only one person there, burning my burger until it was charred and burned to a crisp was unacceptable.

Avoid the burgers at Burger Bistro, buy their Tater Tots! Bet their cook is a wee bit disgruntled! Lol! Can't imagine why a cook would burn a kobe burger that bad unless he hates the owners, managers and clients. Should have gone to The V Spot that was across the street. Lesson learned. I'd call and complain but that does nothing. Leaving this review will prevent others from having the same experience. Get this, before calling, I checked a few reviews of this place on Yelp and read that they burn their burgers! Lol! Was hoping that wasn't the norm but maybe it is. Don't bother, go some place else.

However, this second time I noticed improvements in the food...especially the sweet potato fries! Now I can say they are the best I have tasted so far.

This was a great burger experience.  I came here on Friday night during restaurant summer stroll.  We ate outside and our waiter was exceptional.  I had a burger with smoked gouda and fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  The garlic bun that the burger came on was also amazing.  The bun is just as important as the burger in my opinion.  It wasn't soggy and came out perfectly toasted.  I will definitely be returning to this spot every time I have a burger craving.  I can't wait to try their ice cream sandwiches as well.  Unfortunately on this occasion I was too full to have dessert.,5.0
"I like the burger bistro. Its certainly something different than anything else in Bay Ridge. The food is not greasy which I like. Its kinda like a ""build your own burger"" place which is cool but beware you will pay the price. They charge extra for everything from cheese to the side sauces. Before your know it your eating a $16 dollar burger. The fries are good and so are the frizzled onions. The spicy mayo is to die for! But Beware of the chopped salad its seriously gross! Other than that everything else is good I would say its a must try!",3.0
"After years of trying, I think I've figured out how to tell I'm in the ""local"" Brooklyn and not the ""hipster"" Brooklyn.  It's all in the music.  If a place plays trip-hop, it's meant for the big glasses crowd.  If a place plays rock music that hipsters listen to, it caters to people whose diaspora to Brooklyn predates the 21st century.  The Burger Bistro is the latter.Tucked away in a small (seriously, it's about ten feet wide in here) corner of Bay Ridge, this place has a great atmosphere.  The staff is social and interacts with the crowd like they're regulars (and, perhaps, besides my lady and I, they all were). And I love the way food is ordered here.  At most burger bars I've been to, you order either on paper or through the staff.  There's just something more fun about actually writing *on the menu* with dry erase markers like the Burger Bistro has you do.The problem is the actual product.  At least the veggie kind.  Their veggie burger was surprisingly average.  I ordered mine with cheddar and they just slapped on a slice of non-melted cheese.  And even that sharpness didn't add much flavor to the patty (which seemed to be mostly corn).  Their spicy fries also needed quite a bit of mustard before they were spicy.  The produce on the burger was fresh - we actually saw them wheel in potatoes while we were there - and I did really enjoy their tater tots though.We hit this place during lunch and their $10 lunch special for a side, a topping, and a burger.  But ordinarily, it seems like it's kind of pricey here.  And I usually don't pay just for atmosphere.  Even if that atmosphere involves a waiter singing along to She Wants Revenge and losing hipster points along the way.",3.0
"One of my favorite burger spots, clean, attentive & you'll never have an empty beverage! Small but fantastic!",5.0
Great food and service. They actually listened to my order and made my burger as requested. The waitress was more than happy to modify the chopped salad as well. I totally suggest the chopped salad with goat cheese. Though the space is small I was still able to fit in with the stroller and the staff was more than happy to help and make space.,4.0
"Cool concept...but why is it so expensive? It's a BURGER.The burger is nothing to remember. The toppings and sides are all additional $$. The total bill for 2 people, which included 2 burgers with 2 toppings each and ONE side of sweet potato fries, one soda and one beer came to over $60. It pained me to fork over that cash for a burger meal. Ouch.I have no reason to ever return.",2.0
"Kobe burger (medium) + egg + bacon. Considering there was only one person there, burning my burger until it was charred and burned to a crisp was unacceptable. Ordered a second burger, medium also, burned so bad that we threw it out after two bites. I'd give one star but the tater tots were pretty good. Avoid the burgers at Burger Bistro, buy their Tater Tots! Bet their cook is a wee bit disgruntled! Lol! Can't imagine why a cook would burn a kobe burger that bad unless he hates the owners, managers and clients. Should have gone to The V Spot that was across the street. Lesson learned. I'd call and complain but that does nothing. Leaving this review will prevent others from having the same experience. Get this, before calling, I checked a few reviews of this place on Yelp and read that they burn their burgers! Lol! Was hoping that wasn't the norm but maybe it is. Don't bother, go some place else.

"In my opinion, the best of the 3 NYC Burger Bistros. They have a nicer staff and better cooked burgers. At the Burger Bistro, you build your own burger.

Many and I mean many other burger places always serve a medium well when I ask for medium rare so I am glad I finally get a burger that is done right. The burger was full of juices and the zesty smokehouse sauce liven up the beef. The deep fried corn on the cob ($8.25) with chipotle mayo was delicious but a rip off since its 4 pieces of half-corn.

"Would i usually trek out to Brooklyn from Manhattan? Probably not but i visited the Burger Bistro for a friends birthday party. Great establishment for parties or large groups. Front side of the restaurant are tables but the highlight is the backyard which can easily hold 50 to 60 people for a party or group gathering. Park bench style for seating in the back and the service was great! Kudos to the staff for serving a large group and making a fun atmosphere. Onto the food! Love how you can customize your own burger. I went with a meat, medium, with caramalized onions, italian sausage, and cheddar cheese. It came out a bit medium rare but I can see why with 30 of us ordering at once it was probably hard on the kitchen. Besides that the customized burger was great. Juicy, flavorful, onions and sausage cooked to perfection. Even the soft roll complimented the burger great. Didn't fall apart at all. I had mine with a side of fries and it came out crispy the way i like it. Party apps were buffalo tater tots and deep fried cheese aioli corn on the cob. Tater tots were a bit soggy for my taste and not crispy due to it being sauced with the buffalo sauce a bit long but the corn on the cob was great. I'm going to have to deep fry my corn from now on.Great burgers, great service, fun atmosphere for groups to hang out and talk in the back. A reason to head out to Brooklyn.",4.0

"My husband and I have bought a groupon to come eat here a few times.  We enjoy coming every time, but today's experience was a little different.  First, the servers were different.  Usually, we have a man (I believe by the name of Matt), that greets us with a smile and great attitude.  Today, we had a woman who I'm guessing, does not enjoy her job.  She took our orders and we ordered appetizers.  In our past experience, even when we haven't finished the appetizers, a server would ask us if we are finished (or at least notice when we are close to finishing) and bring out our entrees.  Today, the woman walked by our table 3-4 times, noticed that we weren't eating our appetizer anymore and didn't ask if we were done.  When I had asked her about our entree, she told us that it would be a few minutes longer.  Then, I asked another server and he said that it would be out in a few minutes because they usually wait for the appetizer to be finished before sending out the entree.  That is fine with me, but all they had to do was ask.  Not walk by a few times thinking we are still working on our food.  When our burgers came out, the female server was very snappy and said ""next time you're finished with your appetizer, tell us and we'll bring out your entree or if you want your entree brought out as soon as it's prepared"".  Um, I don't think I should have to tell you how to do your job.  Aren't you supposed to know when a customer is close to finishing their food and ask if they need anything else?  Bring back the server with the great smile and attitude!  The one with resting bitch face can leave.",4.0
"You know when you go to a restaurant with high expectations, and then those expectations are unexpectedly ruined? That didn't happen here. In fact, this was a terrific food experience in almost every way.We were taking mom out for her birthday and, knowing her love of a good burger, we found this little hole in the wall through Yelp and stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner. Sure there's the fun of marking your menu with a china marker, and there's the unique reverse mural that appears right-sided in the full-wall mirror, but the real star is the food.Each of us went with a beef burger as the base, and the flavor of the high-quality meat shone through. This is no standard supermarket chopped meat, but really beefy and fresh...and if you've eaten enough industrial meat in your burgers, you're going to see the good stuff as a revelation. I ordered the sweet potato strings, and they use the whole potato--including the skin--and fry it to perfection.

Went there with 2 friends 3days ago.   Was a big disappointment to me.   The food looks good in the pics that shows in the yelp.  But really just nothing special and the taste is normal   And. It is definitely over priced    I would rather go to five guys.  would not come back,2.0
Food is sooo good. The guy was super nice and helpful. The place is clean and really naiceee. Would recommend.,5.0
I had the Kobe burger with smoked Gouda cheese and horseradish sauce and it was awesome. Would not recommend the french fries specially the seasoned ones unless you like a little bit of the sweet flavor. However the tater tots are great. Service a bit slow. But the attitude was nice which helped. Children friendly and my toddler daughter had a great time. My hubby had the rodeo Burger. And he would have it again. I guess you just can't go wrong with burgers at this place.,4.0
"Would i usually trek out to Brooklyn from Manhattan? Probably not but i visited the Burger Bistro for a friends birthday party. Great establishment for parties or large groups. Front side of the restaurant are tables but the highlight is the backyard which can easily hold 50 to 60 people for a party or group gathering. Park bench style for seating in the back and the service was great! Kudos to the staff for serving a large group and making a fun atmosphere. Onto the food! Love how you can customize your own burger. I went with a meat, medium, with caramalized onions, italian sausage, and cheddar cheese. It came out a bit medium rare but I can see why with 30 of us ordering at once it was probably hard on the kitchen. Besides that the customized burger was great. Juicy, flavorful, onions and sausage cooked to perfection. Even the soft roll complimented the burger great. Didn't fall apart at all. I had mine with a side of fries and it came out crispy the way i like it. Party apps were buffalo tater tots and deep fried cheese aioli corn on the cob. Tater tots were a bit soggy for my taste and not crispy due to it being sauced with the buffalo sauce a bit long but the corn on the cob was great. I'm going to have to deep fry my corn from now on.Great burgers, great service, fun atmosphere for groups to hang out and talk in the back. A reason to head out to Brooklyn.",4.0

"Best burgers in Bay Ridge! Totally customizable and soooo delicious! Seasoned fries are fantastic too! The only thing I don't like is the guacamole, it tastes artificial to me but I'm Mexican and have very high standards when it comes to guac. The restaurant is cozy and the service is great.

"Absolutely love this place! Came here with coworkers and friends and always coming back!

"My husband and I have bought a groupon to come eat here a few times.  We enjoy coming every time, but today's experience was a little different.  First, the servers were different.  Usually, we have a man (I believe by the name of Matt), that greets us with a smile and great attitude.  Today, we had a woman who I'm guessing, does not enjoy her job.  She took our orders and we ordered appetizers.  In our past experience, even when we haven't finished the appetizers, a server would ask us if we are finished (or at least notice when we are close to finishing) and bring out our entrees.  Today, the woman walked by our table 3-4 times, noticed that we weren't eating our appetizer anymore and didn't ask if we were done.  When I had asked her about our entree, she told us that it would be a few minutes longer.  Then, I asked another server and he said that it would be out in a few minutes because they usually wait for the appetizer to be finished before sending out the entree.  That is fine with me, but all they had to do was ask.  Not walk by a few times thinking we are still working on our food.  When our burgers came out, the female server was very snappy and said ""next time you're finished with your appetizer, tell us and we'll bring out your entree or if you want your entree brought out as soon as it's prepared"".  Um, I don't think I should have to tell you how to do your job.  Aren't you supposed to know when a customer is close to finishing their food and ask if they need anything else?  Bring back the server with the great smile and attitude!  The one with resting bitch face can leave.",4.0
"You know when you go to a restaurant with high expectations, and then those expectations are unexpectedly ruined? That didn't happen here. In fact, this was a terrific food experience in almost every way.We were taking mom out for her birthday and, knowing her love of a good burger, we found this little hole in the wall through Yelp and stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner. Sure there's the fun of marking your menu with a china marker, and there's the unique reverse mural that appears right-sided in the full-wall mirror, but the real star is the food.Each of us went with a beef burger as the base, and the flavor of the high-quality meat shone through. This is no standard supermarket chopped meat, but really beefy and fresh...and if you've eaten enough industrial meat in your burgers, you're going to see the good stuff as a revelation. I ordered the sweet potato strings, and they use the whole potato--including the skin--and fry it to perfection. They were not greasy, and they had a lot of flavor so I didn't need to add any salt or ketchup. I'd probably like to see them cut just a tiny bit thicker to allow them to develop a bit of a creamier, sweeter center, but I'm quibbling.Did I say the beef in the burger was first-rate?

"I had passed Burger Bistro a number times over the years before recently checking it out. It is a tiny build your own burger place that is a bit on the pricey side. The first time I ate here I got a regular burger done medium rare. My husband got the kobe beef patty done rare. I was extremely disappointed with my patty, while my husband's patty was excellent. Ok, of course I realize that Kobe beef is the amazeballs of beef but I don't think that should preclude a ""burger"" shop from making an equally amazing regular beef patty. If you are burger shop you should know how to make a great burger without relying on the most premium of beef, home cooks do it everyday. (There's also a good argument against using Kobe beef in burgers because of the loss of texture, but that's another conversation)That being said on our second visit I got the Kobe beef patty and was very happy with my burger. It had so much more flavor and felt like a real burger. I also had their red sangria which was great. Sides are decent too. Tater tots were my personal fave. Burger Bistro also offers daily specials. On our two visits they were bacon wrapped kobe meatloaf, alternatively called heart-attack waiting to happen, and a rabbit burger in honor of easter. When all is said and done the burgers can become pricey. Both times our check topped $60 for two people. The Kobe beef itself adds an additional $4. Your mileage is going to vary on this one. Our second visit I was able to justify the price way more than on our first. I would eat here again, but only for the kobe patty and only when my wallet is willing to take the hit.",3.0
"Love that that you can customize your burger. Each day, if you eat in or out there are specials, the last time it was four free toppings for the burger (woohoo). The burger was a little messy but what do i expect with all the toppings lol The staff is attentive.  I think they give enough tater tots to share but if you don't like to share your sides get your own glutton lol I got a deal off living social so that was cool.Only negative is that I live near by and have ordered from there take out menu and the food is cold majority of the time and I only live like a three blocks away (Ok lazy yes but we all have those days) so maybe better to eat in person.",4.0

"I'm pretty jealous of these people who drop 5 stars on Burger Bistro. The flavor's there; my food was fucking delicious. But as soon as it took that hook towards my stomach, it was bad news from there on out. (THAT MEANS WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS #HASHTAG)So I ordered delivery last night, and right out of the gates I'm confused by the difference between the BB website and their grubHub page. The BB employee I got on the phone explained that they charge more to cover the cost of using grubHub for online orders. It's not that hard to understand, but it would have been nice if that was spelled out on the BB site.Then my delivery took forever. I'd give you the delivery time, but my watch doesn't go to eleventy million. So of course the food arrives lukewarm; the grocery bag and paper and plastic boxes insulated a grand total of zero joules. Thanks Obama.My beef burger with mozzarella, frizzled onions, steakhouse sauce, pickles, and mushroom mysteriously didn't have pickles on it. Burger Bistro has a batting average of Brazil's defense against Germany, and I haven't even taken a bite. I'm so frustrated I am still mixing up my sports analogies a day later.I put the room temperature burger in my mouth and it tastes as good as it looks. I was tempted not to eat it, and I wanted to go all Hell's Kitchen and whatnot (you forgot to use pickles! get out of my kitchen!) But I'm glad I didn't waste my time being that guy who wants a new burger, because it was really tasty.But before I finish my burger and sweet potato fries (they call them ""strings"" but that's a damn lie) my stomach turns and twists and I'm rolling on the floor not laughing at all in the least. Big tummy ache. No fun. I talked to some friends and they had similar experiences with BB's food.What a let down. Such great reviews for this place... I feel like an outlier. I probably am.

For appetizers I've had the buffalo tots (good if you like spicy) and the fried pickles, I would order both again.

"My first experience at burger bistro was fantastic. You basically create your own burger & sides- Free soda refills. My server was great & friendly.I was sold on the special for the night that the server had offered. I've had the hawaiian burger with tator totes on the side. Hawaiian burger is beef, pineapple, ham, teriyaki sauce on a potato roll, comes with french fries. i've replaced my french fries with tator totes, added lettuce & tomato. The beef was approx 2-3 inch thick and cooked just right-medium rare. After our meal, my friends and I were in food coma. It was so good, we couldn't try their dessert. The bill came out to be around $13-$15 per person which was well worth it. Although, it was a pain to find parking in Bay Ridge, we've circled around 5 times and found parking 5 blocks away.

It had so much more flavor and felt like a real burger. I also had their red sangria which was great. Sides are decent too. Tater tots were my personal fave. Burger Bistro also offers daily specials. On our two visits they were bacon wrapped kobe meatloaf, alternatively called heart-attack waiting to happen, and a rabbit burger in honor of easter. When all is said and done the burgers can become pricey. Both times our check topped $60 for two people. The Kobe beef itself adds an additional $4. Your mileage is going to vary on this one. Our second visit I was able to justify the price way more than on our first. I would eat here again, but only for the kobe patty and only when my wallet is willing to take the hit.",3.0
"Love that that you can customize your burger. Each day, if you eat in or out there are specials, the last time it was four free toppings for the burger (woohoo). The burger was a little messy but what do i expect with all the toppings lol The staff is attentive.  I think they give enough tater tots to share but if you don't like to share your sides get your own glutton lol I got a deal off living social so that was cool.Only negative is that I live near by and have ordered from there take out menu and the food is cold majority of the time and I only live like a three blocks away (Ok lazy yes but we all have those days) so maybe better to eat in person.",4.0
"I've been DYING to try Burger Bistro for so long and now I finally understand the hype.Small dining, simple menu and straight to the point. If you're craving a good burger in Brooklyn, this is your new spot. They have a bunch of different buns, meats, and toppings you can try.I ordered a regular ol beef burger with Americana cheese on a potato roll. Anyone who knows anything about burger buns knows it's gotta be a potato roll or nothing. My burger was juicy and cooked perfectly medium. :)I would definitely be making my way back to Burger Bistro sometime soon.",4.0
"Groupon no longer applies to the $10 lunch menu = no longer coming here for my burger cravings only because it's not worth extra sides, toppings, etc since they're a bit pricey. That's the only reason why I came here because of the groupon deal and the $10 lunch special.",3.0
"I'm pretty jealous of these people who drop 5 stars on Burger Bistro. The flavor's there; my food was fucking delicious. But as soon as it took that hook towards my stomach, it was bad news from there on out. (THAT MEANS WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS #HASHTAG)So I ordered delivery last night, and right out of the gates I'm confused by the difference between the BB website and their grubHub page. The BB employee I got on the phone explained that they charge more to cover the cost of using grubHub for online orders. It's not that hard to understand, but it would have been nice if that was spelled out on the BB site.Then my delivery took forever. I'd give you the delivery time, but my watch doesn't go to eleventy million. So of course the food arrives lukewarm; the grocery bag and paper and plastic boxes insulated a grand total of zero joules. Thanks Obama.My beef burger with mozzarella, frizzled onions, steakhouse sauce, pickles, and mushroom mysteriously didn't have pickles on it. Burger Bistro has a batting average of Brazil's defense against Germany, and I haven't even taken a bite. I'm so frustrated I am still mixing up my sports analogies a day later.I put the room temperature burger in my mouth and it tastes as good as it looks. I was tempted not to eat it, and I wanted to go all Hell's Kitchen and whatnot (you forgot to use pickles! get out of my kitchen!) But I'm glad I didn't waste my time being that guy who wants a new burger, because it was really tasty.But before I finish my burger and sweet potato fries (they call them ""strings"" but that's a damn lie) my stomach turns and twists and I'm rolling on the floor not laughing at all in the least. Big tummy ache. No fun. I talked to some friends and they had similar experiences with BB's food.What a let down. Such great reviews for this place... I feel like an outlier. I probably am. But I can't recommend this place, at least for the food I got, and for how much it costs.",2.0
"I love the burger bistro! I've gone here a few times and all the food I have gotten was great. For appetizers I've had the buffalo tots (good if you like spicy) and the fried pickles, I would order both again. Now the burgers are amazing, and not just because they have a variety of burger patties (including veggie), but also the topping selection is great. The only reason I've given this place four stars instead of five is the service I've have gotten here has all been different levels, just depends who is working that day I guess. Overall I would say check it out and you won't be disappointed by the food.",4.0
Thank you for the great food and service :),5.0
I came because I wanted to try the buffalo tator tots. They were so good. Burger was okay. Service was slow but we had ordered fountain soda and it was flat so we asked for cans instead after trying and they were happy to swap without charge unlike some other cheap places would not agree to. Very dark room which I did not like.,3.0
"Love the spot! Delish food.food has flavor!!They do serve kobe burgers, artichoke hearts with horse radish deep. The best two ! Also sweet potato string are to die for with wasabi mayo or horse radish deep.Delicious sauces. A lot of toppings to choose from. Prices are really affordable. Plus they have specials every day. Lunch menu during the weekdays.Strongly recommended.",5.0
"My first experience at burger bistro was fantastic. You basically create your own burger & sides- Free soda refills. My server was great & friendly.I was sold on the special for the night that the server had offered. I've had the hawaiian burger with tator totes on the side. Hawaiian burger is beef, pineapple, ham, teriyaki sauce on a potato roll, comes with french fries. i've replaced my french fries with tator totes, added lettuce & tomato. The beef was approx 2-3 inch thick and cooked just right-medium rare. After our meal, my friends and I were in food coma. It was so good, we couldn't try their dessert. The bill came out to be around $13-$15 per person which was well worth it. Although, it was a pain to find parking in Bay Ridge, we've circled around 5 times and found parking 5 blocks away. We didn't mind parking so far, we had to walk it off!",5.0

"Their burgers are pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. However, I have to give a low rating on account of the quality of the cooking. Twice, I have had my burger delivered charred to a crisp on the outside and completely raw on the inside. I ordered the burger medium both times and it arrived more like a black and blue burger. To their credit, they replaced the order immediately. However, I waited 50min for the first burger and another 50 for the corrected order. I'm sorry but that is too much of an inconvenience. The first time I thought it was a fluke. But it happened again a second time. The waitress said she would let the manager know that this is a recurring thing and he would give me a call.

Once you're seated, the waiter asks you what you'd like to drink along with the checkoff menu where you start making your burger. I got the lunch special. For $9 you get to make your own burger with 1 condiment (i got a portobello mushroom), 1 type of cheese (swiss cheese) along with a side order (potato tots!)- OMG! I can't believe they offer tator tots here. I haven't had these since I was in elementary school. Eating these also brings back nostalgic memories of Napoleon Dynamite for some reason. ( it has to be them tator tots). oh and you get to choose your type of bread, ranging from regular to whole wheat to sliders to ""special bread"" (which they didn't have today) and some other type of bread that I forgot.Two of my friends ordered root beers, which tasted pretty good. For me, root beers have to have this 'bounce' to it once you drink it and TBB's root beer had that tangy bounce to the drink. Their root beer didn't taste too sweet or too rooty. So anyway, two of my friends ordered burgers with a concoction of things, such as mozzarella, portobello mushroom, frizzled onion, wasabi mayo, jalapeno mayo, honey bbq and seasoned fries.

I really really liked the brownie cause it was so chewy and soft and along with the vanilla ice cream, it was definitely heaven in my mouth. I must have gotten diabetes from the dessert alone.

"This has to be the most over-hyped burger place I know.I've been here twice and I was hoping the first time was just a bad experience, but the second time wasn't any better. I came here with my boyfriend and both times our orders were messed up. The first time I ordered sauce with my burger, but I never got i, which is an okay mistake, it's not a big deal. Since you write on the menu to tell them what you want on your burger, I figured maybe the chef missed this.Second time, I only ordered lettuce on my burger (no onions or tomatoes) and my bf didn't want lettuce, tomatoes, or onions. We didn't mark these on the menu. However, both our burgers came out with all 3 toppings. I mean, how do you mess that up? They didn't just miss something we marked on the menu; they added toppings because of lack of care.The food is decent. I will say I LOVE the buffalo tater tots. Those were the highlight of both times I went. The burgers were just decent. Both times I ordered medium and both times I got almost well-done burgers. The bread is good, but gets soggy fast. and its hard to want to order all the toppings you want when it costs an extra $1.25 for pickles. Pickles!The service was good though, besides the chefs.Overall, Would not recommend unless you're there for the tots.",2.0

"This must be the best burger I have ever tasted. More affordable than the Spotted Pig. As juicy as a rare filet mignon steak. Something was very delicious about this burger. Maybe it was because I had a medium-well beef burger with caramelized onions, apple wood bacon, and melted sharp cheddar with a side of crispy tater tots.

"Eh, maybe I'm just not a fan of burgers or American food.Buffalo tater tots - not worth $7 or was it $8?, imo. The tater tots were extremely soggy due to the fact that they try too hard to get the buffalo sauce kicked in. By doing do, they lost the signature style of the tots, which is its crispness. Also the portions are small. Not a fan.Now on to the burgers. Asked for medium but looked more like medium rare to me. The beef was dry so I added more sauce to it. However the lettuce and tomato were very fresh. The prices for additional add ons are too much though...Got the red velvet ice cream with cookie for dessert. The red velvet looked like pink velvet, still good though but tasted like baskin robbins. The chocolate chip cookie was delish.The service was nice but slow. Waited for 25 minutes before the burgers came out while I saw other people who came in after us only waiting for about 10 minutes. The music was fine. It wasn't as loud as others said but then again I went during lunch. This is a small place so come early for dinner. Oh yeah not sure but maybe soda was free? Since my bf ordered a sprite and it wasn't charged onto our bill.$40 plus tax and tips for 2 people during lunch .. thank goodness I had a groupon.",3.0

"I've eaten here twice - once delivery, and another on-site.  Both times I thought it was so-so.  It's not a bad burger but for a place that only serves burgers you expect it to be a damn good burger....it's just not.  In fact, the second time I tried their food, it was on-site and they served me my burger without letting it sit, so all the juices sipped out as I was eating the burger, amateur mistake.  I went with my BF and he wasn't impressed either. I will say that the first time I tried their food it was delivery and I only ate half of it and had the other half the next day, it actually tasted really good as left-overs, so that's something but if you are looking for the best burgers in BK, keep looking.",3.0

"I've used yelp for years now and this is my first review ever, so that says a lot. Really confused how this place has so many reviews and is rated 4 stars. Burger was super bland and underwhelming. Meat cost $8.25 and then EVERY. SINGLE. TOPPING. OR. SAUCE. cost $1.25 EACH. It really adds up, and it still really does not taste good. The tater tot appetizer was tasty though. Free thanks to a scoutmob deal.",1.0
"On the pricier end when it comes to burgers, but they make up for that by offering the choice to customize your burger with different kinds of meat, cheese, etc.Depending on the day, they offer deals throughout the week ranging from half off beers and wines to free toppings.Overall my experience went well and the staff was very prompted at getting our food and drink orders. The only issue we had was an isolated incident with the check. We were charged for items we did not order, or received, that took a bit effort to remove.",4.0
"This has to be the most over-hyped burger place I know.I've been here twice and I was hoping the first time was just a bad experience, but the second time wasn't any better. I came here with my boyfriend and both times our orders were messed up. The first time I ordered sauce with my burger, but I never got i, which is an okay mistake, it's not a big deal. Since you write on the menu to tell them what you want on your burger, I figured maybe the chef missed this.Second time, I only ordered lettuce on my burger (no onions or tomatoes) and my bf didn't want lettuce, tomatoes, or onions. We didn't mark these on the menu. However, both our burgers came out with all 3 toppings. I mean, how do you mess that up? They didn't just miss something we marked on the menu; they added toppings because of lack of care.The food is decent. I will say I LOVE the buffalo tater tots. Those were the highlight of both times I went. The burgers were just decent. Both times I ordered medium and both times I got almost well-done burgers. The bread is good, but gets soggy fast. and its hard to want to order all the toppings you want when it costs an extra $1.25 for pickles. Pickles!The service was good though, besides the chefs.Overall, Would not recommend unless you're there for the tots.",2.0
"Weird ...why are their burgers so texturally challenged? the texture on these things if you dont eat it straight off their grill or it is a tad overcooked is just weird and dense.  Try having a bite cold as a leftover the next day and its just nasty. Want to love it but I dont..love the toppings, love the tots and seasoned fries. love the sauces but the burger itself, which should be the star leaves so much to be desired.  I am sad",2.0
"This must be the best burger I have ever tasted. More affordable than the Spotted Pig. As juicy as a rare filet mignon steak. Something was very delicious about this burger. Maybe it was because I had a medium-well beef burger with caramelized onions, apple wood bacon, and melted sharp cheddar with a side of crispy tater tots.

Want a really good burger with tons of options for toppings and side dishes? Then this is the place to go!Burger bistro has a really good burger and is actually a fun place to go to. I love the way you place your order. They give you a laminated menu and you write your order on the menu with a crayon! They have a whole bunch of different types of meat and an immense amount of options for toppings. Their side dishes are quite good as well. I really liked the tater tots with cheese and meat. They also have some good beer options on tap which is always a plus. The only thing holding this place back from getting 5 stars is that it is kind of pricey for a burger place.

No comment on food but extremely rude service. We didn't even have the chance to taste the burgers. My friend suggested this burger place before going to a neighborhood show. We both bought groupon's for our family of four. My friends arrived early and got a table of eight. While I was waiting for my family to arrive they placed their order and mentioned to the waiter we need separate checks plus we have groupon's. The waiter walked away unease. When my family arrived my daughter started coloring with the erasable marker instead of the crayon provided. And a different waiter unpleasantly corrected my 4yrs old. My husband didn't finish marking his menu but the waiter neglectfully took both of our menus. Without reviewing the marked/unmarked orders or asking our for needs his main concern was to emphasize we can only use one groupon for our party and cannot issue separate checks from our friends bc we arrived together and seating together. It's clearly we are two separate family in a casual burger joint. If they are so unwilling to accept groupon voucher then they should not market their service through groupon.,1.0
"I love the mark-what-you-want menus! Such a cute idea. The place itself is quaint and pretty small. The four of us started with two of the soft shell crab appetizers. Pretty tasty and it came with a side of the jalapeno mayo (what a kick!). The burgers came out pretty fast. We all got the beef patty with various toppings. I liked the chipotle mayo the best. Mmmm medium rare (although mine was cooked to medium..minus one star) with bacon, fried egg and smoked Gouda. You can do without the bacon cause for one dollar they just give you crumbs of bacon..you know, that looks like it came from a shake bottle. Not worth it. The fries were pretty darn good, nice and crispy and fluffy. The sweet potato fries were not as good. Sliced too thin, it tasted flat and empty. They also forgot the smoked Gouda on my bf's burger, so when he sent it back, they melted the cheese and cooked his burger even more where it was too dry. Lots of mistakes on this visit. Good thing we had a groupon for the meal. Might give it another try.",3.0
"I had very high hopes for Burger Bistro. It's a small place with a very classy atmosphere. Their menu is super creative. You get to check off what you want on the menu with their red pencil. Clean and staff are super friendly. We were a party of 8 and they seated us in 2 tables but later pulled the tables together for us. However, my big complaint, we sat by the windows and it was extremely cold there with the wind blowing into the cracks of the windows. I had the Buffalo Tater Tots. A large dish of super soft tator tots, looks like it was made  fresh and not burnt sprinkled with bits of celery and blue cheese. There was a side of ranch sauce. Tasted like buffalo chicken wings but without the chicken. I thought it was super unique and very well made. Then I had a beef burger made medium rare with applewood bacon, pickled jalepenos, lettuce and tomato on a brioche. The patty was almost an inch thick and was made the way I asked for it. I think it was a bit salty and lacked a little burger flavor. The table had ketchup and all toppings were $1 each. Pretty pricy when you think about what you want on your already $8 beef burger. Other meats cost different prices. So sorry burger bistro, I just wasn't impressed.",2.0
"Yum Yum....this place is great!!!  I've passed it like a million times but never went in.  I heard great things about it from others.  Today, we finally went there.  First off, it's SMALL....so the earlier you get there the better.  We had a party of 6, and luckily they were able to accommodate us with only a 10 minute wait.  If you have 4 or less, you have a good shot of getting a table a bit more quickly.  There are no reservations.OK....so in this place you build your own burger.   You get a menu, and you use a red wax pencil to mark off your choices right ON the menu.  My kids thought this was the greatest thing.  You start off with your burger and bun choice ($8.95 for any kind of pattie or bun), then you  choose your toppings, cheese, sauce (EACH are $1.25  Lettuce, tomato and onion were free)....so if you get a beef burger with american cheese, fried onions and bbq sauce, it's gonna cost you $12.70.  Burgers also don't come with fries...those are an additional $4.25, as are all the other sides.   But the fry portion is HUGE...so you can share if you're on a budget.   I myself didn't mind the pricing.  The burgers were HUGE, so I didn't see it as a rip off. (exept they charge for pickles as a topping....NO...Pickles should be counted like lettuce, tomato or onions on a burger---free---but that's my only gripe--and they were sweet pickles..yuck)They also have a kids menu....so if your kids aren't burger eaters (like one of mine), they can have the cutest grilled cheese or a chicken sandwich.  The appetizers were wonderful!!!   And big portions!   We all shared the buffalo tater tots (OMG delish), Bistro chips (OMG even more delish), The fried artichoke hearts (my new fav thing) and the deep fried corn on the cobb (it was ok).   There were 6 of us, and we couldn't finish them all....and afterwards I was stuffed and could only eat one of my sliders.  I would go back just for appetizers alone.  All appetizers were $8.95 each.We all enjoyed our burgers....they were cooked perfectly (the way we wanted them)...And the desserts----Ice Cream sandwiches---TO DIE FOR.   We had the chocolate/peppermint and the oatmeal with vanilla buttercream...OMG...DELISH!!Definitely will be returning....hopefully soon!!",5.0
"So surprised walking into this restaurant. I was expecting the usual fast food set up, but was greeted with a cozy atmosphere.  The large mural on the wall can only be read through their mirror that runs length of then seating area. I was also surprised at the pretty nice beer/ wine section (nice for a burger place, but still surprisingly great). I ordered the cider which was a nice sweet to my perfectly salty meal.My burger, which I topped with all the free toppings possible (it was Tuesday after all) was delicious. Cooked medium rare perfect on a brioche bun.  The fries, one order definitely enough for two, were crispy and salty and fatty and great. I will definitely come here again!",5.0

"I was really underwhelmed with this place. After hearing such good things about it, I really thought it was going to be a lot better. I got a burger, medium with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and raw onions. For starters, my burger was well done. I hate when I get a burger that is overcooked. This was also the messiest burger I have ever had in my life. I'm fine with a messy meal (if I have to go through 10 napkins, so be it) but this was a bit much. I was only able to eat about half of it like sandwich before I had to give up and eat it with a knife and fork. Not only was the bottom bun falling apart but the actual burger was falling apart. I also was not impressed with the fries. They were seasoned a bit too much with black pepper. (But I will say this may be my fault since I don't like black pepper that much.) My sister got a chicken sandwich and wasn't too fond of it either. Considering how mediocre my meal was, it was way too pricey. A burger itself is about $8 and then each additional topping is $1.25, plus $1.25 for a small thing of sauce on the side. Only lettuce, tomatoes, and raw onions are added free of charge. Also, the burgers do not come with sides. You have to order them separately. However, this place is getting 3 stars from me for a few reasons. 1. I did come in about 30 minutes before they were closing. This may have contributed to the quality of the food. 2. The staff was really nice, especially when you consider I came in right before closing. 3. I would be willing to eat here again. Come in significantly before closing, order a rare burger, and maybe some tater tots instead of fries. If after trying it again I'm still not impressed with the food, I'm giving up for good.",3.0
"This place is pretty small but just the perfect environment for a date or a party of 4.  The menu is easy as can be as you mark down what type of burger you would like and the toppings.  Tuna tartar on a fried wonton skin was the special appetizer.  I'm a fan of any tartar so this was good.  My burger had frizzled onions, bacon and honey bbq sauce.  The burger itself is big and it may be difficult for those with small mouths to consume.  But it is well worth it.  A good piece of beef cooked to your liking.  The seasoned fries were like cajun fries at Five Guys but still tasty.  Be sure to save room for dessert! The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream was delicious.Service here was nice and pleasant.  The waiters were always around asking if how things were and if we needed anything.  Even the boss was around talking to all the guests.  The price for the food is fair but it was extra good with my Groupon.  I will definitely come back even without a groupon.",5.0

"I was really underwhelmed with this place. After hearing such good things about it, I really thought it was going to be a lot better. I got a burger, medium with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and raw onions. For starters, my burger was well done. I hate when I get a burger that is overcooked. This was also the messiest burger I have ever had in my life. I'm fine with a messy meal (if I have to go through 10 napkins, so be it) but this was a bit much. I was only able to eat about half of it like sandwich before I had to give up and eat it with a knife and fork. Not only was the bottom bun falling apart but the actual burger was falling apart. I also was not impressed with the fries. They were seasoned a bit too much with black pepper. (But I will say this may be my fault since I don't like black pepper that much.) My sister got a chicken sandwich and wasn't too fond of it either. Considering how mediocre my meal was, it was way too pricey. A burger itself is about $8 and then each additional topping is $1.25, plus $1.25 for a small thing of sauce on the side. Only lettuce, tomatoes, and raw onions are added free of charge. Also, the burgers do not come with sides. You have to order them separately. However, this place is getting 3 stars from me for a few reasons. 1. I did come in about 30 minutes before they were closing. This may have contributed to the quality of the food. 2. The staff was really nice, especially when you consider I came in right before closing. 3. I would be willing to eat here again. Come in significantly before closing, order a rare burger, and maybe some tater tots instead of fries. If after trying it again I'm still not impressed with the food, I'm giving up for good.",3.0
"This place is pretty small but just the perfect environment for a date or a party of 4.  The menu is easy as can be as you mark down what type of burger you would like and the toppings.  Tuna tartar on a fried wonton skin was the special appetizer.  I'm a fan of any tartar so this was good.  My burger had frizzled onions, bacon and honey bbq sauce.  The burger itself is big and it may be difficult for those with small mouths to consume.  But it is well worth it.  A good piece of beef cooked to your liking.  The seasoned fries were like cajun fries at Five Guys but still tasty.  Be sure to save room for dessert! The white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with vanilla ice cream was delicious.Service here was nice and pleasant.  The waiters were always around asking if how things were and if we needed anything.  Even the boss was around talking to all the guests.  The price for the food is fair but it was extra good with my Groupon.  I will definitely come back even without a groupon.",5.0
"If someone asked me what I though of The Burger Bistro, my response after eating there last night for the first time would be, ""Meh, so-so. You can try it, but I won't go back.""Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge burger lover, but the group I was with wanted to check the place out. I ordered the special of the day which was a burger with roast beef on top. I also ordered caramelized onions, wasabi mayo and guacamole as toppings. Each topping, including the individual sauces, cost an additional $1.25. So those three extras tacked another $3.75 on top of the already $8+ burger. Then, I got a slice of provolone, which I didn't order, but was still charged for.  My first impression: this place is crazy expensive!Service was very slow and there were only a few people in the restaurant. From the time we arrived to the time we left took two hours. Most of that was time spent waiting for our food. Though, surprisingly, the waiter didn't apologize for the wait. Of course, we also didn't complain. But it was excessive.The burger itself was okay. I sort of expected it to be something special because of the name of the joint and some of the reviews on here, but honestly, it was just mediocre. At worst it was a very greasy lump of ground chuck. At best it was a very greasy burger that had some decent toppings. The bun was over-toasted and too buttery/greasy for me to hold. It was so charred, I couldn't cut through it, so I just removed the top bun and ate the burger (which was cooked exactly as I requested--medium/well) and bottom bun with a fork.I also ordered sweet potato strings (aka sweet potato fries) which were really good! I wanted to ask for honey for dipping, but was worried that would cost another $5. Seriously, though, the sweet potato fries were the best part.Unfortunately the experience didn't quite end there. As some other reviewers have noted, I too felt a little GI distress shortly after our meal. It was nothing severe, but enough discomfort that I decided I won't be trying The Burger Bistro again.",3.0
"This is really a good burger. My nickname is the Meisterburger and its because my friends would call and I would be cooking hamburgers for the family. So I really can tell a really good burger.

"Good burger place. Ordering is easy just check off what you like so the burger is highly customizable. You can customize on the bread, patty (and how you like it), topping, sauce, cheese. They have a 9 dollar lunch special that allows you to pick the burger and a side. I like the sweet potato strings (I honestly think they should just be called fries because they're not shaped like strings). They have interesting sauces, like wasabi mayo which was pretty decent.

It's so creamy and had a nice kick to it! It's served in a mid-sized shot glass which looks real cool.The toppings on the burger were amazing, very sloppy but amazing.

"Food was fine but service was lacking.  I visited this place several times with different groups of friends.  The servers seemed disinterested in our business the first time we went, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  The last time I went, with a group about 5 friends about 2 weeks ago, we sat in the backyard/outdoor seating area.  The server barely came to the back often enough to get us refills on our drinks.  They weren't even that busy.  What's worse?  We ordered brioche buns and received Wonderbread burger buns.  Wonderbread/supermarket buns!!  Even worse than that, the server didn't even have the decency or courtesy to tell us about it.  No ""sorry we ran out of brioches"", no ""would you like to pick a different kind of bun.""  He just served them to us as if we wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  We had to say something about it, at which point he told us they ran out of brioche.  We STILL did not get an apology.  The couple next to us, however, got their brioche buns.  Not that we particularly cared that much about the buns, but at least have the decency to acknowledge that we know the difference.  We ended up spending over $130 that night with a group of just 5, and we still left a hefty tip.  We are foodies who don't mind spending money on good food and service.  But we will be taking our money elsewhere the next time we want burgers.",1.0
"At one point in January 2011 I thought that the Burger Bistro served the best burger I've had anywhere in the United States, but in the 6 months since I cannot say the same anymore.

Burger Bistro serves up one solid beef burger.  I can't say its the best I've had in New York but the quality is better than your standard gastropub.  For Bay Ridge it might be one of the better places to go.  The beef burger itself was flavourful and extremely filling.  I was amazed at how filling it was and I had the burger with a lettuces wrap.  I ordered a side of fries which were solid as well.   The main reason I give this place a three is there really wasn't a wow factor for the price.  A burger and cheese for $10 and the quality is just slightly better quality does not seem like much of a deal.  Basically this place is just a bit overpriced.  Perhaps the lunch deal is a better option if you work in the area.,3.0
"Hands down my favorite burger joint in Brooklyn. Saturday was the third time I've been there and it gets better every single time.Their burgers are cooked perfectly to the temperature that you want.

You can add many different toppings, change the meat, and etc. I usually stick with the chipotle mayo and a fried egg. (I must say, amazing chipotle mayo)Burger Bistro also has special dishes once in a while. This past weekend they had a lobster roll with deep fried corn. The special was 20 bucks (I think it was a bit pricey) but it had a lot of meat and tasted fresh. The deep fried corn was interesting. Tasted like grilled corn but with the scent of popcorn. I had their steak special once too. It was a while ago, but I enjoyed it. I really love the fact that they break outside their burger-boundaries to experiment!!!!The service is top-notch. All of the staff seems friendly, especially the dude with the glasses and the tattoos (I think he's the owner) He really makes the place welcoming!

"It's been 22 years. 22 years I've been desperate for a proper burger in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn. I understand that there's a sea of diners and other worldly restaurants out here, but none of them has ever served me a decent burger. Soggy buns, gritty patties, unmelted cheese; I've had it all.I was searching for a place to eat with a close-minded friend of mine. Burgers, I thought! Who in their right mind, vegetarians including, could turn down a decent burger. That's when I discover Burger Bistro. 4 1/2 stars on yelp you say? In Bay Ridge, for burgers? The closest thing to a decent burger here was the overpriced Five Guys, and their burgers are garbage. I had my doubts.Let me start with my first impressions. The dining area itself is small, and admittedly, lacks personality. Not much decor is on the walls aside from a few artsy-cutesy scribbles. And not many patrons were on hand either. But whatever, it was an early afternoon, many people were just getting off work at this time. We were sat quickly by a very pleasant waitress, and proceeded to order. Now, the way you order is a tad odd, but ingenious in a way where it frees up a waitress's workload. The menu is basically a check list. You have a choice of appetizers, and from there you can select the way you want your burger done, what toppings, what kind of bun, etc. A pastel type pen is provided for you to check off your choices on the menu. My friend and I both chose a beef burger with bacon, and a jalapeño-mayo sauce. I had my burger with smoked Gouda, and he had his with asiago. 15 minutes later, the burgers arrive, and the rest was history. Super juicy patty, equally soft bun; this was a quality burger my friend. The jalapeño-mayo sauce was seriously lacking kick, but never mind that, this burger deserves the full five stars based on the burger basics alone. It is a technical marvel. I've had many great burgers in Manhattan, but Burger Bistro can compete with just about any of them. Just because you're residing in Bay Ridge no longer means that you can't get a good burger.

I have to say i enjoyed everything about Burger Bistro from the friendly staff to the yummy tater tots to the burgers . First we ordered the buffalo tater tots and i was in fat girl heaven they were crunch and soft and mixed with some crumbled blue cheese and buffalo sauce it was yummy . Next we ordered a burger i had a beef burger with fried mozzarella which came with 2 actual mozzarella sticks so cute then topped it off with a fried egg and on a garlic roll so yummy tasty juicy and tender it was awesome burger . I had there fresh made Arnold Palmer drink which is ice tea and lemonade mix it was super tasty and not to sweet . yes it can get a bit pricey since you are creating your own burger but it was so worth the money .,5.0

"For a slightly boozhi burger experience in a not so boozhi area, this place is perfect. The burgers here are pretty good in quality and taste. In a build-your-own format you can choose many different options(meat, condiments, bun,etc) with additional options of creative appetizers(I had the buffalo tater tots). The burger was a fair portion cooked well with all my selected fixins. I did not like my bun or any other that my table had chosen. It seems they are trying too hard to be upscale and taking away from a traditional burger taste. The appetizer/sides were also pretty good.Some negatives from my experience were the wait time (30 mins), cramped seating area and cost of the meal( anything you add on to the burger is ~$1 a piece). Overall I would come back here but it would not be my first choice with the abundance of bar/pub fare in the neighborhood.",3.0

Service was attentive but getting the food out was a little slow. The ice cream sandwiches were HUGE! They're like my bf's dream ice cream sandwiches.

A nice small place for a fresh burger. The servers were welcoming and explained a lot about the menu when we entered. The blue cheese tater tots we had were quite salty. Good but really salty.

"Solid place for a burger in South Brooklyn.The concept is DIY; you fill out what kind of burger you want (beef? turkey? shrimp??) and then check off your toppings like you would on a lotto ticket (some goat cheese? fried onions? pickled jalapenos??).  I like when restos make flavor recommendations, but there's something to be said about being the king of your own burger.  I got the beef burger with applewood bacon and blue cheese.  Opting to stick with an old faithful burger combo, this one inch thick, medium rare burger was a damn fine flavor explosion, if I do say so myself.  I could have gone a little funkier, but there are obvious consequences to choosing a bad combination.  With no recommended combos on the menu and a big ingredient list, you are left to the burger wolves if you make an ill informed choice.Beer selection is solid, if somewhat vanilla - but I'm not complaining about pairing a juicy burger with a Hoegaarden or Magic Hat #9.   Definitely recommended.",4.0

"For a slightly boozhi burger experience in a not so boozhi area, this place is perfect. The burgers here are pretty good in quality and taste. In a build-your-own format you can choose many different options(meat, condiments, bun,etc) with additional options of creative appetizers(I had the buffalo tater tots). The burger was a fair portion cooked well with all my selected fixins. I did not like my bun or any other that my table had chosen. It seems they are trying too hard to be upscale and taking away from a traditional burger taste. The appetizer/sides were also pretty good.Some negatives from my experience were the wait time (30 mins), cramped seating area and cost of the meal( anything you add on to the burger is ~$1 a piece). Overall I would come back here but it would not be my first choice with the abundance of bar/pub fare in the neighborhood.",3.0
"Mmmmmmmm, finally got to go to Burger Bistro after months of drooling over the pictures and reviews on Yelp! I wouldn't say that this is the best burger I've ever had but it's not bad! The chipotle mayo is killer, sort of like crack juice. This is not a place where you want to bring a date...unless your date appreciates your face covered in meat, lettuce, tomato, mayo and such. Service was attentive but getting the food out was a little slow. The ice cream sandwiches were HUGE! They're like my bf's dream ice cream sandwiches.

"What you'll find here- Delicious food and attentive staff!I never really cared for the restaurants around my neighborhood, mainly because none of my friends live near me and so whenever I eat out, it's usually wherever is convenient for all my buddies.However, I will be sure to drag my friends here the next time they ever decide to pay me a visit.What we ordered:Appetizers- The boyfriend and I tried the Buffalo Tots (He thought it was supposed to be chicken....but I thought it couldn't be more clear that it was not.) We didn't like it very much and felt that it'd taste better if it were chicken balls/boneless buffalo wings.  The Meal- We both had the Lunch Special (1 burger, 1 cheese, 1 special topping, 1 side).  We both ordered the beef burger medium with bacon. However, I had the Potato slider buns and he had some other not-as-important bun. I recommend the potato buns because potato bread is the bestest.The burgers were cooked perfectly and oh-so-juicy.The sides of Fries and tater tots were crunchy and satiable.  I think the tots were a tad tastier though. Next time, I think I'll try to salad though....so that I can eat my bacon cheeseburger guiltless and maybe even order an ice cream sandwich..Other things to note: -Lunch special (from 11-4?) is only $9, very very worth it considering the burger itself is $7 (excluding special toppings). -Free toppings include tomato, lettuce, and raw onions.-I love the menus and the red markers!

I've had both the beef burger and the turkey burger and both were great and cooked according to my request (medium) and the same goes for my husband. The burgers are spiced perfectly and so juicy. Even the fries are good! I also really like the buffalo tater tots.And also, i go to restaurants i've heard good things about. I will then frequent those restaurants if I thought the food, service, etc was deserving of my money. I dont base my decisions on a ""cutesy"" way to fill out a menu. I'm not 2.",5.0
"Okay; while I admire this place and its success I feel everyone should be aware of how to get the best satisfaction out of this menu. Its a 'check-box style' menu--you check off the items you want 'assembled' into your burger. Roll; meat; done-ness; toppings; etc. Its great but it can go terribly wrong. Some of these gourmet ingredients are hard to figure out in advance. You have no way of knowing if they're going to be to your taste. So the best solution is to always order the 'slider' style burger (2 mini burgers) until you're more certain of the way they do things here. You don't want to get stuck with a huge-size burger which is not what you expected.For example: 'brioche' roll is the default burger bun here. Not everyone's fave. What are the other choices though? Garlic bread or whole wheat. This is a little bit awkward. If only 'potato rolls' (used on the sliders) were also available in the full burger size--it would help.Next, the ""done-ness"". Seemingly, every restaurant defines this differently. You should ask questions to determine before-hand, just how 'pink' the 'pink meat' will be and how much of that 'pink' is going to permeate the burger when it finally arrives. I know this can be difficult to nail down when communicating with a waiter/kitchen.Also: the beef itself. yes, I'm used to the concept of 'more flavorful' burgers attained by mixing in some higher-cut sirloin (guessing that's what they do here) but I find biting into a burger and discovering a 'striated' or 'fleshy' burger-texture disconcerting. Hard to explain. Burgers are traditionally a 'mealy' or 'ground-up' texture--to my way of thinking, anyway. If its too 'steak-like' I feel weird eating it in a bun; would rather cut it with knife/fork, almost.Another item: blue cheese. When you order blue cheese on a burger here, you aren't getting some creamy blue cheese dressing or spread. You are getting ACTUAL blue cheese. Crumbly, dry, pungent, potent blue cheese. It can give your burger a markedly different flavor than what you expect. (Blue cheese 'spread' is in the 'sauces' section and easily overlooked.)But still: catch my drift? 'Burger Bistro' is applying 'gourmet' to every part of a burger; and that's excellent --but sometimes gourmet doesn't always work. Some things--conceivably--aren't meant to be gourmet. So: get the sliders until you find your comfort-zone. Sliders have been the best meal I've had here. Everything else on the menu is fine--'tater tots' in particular are superb. And service is impeccable. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood and can be a lot of fun. But just be mindful that its not your usual burger place--in ways you may not be ready for. You can find yourself walking out of here with a $30 meal which feels strange in your stomach; and it won't  be their fault. It'll be yours. They say 'gourmet' and they mean 'gourmet'. Its really best to take your time and ask thorough questions of the waitstaff rather than 'assume'. Believe me, they will be ready to help you with plenty of patience and information as to how the burger presentation is actually going to look on your plate. No harm in asking!",4.0

"Yelp helped me find this place. The power of yelp! The burgers are delicious. I love how their menu works (you mark down with a pencil what type of burger you want, what type of toppings, what type of cheese, and what type of sauce and then note any sides). The burger is a good size and filling. The sweet potato fries were yummy (and a huge portion! I had to take home).And of course their ice cream sandwiches. I've gotten those to go a few times since. My favorite is chocolate cookie with dulce de leche ice cream inside. As with the burgers you can pick the cookie and pick the ice cream. On nom nom!..... damn. Now I want some.",5.0

This place was just so frickin enjoyable!The selection is extensive and the presentation/atmophere/crowd is fun and energetic.  They also have large picnic tables in the back (with a backyard feel) which are great to sit at when the weather's nice.  I thoroughly enjoyed my turkey burger and glass or Merlot on a breezy August evening at the picnic table.,5.0
"This is a solid burger place. The burgers taste really good, and the toppings are great complements too. My standard order is a medium-well with swiss, frizzled onions, lettuce, tomato, and a side of horseradish cream dip.The buffalo tater tots are GREAT, and I don't even like ""buffalo style"" things. The tots are hot and crispy, with lots of blue cheese chunks and just the right amount of sliced celery. The deep-fried corn on the cob is coated with tangy BBQ sauce and makes me feel like I'm eating a vegetable, so that's always a win. The bistro chips (with blue cheese and bacon) are a delicious idea that I first experienced at Buckhead Diner in Atlanta. Burger Bistro's version could have a bit more blue cheese on them, or some blue cheese dip to accompany it.The meat itself was good but not exceptional. It had a bit too much snap to it, like it would if it were a frozen patty. (The meat itself seems fresh, though. Maybe it was over-mixed?) The brioche rolls are the best thing you can put a burger on. The burgers taste better than Five Guys, but the Five Guys meat melts in your mouth a bit better. The toppings are also way expensive - you have to pay extra for each one you order, pushing the price of a burger way over $10.They always have the order ready and hot for me when I call it in, and there's never been any of the typical confusion you get at so many places that offer takeout. Parking is basically impossible - if you're lucky, you can find a hydrant and run in, keeping your fingers crossed.",4.0
"I was here last year for the Backyard Event. The food was mighty tasty as I remember. When I saw a Yelp Deal come out, I knew I had to get one. Just thinking about those juicy sliders made my mouth water. I decided to use it this past weekend and now i'm having second thoughts on my purchase.Burger Bistro is located a few blocks off the R train in Bay Ridge. It's cool spot to grab burger, a beer and enjoy a nice backyard. Since I already knew how the food was, I already knew what I wanted. A nice juicy burger and nice sides to munch on. I was right about the sides, but wrong about the burger.First we sat down at the table and was handed menus. It took us a few minutes to look it over and marked what we wanted. We decided to start with some Fried Artichoke Hearts and two burgers with a side of Sweet Potato Fries. The GOOD:The Fried Artichokes were fried to perfection and were nice and crispy. The horseradish sauce was really good. The Sweet Potato Fries were really good, no sauce needed. They are perfectly seasoned. Also the Buffalo Tater Tots are really good. These were covered is Buffalo sauce and crumbled with blue cheese and Celery slices.The BAD:After we placed our order a group of 3 guys came in and say down at the table in front of us. They ordered some drinks and food. It was probably a 10min difference and they got whatever they ordered FIRST. All had burgers and sides. It took about 30 MINUTES for our order to arrive. At times I felt like I had to get up and walk up to the waiter and staff where our food was. I didn't want make scene and just let it slide. Finally after 30 MINUTES our food arrives. It was good, but the waiter NEVER apologized for the wait. My hamburger arrived with the grilled portobello mushrooms and peppers with some pickles. You have the option on how you want the meat cooked. Rare, Medium Rare, Medium Well and Well Done. If your not sure what kind you like a description is on the menu. Based on the menu I chose Medium Well that says, ""hot pink slight center"". My burger came nice and juicy, but NOT a sight of PINK was seen. I didn't want to delay my food even more so I decided to just eat it. I was initially going to give you a ONE STAR REVIEW, but your dessert saved the meal. The Ice Cream sandwiches are REALLY GOOD. The got the Dulce de Leche ice cream between two Peanut Butter cookies. I don't know if i'm going to come back here again. It's a bit of a trek into Brooklyn and the service wasn't what I expected. Having to WAIT for 30 MINUTES for your food at a restaurant that wasn't even full is just RIDICULOUS.",2.0

"Oh Burger Bistro, what happened to you? This used to be a perfect family spot. The concept was good -- build your own burger by circling items on the menu -- and there was something for everyone. Most important, the burgers were good! We went last night and it will be our last time. One of the first things we noticed was the prices. They seem to be much higher than they used to be. A beef burger is $8.25 plus extra for cheese and various toppings. And that does not include french fries or anything else (not even a pickle). A kobe beef burger is $4 more and a lamb burger is $2 more. Appetizers are also $8.25. We had buffalo tater tots and fried artichokes, both of which tasted like grocery store freezer items. I had a lamb burger, which I ordered medium rare. When it came it was raw inside. You could tell that the meat had been overhandled until it was pink slime. No wonder it didn't cook right! My husband's lamb burger was the same. I sent mine back and asked for a beef burger. My husband was so disgusted he just sent his plate away. When my burger finally came, it was just as raw and slimy! When I pointed out that the first burger was underdone, the server said that people are often surprised at how rare their burgers are. What is that supposed to mean? Why would you have a practice of undercooking burgers? In sum, this place gets all of the essential elements of a burger joint exactly wrong: (1) the prices are too high, (2) the meat is low quality and not seasoned properly, (3) the meat is smushed to a paste, (4) the burgers are grossly undercooked. Go somewhere else for a great burger -- like to Brooklyn Beet, or to Lot 2 in South Slope.",1.0
"Yelp helped me find this place. The power of yelp! The burgers are delicious. I love how their menu works (you mark down with a pencil what type of burger you want, what type of toppings, what type of cheese, and what type of sauce and then note any sides). The burger is a good size and filling. The sweet potato fries were yummy (and a huge portion! I had to take home).And of course their ice cream sandwiches. I've gotten those to go a few times since. My favorite is chocolate cookie with dulce de leche ice cream inside. As with the burgers you can pick the cookie and pick the ice cream. On nom nom!..... damn. Now I want some.",5.0
"Can't get enough of this place! We had lunch at Burger Bistro, but were too full to have a dessert, so this time we went and we had the famous ice cream sandwiches, which was amazing! It will hit and cure any sweet tooth! This location had a nice environment, very nice. I loved it!",5.0
"Had their burger and fries, and they were both average, especially considering the price.The fries were clearly the frozen kind, and set me back $4.50. The service was great, which is why i gave the 2nd star. The place has potential, just wish they would put more thought into making a better burger, since it is the only item on their menu.",2.0
"I saw this place in a Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives book. Tried it and thought it was very good. Hamburgers done well and the fried corn is excellent.",4.0
"Love Burger Bistro! Our first experience here was not that great (almost burnt meat) but they redeemed themselves multiple times after that. I always order the slider, it comes in 2 decent-sized sliders and easier to eat! My husband and I are fans of their seasoned fries too. One thing to keep in mind is the food is so much better when you eat there rather than delivery. We got delivery once and the burger was soggy.",5.0
This place was just so frickin enjoyable!The selection is extensive and the presentation/atmophere/crowd is fun and energetic.  They also have large picnic tables in the back (with a backyard feel) which are great to sit at when the weather's nice.  I thoroughly enjoyed my turkey burger and glass or Merlot on a breezy August evening at the picnic table.,5.0
"This is a solid burger place. The burgers taste really good, and the toppings are great complements too. My standard order is a medium-well with swiss, frizzled onions, lettuce, tomato, and a side of horseradish cream dip.The buffalo tater tots are GREAT, and I don't even like ""buffalo style"" things. The tots are hot and crispy, with lots of blue cheese chunks and just the right amount of sliced celery. The deep-fried corn on the cob is coated with tangy BBQ sauce and makes me feel like I'm eating a vegetable, so that's always a win. The bistro chips (with blue cheese and bacon) are a delicious idea that I first experienced at Buckhead Diner in Atlanta. Burger Bistro's version could have a bit more blue cheese on them, or some blue cheese dip to accompany it.The meat itself was good but not exceptional. It had a bit too much snap to it, like it would if it were a frozen patty. (The meat itself seems fresh, though. Maybe it was over-mixed?) The brioche rolls are the best thing you can put a burger on. The burgers taste better than Five Guys, but the Five Guys meat melts in your mouth a bit better. The toppings are also way expensive - you have to pay extra for each one you order, pushing the price of a burger way over $10.They always have the order ready and hot for me when I call it in, and there's never been any of the typical confusion you get at so many places that offer takeout. Parking is basically impossible - if you're lucky, you can find a hydrant and run in, keeping your fingers crossed.",4.0
"I was here last year for the Backyard Event. The food was mighty tasty as I remember. When I saw a Yelp Deal come out, I knew I had to get one.

"I'm not a big fan of burgers but THIS place..there's just something about their food.  Serge and I ordered from here for the 2nd time last night.  Thankfully we didn't go nuts and order almost everything on the menu like we did the first time we ordered. I sort of wish the burgers included a side but the $ is worth it.  We both ordered burgers with 2 toppings, 2 orders of fries, frizzled onions and a side of sauce and it was under 35 bucks - not bad.They make the burgers exactly how you order them (rare, med/well, etc.).  I don't know what seasoning they use for the burgers but they're tasty and have the BBQ grilled flavor - they're also HUGE!  They have many types of toppings, cheeses and even types of bread.  The seasoned fries are very, uh, seasoned but delicous.  The frizzled onions were delicious.  In the past we tried the crab cake, grilled vegetables, and sweet potato fries which were all awesome.  I'd love to eat in at this place but after eating they're food, you just wanna unzip your pants a little cause you'll def NEED the room ha!

"You're going to charge me for toppings on a burger, fine. You're going to charge me for fries, fine. I'll happily pay upwards of $15+ for a perfectly cooked burger with high-quality ingredients.

"This review is after the second visit to the bistro of burgers.  Aside from the food which I'll get to, the place itself is pretty cool.  I like the decor from the backward written wall that you have to look at the mirror to read, to the tables, chairs and menus.  Their menu is simple and laminated so you can check off items that you want with a grease pen.  You always build you're own burger since they don't offer a signature.  I like this type of menu, because I know what I want in a burger.  Also, if the order is wrong, then its on you.  They have a few craft beers and wines which are nice to enjoy with a burger.  I ordered a beef burger medium with pepper jack on a whole wheat bun with a side of chipotle mayo and seasoned fries.  The burger was cooked as ordered, juicy but not greasy.  The debate whether a burger should be greasy or not varies according to who you talk to.  In my opinion, the smaller the burger the greasier it should be to compensate for the loss of juiciness.  Since this burger is about 6-8 oz, the lower cook temp helps retain the meats natural juices.  For people who order burgers mid-well to destroyed, there's no hope for you.  The only complaint I had about the burger is whole wheat bun.  It was a little dry and not toasted.  Adding a little heat to the bun would help it go a long way.  Looking around, I think the brioche bun suffered from the same fate except that it comes with it's own buttery fail-safe.  Still, warming up the bun a little makes it softer and helps it hold onto  the burger.  The seasoned fries were great.  They used old bay which was a nice unexpected treat, but I think they were a little heavy handed with the seasoning.I will definitely go back and maybe take a chance on their special burger.  The day I went they had elk, but I wanted to vet their craft based on the standard before venturing into less popular offerings.",4.0

"Ok. Again. 3 simple burgers. $11 each? We had 3 burgers and 2 orders of fries delivered and it was $52 with tax and tip. Butcher Bar double burgers are $6 and change. Burger Bistro burgers taste fine, a bit dry at times, or overcooked, but fine. I've never had a bad meal there but they overdo it with the prices and nickel and dime you to death. I'm surprised they don't charge extra for utensils and napkins. I was cracking up that they charged $6 to add chicken to a salad. $30 for a cheesburger, fries and salad. So, it's good but the prices are annoying.",2.0
"I'm a huge burger fan and I have very high standards for burgers. I can only give this place 3 stars. I felt like it was overrated from all the reviews i've been reading. I asked for a medium rare burger and got a medium well. I'm very picky about the way the my meat is cooked and the medium well was just too dry for me. I ended up piling a punch of pepper and ketchup on it. Their tator tots was soggy but their sweet potato string fries were really really good. It was different, it's not like your typical shoe string fries where its thin but this one had texture and it wasn't thin. The fries were the best part of my meal but I can't give a rating on a burger joint based on their fries.",3.0
"Had the Kobe burger, it was average at best and very pricey. I like the concept of being able to create your own burger however the additional topping will definitely boost your bill ($1.25 for a slice of cheese etc..).

"Very disappointed.  The burgers were okay but nothing special. To charge $15 for a burger and not to give fries, is silly.

This place averaging four stars has to be a joke. I am tempted to give two stars but decided to round up to three simply because of their professionalism/customer service. One waiter dropped a fork on the floor while placing utensils on an unoccupied table with really no-one but myself noticing and he actually took it to the back towards the dirty dishes and brought out a fresh one. - (Good run on sentence but I had no clue how to shorten it). Anyways my waiter was very pleasant and offered good suggestions for my meal. I ended up trying both the chicken burger and beef burgers added some regular fries and washed it down with a ginger ale soda. The chicken burger was surely better than the beef and really didn't even need a sauce . The fries was nothing to brag about wish they were fresh cut though with the amount of people they had working . The ginger ale was super watered down and not good at all. For approx 40 dollars total including tip I expected better. Smash burger has a very similar concept to this place and quite frankly have way better tasting food for 1/2 the price. Maybe if they didn't charge a dollar for every frickin topping and a sauce I would return but other than that it's simply not worth it to me.,3.0

"I was really craving a fat juicy burger on a rainy day. I called up a girlfriend of mine and asked her if she wanted to get FAT JUICY BURGERS with me - she obliged.

I'll probably try a different mayo the next time. It just kind of tasted like cream.. Does that make sense? It didn't taste like mayo - but then again it didn't really taste like anything - just sauce. LOL TATER TOTS: I LOVE TATER TOTS. When I was in JHS and HS, I'd forgo lunch my grandma would make for me, just so I could get school lunch. JUST FOR THOSE DELICIOUS TATER TOTS. Definitely brought me back to being an adolescent.

"3.5 stars...I REALLY wanted to love Burger Bistro, after all, I don't think I've ever been disappointed with a 4.5 star restaurant before. I'm still rationalizing my 3.5 star review in my head thinking that maybe I just had a rare experience and that I should come back but then I remember my theory that the best places just don't have off-days and that there are too many places in NYC to try to go back to a place that had a fail in any meaningful way.I came on Friday around 3pm and the upscale yet creatively down-to-earth burger restaurant was devoid of any customers. I sat myself and was given their menu, the best thing about this place (their beautiful backyard patio is a close second). You're given a red china marker and a laminated menu where you create your perfect burger from a huge list of customizations. Your basic cheeseburger will run you $7 but once you add fries and a few toppings you can easily get to $12-15. I understand how bacon or cheese can be $1 each but these guys charge the same $1 if you want BBQ sauce on your burger, that's just ridiculous. I got a beef burger cooked medium on a wheat bun topped with sharp cheddar, caramelized onions, and seasoned fries (if you go between 2-4pm M-F they have a lunch special where you basically get a free side). They have beer and wine here but the options weren't on the food menu and no where did I see a list or was given a separate menu for it so I still don't know what they serve here.When my burger came it was beautifully sitting on a plate beside a nice mound of fries. The fries were great, they were piping hot, crispy, and a good size. They basically take the normal fries and toss it with old bay or some combination of seasonings. The burger's diameter was pretty small (I'd say about 4"") but it was nice and thick and piled high with caramelized onions (a little too much). My issue with the burger was even though it was juicy and cooked correctly (properly on a grill instead of greasy on a flat top) it wasn't tender at all. The texture was just a little too tough and worse yet, the outside was mostly this thick black charred crust of sorts.I was never checked on during my meal and even though by the time I was done there was several other people in the restaurant I still had to flag someone down after sitting idly by for several minutes to get someone to get me a check. I saw the guy who went to get my check do something to prepare the check on the computer in the back then he continued to do chores and start doing dishes. I sat astounded as the already so-so service got much worse when he totally forgot that I was sitting there waiting. I eventually put my coat on and walked up to the back area to retrieve my check and pay, luckily I had cash so I didn't have to wait anymore.If the burger was as amazing as I thought it would be I wouldn't care much about the service flop because the place was still nice and I like how their menu works but they are a burger place and there is no real reason for tough meat or a charred outside. For now I'll stick to my two favorite places for burgers, Bareburger and Hope & Anchor.",3.0
"Good solid burger place, but toppings start to add up after awhile. So the 7 dollar burger turns into a 10 buck burger quick.Burger itself wasn't cooked exactly medium, more medium wellish. Patty was fine but not extraordinary. Slightly overcooking the patty is forgivable, but I ordered a fried egg ontop. And THAT is a crime to overcook. No runny yolk! What's the point of getting a burger with an egg if no runny yolk!! The cheeseburger nachos or whatever they call them are kinda cool, but the chip needs to be a heartier thicker chip, it feels too flimsy for the toppings after awhile.The sweet potato fries are addictive. Pretty good, not sure what they do to them, maybe dredge them in a lil flour. They def do something. Good stuff.This is a good burger place, just not great.",3.0
"Looks like my order was rushed, it was nearly full house after 6 pm Sunday.  I ordered a beef burger, medium/well and sweet potato fries.  When my food was served to me, I thought ""burnt hockey puck.""  I cut it in half and it looked more than slightly pink.  Still edible and I finished the burger. Fries were excellent, a mix of shoestrings that are moist center and some crispy.  Next, eating Sunday dinner at the Park Slope to compare service and food.Speaking of service, the staff were uber nice and accommodating.  I picked a seat near the open door and windows until I got allergic to the smell of cigarette smoke. Then I asked if I could sit further inside which turned out to be warm.  My waitress said she could turn on the air-conditioner which she did.  Ahh...",2.0
"Excellent little spot, I actually walked by it without noticing it.But the environment is fantastic - cozy, friendly staff, pleasant decor, and beautiful scents of fries and burgers floating around.The menu is neat and simple, prices are near the type of orders and you check things you want. The burgers have more than one variety with how you want it done. Plenty of toppings to sauces to select some, and add on a side and it's so filling.I got a medium cooked burger and it was made correctly with juices in tact. Cucumber yogurt is ok, weird bit of topping sauce. The guacamole, frazzled onions, roasted peppers, portobello mushroom all look delicious ($1 each topping and sauce). A side of seasoned fries and this meal was just great.However, I did save room for the ice cream sandwich. Double chocolate chip with mint ice cream combination was fantastic. Cookies were hard, but when it breaks off with the ice cream, oh so good and delectable.Fantastic spot for some custom burgers and excellent staff service. Superb spot and looking forward to having some more toppings on my burger.Note: there's a lunch special from Monday to Friday - $8 for a burger with 2 toppings I think (see pictures). Excellent deal!-Also, for those who have a Yelp deal, do spend it all on the food. The staff noted that for me and made the most of my deal.",5.0
"Here's the thing:  the Roy Roger's Fixin's bar is one of the greatest things to ever be conceived by man.  There is no logical argument that can prove otherwise.  There were delicious sauces that you could mix into a crazy gross looking but delicious concoction as well as pickles that, despite sitting out all day, were the best pickles I ever had.  Or so my memory will have my believe.  Plus, great name.  Fixin's Bar.  Awesome.This is why The Burger Bistro is the shit.  While you cannot actually walk to a mini salad bar/kiosk thing in the middle of the restaurant, there tons of ways to have your burger customized before it is brought out to you.The options provide the possibility for endless combinations. There are 9 cheeses, 4 roll choices, 11 possible toppings (frizzled or carmelied onions, bread and butter pickles, bacon, an egg, mushrooms, other awesome shit), 6 sauces, 4 types of burgers and 8 sides to choose from.  I recommend horseradish sauce and / or wasabi mayo. But I would just dip the fries in them. Actually, why get fries when you can get tater tots?  Fucking tater tots, dude!Also - the burgers are absolutely fantastic.  If you don't live in Bay Ridge and already have a favorite burger place, this is may be an inessential trip.  That is, if the idea of a thousand toppings and tater tots doesn't get you hyped the fuck up.  And if the idea of tater tots doesn't get you hyped the fuck up, you ate lame shit in middle school.",4.0
"I had a beef burger with brioche bun and mozzerella cheese with a side of sweet potato fries and my friend had a beef burger on brioche bun with crumbled bacon and a side of wasabi mayo sauce. We both asked for the burgers medium rare and it was perfect. I wish the meat was a bit more flavforul though. My one complaint is that the bun was cold, not even warm. Wish they would have warmed it up before serving it. The sweet potato fries were good and tasted fresh. The mayo sauce was also very good and went well with the burgers and when mixed together with the ketchup served as a very good dipping sauce for the fries. I have been to their other location in park slope and it seems as though the prices have increased by quite a lot since the last time I went to a burger bistro. If I didn't have a groupon I don't think I would have added on any toppings or gotten a side because it would have been too expensive for a quick lunch. Good food, good service, but rather pricey.",4.0

"Before i start this, i'd like to point out that this is probably the most anger i've experienced towards food. I order from this place pretty regularly, and it was my go to spot when i wanted to indulge in a good burger. Lately they have just been terrible. Every time i order now the bread is soggy to the point of paste and the meat is taste-less. The fries are soggy and kind of taste-less as well. Normally i order the beef burger, but one day i decided to try a Kobe Beef burger thinking it would be a step up. It turned out to be just a huuuge thick slab of way too soft and bland beef. For a moment i thought i was eating wet, grounded up cardboard. I thought okay, i'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a bad day for the chef. But today...i try their grilled chicken sandwich and its the same deal. The chicken was an inch thick, way overcooked, and would probably lose in a taste competition against a paper napkin. The bun was falling apart, and the fries were like eating french fries that have been boiled in plain water after it was fried. I don't know but they must have changed ownership recently, and i will most likely never order from here again.",1.0

I'm still rationalizing my 3.5 star review in my head thinking that maybe I just had a rare experience and that I should come back but then I remember my theory that the best places just don't have off-days and that there are too many places in NYC to try to go back to a place that had a fail in any meaningful way.I came on Friday around 3pm and the upscale yet creatively down-to-earth burger restaurant was devoid of any customers. I sat myself and was given their menu, the best thing about this place (their beautiful backyard patio is a close second). You're given a red china marker and a laminated menu where you create your perfect burger from a huge list of customizations. Your basic cheeseburger will run you $7 but once you add fries and a few toppings you can easily get to $12-15. I understand how bacon or cheese can be $1 each but these guys charge the same $1 if you want BBQ sauce on your burger, that's just ridiculous. I got a beef burger cooked medium on a wheat bun topped with sharp cheddar, caramelized onions, and seasoned fries (if you go between 2-4pm M-F they have a lunch special where you basically get a free side). They have beer and wine here but the options weren't on the food menu and no where did I see a list or was given a separate menu for it so I still don't know what they serve here.When my burger came it was beautifully sitting on a plate beside a nice mound of fries. The fries were great, they were piping hot, crispy, and a good size. They basically take the normal fries and toss it with old bay or some combination of seasonings. The burger's diameter was pretty small (I'd say about 4"") but it was nice and thick and piled high with caramelized onions (a little too much). My issue with the burger was even though it was juicy and cooked correctly (properly on a grill instead of greasy on a flat top) it wasn't tender at all. The texture was just a little too tough and worse yet, the outside was mostly this thick black charred crust of sorts.I was never checked on during my meal and even though by the time I was done there was several other people in the restaurant I still had to flag someone down after sitting idly by for several minutes to get someone to get me a check. I saw the guy who went to get my check do something to prepare the check on the computer in the back then he continued to do chores and start doing dishes. I sat astounded as the already so-so service got much worse when he totally forgot that I was sitting there waiting. I eventually put my coat on and walked up to the back area to retrieve my check and pay, luckily I had cash so I didn't have to wait anymore.If the burger was as amazing as I thought it would be I wouldn't care much about the service flop because the place was still nice and I like how their menu works but they are a burger place and there is no real reason for tough meat or a charred outside. For now I'll stick to my two favorite places for burgers, Bareburger and Hope & Anchor.",3.0
"Good solid burger place, but toppings start to add up after awhile. So the 7 dollar burger turns into a 10 buck burger quick.Burger itself wasn't cooked exactly medium, more medium wellish. Patty was fine but not extraordinary. Slightly overcooking the patty is forgivable, but I ordered a fried egg ontop. And THAT is a crime to overcook. No runny yolk! What's the point of getting a burger with an egg if no runny yolk!! The cheeseburger nachos or whatever they call them are kinda cool, but the chip needs to be a heartier thicker chip, it feels too flimsy for the toppings after awhile.The sweet potato fries are addictive. Pretty good, not sure what they do to them, maybe dredge them in a lil flour. They def do something. Good stuff.This is a good burger place, just not great.",3.0
"Looks like my order was rushed, it was nearly full house after 6 pm Sunday.  I ordered a beef burger, medium/well and sweet potato fries.  When my food was served to me, I thought ""burnt hockey puck.""  I cut it in half and it looked more than slightly pink.  Still edible and I finished the burger. Fries were excellent, a mix of shoestrings that are moist center and some crispy.  Next, eating Sunday dinner at the Park Slope to compare service and food.Speaking of service, the staff were uber nice and accommodating.  I picked a seat near the open door and windows until I got allergic to the smell of cigarette smoke. Then I asked if I could sit further inside which turned out to be warm.  My waitress said she could turn on the air-conditioner which she did.  Ahh...",2.0
"Excellent little spot, I actually walked by it without noticing it.But the environment is fantastic - cozy, friendly staff, pleasant decor, and beautiful scents of fries and burgers floating around.The menu is neat and simple, prices are near the type of orders and you check things you want. The burgers have more than one variety with how you want it done. Plenty of toppings to sauces to select some, and add on a side and it's so filling.I got a medium cooked burger and it was made correctly with juices in tact. Cucumber yogurt is ok, weird bit of topping sauce. The guacamole, frazzled onions, roasted peppers, portobello mushroom all look delicious ($1 each topping and sauce). A side of seasoned fries and this meal was just great.However, I did save room for the ice cream sandwich. Double chocolate chip with mint ice cream combination was fantastic. Cookies were hard, but when it breaks off with the ice cream, oh so good and delectable.Fantastic spot for some custom burgers and excellent staff service. Superb spot and looking forward to having some more toppings on my burger.Note: there's a lunch special from Monday to Friday - $8 for a burger with 2 toppings I think (see pictures). Excellent deal!-Also, for those who have a Yelp deal, do spend it all on the food. The staff noted that for me and made the most of my deal.",5.0
"Here's the thing:  the Roy Roger's Fixin's bar is one of the greatest things to ever be conceived by man.  There is no logical argument that can prove otherwise.  There were delicious sauces that you could mix into a crazy gross looking but delicious concoction as well as pickles that, despite sitting out all day, were the best pickles I ever had.  Or so my memory will have my believe.  Plus, great name.  Fixin's Bar.  Awesome.This is why The Burger Bistro is the shit.  While you cannot actually walk to a mini salad bar/kiosk thing in the middle of the restaurant, there tons of ways to have your burger customized before it is brought out to you.The options provide the possibility for endless combinations. There are 9 cheeses, 4 roll choices, 11 possible toppings (frizzled or carmelied onions, bread and butter pickles, bacon, an egg, mushrooms, other awesome shit), 6 sauces, 4 types of burgers and 8 sides to choose from.  I recommend horseradish sauce and / or wasabi mayo. But I would just dip the fries in them. Actually, why get fries when you can get tater tots?  Fucking tater tots, dude!Also - the burgers are absolutely fantastic.  If you don't live in Bay Ridge and already have a favorite burger place, this is may be an inessential trip.  That is, if the idea of a thousand toppings and tater tots doesn't get you hyped the fuck up.  And if the idea of tater tots doesn't get you hyped the fuck up, you ate lame shit in middle school.",4.0
"I had a beef burger with brioche bun and mozzerella cheese with a side of sweet potato fries and my friend had a beef burger on brioche bun with crumbled bacon and a side of wasabi mayo sauce. We both asked for the burgers medium rare and it was perfect. I wish the meat was a bit more flavforul though. My one complaint is that the bun was cold, not even warm. Wish they would have warmed it up before serving it. The sweet potato fries were good and tasted fresh. The mayo sauce was also very good and went well with the burgers and when mixed together with the ketchup served as a very good dipping sauce for the fries. I have been to their other location in park slope and it seems as though the prices have increased by quite a lot since the last time I went to a burger bistro. If I didn't have a groupon I don't think I would have added on any toppings or gotten a side because it would have been too expensive for a quick lunch. Good food, good service, but rather pricey.",4.0

"Before i start this, i'd like to point out that this is probably the most anger i've experienced towards food. I order from this place pretty regularly, and it was my go to spot when i wanted to indulge in a good burger. Lately they have just been terrible. Every time i order now the bread is soggy to the point of paste and the meat is taste-less. The fries are soggy and kind of taste-less as well. Normally i order the beef burger, but one day i decided to try a Kobe Beef burger thinking it would be a step up. It turned out to be just a huuuge thick slab of way too soft and bland beef. For a moment i thought i was eating wet, grounded up cardboard. I thought okay, i'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a bad day for the chef. But today...i try their grilled chicken sandwich and its the same deal. The chicken was an inch thick, way overcooked, and would probably lose in a taste competition against a paper napkin. The bun was falling apart, and the fries were like eating french fries that have been boiled in plain water after it was fried. I don't know but they must have changed ownership recently, and i will most likely never order from here again.",1.0

I got the burger with cheese and mushrooms and tried tater tots and sweet potato fries from my friends. This had to been one of the best burgers I've had in a while. Hell of a lot cheaper too than another place I liked that's in the city. They give a nice sized portion for the price and my only honest regret was not marking off the tomato and lettuce on the menu because even that looked damn good on my friends' plates. The sides I tried were just as awesome. The only minor but not worth losing a star for I'd say is that the music was kind of obnoxious at certain points. But regardless I don't want a burger from anywhere else but here from now on. That's how much of awesome was in that burger.",5.0

It was very tough to eat and I had to use quite a bit of force to rip apart the steak. It didn't taste good. At all.(2) The burgers are now smaller and definitely not as tasty. When I got a burger the last time I was there, I couldn't believe how small the roll was! Not only that, but the roll wasn't good at all. I usually get sliders but noticed that instead of three sliders they now only offer two sliders. The mushroom on my burger tasted way off. Less bacon on my burger than I remember. Just overall a very disappointing burger.(3) Their prices went up in all different areas. I can understand prices go up for purchases they are making on their end but then either do one thing or another---either increase your prices or decrease your portions. The portions were never big to begin with so to make them smaller and increase your prices on stuff in a short period of time sucks.(4) The service seems to be so-so. The last time we went there it was pretty good (there is one server who is usually on top of everything but we still managed to get the wrong sauce) but the time before that we waited and waited for things---and even gave up on getting some of them.Overall, I'm really disappointed on how The Burger Bistro transformed over time.

And now they are open late on the weekends say whaaaaaaaat??? I can finally replace the murder burgers from White Castle with some damn good burgers from The Burger Bistro after a night of drunken debauchery!!! Who cares if I have to drive across Brooklyn to do it, they are worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0
"I always loved those Choose Your Adventure books as a kid.  This is part of the reason I really enjoyed Burger Bistro.  You get to choose everything you'd like on your burger including: protein, cheese, sauce, bread, and sides.  The list for each is long allowing people the opportunity to created endless combinations.  As a vegetarian I was elated with the addition of the veggie burger on the menu.  It was great - not some dried up boca burger or nasty patty.  This is obviously awesome because now veg heads can enjoy the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" experience right along side their meat eating friends.   The sweet potato fries, frizzled onions, and bread and butter pickle chips are excellent. There is a good enough beer selection and they have TATER TOTS.  (Yes, that warrant all caps)Add to this that whoever is choosing the music is doing a great job...",4.0
"This is a great little find, very casual, cozy environment. They give you a menu  where you check off what you want your burger to contain. You select everything from the meat, and toppings, to the bun and sides. The waiter had some great suggestions, so if you are not sure just ask and they will guide you. He suggested Spaten beer for me which was great! Very similar to a Stella. I has beef sliders with Monterey jack cheese and pickled jalapeno, with jalapeno mayo, suggested by the waiter and it was Delicious!! I am a big fan of spicy;) so this was a great choice for me. One word jalapeno mayo! omg sooo good..",4.0
"These burgers are irresistible - I had to have a bite of my sisters even though I'm vegetarian. It was the best burger she's ever had and it tasted equal to the best burgers I ever ate back in the day. It takes really tantalizing meat to tempt me from my principles and this was it. Only 4 stars because the fries were awful, those big fat tasteless ones that no seasoning or ketchup can help. Fie, incongruous fries!There IS a veggie burger on the menu.Um the dessert menu is this: pick a type of cookie (lots), and type of ice cream (lots but no non-dairy), and they make a FREAKIN ICE CREAM SANDWICH whoa. If the proprietors read this I recommend that ya'll carry a soymilk or ricemilk or almondmilk based non-dairy ice cream and make sure one of the cookies is also dairy free then you could offer a vegan ice cream sandwich... if you want to get raving 5-star reviews from a whole 'nother spectrum of clientele! This places is open until 3 or 4 am on Friday and Saturday nights! Woo hoo!!!!",4.0
The food was excellent and so was the service. Employees all had good attitudes and pleasant. Looking for parking was another story. A bit pricy but it is 2013. Will return.,5.0
"The Burger Bistro really impressed me with the amount of care they put into...well, everything!It's a quaint place, but you'll be served with a smile and kindness. Grab a grease pencil and mark on your laminated menu what you'd like. There are a lot of decisions to make, so take your time. You can choose how you'd like your burger prepared, what cheese, what toppings, and the kind of bread. There are also weekly specials. Choose a side, and any sauces you'd like to accompany your meal.I had my burger with applewood bacon, pepper jack cheese, and a fried egg. It's a good size, and you'll probably have to squish it down to fit it into your mouth. It was cooked medium as I asked, and was really fresh tasting. I especially was pleased that it was a balanced flavor; it wasn't too salty, or too anything, really. Just delicious. I also shared a few potato chips with my party, and they were nice and crisp, without being overly greasy.There's a nice mural that's mirrored on the wall, so that when you glance at the mirror,  you have something to look at. I liked that too. Lastly, you can make your own ice cream sandwich. Choose a cookie, and an ice cream to pair it with, and you'll be served two soft, chewy cookies surrounding some very smooth ice cream. I had the chocolate chocolate chip cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream, and enjoyed it thoroughly. There are also weekly specials for both the cookie and the ice cream.The quality of everything was so good, and the service wasn't just friendly, it had personality. I need to return and try more ways to configure my burger. Oh, and if you're thinking ""oh, but is it better than [chain burger joint]?"" the answer is yes. Very yes.",5.0
"I have been extremely curious about this place since I saw a friend talk about it on Facebook. Safe to say, I'm pretty damn impressed. You have your choice of indoor or outdoor seating.The China Marker used to mark off your choices on the menu is a fantastic idea for ordering your food! But don't forget to check off how you want your burger cooked!I ordered a burger with blue cheese, applewood bacon and guacamole - omg, so good! The bacon was crumbled like bacon bits. And the best part - the music. Not your typical cliche ""uns uns"" music or any terrestrial radio crap. It's all 90s rock music. Definitely fits the atmosphere.I can't wait to go back here again. Puts Jackson Hole Burgers to SHAME!",4.0
"So they have certain deals depending on the day that you go in to eat.  I went in on a Wednesday, when the deal was free cheese.  You build your own burger and a slice of cheese is like 1.50 so I guess this was a pretty good deal.  I love how you get to customize your own burger but I hate how some little things cost extra, like sauces and cheese.  It's pretty price, about 8 bucks for a burger without any of the extra stuff I mentioned above but I guess it balances out because the burger is huge.  I also had the tater tots which were very good, but then again, you can't mess up tater tots.",4.0
"""Here at The Burger Bistro, we believe that a restaurant should not be telling you what to order, you should be telling the restaurant."" proclaims Burger Bistro's website.  That is the main draw of this Bay Ridge burger restaurant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.  For anyone that have been to the Meat Ball Shop in Manhattan, you would instantly recognize the system that they use for the patrons to choose how they want their burger.  They have a laminated menu with a pen at each table. For a base price of $6, you start by checking off the type of meat for your burger, how well you want it to be cooked,and the type of bun it'll be sandwiched between.  After that you choose your own combinations of sauces, toppings, and cheeses for a dollar a selection.  Lettuce and a few slices of tomatoes drizzled in vinaigrette  comes standard with the order.  Burger King should hand their ""Have it your way"" catchphrase to this place.  They deserve it more. With the help and suggestion of the very friendly and attentive waiter, I made mine a medium rare burger on a onion roll, topped with pepper jack cheese, applewood bacon, cherry peppers, with  jalapeno mayo.  The sauce comes in a small shotglass on the side which gives you control of how much of it you want to put in your burger.  The burger was substantial and was cooked exactly as ordered.  If you want to, you could turn your selection into a slider which simply means that they put your chosen ingredients into 3 small potatoes buns.  The burger was delicious and certainly deserves the 4 to 5 stars that it's been getting on Yelp so far.  The only minor quibble I had with my order was that the cherry pepper was basically  half a giant pepper split in the middle and could barely fit between the burger and the bun because of it's curved shape.  *Look at the photo to see what i am talking about* yelp.com/biz_photos/tx-B…I was leaning towards getting the seasoned fries for my side but after the waiter raved about the frizzled onions, I decided to take his advice and ordered that.  So glad I listened because these crunchy, thin, light onion strings were incredible.  Onion rings have nothing on these.  BTW.  All the sides are a wallet friendly $3 which helps a lot since I just paid $10 for a burger.  yelp.com/biz_photos/tx-B…The place is small but have the atmosphere of a good casual restaurant.  A bar or a fast food burger joint this is not.  Although I didn't order any, this establishment serves beers and wine.4.5 stars",4.0
"Fancy burgers at a casual price. I had been yelping all day and wasn't really intending on leaving the house on a rainy Sunday. After checking out the best rated places in my hood, I stumbled upon The Burger Bistro. As soon as I saw the pictures of the crazy burger combo's I didn't quite mind going out and getting drenched all in the name of deliciousness.The decor is sleek and sophisticated, definately not what I was expecting from a burger joint. I soon realized it wasn't a burger joint, when I saw the six foot high wine rack in the back of the restaurant. We were greeted, by pretty much every member of the wait staff, when we came in. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful. The menu gave so many flavor combinations that I felt a bit overwhelmed. I asked her for a few suggestions and I definately came out with a great burger. My two boys ordered their dessert at the same time we placed our burger orders. Our waitress came back with two blank menu's for the boys to doodle on while we waited for our food. The boys had a great time and my fiance and I appreciated the quiet time. When our food arrived, she asked for the menu's back. After a few minutes, she returned to tell the boys that their pictures were so great that dessert was on the house. No reaction from the kids, but I was thrilled! When I picked up my burger, I didn't think I was going to be able to finish it, due to its heftiness. However, when I dug in, I couldn't stop eating it. My fiance and I always order something different so we can trade bites, but before we both knew it, our burgers were gone. I will just have to order my own Gouda burger next time. It's hard to tell if it was the beef/carmelized onion/horseradish cream combo or the actual burger that made it magic. Ehhh, it was probably the burger. The ice cream was out of this world and soooo creamy. It's definitely some artisan gelato or something like that. I was very pleasantly surprised and believe I have found my new favorite spot in Bay Ridge.",5.0
"I would eat every meal here if i could. AMAZING!!! Best burgers in Brooklyn. Ive actually never been to the restaurant, I just get delivery, and its still the BEST BURGER! Its all great, I cant even start listing things I like because that would be all of it. Just get a menu, close your eyes, and point to stuff, guaranteed amazing no matter what it is. Also the ice cream sandwiches are super yum. I could go for a burger right now...",5.0
"Amazing burgers and sandwiches made to order. A la carte pricing for toppings, sauces and sides means it can get a bit expensive, but it is worth it.  The burgers are always cooked to order and made perfectly. They used to have better bun choices(onion brioche, olive brioche), and the loss of that bread is a blow...the rolls now are fairly plain. On a better note, the sweet potato fries have been improved, and Tater tots are always fun. Keep an eye or for their daily specials and try something new; they often offer things not available on the menu. The addition of lunch specials (a burger with 1 cheese, 1 topping and a side for $9) is a great inexpensive way to give them a try without breaking the bank. Dining in is a pleasant experience and the staff is attentive, though the restaurant is small and not optimal for groups of more than 4. Delivery is also fast. Although they always say 45 mins on the phone, I usually get my food in less than half that.",4.0

At 9:10 pm the delivery man calls on my cell double checking the address and shows up a few minutes later. Insists burger was ""just given to him and is hot"". Very upset about lack of a tip. When I tied the burger, it tasted like a stale hockey puck warmed over, unsurprising after 1.5 hours. Clown town. Never again.",2.0

We ate outside on what may have been the nicest weather of the season and came early enough that it was not crowded. It only took one visit to convince us that The Burger Bistro just may have the best burgers in Brooklyn (okay I haven't tried Peter Luger's but these are $40 less per burger!).",5.0

"adorable menu? sorry folks thats not what makes this place awesome..the meat they use is super fresh, and you have a great choice of protein.  all the choices are spot on.  i had a lamb burger with gruyere, fried onion, and mustard (l,t,o) on brioche and my girlfriend had a beef burger with pepper jack, pickles, caramelized onions on garlic bread.  we had some sangria (half price as it was the special of the day) and tater tots which were overfried to delight.",4.0
"I walk by Burger Bistro almost everyday and after reading the positive reviews on Yelp, I was itching to try it. I usually go during lunch and they have a pretty great and affordable lunch special. They give you a check list of the type of burger and toppings to choose from and they ""make it how you want it"" to perfection. Burger King, eat your heart out! Even though I've only done take out here, the service is great. Nice guys! In my opinion, the best Turkey Burger in Bay Ridge.",4.0
I was disappointed after dinner at this place. First of we waited so long for the table. finally we got table to sit but then no one showed up for about 20 minutes.  We ordered whole wheat burger bread but they got us regular burger bread. Moreover you have to pay extra $1.25 for sauce other than ketchup. If you are two people and oder beer or wine..be ready to pay more than $40. I am not going agin.,3.0
I would come to this place from time to time with my friends after school and I would say that this is a great burger place. Of course not the best but when I'm craving a satisfying burger this will definitely do the job! Nice waitress and great food :)! Would definitely recommend.,4.0
"I've only ever done takeout here, and I think they need to work on that service.  I've never eaten in so my comments don't apply to that. This should really be 2.5 stars but I rounded it up to be generous.On each occasion, my order has taken longer than I was told it would (this last time at least 30 minutes beyond the wait time I was given). I'm wiling to wait as long as it takes, but I'd like more realistic wait times.  Also, whenever I've given an order, the person who takes it is not necessarily responsible for it so when I've asked about the status of my orders, I either get a generic ""it's coming up"" or just ""I don't know.""  This last time I paid in cash, and didn't get change back. Granted it was less than 50¢ but still, I've never been to a business that didn't make sure you got change back even if it's only 1¢.The only reason they are getting 3 stars is because their burgers are quite good, but I've had better and cheaper at Saluggi's in Manhattan.",3.0
"The cute thing about this place is that the menu looks like a checklist and you get to mark what you want with a charcoal pencil. But don't be intimated to put checks on everything because each items has a price.The food here was delicious and really different. Our group ordered a cheeseburger nachos for appetizer. It was yummy! I had the crab cake sandwich, it was yummy too. I would of tried all the sides because it sounds yummy but it cost $4 each. Overall, this place is worth the try!",5.0
"Excellent turkey burger, perfectly done fries and tasty sauces. Professional service and the price was right.  Cons? Delivery guys come on a Monday so it's a constant stream of open door 'breeze' and giant frozen boxes rolling in the front door and the music was absolutely awful. Such obnoxious 90's heavy metal crap, screechy skater music and whatever it was, it was so irritating.  I'd still recommend it, as it's hard to get a good turkey burger anywhere.",4.0
"Really great place. I went with a groupon and they still served me with a great smile on their face. They were really welcoming and offered great service from the beginning to the end. When I bought the groupon, I first looked at their online menu, it was $1.50 for their sauce, toppings, etc. But on their menu it was $1.25. I went with a friend and arrived at around 2:30, they told us about their lunch special which included the burger, 1 topping, 1 cheese and 1 side order. Which was an incredible deal. I got the tater tots as the side order and was it delicious! It was hot, had a crunchy shell while inside was moist. It was delicious but also it came with half the plate full. The burger came and it was huge, I had trouble biting it since it was stacked high. I asked for medium well and they got it correct. The burger was delicious and fresh. Great service and great food. Definitely recommend, especially their lunch special! It was definitely worth it!",5.0
"The Burger Bistro has by far the best burgers in beautiful Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. This place is mobbed every Friday and Saturday night for good reason - they just do so many things right.First of all, and this is a big point to me, they understand what medium rare means. Most restaurants seriously overcook their burgers and so ordering medium rare will typically get you medium. Not so with the Burger Bistro - if you order f*cking medium rare, they give you f*cking medium rare. Everything on the menu is really, really fresh and just tastes awesome. The meat is tender and juicy, the fries are crispy and not the least bit soggy, and the bacon is outstanding. They also use good-quality buns that don't get overwhelmed by moisture from the meat.Burger Bistro also has a great selection of sauces, including my favorite, yogurt & cucumber. They also serve the BEST sweet-potato fries I've ever had, hands down.The service is also prompt and courteous, and the prices are pretty good for a premium burger joint.Now, I would happily give Burger Bistro 5 stars if it wasn't for two issues:1) They serve soda in cans, and thus they charge for each one. No free refills!2) They don't have a choice for sour pickels. All they have are those nasty-ass sweet bread & butter chips. Nonetheless, Burger Bistro is freaking awesome, so good that I chose to have my birthday dinner there.",4.0

It by no means confirms you will get the exact right temp on your burger, but there's no mistaking what you ordered!Portions on the fries and tater-tots are big.

"I love this place! Not sure what the burger blend is but it is just to my liking.  They have interesting specials but I always build my own. Do the frizzled onions!  Try the crab cake. I know crab cake at a little burger joint it's probably frozen, right?  Nope I was shocked at how much I liked it. Now we order it every time.Only complaint, I feel like they should give you one topping for free. Raise the price 50 cents, i don't care but $1 for every single topping bothers me. Okay, they give you lettuce and tomato for free but I don't really count that. And a final kudos.

"The Burger Bistro is sort of the perfect establishment for Bay Ridge, which has been lacking a casual but quality burger-and-fries joint for years now. Sure, the English Muffin Burger at Skinflints is excellent, but anyone who's lived in the area knows you're gonna wait at least an hour, maybe more for your food there, and the toppings are quite limited at that.I don't think I've waited longer than 15, 20 minutes for my fully customized burger to show up at the Bistro. The customization is what makes this place great. You choose everything that goes on it, usually for a modest price for each additional topping. I love the pickled jalapenos and homemade honey barbecue sauce. I even get a fried egg on my burger sometimes. They have a very complementary, if limited, bottled beer selection (Brooklyn Brown, Bluepoint IPA, Magic Hat - go with the Brooklyn Brown, it works well with the caramelization of the meat), and wine as well. Although you'll never find me drinking wine with a burger - this isn't Staten Island. They have a nice open backyard in the summer for outside dining too.The waitstaff is friendly and prompt (they'd better be for such a small place), and the owner  and chef always have some crazy creative special on the menu that rotates every week (and they take inspiration from customer ideas online!) After running the Brooklyn Marathon last year, I came here and ate a donut burger - a bacon cheeseburger stuffed between a glazed donut - to the horror of my fiance and her coworkers.

It was definately a good experience.The Burger wasnt the best I ever had but it was quite good especially at $8 for a lunch special.  The choices on the menu were very easy and you have your choices in customization from the bread its served on to the cheese to the toppings and what it is accompanied with.  You simply mark your menu and hand it to the waiter.  I like this method cause there is no room for error-the waiter even repeats your order back to you just in case you forgot something.According to a little sign on the table Burger Bistro is open till 4:30!!!Which is awesome for Bay Ridge because this would be a great alternative to going to a Diner.  I like the concept-the place is comfortable-however I went on a hot day and they did not have the AC running-but it wasnt too hot.I'd say its a must try once and see how you like it type of place.My only disappointment was the tater tots they tasted as if they were ore-ida-nothing special.,4.0

I love that you can customize your burger, I love all the toppings choices, I love all the sauces and I LOVED their sweet potato fries and tater tots! I was expecting the place to be more packed on a Friday night but I guess since their outdoor space was open it created more room in the back for seating. I ordered my burger with Munster cheese, Portobello mushroom and crispy onions, I also had a side of sweet potato fries. The food was AMAZING, non-greasy and service was super attentive. The delivery guy was working nonstop unloading bags of burgers, I bet this place is a neighborhood hit. There's no doubt that I'll be back.",5.0
"You ever have a day where you go somewhere and it's always your experience that gets messed up but everyone else with you has a perfect experience? Yea, that happened to me. Let me say that we LOVE that Burger Bistro is in our neighborhood - we were desperately in need of a good burger place. Our first time there was actually when we wanted dessert one night and just stopped in for their yummy ice cream sandwiches and a milkshake while hanging out in the back patio. Delicious. Our 1st burger visit was great for everyone but me. The concept is pretty cool and it certainly makes it easier for the wait staff, having us check off our order right on the menu. We were that table that got forgotten about most of the night so that was frustrating - I'm never that jerk-off that yells across the room to get the waiter's attention, I just kind of meekly sit around until they remember I'm there but all in and all the waiter was very good - I think he was new and had most of the tables alone on a busy Friday night. My burger was good - it's just it wasn't what I ordered and it was very very rare. I HATE being that person that returns undercooked meat because hey, most people like their meat on the rare side so I'm sorry I'm that small annoying percentage that does not. When it came back they put more fries, hooray but the meat was still really rare. At that point, I was tired of trying to eat it and gave up. Everyone else had a perfect experience and we will definitely go back - I just got the short straw of the day :-)",3.0
"Incredible burger, incredible service, incredible atmosphere, incredible desserts.  I loved this place before the burger even came.  The menu comes with a pencil to select all aspects of your burger.  I went with a beef burger with jalapeno mayo, pepperjack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, and a fried egg.  This was all suggested to me by the waiter and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. This was also followed by an ice cream sandwich that consisted of macadamia cookies and pistachio ice cream (also made to order).  I will be going back there again today for a round 2. Highly recommend.",5.0
"I wish there were at least two extra stars to give this place of Burger joy. The menus were simple, the staff was great, and best of all the burgers were to die for and I mean take a bullet die for good.

This place is great. The regular burgers are good but nothing special. It's their special burgers that really hits the spot. I recently their special jerk chicken burger and it was amazing. The chicken was very juicy and full of flavor. It was served on a banana bread which tasted very good but not a good combination in my opinion. Service is great here too! Don't leave without trying their tater tots and dulce de leche desert.,5.0
"Brooklyn has the BEST Burgers Anywhere!  Well maybe not Brooklyn but at least this high-end burger spot deserves my vote as ""Best Burger.""Discreet local burger joint that doesn't catch the eye from the street but absolutely catches my palate.I took a friend out for lunch today and wanted something easy and quick.  Good thing they had the $8 lunch special or I could have spent $20 easily just for myself.  So we walk in and it was empty at 1:30pm on Friday??  But we were escorted to the backyard outside seating area where they had four long picnic tables with music playing on the speakers and 3 other groups of people already eating.Simple menu very easily laid out for ordering.  Just use the red or black crayon to mark what you want.  I had the beef burger, cooked medium-rare; yes they give me the option and they cook it that way!  American cheese, guacamole, and one big flat piece of grilled Portobello mushroom.  I had seasoned fries for my side and my friend had the sweet potato fries.  DELICIOUS!  I mean all of it...perfectly cooked and seasoned homemade hamburger beef patties and they were thick!  The mushroom was just fantastic along with the guac.  My fries had was seasoned with sea salt and the UTZ BBQ potato chips seasoning.  My friend's long and lightly floured fried sweet potato fries were amazing; slightly crunchy and salty at first and then just fresh sweet potato sweetness.They also serve wine here as there is a rack for the wines the hold near the single bathroom.Great service to top it all off!",5.0
"I was looking for a place with sweet potato fries in Bay Ridge and saw the great reviews from yelp so I came here with a few friends. I walk by third ave all the time and I always missed this place! it's a hole in the wall so keep your eyes open! This little gem has cute decor and the friendliest waiters. The best thing about this place is that they'll give you a menu and you can mark off what you want on your burger including the type of bread! I got a turkey burger on brioge bread with gouda cheese, roasted peppers, guacamole, and horseradish sauce including some sweet potato strings. Let me tell you... the burger is to die for! Good thing we found this place because it beats all of the burger places I've been to! I would give Burger Bistro five stars only if the sweet potato fries actually tasted like sweet potato fries. They weren't even fries... more like strings or it felt like they were holding back on the sweet potato and left you with breaded flour.Anyway, I'll get the seasoned fries next time! I hear the ice cream sandwiches are good too!",4.0
"Okay it's a wee bit pricey for burgers but I still give it 5 stars because the food is fucking great. The fries, burgers, choice of cheese and toppings- so awesome. Totally worth it.",5.0
It was definately a good experience.The Burger wasnt the best I ever had but it was quite good especially at $8 for a lunch special.  The choices on the menu were very easy and you have your choices in customization from the bread its served on to the cheese to the toppings and what it is accompanied with.  You simply mark your menu and hand it to the waiter.  I like this method cause there is no room for error-the waiter even repeats your order back to you just in case you forgot something.According to a little sign on the table Burger Bistro is open till 4:30!!!Which is awesome for Bay Ridge because this would be a great alternative to going to a Diner.  I like the concept-the place is comfortable-however I went on a hot day and they did not have the AC running-but it wasnt too hot.I'd say its a must try once and see how you like it type of place.My only disappointment was the tater tots they tasted as if they were ore-ida-nothing special.,4.0

"The good restaurants will always leave a good impression on you; and The Burger Bistro did just that. They really know how to cook their burgers. I ordered mines medium - and for the first time in a long time - the burger was cooked perfectly (the pink center - not what you think, sicko). The burgers are made to order - I had mines with American cheese and frizzle onions. The bread was so so (I choose brioche). I'm probably going to go with something else next time. But overall, very decent burger put together.*fried eggs were one of their toppings (I'll have to try  that next time! Cowboy style)",4.0

"Tonight, I had their special (Cajun bison burger). Apparently it changes all the time. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had. I topped it with a fried egg, applewood bacon, and smoke gouda cheese. It was amazing.All their extra sauces are amazing. There were 6 of is and we each ordered one which we all shared. I loved the wasabi mayo. At the end of the night we mixed all of our sauces (cause we're sauce bosses), along with extra bacon bits and it was incredible with the fries.This is a must try. My friends ordered the lamb burgers and regular beef burgers and said it was great as well. Tatter tots are the best choice of sides.

"Went here at a friend's request because he wanted a burger.We wound up both going with the special that night, a Kobe burger with fries ($16).  We both got it medium rare because who orders good beef well done?  I didn't get any cheese but did order a side of the jalapeño mayo for my fries, which the waiter had highly recommended.  Our waiter was nice - pretty attentive.  We were both pleased with our burgers but I feel like it wasn't actually Kobe beef seeing that it was only $16.  Whatever.  My fries were great.  Just the normal shoestring fries but I really enjoyed them.So one of the first things that struck me at the beginning was that they stole their menu idea from Meatball Shop.  Perhaps others have used this idea before so it wasn't really Meatball Shop's idea but still.  I kinda feel bad giving it only 3 stars but I wasn't as excited about it as I had hoped I would be.  It was pretty good.  Or as it states when I select 3 stars, A-OK.  I realize I'm only basing this on 1 visit but I don't know that I was that drawn in to want to go back.  If I lived down the street, sure I'd be back and try their other burgers and other toppings, but a great burger place draws me back again and again despite the neighborhood because a good burger is a good burger.  Not to be confused with the goodburger chain.  Or the skit from the Nickelodeon show ""Keenan and Kel"".  Weird tangents aside, if you're in Bay Ridge or live somewhere that allows you to get to Bay Ridge fairly easily, check this place out and decide for yourself.",3.0

"The burger bistro is a pretty small place but do NOT let that turn you away. What they lack in real estate they more than make up for in taste and variety. (Note: keep track of how many toppings and sauces you get, because the cost will add up.) The frizzy onions had less batter than your traditional onion ring which results in a light crispy side that is fun to eat. The sweet potato fries weren't oily or greasy and were deliciously crispy. The burgers themselves were quite delicious and very juicy. The waitress even came around to see if we liked the the way the burger was cooked. (The place wasn't very packed only one other couple was there so take that into consideration with the service.) The sauces were very good. The jalepeño mayo sauce went well with the frizzy onions and fries. The Chipotle mayo was average. It also went well with the sides.

"Came here a couple times (my last visit was over a year ago) and not much has changed since my last experience at BB.I love the concept that you can customize your own burger but it would also be nice if they can offer some suggestions on the side -for those who don't know what works with what toppings or couldn't decide what to put on their awesome burger (like me! haha). The apps came quick but the burgers took awhile. i guess because everything was customizable -it's hard trying not to F it up. Nonetheless, the service was good, the food was good. only a 2 person waitstaff for a small joint and getting their attention can be quite difficult since there are many tables to cover during feeding times. My friend & I ordered the artichoke appetizer -which was okay, not memorable.  I had the turkey burger, with L&T, gouda and caramelized onions. Burger was well flavored and cooked to perfection but found the patty a bit small when sitting in the mama-sized brioche bun it came with.Overall, it's not enticing me to go back every other week or so but if you're a avid foodie, i'd suggest you to make the trek out here and try this place out at least once. Maybe I'll visit them again next year.",3.0
Sat down for a quick lunch. The service was fast and efficient. We started with the Buffalo Tater Tots which i found to be adequately seasoned with a nice spicy buffalo sauce. The blue cheese crumbles balanced the dish out.  Burger Review: i can't stress this enough at a burger joint-- SEASON THE MEAT!!! PLEASE SEASON THE MEAT!!!  the lamb burger i had was juicy but the meat was unseasoned and bland. My entire party had the same experience. With the beef as well. Disappointing that a little salt and pepper (or lack thereof) can ultimately ruin an otherwise decent burger. They have a decent amount of toppings that you can add but I'm not one to smother my burgers with multiple toppings in order to make it taste good. The sweet potato fries were nothing special either.  I tasted more of the batter than the actual fry and that wasn't a good thing.  Overall we were all disappointed because everyone we spoke to had good things to say about this place.,2.0

"I recently went here for a family dinner and was a bit disappointed with what I got. The appetizer salad was great but the turkey burger was a bit dry and was lacking in flavor.

Nonetheless, the service was good, the food was good. only a 2 person waitstaff for a small joint and getting their attention can be quite difficult since there are many tables to cover during feeding times. My friend & I ordered the artichoke appetizer -which was okay, not memorable.  I had the turkey burger, with L&T, gouda and caramelized onions. Burger was well flavored and cooked to perfection but found the patty a bit small when sitting in the mama-sized brioche bun it came with.Overall, it's not enticing me to go back every other week or so but if you're a avid foodie, i'd suggest you to make the trek out here and try this place out at least once. Maybe I'll visit them again next year.",3.0
Sat down for a quick lunch. The service was fast and efficient. We started with the Buffalo Tater Tots which i found to be adequately seasoned with a nice spicy buffalo sauce. The blue cheese crumbles balanced the dish out.  Burger Review: i can't stress this enough at a burger joint-- SEASON THE MEAT!!! PLEASE SEASON THE MEAT!!!  the lamb burger i had was juicy but the meat was unseasoned and bland. My entire party had the same experience. With the beef as well. Disappointing that a little salt and pepper (or lack thereof) can ultimately ruin an otherwise decent burger. They have a decent amount of toppings that you can add but I'm not one to smother my burgers with multiple toppings in order to make it taste good. The sweet potato fries were nothing special either.  I tasted more of the batter than the actual fry and that wasn't a good thing.  Overall we were all disappointed because everyone we spoke to had good things to say about this place.,2.0

"The burger in this place was okay, it didn't wow me. I had the specials of the week which was some kinda spicy bean soup. I also got special burger of the week which was a ground beef burger with cheese filling waffle as the bread. The burger was alright,, it tasted a bit burn and the texture was crunchy , kinda weird..",3.0
Love this new place!  Burgers are fresh and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and provide great service. We ate in the outdoor are in the back which has a great feel to it. The dessert was amazing. The cookies were fresh like when you make them yourself and they just come out of the oven.  Wouldn't change a thing about this place.,5.0
"I recently went here for a family dinner and was a bit disappointed with what I got. The appetizer salad was great but the turkey burger was a bit dry and was lacking in flavor. Everyone else at the table got hamburgers that were delicious so I definitely want to go back, I just wouldn't order the turkey burger again.I loved the menu concept - just cross off what you want - and loved the array of options offered. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The only drawback was the lack of free refills (and the dry turkey).",3.0

"I am in love with this place....and service was top notch...I had medium well beef burger with american cheese with applewood bacon and jalapeno mayo....and with fries on the side....I KNOW crazy!

LOL....So i am panicking and what do you know...the manager noticed it...and helped me with the mess...i apologized and he said it was alright....He was super cool with it!! OMG! He also offered me another chair..but i said not a problem, and he also came over to wiped the table off...oh man....i am truly embarrassed!!! The burger came in threes..it was tender, juciy and yummy, but it was three small burgers...i wish it was a big one, so i can devour my love to it....lol...Definitely coming back again for other items on the menu....and pray that he doesnt remember who i am...!!!

"Pomelia and I were hankering for some good burgers and we found this place relatively near by where we live.  We each had burgers with a few of the toppings they had to offer (onions, bacon, mushrooms, et al.)  My burger came with a small cup of honey BBQ sauce that was really good on the fries. The burgers are so large that it's a bit hard to eat them with some of the toppings added which sort of distracts from the point of having them. That being said, you might want to pass on some of them like the slice of bell pepper since most toppings are an additional $1 (though I think lettuce and tomato are complimentary).We went during a heat wave and the inside of the restaurant was actually warmer than outside, even with their AC unit turned on.  But the food was good enough to help us ignore the extreme heat.  What we could not ignore, however, was the seeming cloak and dagger underhandedness of the wait staff.  The menu does not have drink prices on it, and our waitress ignored our repeated requests for water and instead pushed an order of sangria on us (we're relatively young and impressionable!).  The sangria ended up being the same price of the entire burger meal ($30)!  Neither of us are big drinkers and it was pretty good, but not at the price they were charging us for it.  Be very careful of their ""suggestions"".  It left a very bad taste in our mouths.We plan on going back when the weather is nice and avoiding the sangrias. The burgers are worth trying this place out again. We also enjoyed the menus upon which we could check or circle off what we wanted to order with a little crayon/marker.",3.0

"I really wanted to like this establishment, especially since it was  local and the food selection around the neighborhood quality wise has always been subpar. I went here twice in hopes that my initial experience may have been a fluke based on the reviews but the second time just made things worse.I was quite excited (especially my stomach) to see the build a burger format and the # of selections listed on the menu. We ordered the buffalo tater tots as a starter and I also ordered a medium beef burger with gorgonzola cheese on potato bun sliders. The buffalo tater tots was a bust since it was just tater tots overly drenched in buffalo wing sauce. The beef patties were definitely on the over cooked side, however, I didn't want to create a comotion since the place was rather busy so I just toughed it. I must say though although the patty was overcooked to my liking, the seasoning of the patty was tasty.Due to the locality of the establishment and the hint of potential based on the patty seasoning, I decided to give this place another try in hopes that the first bad experience was an isolated incident. We ordered the Neezburger Chachos and the Sauteed Crab Cake as appetizers. The Neezburger Chachos basically seemed like a dish that can be put together by anyone at home. It seemed like individually wrapped American cheese slices were used on top of potato chips bought from the bodega, with some ground beef and some peppers & onions. The cheese wasn't even melted properly and within a few minutes solidified into  one giant blob of cheese. The Sauteed Crab Cake came in 1 small piece and it was definitely fishy, even the spicy mayo couldn't hide the horrid taste! To add further disdain, the burger I ordered, a medium beef patty with a regular bun along with frizzled onions arrived rare. I was unaware of this of course until I took my first bite. What made this worse was it seemed that the seasoning this time on the patty was overdosed with white pepper. Ironically, everyone else I went with also did not like their turkey burgers but didn't make a big fuss. We all noticed that none of us took more than 3 bites at most and we decided to just pay the bill and dine elsewhere.  I guess I'll just have to make that drive to Cobble Hill or Park Slope if I wanted a gourmet burger.",1.0

The burger itself came out on a kind of disappointing bun (how sad it is to say that one can be disappointed by a bun, no? Maybe my life should get 3 stars). You would understand if you could see it. It's just smallish and pale while the burger meat is bland like the bun. I wanted to taste more.

"So we ordered dinner from there tonight. I don't know, maybe it was cause it was delivery and not fresh out of kitchen like if we were there but wasn't the best. The seasoned fries were great. The burgers were cooked perfectly. The crab cake was done right. The sweet potato strings seem to be battered which makes them a bit heavy and soggy. The nachos are done with real potato chips and the cheese wasn't fully melt, from delivery?? Possible. The bacon was good, but why does everything have to be applewood smoked?? Can I have regular bacon please. They chop the bacon up into little pieces and sprinkle it on the burger, I felt like I would have gotten better bacon flavor with strips.In closing I am not saying don't go here, I actually plan to eat there again but I don't think their food is suited for delivery.

"I tried several times to come here, but it was always too crowded. So I decided to go back on a weekday at noon, perfect! First off, the staff is very friendly and helpful Next, the menu is great cause you check off what you want and how you want it. The tater tots are great for the app and the Cheeseburger was delicious cooked just the way I ordered it the bun was soft and the fries were awesome not greasy at all. They have lunch specials also, I'm definitely coming back and also a new location in Park Slope soon!",4.0
Really delicious burgers. They really do have the pricing down to a science though. I find myself questioning how the bill always gets so high. I can't bring myself to pay so much money for a burger.,3.0
"Awesome place! I've been there about 3 times this summer! Impeccable customer service. I found this place through Yelp. I love their burgers and frizzled onions, even the dessert: simple but delectable. Leaves you feeling satisfied but not grotesquely full. Super reasonable prices! Awesome first date place, especially if you sit inside. Ambiance without all the frills and laid back without the cheapy feel. I love this place! Kid friendly too! Will be back soon!",5.0
Great burgers and service is even better. Our server Ramon was very busy but polite and super fast. There were three very old lady's and he was very patient and respectful to them and assisting them with their separate checks.,5.0
Awesome burgers!!!!,4.0
"So we ordered dinner from there tonight. I don't know, maybe it was cause it was delivery and not fresh out of kitchen like if we were there but wasn't the best. The seasoned fries were great. The burgers were cooked perfectly. The crab cake was done right. The sweet potato strings seem to be battered which makes them a bit heavy and soggy. The nachos are done with real potato chips and the cheese wasn't fully melt, from delivery?? Possible. The bacon was good, but why does everything have to be applewood smoked?? Can I have regular bacon please. They chop the bacon up into little pieces and sprinkle it on the burger, I felt like I would have gotten better bacon flavor with strips.In closing I am not saying don't go here, I actually plan to eat there again but I don't think their food is suited for delivery. I don't blame them, some food just doesn't deliver well.",4.0
"Really good place, a little like a new version of the Brooklyn diner. Love the pea salad and a burger on lettuce. Food is really good, but this isn't a place where staff gets to know you. It's just an awesome burger and salad and that's it.",4.0
"Honestly...the food here is off the charts!  We had a couple of the burgers and sides delivered and everything was phenomenal.  And I mean everything...from the beef to the bun, even to the lettuce and tomato....everything is fresh and of high-quality.  I specifically loved the sweet potato strings...no doubt the best sweet potato anything I've ever had!  We can't wait to actually go into the restaurant next time and try their amazing looking ice cream sandwiches.Go to Burger Bistro....it's awesome!",5.0

"When they say ""your best burger..."" these guys mean it.  YOU check off on the menu what you want, be it the bun, the meat, to the cheese, to the many other toppings and sides they have to offer.  They were running a Kobe beef burger as a special so I was all over that.  I selected Asiago cheese, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, and horseradish cream as toppings. A brioche bun would hold this medium rare masterpiece together, and I added the lentil salad instead of fries to be a little more adventurous.  My wife opted for the regular beef, asiago, and frizzled onions, to be transformed into three sliders...she likes hers medium.  The ability to write on the menu meant that she could write next to the fries check box  ""cooked twice"", because she likes those bad boys CrUnCHy!  We both further indulged and each chose to build and ice cream sandwich.  I chose Dulce de Leche ice cream to be sandwiched between  the special ""pretzel, corn chip (yes, corn chip!), chocolate chip"" cookies they were featuring.  My wife chose the double chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream.When the meal arrived, the presentation was simple yet elegant.  The burger was served with the top bun slightly offset as if it was tipping its hat saying hello.  To the side was a small hill of shredded iceberg lettuce topped with three slices of plum tomato.  It was drizzled with a vinaigrette, so I think it was to serve one of two purposes;  as a side salad, or to be placed on the burger if you so desired.  I left it alone for now, and focused on my burger.  It was beautiful, peppers and onions bound together by silky white melted Asiago slowly slid from atop of the burger creating a sort of cheese force field around it.  I noticed that there wasn't a lot of juice oozing from the burger, so I took my napkin and stuffed it into the front neck of my shirt as a precaution.  As I raised the burger to my mouth, my eyes involuntarily closed as the first bite was taken.  Three things happened at this point.  First, the pressure of my mouth biting on the burger made it burst on the other side, sending a stream of juice to the front of my shirt (napkin saves the day!)  Second, the sweetness of the peppers and onions mixed with the sharp salty Asiago, and that buttery Kobe beef teaming with the spicy horseradish sauce, turned my mouth into a mosh pit of deliciousness.  Third, the world seemed to slow down for a second and a satisfying ""mmmmmmm!"" somehow escaped my lips from somewhere far within.  I swear the bottle of Magic Hat 9 I was drinking saw my face and felt the need to light a cigarette.  The burger was more than amazing, it was flawless.Much of the same could be said for my wife's little sliders.  Each was a miniature representation of a regular sized burger (now I know why there were three slices of tomato!) cooked to perfection, and placed on pillow-y potato rolls.  The lentil salad contained delicious bits of tomato and onion, and contrasted nicely with my burger.  The french fries my wife ordered were cooked PERFECT.  We have been to a lot of places that just don't understand the words ""cook twice"" and she has been disappointed all too often with oily, limp fries.  I have a feeling that these guys didn't need the extra instructions and probably cook their fries perfectly anyway.With all of the burgers devoured, sides consumed, our desserts arrived.  The ice cream was rich, creamy, and delicous.  Her cookies were a chocoholics dream.  My cookies were sweet, salty, and crunchy and paired well with the sweet dulce de leche ice cream.  The only thing I would recommend is that they serve a softer style cookie that would give a little to the ice cream as you squeeze it together.  That way the cookie wont' crumble as much when you bite it.  However, seeing that this is ""The Burger Bistro"" and not the Cookie Bistro, its and afterthought.This was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my entire life, I can't wait to go back.",5.0
Went there for the first time last night with my mother. I had a turkey burger and I love how you can pick and choose everthing. It is a great place if you like your burgers done a certain way. They have veggie burgers too which were great because my mom had that. It was one of the best burgers I've had in a while. My mom had the sweet potatoe fries and I had the onion frizzles.

"I want to give it 3.5 but I guess I'll have to round up. On my initial visit, I thought this place was a solid 4. I came back the next day with some friends and a few things bring their rating down. So let's get the negatives out of the way:- overcooked potato bread sliders. My friend ordered medium but it came out extremely well done.- bad crab cakes, so I was told by my friends at the table (I don't eat crab). They claim they've never really had bad crab cakes anywhere, so this was a real surprise.- not all the cookies for their ice cream sandwiches are the soft bake kind, which makes it very hard to eat, especially with softer ice creams such as dulce de leche. It turns into a complete messThat said, my OWN personal experience was great. I got my burger medium and it came out as it should. The meat was very good, and I liked the bun it came on. The variety of toppings was great, but I try not to get it too stacked or else it gets messy.I thought the sweet potato fries were great, but my friends were not as impressed.The buffalo tater tots were REALLY GOOD. Definitely get that. I LOVED the ice cream sandwich. I got oatmeal raisin and vanilla, which was the perfect combination. The soft-baked cookie and the perfect consistency of the ice cream made for a great sandwich. 4.5 stars from 140+ reviews seems a little high, but IMO this is definitely a quality joint.

"Redeemed my Yelp voucher Friday night at this tasty Brooklyn burger spot!!!  The menus are unique (to me) and covered EVERYTHING (except drinks) for your meal.  From toppings to sauces to sides to dessert!!!  The decor was warm and welcoming.  Our waiter John was nice and attentive.  And the music was awesome!!!  I had the cheddar cheese burger, cooked medium with applewood bacon on whole wheat.  Burger meat was tasty and seasoned perfectly but not as juicy as I like.  I prefer my bacon on my burgers to be in strips rather than crumbled like it's served here.  Plenty of cheese and the wheat roll was soft and different.  I've never had a burger on wheat bread before - and I can truly say.... YAY!!! I'm a fan!!!  My side were the tater tots - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - juuuust the way I like em'!!!  Thumbs up!!!  For dessert I had the Double Chocolate Chunk cookie with the vanilla ice cream - LOVED IT!!!  Bf had the beef burger as well with american cheese, grilled onions and grilled portobello mushrooms - he really enjoyed it but also felt like it wasn't juicy enough.  His side was also the tater tots.  He paired his meal with a glass of Pinot Noir and enjoyed that VERY much!!!  Also had the Double Chocolate Chunk cookie with the vanilla ice cream - HATED IT!!!!  For that one I have to say he's nutts!!!  He just didn't know how to eat it.  Ice cream sliding out between the cookies annoyed him too much and turned him off.  I have to show him the professional way to eat an ice cream sandwich.  That's all....  The only thing critic I have for the ice cream cookie sandwich is that it would have been a bit better if the cookie were softer and just a little.... bit warm.  But, even it they kept it the same, I'd still eat it.  I have my eyes on the white chocolate/macadamian nut cookie next time...  I live fairly close by and it's comforting to know that I can get a GOOD burger at any given moment until 4 a.m.!!!  WOW!!!  I'M IN!!!!",4.0

"My wife and I live around the corner and love Burger Bistro.  The atmosphere inside is fun, the waitstaff is great, and the food is excellent.  It's ruined most other burgers for us.  We have tried a large portion of their usual menu, and they always have interesting and creative specials.  Their sangria is tasty and their deserts don't dissapoint either.  During the warm weather, their outdoor seating in the back is nice.Their menu is laminated, and you check off your order with a grease pencil.  It's a nice quirk.(The temperature of the sliders is our only complaint.  They could be a little more consistent (sometimes they're overdone).)",4.0
"Redeemed my Yelp voucher Friday night at this tasty Brooklyn burger spot!!!  The menus are unique (to me) and covered EVERYTHING (except drinks) for your meal.  From toppings to sauces to sides to dessert!!!  The decor was warm and welcoming.  Our waiter John was nice and attentive.  And the music was awesome!!!  I had the cheddar cheese burger, cooked medium with applewood bacon on whole wheat.  Burger meat was tasty and seasoned perfectly but not as juicy as I like.  I prefer my bacon on my burgers to be in strips rather than crumbled like it's served here.  Plenty of cheese and the wheat roll was soft and different.  I've never had a burger on wheat bread before - and I can truly say.... YAY!!! I'm a fan!!!  My side were the tater tots - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - juuuust the way I like em'!!!  Thumbs up!!!  For dessert I had the Double Chocolate Chunk cookie with the vanilla ice cream - LOVED IT!!!  Bf had the beef burger as well with american cheese, grilled onions and grilled portobello mushrooms - he really enjoyed it but also felt like it wasn't juicy enough.  His side was also the tater tots.  He paired his meal with a glass of Pinot Noir and enjoyed that VERY much!!!  Also had the Double Chocolate Chunk cookie with the vanilla ice cream - HATED IT!!!!  For that one I have to say he's nutts!!!  He just didn't know how to eat it.  Ice cream sliding out between the cookies annoyed him too much and turned him off.  I have to show him the professional way to eat an ice cream sandwich.  That's all....  The only thing critic I have for the ice cream cookie sandwich is that it would have been a bit better if the cookie were softer and just a little.... bit warm.  But, even it they kept it the same, I'd still eat it.  I have my eyes on the white chocolate/macadamian nut cookie next time...  I live fairly close by and it's comforting to know that I can get a GOOD burger at any given moment until 4 a.m.!!!  WOW!!!  I'M IN!!!!",4.0
"Back again....this time for a turkey burger and chopped salad. These guys actually make it delicious when you're watching calorie count! The Burger Bistro has become our new favorite Bay Ridge ""fun"" place. My husband went with a bunch of buddies and they all loved it and from I heard, they ordered just about everything on the menu. The portions are perfect, the food is fabulous and the service is super! AND the price is right, too! What more can I say? Except.....lol......the atmosphere is a breath of fresh air!  Love, love, love....The Burger Bistro. :-)",5.0

"If you don't feel like heading all the way to Vegas to go to Burger Bar, you're in luck, great burgers have found their way to Brooklyn. Burger Bistro is phenomenal. From the great burgers to every awesome side, my friends and I ordered every side and not one of them was bad. The cheeseburger nachos are great to. Always a creative special and phenomenal desserts. Once you go you'll be hooked.",5.0
Ordered a burger to go on Friday. Yet another reason to love this place... a burger that doesn't get soggy if it's not eaten right away! The buns are are so thick that you don't have to worry about coming home to open the box and finding a soggy bun with some meat stuffed inside. The place just continues to impress...,5.0
"This is a great burger restaurant. It may seem a little pricey at first, but I've been going regularly for months and have found that the quality is high and the service good. It's worth the price.

"The food is great. I liked it so much I had it two days in a row. First was a burger with smoked Gouda, bacon, caramelized onions and chipotle mayo. Second day with pepper jack, jalapeno mayo and bacon. They were both amazing. I've been in the restaurant business for twenty years and these were two of the best burgers ever had. The tator tots      reminded me so much of middle school and were nice and crispy. Frizzled onions were awesome. My first visit was on Good Friday so it wasn't very busy. It's an extremely small space so I imagine if busy it would be a tight fit.",4.0
"Umpteenth Edit, April 2011:  Hurrah!  They've changed the buns and they're a LOT better!  And they've added chocolate ice cream to the choices. I'm VERY impressed - and delighted! I appreciate it when a business is responsive and flexible to make needed changes. Well done!  And OF COURSE the burgers are as fantastic as ever too. Happy happy! 2nd EDIT: At the top so you see this first. Finally dined at the restaurant. EVEN BETTER, if that's possible. Adorable room, too, with a comfy / cool vibe. Our super-efficient, ultra-pro waiter, Steven, kept us in stitches and took very good care of us (ok, full disclosure, I was flattered that he recognized me from my Yelp review, LOL!). Three things I didn't want to finish because then they'd be all gone: the coffee (excellent, made in a French press), the ice cream sandwich (YUM! Dulce de leche on white choc macadamia nut!), and, OF COURSE, that hard-to-believe-it's -THAT-good!!! burger.AND - the buns hold up better on site!  :-)ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am blown away.  I am practically speechless at the quality of this burger; I humble myself at its juicy little feet.No, seriously, I've eaten a whole lot of burgers in my time, and THIS burger just might be the BEST one EVER.Now, I love me a great fast-food-type burger from time to time - Five Guys, Shake Shack, yum! - but Burger Bistro's patty is in that OTHER category I think of as ""real"" hamburgers.  And I've had some pretty damn great ""real"" burgers too - Bobby's Burger Palace, reliable old Brooklyn standby Junior's, the scrumptious Pat LaFreida burgers Fresh Direct delivers to my door - and Burger Bistro beats every one of them.  And mind you - we ordered delivery - we haven't even eaten in the restaurant proper yet!  And our burgers, which could have been compromised by the ride to our house, were still the best I can remember tasting in recent memory.  Each cooked exactly to our liking, with some pretty impressive sides and condiments too - I had a beef burger medium rare, with a grilled portobello and an amazing store-made horseradish cream, to which I added some (plain) lettuce and some of the frizzled onions I got on the side (more on those in a moment) - PERFECTION!  My partner's burger was right on the money too.  And yes, the frizzled onions were a revelation, arriving still crispy and hot, and the side of grilled veggies - what a wonderful option, a concession to ""healthy"" amid all this beefy-fried-oniony decadence! - was tasty too.  I could quibble that perhaps the buns were not quite as amazing as the rest of the fare, but in the face of these burgers and the rest of the offerings, that would be truly splitting hairs.I am FLOORED that the BEST burger I could ever IMAGINE is RIGHT HERE in Bay Ridge!  Jealous?  You should be - but just come on over and taste for yourself!EDIT, a few days later: Some changes have been made.  We ordered from them again last night, and we were told they no longer put balsamic dressing on the lettuce and tomato that accompanies the burgers (fine with me, I thought the dressing was overkill anyway).  And while I ordered my burger on an olive roll and my partner ordered hers on an onion roll, what we both received was a plain white roll (tellingly, while all the condiments were spelled out on our receipt, our choice of roll was not).  I guess they have abandoned the other types and are now using only white rolls.Contrary to what I posted originally, the issue of the rolls really should be addressed.  These rolls really do not do justice to these exceptional burgers.  In fact, these rolls are tasteless, bland, and their texture seems stale (all 4 rolls we've had so far), even if they are fresh.  And they fall apart when they meet the burger juice - by the second half of my burger, I was eating it with a knife and fork, and I mean, really, who wants to eat a burger with a knife and fork?  Seriously, Burger Bistro, GET BETTER ROLLS!!!!!  If for some reason you want to stick with these, at least TOAST them!  The way they are now, they are totally unworthy of the burgers they (inadequately) hold.We tried the sweet potato strings - outrageously good.  Really, all the sides / condiments have been terrific, but I have to admit I'm annoyed with the pricing: a buck for a TINY container of sauce?  What is it, an ounce?  A buck for ONE portobello mushroom on my burger?  Really, most of the condiments should be about fifty cents, if you want to charge at all.  Raise the base price of the burger to $7, I wouldn't mind that, but the price for the toppings and sauces is truly too high.Let none of my reservations deter you, though, because they're really beside the point: you can ignore the forgettable buns and, (damn it), I guess I'll still (grumble grumble) pay for the condiments: I stand by my original assertion that this is among the very BEST burgers I've ever had.  Any time.  Any place.  Burger PERFECTION.",5.0

"I went to Burger Bistro on a Saturday night with my husband, daughter and another couple (hi if you're reading!).  It was one of those super windy cold nights so that is why I believe that the restaurant wasn't super packed and we were able to be seated right away.  The place is tiny but very warm and cozy.  The menu is very straight forward.  They had a few appetizers.  We tried the chachos neeseburgers which is their take on nachos with burger meat.  Instead of nachos it was made with homemade potato chips.  It was different but it worked!  The place is called Burger Bistro so that is exactly what to expect...BURGERS! Nothing else on the menu but there are different kinds of burgers (beef, lamb, veggie, turkey, etc.)  My daughter is not a fan of burgers so it was difficult ordering for her so I decided to order the sliders which I found to be a great value.  Two nicely sized beef sliders with provolone cheese and guacomole and I chose regular fries to go with it.  Everyone else had beef burgers (huge!!!) with crazy toppings such as fried egg, carmelized onions, frizzled onions and smoked gouda.  The burgers were so big they were difficult to eat but somehow they managed!  Our friends ordered the seasoned fries which they weren't wowed by.  They were not crispy and a little on the soggy side.  However, my husband ordered the sweet potato strings.  They weren't really strings but thicker and more fry like.  They were out of this world!  They just dust them with flour and fry them.  I ordered my sliders medium and one of the two came medium rare.  I thought that was rather odd but I didn't send it back because I prefer medium rare.  The burgers were delicious but my daughter didn't care for it...said she likes school burgers better! It's a good thing she is not writing this review!  She only had a quarter of a slider.  It didn't agree with her and she ended up throwing up in the middle of the night.  I'm sure it was a fluke and I would still go back because everything tasted so good!  Try it!",4.0

"Sorry, only two stars for me. The two of us got turkey burgers and despite checking off the ""well-done"" box, both come out rare with way too much pink and seemed barely cooked. Also, the so called multi-grain roll was basically white bread with a few spots of grain in it. It would be nice to have an actual whole wheat option. My last disspointment was that the tomato and lettuce that are on the side had some weird sauce on it. I would rather have had them au naturel. On the positive side, their menu system which has been already described is fun and they do have a lot of options for toppings and sauces.

"Awesome burger, service and ice cream sandwiches. I kept my first burger here simple so that I could really taste the burger. I was not disappointed. The beef was high quality and cooked perfectly. It had a nice char on the outside and pink inside so I got both of the flavors I look for in a burger. I got it on a onion bun and it was good too. I have had some really good burgers at other places that were ruined by bad buns. We also ordered some sweet potato fries and tater tots (the tots were part of the weekly special). The sweet potato fries were obviously fresh and had a nice blend of sweet and salty. Halfway through our burgers, my wife and I wondered why there weren't more people here. People have to know about this place. You will not be disappointed.After our burgers, we got two ice cream sandwiches. I got the double chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream and my wife got the white chocolate macadamia with dulce de leche ice cream. All I can say is WOW. The cookies are made there and were so amazingly chewy. They also use very good ice cream. If you are like me and you love a good hamburger you MUST try this place.",5.0
"So...... after reading all the reviews and all the pics, I fixated on this burger haven and made a commitment to get there ASAP! Unfortunately, 2 weekends later.... i finally did! It was a dark, rainy night but that did not stop me from satisfying what had become an obsession. So though I got there very late, the staff was very accommodating and friendly in filling my take-out order (even running out through the rain to hand me the package containing.... the burger!). The drive home was torture... as the delicious smell wafted through my car. I COULDN'T WAIT!! I open the box and my all beef burger with carmelized onions, portebello mushrooms, cheese, L&T just sat there looking sexy!! Was it as good as it looked and smelled.....? The first bite.... heaven! I did not allow any conversation during my meal.... no! I had to savor this moment. It was damn good! I am now trying to manage my cravings since I'm now hooked.... Next? The lamb burger is MINE!

"Sorry, only two stars for me. The two of us got turkey burgers and despite checking off the ""well-done"" box, both come out rare with way too much pink and seemed barely cooked. Also, the so called multi-grain roll was basically white bread with a few spots of grain in it. It would be nice to have an actual whole wheat option. My last disspointment was that the tomato and lettuce that are on the side had some weird sauce on it. I would rather have had them au naturel. On the positive side, their menu system which has been already described is fun and they do have a lot of options for toppings and sauces.

As soon as we walked in at 9:05 she told us the kitchen was going to close at 10. That's an hour away. You may as well have just said ""I don't want you here"". Then we asked for the 1/2 price sangria special. She told the server we could not have it since they were out of fruit. Even though we said we didn't mind having it with no fruit. We're the ones paying for it and drinking it. She then would not offer anything as a substitution. Then I was trying to order another burger to go to which I was told I'd have to wait until after my food came out. When I then walked to try to place it to go, I was reprimanded by the manager that the waiter would come to me. I've never seen someone who runs a restaurant so against customers spending money. Mind you we were also the only table in the restaurant. All 10 of our burgers which were ordered rare and medium rare were BURNT. Awful experience. Never coming back and will spread the word in this AWFUL excuse of a person. You should not be in the restaurant industry if you hate people and business.

"Im not very generous when it comes to burger joints but couldnt hesitate giving this place 5 stars. Only went twice so far but the deliciousness of the food paired with the excellent service made it a no brainer. First was the special and a rarity to say the least, a burger topped with cheese bacon and a fried egg served on a glazed donut. When a friend said they serve this, being i had just started a pretty strict diet and was trying to train my body not to be tempted by meals even half the calories as this may be my first response was no way dude that sounds disgusting....within a minute or so my attitude changed to, damn dude that still disgusting we need to go right now and try this! Glad we did, if youre going to cheat on a diet may as well go all out right? Especially since this special burger isnt offered all the time so if you do see it on specials list you have to order it. We went back another time a week later and again got the special which that week was a half pound kobe beef burger and i can recommend that just as strongly as well, easily one of the best burgers ive ever had in new york city.  Ive still yet to try a regular burger from them on a weekday but i couldnt imagine that being a disapointment.  The sides were amazing as well, frizzled onions, sweet potato strings, both excellent and generous portions...ugh and the deserts are hard to say no to, homemade cookies used for ice cream sandwiches, white chocolate macadamia nut cookie wuth ducle de leche ice cream, mmmmmm, needless to say time to go to the gym but well worth the indulging.
