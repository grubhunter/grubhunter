"Have to do it. the 5 stars don't lie. Great ambience. Felt local authentic, white brick but homey.Not only the food is sourced locally but so is the beer.For brunch considering how popular the place is 10 bucks a meal is reasonably priced.Food was fantastic. Wife got farmers omelet. Almost tasted like french onion soup inside and was delicious. I got what is essentially a crab cake but with white fish and harissa sauce with a sunnyside egg on top. Food came very fast great service. Definitely went people visit I will take them here. Just go OFF PEAK as the place is ALWAYS packed and you will wait",5.0
"After three other times coming here and being disappointed, this place is on a downhill slope. We aren't fans of one of the bartenders, and the food ticket times have just become way too long for us to justify this place as one of value.Love that the owner reached-out, and really cares about the full experience. 4 star.",4.0
"Hungry and missing breakfast en route home from IKEA, I decided I grab something on the way. 'Disappointed I was unable to introduce my Lady to a nearby (hint, hint) venue I decided to give the Farm a shot!   So upon entry we're greeted with a smile () and were seated in the rear of this pretty small venue where we then discover there's an outdoor space (open during the S/S season). That was cool and it didn't hurt we were receiving an abundance of natural light from the window while decided what to order.   The menu was very limited, yet concise. I didn't mind at all as I'm not very difficult. My date however ... uhh yeah so we then decide to order and while she went with the farm omelet (cheddar, caramelized onion, market greens, & Yukon gold potatoes) holding the onions. I ordered the egg sandwich (scrambled egg & cheddar on a ciabatta) and substituted the ciabatta for whole grain. I also ordered a side of toast w/ goat butter & maple sugar which really caught me by surprise! My taste buds jumped as the sweetness kicked my palate on the first bite. In any case it was all good as it became more bearable with every following bite. And no, I don't have a sweet tooth if you're wondering. It tasted more like a pastry than anything.   Service was very much up to par as our glasses remained filled with water and everyone exhibited a smile with exuberant energy(just how I like my food establishments)! We received our food and man oh man as we began diving in and terrorizing our dishes we became full faster than usual! I loved it and had no complaints!   My dish was delish! My egg sandwich was stuffed(understatement) with bright yellow egg and cheddar and it was absolutely appetizing! I liked that the check came with a small toy farm animal used as a paper weight and there were lots of coloring activities to keep a kid busy if one was brought along.   Needless to say, I would definitely come back here and or refer it to a friend! I can't wait to come back when it gets nicer out and the outdoor dove is open to patrons! Kudos to The Farm on Adderley!",4.0
"Great food & good service! - I'm all about service, if that isn't right then my whole experience is shattered.  Here the service is impeccable.  Server had a great attitude and was attentive. Food: I had the schnitzel which is laid on top of a bed of greens ( forgot what greens it was but it was good lol) with anchovies and a egg on top. I came for brunch so I liked the egg being there.  The chicken + egg + anchovies came well together.  It was so freaking good. Also got the fries which came with their curry mayo.  Yeah the dipping sauce was good but it's not like OMG good like other reviews make it - Wifey got a omlet with home fries and those home fries were so moist and delicious.  They took it to another level.  Coffee is good too - pricy but you get unlimited refills so it was worth it.  Overall experience  - their prices are average - food is good and service is great.  Will I come back? Yes I would.Lastly I got the chocolate bread and No it's not overly salty and Yes it's freakin amazing!",5.0
"The selections were pretty standard for brunch, but I felt the quality was above-standard and on the leaner side than most brunch places. I got the Sausage & Eggs, which came with very lean house-made breakfast sausage, fluffy scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, and a very fresh side of baby greens. I didn't care much for the potatoes (I would have preferred them crispier), but everything else on the plate was delicious. Other members of my table had the Farm Burger and the Farmer's Breakfast. The burger was delicious. The patty was made of very high-quality beef, seasoned and grilled perfectly and served on a toasted house-made English muffin. The fries could have been crispier, but they seemed freshly cut and came with some delicious house-made ketchup. The Farmer's Breakfast also looked really good. It was very crowded when we got there. We were placed on a 20-minute wait. Although there is not a lot of waiting room in the restaurant, we found a coffee shop nearby and hung out there before checking back on our table. The atmosphere is very nice, and the service is pleasant. I definitely enjoyed my brunch here and felt the pricing was reasonable. It's a very solid option for brunch in Brooklyn.",4.0
"I dug it. Visiting my son,who's a local,meant imbibing and burgers. Enter The Farm.Staff was friendly.Friday night, busy, but they found us a table.Burgers because always burgers unless its brunch then burgers with eggs on top.Crafty beers.Price fit the location...pricey but ok because burger was good so definitely doable again.",4.0
"Delightful brunch place in the heart of Ditmas Park! My boyfriend and I came here last week for a low key late brunch. We luckily got seated before they closed for dinner service. The wait wasn't terrible at 30 minutes. Seating is tight like most brunch places are, but service is efficient.I ordered too many things for us to sample. We got the French fries and chocolate bread based on the reviews here. Neither of them disappointed! The curry mayo dip was delicious! I mean, even without consulting Yelp, chocolate bread and French fries sound amazing but I would probably skipped them both and saved the calories for something else hahahah.I ordered the omelette with market greens and my boyfriend ordered their giant breakfast platter. Both dishes came out quickly! My eggs were cooked to perfection and the onions in my omelette were caramelized and seasoned well. The omelette was about the size of my forearm and I was able to stuff myself with half of it before calling it quits; that's how good it was!I would most definitely come back here again for brunch. It's only a few neighborhoods away, the area has not been hit that hard by gentrification (yet) and so it's still got a lot of its original, authentic Brooklyn charm to it. Job well done, Farm!",5.0
"We located this place due to the power of Yelp and it did not disappoint! It is a farm to table kind of place, which I really like. We arrived for brunch and the place was full but we weren't waiting long for a table. Once we were seated, we ordered and the food came out so fast! Literally 5-10 mins after we ordered. It was a unseasonably warm day so it was nice to see the doors onto the yard were open. I ordered eggs with sausage and my fellow diner ordered the hash. Both meals were excellent. My sausage was more like a patty, so it was quite large. It tasted great, but was a tiny bit greasy. The potatoes were also really tasty. My husband enjoyed the hash and from what I sampled it tasted great too. We ordered some of the salted chocolate bread as a side and it was a decent portion size, easily enough to share between two as a side to your meal. It was enjoyable but not too memorable. Service was friendly and quick and I would visit again if in the area. I liked that you are given a small farm animal figure with your cheque, very cute!",4.0
"Came here on a sunday night for dinner with my wife.  Street parking was not too difficult to find.  Restaurant was fairly empty and we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us and notified us what was unavailable from the menu and also told us the specials of the day.We tried their appetizer special, which was fingerling potatoes with caviar.  We had their polenta with a side of brussel sprouts and the pork shoulder.  The appetizer was a littler bigger than i expected.  Tasted good and unique.  The polenta was ok but had a lot of weird vegetables in it.  Tasted a little funny but was pretty good.  Brussel sprouts were a little tasteless and can probably pass on that.  The pork shoulder was delicious.  Nice soft and tender meat that was flavorful.  In the end, we shared the upside down cake.  Tasted a little on the sweet side but good.  The cake portion kind of tasted like a banana cake.Great food to go along with good service.  Menu is a little small but everything sounded really good.  Would like to come back to try their brunch.",4.0
"Woke up this morning with a starving belly and needed to get my brunch awn stat!I browsed online to see who has food I'd be in the mood of, close enough to pick it up and still be good by the time I get home. The Farm on Adderley won. I call them up and this absolutely amazing young man, Jason, took my order. He was super friendly, informative and a pleasure to deal with on a freezing Saturday morning. I ordered the Tuna Sandwich, Egg Sandwich, Fries, Chocolate Bread, Oatmeal & PB & Chocolate mousse dessert & two coffees. The tuna sandwich was heavenly. Packed to the brim with delicious tuna, capers and olives and super fresh bread. You absolutely must get the chocolate bread. It is so different, I have never had anything like that before. I do have one small complaint though. The coffees came black. I only realized it once I got home and luckily I had milk at home. But I'd be super bummed if I'd have come home and not been able to drink my coffee. Not very sure why it did come milkless. The price was super right for the items I bought. I will definitely be coming back to try some more dishes.",4.0
"Came here for brunch and had an enjoyable meal. The red flannel hash was an interesting take with the beets adding a delicious and different take on a classic.The top notch ingredients and prep that goes into making the dish is evident as everything was delicious.

"So, being fairly new at YELPING I like to make sure I grab as much bites from spots in my neighborhood as much as I can (hard to keep up tho, there's a new 1 every month or so )   Anyways , I trekked about 15mins so I could work up an appetite for this restaurant .. It was a good idea because I I was fullllll by the end of my meal   Very nice and inviting atmosphere .. I sat by the bar and had a shot of 1776 whiskey (whiskey at 1pm, yum) I had a well done farm burger (everything's organic or straight from the farmers market) with eggs and extra bacon which was all very good and very nice size portions ... I also had a bowl of granola which was delicious but I like more fruits .. My only setback was the fact that they wrap it up at 3pm! For a 2hr break",3.0

"Wonderful restaurant! This was the first place I ate at when my boyfriend and I explored Ditmas Park a few months ago. We came in for brunch and it was delicious! Portions were good and the potatoes were fantastic. Everyone was super friendly and we were able to get a table in the back patio, which was lovely. There were string lights up above and we could see the houses in the neighborhood above the fence. Everyone there seemed to be in great moods and we loved that the restaurant was classy and down to earth at the same time. We went back for dinner with a group of five on Saturday night and it was just as great we remembered! It was relatively empty when we arrived around 6 but more and more people came in while we were eating. The atmosphere inside is warm and inviting. The music wasn't too loud and it was easy to hold conversations even when it started getting more crowded. Our waitress was really sweet and didn't mind repeating the descriptions of the specials when we asked her too. I got the chicken--it was super juicy and flavorful. It was a big portion and I got pretty full halfway through. The complimentary bread is AMAZING!! The fries with curry ketchup are really yummy as well. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food!

"I really enjoy farm fresh ingredients and quaint little brunch places and this place is the quintessential brunch place of my dreams. My boyfriend and I came to the farm on adderly on Sunday around 1pm - prime brunch hour. They advised that it was going to be a half hour wait and we were seated right about half an hour later. The menu is pretty small and my boyfriend and I were thrown off by the lack of options. We both picked the burger with fries and a side of bacon to share and chocolate  bread with sea salt and butter to share as well. When the food came out we were surprised at how huge the portions were. Chocolate bread with sea salt & butter -  sounds like a dream but the reality is that it is too salty. Next time I would ask for the salt on the side so you can personally cater the taste. Burger on English muffin - although I was surprised that the medium was on the medium rare side, it was juicy and delicious. I especially like that it was on an English muffin, therefore, it was soft and juicy. The fries were good as well. Bacon on the side -  we got the side of bacon for $5 to share because putting bacon on our burgers was going to cost $2/person. We decided to get a side for $5. It was huge and we couldn't finish it. But the bacon was great. Altogether I would definitely come back to the farm, especially since it is one of the closest brunch options to me.

"I've been coming to The Farm for a few years now. It's in my brunch rotation and I've also been here for dinner.  I have NEVER had a disappointing meal here.

Seriously so good.  My friend had some kind of omelette with house sausage and a side of salted chocolate bread.  He loved all if it.  So come here and you will enjoy your meal.My issue with this place is the the way the manage the wait list. I get it. During prime brunch hours I expect a wait.  It's especially ok when the weather is nice and you can wait outside etc etc.  However, this particular Sunday, we came during a lull. There were 9 tables for 2 just sitting there empty. The hostess is the worst. Condescending. Not apologetic for the wait. Nada.  It just feels as though you are being done some huge favor by being seated in the first place. It is pretentious and extraordinarily off putting.  Easily a 4 star place getting 3 stars for the crappy attitude of the hostess and the stupid way they manage their wait list.",3.0

"This was a nice break from Sunday brunch in Manhattan. My friend and I wanted to visit the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, and we decided to grab brunch nearby. There was a short wait (about 15 min.)- which was a nice break from the usual hour-long wait at popular brunch spots in Manhattan. The restaurant decor is what you would find at a quintessential Village brunch spot. On top of that, they also have a full wall of doors opening into their garden seating area in the back of the restaurant, and is beautiful on a nice Spring day (again, I have to reiterate that this is in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn). The menu prices are reasonable- a generous-sized entree, a side dish, and a nice big pot of coffee will run you about $25 (and, that's already including tip). I ordered the chicken schnitzel (w/ fried egg) and a side of toasted chocolate bread (w/ sea salt and butter). If you're conscious about your daily carb-intake, I'd suggest skipping on the chocolate bread- it wasn't something I would order again. But, the chicken schnitzel was tasty and filling. My friend ordered their smoked pollack cake with a side of bacon. I tried a piece, and we both agreed that it was a nice tasting dish as well. Our waiter was also very attentive, which is always a nice thing during a busy brunch service. It takes a while (about 40 min. on the Q line) to get out to on the weekend from Manhattan, so I would definitely recommend this place for brunch to anyone who is ever in the area.",4.0
"I am such a fan of The Farm, and I definitely consider myself a regular. There were points in time that I would come so often for brunch that I had to stop myself and take a break for a few weeks... But as always every place can use some improvements. I'll start with the GOOD: The unique food is by far my favorite, and it's always EXACTLY what I want. The portions are also amazing. I really appreciate places that aren't trying to make you leave crazy stuffed to the point where you want to explode. Their portions are always justtttttt RIGHT!Their coffee is ON POINT! When I settle down for brunch I am always looking forward to unwind with an amazing cup of coffee, and The Farm definitely does the job for me. The atmosphere is super quaint and adorable. It's perfect for brunch with the girls or a date night with your loved one. Drink selections are always unique and pleasurable. Their cocktails are super unique, wine & beer selections are wonderful, and they often change it so its a nice pleasant surprise. The BAD:They can be a little weird when it comes to cooking meat anything other than medium/medium rare. If you ask for something to be well done it usually never comes out that way (either over cooked or under cooked). Sometimes the food doesn't come out hot so mid meal it'll be cold. The service can also be a little funky at times. Sometimes the waiters/waitresses sound a bit unsure about the specials or any questions you might have, and they could be a bit stand offish... But it's not that big of a deal I guess.One thing I will say is that if anything ever goes wrong during your meal the management is super apologetic and will do something for you like comp a meal, send over free dessert, etc.... So that's nice, but really it would be better if the entire experience was consistent....TL;DROverall, I totally recommend (more so for brunch) this place. I love it, always have a nice time, yummy food, speedy service, only order meat if it's medium/medium rarely cooked.. You won't regret it :).

"I really want to love this place since all my friends kept on recommending. This restaurant is definitely closer than most of the bring places in Brooklyn. I came here once last year and found everything very ""meh"". Bland and nothing to review about. The only thing I remember about our visit last year is their side of one sausage patty for $6!Our recent visit was a two weeks ago. My boyfriend had their burger and was in love. ""Might be the best burger I ever had"" - boyfriend. However, I was not so lucky. I had the Chicken Schnitzel. I was really enjoying it until I realized the middle was still raw. I told my server, someone apologized and told me they'll make me a new one. Great! That's wonderful I thought. Waited about 10minutes, got my chicken back but even from far, the chicken was obviously over-cooked. Dark brown, close to a charred chicken is definitely over-cooked. But I decided to still give it a try. The portion shrunk in half, literally. I ate as much as I could and gave up. Watercress salad was refreshingly good. I guess I should have ordered a salad. The person who apologized came back to check on me and I told him it was over cooked. He apologizes again. Well the good thing is they are very apologetic. I guess I pissed the kitchen off by sending back my raw chicken.",3.0
"This place was very nice! Situated in Flatbush, this little cafe boasts some pretty interesting menu items. After much thought, I decided to get the quiche which had spinach, gruyere cheese, fluffy eggs, and a delicious crust. I loved the quiche--one of the best quiches I've had! A perfect balance of creaminess with the flavors of the cheese. I loved the crust--definitely flavorful as well. It was paired with a watercress salad. Watercress is usually bitter, but I do not feel it complemented the quiche well. A more subtle flavor to the salad or using arugula instead would have been better. A fun little place for brunch! Also, got a side of toast with goat cheese and maple butter. Absolutely delicious!!! Get this. I devoured this thing. The service was a little hay-wire--our waiter was a bit fumbled/jumbled and spilled a few things here and there. Maybe he was having an off day. Overall, great place and I'd definitely want to check out their other menu items!",4.0
"The Farm is packed for brunch, yet the restaurant is extremely well operated which tames the wait. The service is speedy and friendly which makes it a pleasure to dine here. I had the chicken schnitzel. It was perfect cooked: juicy on the inside while crispy on the outside. It was bedded on watercress and topped with a sunny side egg with anchovies. It has a great balance of flavors. I liked the freshness the watercress added. The anchovies added some saltiness. The yolk added a richness. I also spritzed lien on juice which provides sourness and citrus. I highly recommend the dish. We split toast with goat butter and maple sugar as well as the French fries with curry mayo and homemade ketchup. I used the toast to dip into the leftover yolk and juices on my plate. All in all, the Farm is an excellent spot for brunch. I'd rate it 4.5 stars.",5.0
Best burgers in the hood. Staff is great for the most part. Love their back patio. We always try to go during off-peak hours as it gets packed really quickly. And for good reason.,4.0
"Follow up review. Food was great and was very impressed with the service. However, I came here last year and ordered the farmers omelette, it was $7 and came with potatoes. This time the omelette was $9 and did not come with potatoes. Was definitely disappointed about that.",4.0
"I've been coming to The Farm for a few years now. It's in my brunch rotation and I've also been here for dinner.  I have NEVER had a disappointing meal here. EVER.  The food is really good.  A friend of mine and I had brunch this past Sunday and again the food was great. I had the beet hash and a sunny side up egg. TAS-TY. Seriously so good.  My friend had some kind of omelette with house sausage and a side of salted chocolate bread.  He loved all if it.  So come here and you will enjoy your meal.My issue with this place is the the way the manage the wait list. I get it. During prime brunch hours I expect a wait.  It's especially ok when the weather is nice and you can wait outside etc etc.  However, this particular Sunday, we came during a lull. There were 9 tables for 2 just sitting there empty. The hostess is the worst. Condescending. Not apologetic for the wait. Nada.  It just feels as though you are being done some huge favor by being seated in the first place. It is pretentious and extraordinarily off putting.  Easily a 4 star place getting 3 stars for the crappy attitude of the hostess and the stupid way they manage their wait list.",3.0
"In this neck of the woods, nice brunch spots are few and fair between. Aka someplace by my house that I can waddle back to after stuffing my face silly. What do I recommend you eat here? Pretty much everything, even the oatmeal and I despise oatmeal. (Not a bottomless mimosa/bloody mary spot-but still got great drinks.)",4.0
"This was a nice break from Sunday brunch in Manhattan. My friend and I wanted to visit the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, and we decided to grab brunch nearby. There was a short wait (about 15 min.)- which was a nice break from the usual hour-long wait at popular brunch spots in Manhattan. The restaurant decor is what you would find at a quintessential Village brunch spot. On top of that, they also have a full wall of doors opening into their garden seating area in the back of the restaurant, and is beautiful on a nice Spring day (again, I have to reiterate that this is in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn). The menu prices are reasonable- a generous-sized entree, a side dish, and a nice big pot of coffee will run you about $25 (and, that's already including tip). I ordered the chicken schnitzel (w/ fried egg) and a side of toasted chocolate bread (w/ sea salt and butter). If you're conscious about your daily carb-intake, I'd suggest skipping on the chocolate bread- it wasn't something I would order again. But, the chicken schnitzel was tasty and filling. My friend ordered their smoked pollack cake with a side of bacon. I tried a piece, and we both agreed that it was a nice tasting dish as well. Our waiter was also very attentive, which is always a nice thing during a busy brunch service. It takes a while (about 40 min. on the Q line) to get out to on the weekend from Manhattan, so I would definitely recommend this place for brunch to anyone who is ever in the area.",4.0
"I am such a fan of The Farm, and I definitely consider myself a regular. There were points in time that I would come so often for brunch that I had to stop myself and take a break for a few weeks... But as always every place can use some improvements. I'll start with the GOOD: The unique food is by far my favorite, and it's always EXACTLY what I want. The portions are also amazing. I really appreciate places that aren't trying to make you leave crazy stuffed to the point where you want to explode. Their portions are always justtttttt RIGHT!Their coffee is ON POINT! When I settle down for brunch I am always looking forward to unwind with an amazing cup of coffee, and The Farm definitely does the job for me. The atmosphere is super quaint and adorable. It's perfect for brunch with the girls or a date night with your loved one. Drink selections are always unique and pleasurable. Their cocktails are super unique, wine & beer selections are wonderful, and they often change it so its a nice pleasant surprise. The BAD:They can be a little weird when it comes to cooking meat anything other than medium/medium rare. If you ask for something to be well done it usually never comes out that way (either over cooked or under cooked). Sometimes the food doesn't come out hot so mid meal it'll be cold. The service can also be a little funky at times. Sometimes the waiters/waitresses sound a bit unsure about the specials or any questions you might have, and they could be a bit stand offish... But it's not that big of a deal I guess.One thing I will say is that if anything ever goes wrong during your meal the management is super apologetic and will do something for you like comp a meal, send over free dessert, etc.... So that's nice, but really it would be better if the entire experience was consistent....TL;DROverall, I totally recommend (more so for brunch) this place. I love it, always have a nice time, yummy food, speedy service, only order meat if it's medium/medium rarely cooked.. You won't regret it :). Favorites:Adult Grilled CheeseHashTrout Chicken BreastChocolate Mousse ALL of their sides are AMAZING :)",4.0

"After a handful of Brunch dates here, it's finally time for a review. Unless you're having cravings, don't bother coming here on the Weekends. Super packed. The last time I came here, I waited 40 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. On the other hand, Weekdays, the place is a little slower. One of the waiters was very helpful. He cracked jokes with my friends and I. He made sure everything was okay and he would come by once in a while to check on us & refill our water. The burgers are very fattening yet fullfiling. It's quite big so most of the times, I don't even finish my burger. The curry mayo fries are amazing! I love the sauce that comes with it.",5.0

"Never a dull moment when I see this girl, yet another lovely brunch date with my sidekick Adeline L. and her man Scott H., this time we're here at Farm on Adderley. She actually lives in the area, we were at Milk & Honey on our last date, not too far from here. I discovered this place while yelping for a brunch spot in the area so she wouldn't have to travel as far.My, what a popular place in this quiet neighborhood? We got here a little after 12 and the place was jammed. Watched the friendly ladies behind the bar shaking up drink after drink while waiting and finally getting a table after 45 minutes. Wanted to skip the mimosas today after seeing their list of imported drinks, got the brewed cola, sorry, but it was more like flat soda.....Scott dived right in for a burger, to my surprise, after 10+ years of knowing Adeline L., what I thought was her favorite meal wasn't, in fact she's in love with burgers? She's cool like that, lol. The burger is sandwiched between an english muffin and served with the longest hand cut fries I have ever eaten, how big were the potatoes? The curry mayo were the highlight of the meal, a must try. The ketchup tasted homemade plus it had a sweet tang, very appetizing.Adeline L. and I shared the Smoked Pollack Cake and their Red Flannel Hash. The pollack cake had a texture similar to a crab cake, my first time having pollack, actually. The fish cake was light, and seasoning was simple, unfortunately the smokiness of the harisso mayo was a bit too smokey that I kinda left it out so I can taste the flavor of the fish itself. As for the hash, the runny yolk cut through the saltiness of the corned beef hash, at the same time compliments the bitterness of some of the greens in the salad all in one bite.Last but not least, their chocolate bread was just delightful--sweetnees from the chocolate and saltiness from the salt. Great place with delicious food all packed in a simple menu. Most of their menu is made of organic ingredients, so the food is ultra fresh!",4.0
"I'm in love, and it's not just because of the rustic garden and the intelligent service and the welcoming bar and the animal toys that come with the check.

The fact that there is something called ""chocolate bread"" on the menu does not factor into my ardor.I love this place because the logo features a little barn/silo combo.

I was really excited about brunching here seeing that this was the closest highly raved about brunch place in the area I was staying at. I went with the red flannel hash and my company ordered the chicken schnitzel (w/ fried egg) and a side of toasted chocolate bread (w/ sea salt and butter). I barely touched my hash and only ate the fried egg which came with it whereas my friend did not especially like his dish also. I tasted some of his chicken schnitzel and found it to be a better tasting dish than mine. The chocolate bread was a tad bit too salty and over-powered the chocolate which kind of took away from the dessert-like-concept. The two things we loved was the coffee and the service. The atmosphere is good and this looked like a popular neighborhood spot but just did'nt do it for us.,2.0

My husband's burger was one of the best medium rare burgers I have had. He offered me a bite and I took four (or five or six). I lost count. I think I got too carried away with how good it tasted and ate more than half. My only complaint was his fries were too starchy. Sour beer? What's that?After the sample- Yes Please!

I'd love to come back to try the rest of their stuff on the brunch menu and of their dinner menu. There's also backyard seatings when the weather gets warmer again!",5.0
I was sadly dissapointed :( everything looks pretty but has no flavor!  I had fried chicken and my friend had the farm burger :( Great service though!,2.0
"A wonderful place with delicious food. Cousy atmosphere with soft lighting, quite romantic if you have the right company :)I really enjoyed their Roasted Beets appetizer. For main dish I ordered Celery Root Pave - king oyster & maitake mushrooms, hazelnuts, lemon which was delicious. If you are in the area I highly recommend it.",5.0

"A MUST try.i took my parents here on thursday for lunch, but they had breakfast items, which we got. LOVED IT. it couldn't  have been better. from the service, to the atmosphere to the food.

"This is a really great spot we have been going to for some time. The staff is always very friendly, the clientele are always in a good mood, even when there is a wait, and it's a very laid back place despite being so busy. We usually come for brunch after ice skating in prospect park in the winter and its nearly always been a good experience. Even the bad experience ended up being a positive. We went in one morning and ordered our meals. The farm burger is my favorite and I always request my burger to be well done. Unfortunately, my burger came out rare. I had the waitress bring it back in while my girlfriend ate her French toast (also delicious) but the burger took about 10 minutes to come back out. When I received it the burger was on the same bun, which was now very soggy after the egg had burst and soaked into it. The burger was the same piece of beef I sent back and had been very over-cooked, which wouldn't have been a problem had the egg and buns been replaced. I told the waitress I wasn't going to eat it and she offered to get me something else however I wasn't going to make my girlfriend wait another 15 minutes for my meal so I said just forget it. A manager came out to apologize and offer me something else but I respectfully declined. After my girlfriend finished her drink I asked for the check and they said it's been taken care of. I stated it wasn't fair that the whole meal be comped but they weren't having it. I took a menu and did a bit of math in my head and left the price of her meal, drink, and tip for the waitress. I don't go out looking for free meals but it was very nice of the management to do that for us even though I was slightly annoyed about being hungry and feeling like I wasn't paying my fair share.The more I think about it the more I am grateful for the experience. It made me like the place even more and I can't wait to return. Please check this place out if you're in the area but be prepared to wait if you aren't there within an hour of opening.

Came here for brunch. It was definitely busy but we were able to get a table in 10 minutes. Wonderful outdoor seating on a nice spring day where it didn't feel like you were in some cramped backyard. Had the farmers breakfast which had a nice thick piece of toast and wonderfully made scrambled eggs. Also the sausage and eggs plate was good. Eggs here are the standout. Nice flavor and a nice yellow color. The side home fries were wonderful potatoes with great herbs. Go for a bloody mary as well. Spicey with a good balance of tomato and alcohol and accompanied by a spear of pickle.

"Being the ""burger head"" that I am, after reading the reviews, I HAD TO make my way here to give it a try.  First let me say that the bread that they give you upon your arrival has to be one the THE BEST breads we've EVER tasted.  It has a muffin like consistency and a top crust that was salty and buttery - dipping it in their beautiful quality olive oil simply took it over the top for us!  We restrained ourselves from asking for more bread because we ordered their Crostini (bresaola, ricotta), for $9, as an appetizer. It was our first time trying bresaola, which they make in-house, and it was absolutely delicious!!! The burgers were good.  I cannot say that it's the best that I've ever had.  The English muffin is extremely dense and I'm more partial to a lighter bun on a burger.  The cheddar was very flavorful for the amount that they put on and we really dug the homemade ketchup.  Our biggest disappointments were the dessert - we had the upside down chocolate/banana cake and the prices of the wine!  WHOA!!!!  $17 for 8 ounces, and that was the cheapest.  We opted for a mixed drink, which is A LOT more reasonable at $10 (margarita and a white Russian).  Love the service, music, and the atmosphere.  I'm pretty sure we'll go back to try something other than the burgers.",4.0
"A couple of friends and I were riding to Coney Island and decided to stop here for brunch based on reviews from other Yelpers.  I re-read some of the more recent Yelp reviews and saw they also had a problem with one of my biggest complaints about the restaurant - the SERVICE.We put our name in and they said it would be a 20-30min wait.  We saw a few people waiting while we sat on the bench outside the restaurant.  However, we got a little worried when people coming in after us were getting seated, and we still were waiting (there was only three of us), and there were many tables open.  We asked the hostess about 3-4 times when we'd be up and she kept saying ""shortly"".  After waiting for 45min, we finally got fed up with her and asked what was going on.  It turns out, she completely skipped our name on the sheet and was calling people from the second sheet.  Also, we were either outside on the bench or inside grabbing a drink at the bar the whole time.  She saw we were waiting and we kept asking to be seated, but she kept giving us excuses.  Also, I typically don't write reviews like this, but she was completely rude, terrible at customer service, and does not know how to treat or talk to people (let alone customers).  Being a hostess is not her calling card.When we were finally seated, we got a nice table on the back patio.  The place has a very quaint ambiance to it, especially on the back patio.  It's also a great spot to take kids, which makes sense given the kid-friendly neighborhood it's in.  As for the food, I ordered the egg sandwich with eggplant, my friends ordered the grilled cheese and the farmer's breakfast.  The egg sandwich with eggplant was interesting - two things I really enjoy, but have never had together in a sandwich/meal.  It tasted good, although it was a bit dry so I needed to add some ketchup and hot sauce.  The eggplant was a bit too stringy for my liking on the sandwich.  If they grilled it more, it definitely would've tasted a lot better.  However, it wasn't terrible, but I just don't think I'd get it again.  I had a bite of my friend's grilled cheese and it tasted OK, nothing special.  The swiss chard in the farmer's breakfast was on point.Overall, it's an OK brunch place.  With the ambiance, it's probably closer to a 3, but I had to give it a 2 because I just don't think it's worth the hype.  Our waiter was actually very attentive and nice, but we started off the meal on a bad foot and it never really got back on track.  Given the fact that they don't take reservations, I don't think I'll be back.  Plus, if I am ever back in Flatbush, I'll want to try something new.",2.0
I used to love getting brunch here with my old roommate when we lived in Kensington. I really miss that place. Be sure to drop in if you are ever in the neighborhood it is worth it.,4.0
I went on a Sunday afternoon and although it was a busy brunch crowd the wait was about 10 minutes. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. It has good music (not too loud) and a nice ambience. I give it 3 stars based on food. I ordered the french toast with apple compote. The food came out quickly but I sent it back because it was soggy and barely cooked. The next order came back cooked through but the bacon was sitting in a thick layer of grease. I wanted to order coffee to go but they ran out of to go cups. I would probably go back for coffee or maybe drinks  and appetizers in the evening but I doubt if I'll do brunch again.,3.0
The food and service was very good! Not too expensive and a very nice ambiance.  We had the farmers breakfast and the pollock cake with a side of bacon and maple sugar toast.  We sat in the back yard and things kept falling from the tree into our food but it was cool it didn't bother us.  Our server was super sweet.  I hate to say anything negative but I'd pass on the maple sugar toast because they put very little spread on there and there wasn't enough of a difference from the plain toast.  Otherwise I'd recommend this place to anyone.,4.0
"The burger and the asparagus were great. The steak was bad, big time bad, felt like I chewed a piece of rubber. Overpriced drinks with not nearly enough alcohol. Service was not that great, but they did have a packed house. Although at times it looked like some of the waiters were standing around not doing anything. The look on the waiters face was as if he couldn't be bothered. Would it have hurt him to smile? Often we had to wait a while to get service.It's an ok place, with decent food, but I don't see myself coming back here.",3.0

On the weekends they have brunch with a broader menu such as shrimp and grits and French toast, at least that's what I was told lol. It's a great place and I can't wait to go for brunch next time.",5.0
Just had the burger from the concession at the Interpol concert. Reminded me of the dry unflavored burger I'd get from the cafeteria lady in middle school.  The cheesy fries on the other hand are great. That's what pulled me to give three stars.,3.0
"Being the ""burger head"" that I am, after reading the reviews, I HAD TO make my way here to give it a try.  First let me say that the bread that they give you upon your arrival has to be one the THE BEST breads we've EVER tasted.  It has a muffin like consistency and a top crust that was salty and buttery - dipping it in their beautiful quality olive oil simply took it over the top for us!  We restrained ourselves from asking for more bread because we ordered their Crostini (bresaola, ricotta), for $9, as an appetizer. It was our first time trying bresaola, which they make in-house, and it was absolutely delicious!!! The burgers were good.  I cannot say that it's the best that I've ever had.  The English muffin is extremely dense and I'm more partial to a lighter bun on a burger.  The cheddar was very flavorful for the amount that they put on and we really dug the homemade ketchup.  Our biggest disappointments were the dessert - we had the upside down chocolate/banana cake and the prices of the wine!  WHOA!!!!  $17 for 8 ounces, and that was the cheapest.  We opted for a mixed drink, which is A LOT more reasonable at $10 (margarita and a white Russian).  Love the service, music, and the atmosphere.  I'm pretty sure we'll go back to try something other than the burgers.",4.0
"A couple of friends and I were riding to Coney Island and decided to stop here for brunch based on reviews from other Yelpers.  I re-read some of the more recent Yelp reviews and saw they also had a problem with one of my biggest complaints about the restaurant - the SERVICE.We put our name in and they said it would be a 20-30min wait.  We saw a few people waiting while we sat on the bench outside the restaurant.  However, we got a little worried when people coming in after us were getting seated, and we still were waiting (there was only three of us), and there were many tables open.  We asked the hostess about 3-4 times when we'd be up and she kept saying ""shortly"".  After waiting for 45min, we finally got fed up with her and asked what was going on.  It turns out, she completely skipped our name on the sheet and was calling people from the second sheet.  Also, we were either outside on the bench or inside grabbing a drink at the bar the whole time.  She saw we were waiting and we kept asking to be seated, but she kept giving us excuses.  Also, I typically don't write reviews like this, but she was completely rude, terrible at customer service, and does not know how to treat or talk to people (let alone customers).  Being a hostess is not her calling card.When we were finally seated, we got a nice table on the back patio.  The place has a very quaint ambiance to it, especially on the back patio.  It's also a great spot to take kids, which makes sense given the kid-friendly neighborhood it's in.  As for the food, I ordered the egg sandwich with eggplant, my friends ordered the grilled cheese and the farmer's breakfast.  The egg sandwich with eggplant was interesting - two things I really enjoy, but have never had together in a sandwich/meal.  It tasted good, although it was a bit dry so I needed to add some ketchup and hot sauce.  The eggplant was a bit too stringy for my liking on the sandwich.  If they grilled it more, it definitely would've tasted a lot better.  However, it wasn't terrible, but I just don't think I'd get it again.  I had a bite of my friend's grilled cheese and it tasted OK, nothing special.  The swiss chard in the farmer's breakfast was on point.Overall, it's an OK brunch place.  With the ambiance, it's probably closer to a 3, but I had to give it a 2 because I just don't think it's worth the hype.  Our waiter was actually very attentive and nice, but we started off the meal on a bad foot and it never really got back on track.  Given the fact that they don't take reservations, I don't think I'll be back.  Plus, if I am ever back in Flatbush, I'll want to try something new.",2.0
I used to love getting brunch here with my old roommate when we lived in Kensington. I really miss that place. Be sure to drop in if you are ever in the neighborhood it is worth it.,4.0
I went on a Sunday afternoon and although it was a busy brunch crowd the wait was about 10 minutes. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. It has good music (not too loud) and a nice ambience. I give it 3 stars based on food. I ordered the french toast with apple compote. The food came out quickly but I sent it back because it was soggy and barely cooked. The next order came back cooked through but the bacon was sitting in a thick layer of grease. I wanted to order coffee to go but they ran out of to go cups. I would probably go back for coffee or maybe drinks  and appetizers in the evening but I doubt if I'll do brunch again.,3.0
The food and service was very good! Not too expensive and a very nice ambiance.  We had the farmers breakfast and the pollock cake with a side of bacon and maple sugar toast.  We sat in the back yard and things kept falling from the tree into our food but it was cool it didn't bother us.  Our server was super sweet.  I hate to say anything negative but I'd pass on the maple sugar toast because they put very little spread on there and there wasn't enough of a difference from the plain toast.  Otherwise I'd recommend this place to anyone.,4.0
"The burger and the asparagus were great. The steak was bad, big time bad, felt like I chewed a piece of rubber. Overpriced drinks with not nearly enough alcohol. Service was not that great, but they did have a packed house. Although at times it looked like some of the waiters were standing around not doing anything. The look on the waiters face was as if he couldn't be bothered. Would it have hurt him to smile? Often we had to wait a while to get service.It's an ok place, with decent food, but I don't see myself coming back here.",3.0

"Somehow, this place was packed with runners after the Brooklyn Half even though it was somewhat miles away from the finish. But we got seated within 20 minutes of putting our names down. The service was a bit slow but all of our food came out altogether at once. I ordered the farmer's breakfast which simply had scrambled eggs, toast and salad. It was a pretty standard brunch style but nothing spectacular about it. Maybe because my stomach was still reeling from the post-run. The only thing that really annoyed me was that they only had one bathroom stall.",3.0

"Came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon around 12 and the place was pretty empty, so I guess we were lucky to come at an off-time!

The fries were extra crispy and maintained their crispiness throughout our meal. We both agreed that the fries tasted better with the ketchup than the curry mayo. Although I did not get to try my friend's tuna sandwich, she said it tasted good.

"We've been coming here for about six years.  It's in the neighborhood and was unique at the time (although much less so nowadays).

You probably won't feel the need to get up and walk out, but they'll let you know when they've had their fill of you.  I lifted the last piece of bread off of my plate and the plate was gone before the bread was in my mouth. This is a true and literal account, no exaggeration .  If you're new to the Farm on Adderley, you may enjoy it.  There's still a cool interior decor, although I'm put off by the fact that the staff have slowly but surely adopted the smug, old-timey-Newsies-costume-party ways that have become the hallmark of Brooklyn.

"Eating tasty food at a clean, open, and pleasant place is something that I seek to do just about every day of my life. The Farm on Adderley provided a great space in which to fulfill 3 of these 4 requirements. The restaurant itself is nice and open during the day, and the service is excellent. The lack of stars results from the taste of the food. I decided to visit based on the Yelp photos and reviews, but honestly did not have a great brunch there. I had the omelette with caramelized onions, salad, roasted potatoes, and a side of the chocolate bread. While the presentation was pleasing to the eye, the onions made the omelette soggy and the salad didn't do  much to save my palette. The potatoes were good, but unfortunately the dish felt off balance because the chocolate bread ended up being overly salty which was quite unexpected. My sister is a baker, so she's taught me the importance of a pinch of salt helping to elevate the sweetness of something, but in this case, it was just too much and I reckon there were sea salt crystals on top of the bread slices. Luckily we had an order of fries to comfort us.The waiter taking care of us happily and graciously did not charge us for the bread once we explained how off-putting the taste was. This was a nice gesture and I think I will return for the service alone. However, I'll  be trying other things on the menu.",2.0

"Service: 2 starsFood: 3 starsAvg: 2.5 stars (if my math serves me correctly).  3 stars for the benefit of the doubt We came here with a big group of 10 on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. It was busy. The place is really small so it's not ideal for large groups (though I think theres an outside patio which could be utilized in warmer weather). There are always people passing by behind the tables. The waiter we had was kind of abrasive.We felt rushed  to order. He spilled coffee on two ppl in our group and various coffee spillage on the table. There were no apologies to any of the members in our group. He just blamed it on the carafe the coffee was in. (Why he didn't change it after the first time it happened is beyond me.) Didn't seem to be too knowledgeable about all menu items. When asked for suggestions, one of us got a response of ""whatever you feel like""Whats really unfortunate is the mandatory 18% tip for parties of 6 or more when you get terrible service. The food was pretty standard. A lot of us got the sausage and egg plate. Round breakfast sausage patty, but not the mcdonalds mystery meat kind. Scrambled eggs. Potatoes. Salad. I felt the potatoes were too buttery/heavy for my taste. Eggs were a bit on the liquidy/soft side. The coffee here is also a hit. Everyone liked it....when it finally made it into the cup.Poached eggs and grits: The person who ordered it said he probably made the wrong decision. Chocolate bread: warm, buttery, chocolate swirled goodnessI can't really comment on anything else anyone ate because they were sitting too far away for me to pay attention and my stomach was really only worried about feeding itself at that point.

"The Farm On Adderley is a very tasty Organic restaurant serving everything from Hamburgers, Salads, Eggs, and much more.  They have a cute lay out where you can eat inside or their outside backyard area.  I enjoy their coffee and I believe they have Wifi connection as well.  The price is just right and the taste exceeds the expectation.   Will come back to The Farm On Adderley when in the neighborhood.",4.0
"The Farm has been around for a while. Its one of the best neighborhood places to go to. I enjoy their food as well their seasonal signature drinks but my favorite is the Bloody Mary!  Their ""portobello sandwich"" and ""tuna sandwich"" are excellent!!!",5.0
"This place was great!Tasty salads with very original delicious combinations.Steak special the night we were there was incredible.  Perfectly cooked to medium rare, with an amazing sear and scrumptous spice butter sauce.Potato chirizo clam soup was out of this world.  Everyone at the table had a taste and loved it.Place is casual, and hopping.",5.0
"Service: 2 starsFood: 3 starsAvg: 2.5 stars (if my math serves me correctly).  3 stars for the benefit of the doubt We came here with a big group of 10 on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. It was busy. The place is really small so it's not ideal for large groups (though I think theres an outside patio which could be utilized in warmer weather). There are always people passing by behind the tables. The waiter we had was kind of abrasive.We felt rushed  to order. He spilled coffee on two ppl in our group and various coffee spillage on the table. There were no apologies to any of the members in our group. He just blamed it on the carafe the coffee was in. (Why he didn't change it after the first time it happened is beyond me.) Didn't seem to be too knowledgeable about all menu items. When asked for suggestions, one of us got a response of ""whatever you feel like""Whats really unfortunate is the mandatory 18% tip for parties of 6 or more when you get terrible service. The food was pretty standard. A lot of us got the sausage and egg plate. Round breakfast sausage patty, but not the mcdonalds mystery meat kind. Scrambled eggs. Potatoes. Salad. I felt the potatoes were too buttery/heavy for my taste. Eggs were a bit on the liquidy/soft side. The coffee here is also a hit. Everyone liked it....when it finally made it into the cup.Poached eggs and grits: The person who ordered it said he probably made the wrong decision. Chocolate bread: warm, buttery, chocolate swirled goodnessI can't really comment on anything else anyone ate because they were sitting too far away for me to pay attention and my stomach was really only worried about feeding itself at that point. Will try to check this place out one more time with a smaller group to see if our experience is any different.",3.0

"I dig it. Not too loud, no wait on a Friday night, great variety in the menu both food- and drink-wise. Maybe a little pricey, but it's farm-to-table. Enough veg options!The cucumber lemonade is possibly the most refreshing, summery drink I've ever had. Get it!Noticed one thing that made my eyes widen: It's $1 to add a tomato slice to your burger...? But in the grand scheme of things, that's nothing to complain about.",4.0

"Lives up to its hype of having exceptional and inexpensive farm-to-table Sunday brunch. We got the farm burger, which came perfectly medium rare with all the fixins: french fries, great pickles, onions, fresh lettuce. The sausage and scrambled egg platter came with potatoes and salad was very filling although their housemade sausage patty was a bit dry and the potatoes were a bit mushy (I guess I expected really well-browned home fries?) Strawberry french toast was the best I've ever had. Warm and kind of just.. hugs your mouth? Perfect sweetness, moist in the center where it should be and crunchy edges. We also ordered an iced coffee. For three people this came up to about $50 *including* tax and tips. And if you come here for brunch on a Sunday and wanna walk it off after, the Cortelyou farmer's market is just two blocks down!",5.0
"Great brunch, terrible service. The french toast is simply divine. 5 out of 5 on the gentrification sadness meter. Kinda extra.Tables are too small and that was frustrating.--if they just refilled the water instead of leaving you with this water-filled wine bottle, that'd help.

That part was fine, but then the hostess needed to also tell us that it was for ""this time only"". A little hospitality lesson... it's not a favor to the customer when you correct a mistake your establishment made. I don't think we'll be back.",2.0

"Had to write an update as The Farm has become my favorite local drink and snack spot. Everyone here is friendly and attentive but in a decidedly laid-back way.

"The brightest spot in a row of foodie friendly spots along Courtelyou Road. The Farm on Adderley has a wonderful seasonal menu, and I don't think I've ever had anything that disappointed me (though I will say the burger doesn't seem that worth it for the price, and served on a lame English muffin to boot). Breakfast and brunch are a favorite, everything I've had- from the simple apple cinnamon oatmeal to the deeply savory polenta with poached eggs and swiss chard- has been a hit. If you're still hungry or just want something to nibble on, try the Toast with Goat Butter and Maple Sugar. It may seem lame to shell out more than a buck or two for toast, but trust me, its divine!They have a nice number of seats inside though its more suited for couples than large groups, also a lovely patio in the back. I always think of the two ""Farms"" (the other being Flatbush Farm) together for their great decor and seasonal menus, but Farm on Adderley definitely wins because their staff is wonderful and the place runs very smoothly, something I can't say about all those other Farms out there...",5.0
I been here plenty of times. The breakfast/brunch on the weekends is something to just behold.

"Nice little brunch spot in the restaurant row of Cortelyou. We came on a Monday so it wasn't too packed, but I can definitely imagine a wait on the weekends here. There are about 15 tables or so within the restaurant. I ordered the hummus, which was flavorful and hearty for an appetizer and had the English muffin burger as my entree. My fiancé ordered the grits which were smooth and creamy. The burger I had was perfectly cooked to my requested medium rare and was not greasy at all. Definitely will be coming back.",5.0
I was so happy when this opened up right in my neighborhood. Now I don't have to travel downtown or to the city for some brunch. Went here with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon and it was PACKED.

Nice to have a good spot to eat in my hood!!,4.0
Love this place. So homey. So good. My husband and I love their burger! The desserts are always changing and yummy. I like the slight changes to the menu month to month or season to season.

"Been here several times and always enjoyed my meals. I've been here only during brunch hours so i can only review on the food during that time.

That was my fav but it was removed from their menu recently (i almost cried). Im guessing itll return when the warmer weather is here. Customer service is always good. Our glasses are always filled and when i need something, i know someone will catch me starring at them and they come right over almost immediately. I will continue to come back as this is listed as one of my fav brunch spots. Just please bring back fisherman's eggs asap!!!",4.0

"When am I going to learn sticking a fried egg on a burger doesn't automatically make it awesome??? Case in point again this morning for brunch at The Farm, where I ordered the burger that reviewers on Yelp! have touted as being delicious. Well, I don't know what 's happened, but the burger at the Farm needs to be left on the farm and not carried to their restaurant!!! It was soooo lackluster that I hate I had to pay for it--dry bread (what a disappointment), overcooked, dry meat (I ordered medium rare), no tomato, etc... I mean, it looked super good; just take a look at the pic I posted. Oh, how I wanted to love it, but it just didn't pass for me :(Another thing that disappointed at The Farm was the chocolate bread. Dry, dry, dry! Beware of this. It didn't look anywhere close to the delicious-looking pics I've seen of it on Yelp! Also, if you order anything else besides the burger, beware that portions are small-ish. If you're taking a group of burly men, think twice.Things that the Farm have going for them include the fries (they were crunchy and tasty), the cheese polenta (but, folks, be real, it's simply cheese grits--just call it what it is, the northerners WILL eat it), the dessert (the chocolate banana dessert was yummy), and the service (the hostess, the bartender, and waiter were super nice).As for atmosphere, note that this play is super small, and it gets crowded fast... so plan on a wait for a table.*Just realized I didn't get curry mayo w/ my fries... nor a plastic animal toy w/ my check... did I get gypped at The Farm today??? (Is it okay to say gypped?) :-P",2.0
This place gets five stars!! The food was amazing as well as the service! The waitress was very kind and attending to the groups needs and wants. I definitely recommend it if you're in the area!,5.0
"Adorable place. I stopped in solo for a quick lunch at the bar. I went with the poached eggs and grits with a side of sausage. Grits are new to me I am still not sure how I feel but the sausage was amazing. Lunch cost me $19 bucks, I left happy and full.  The waitress/ bar tender really knew her stuff she  could tell me where everything on the menu came from. Pretty cool..",5.0
Still a great place to eat brunch. Awesome outside seating area and good service. Friendly staff. Awesome fries. Great coffee! Would recommend. Have never tried the dinner menu but I'm sure it's great.,4.0
"so delicious for brunch. good and quick service. one thing that was weird, they somehow delivered our food before our bloody mary's. but i will chalk that one up to a random mistake. the bar tender was great and let me sit at the bar with a coffee (that he added to my tab at the table without charging me for more coffee) while i waited for my friend to arrive.",5.0
Easily the best restaurant on Cortelyou road if you like seasonal dishes that are cooked with love.,5.0
"If there is any review of mine on Yelp that is way, way overdue , it's the review of the Farm on Adderley. This restaurant/bar/movement has been a personal favorite of mine for years now, for brunch, dinner or for it's bar to just stop in and have a great draft or cocktail, but I've never gotten around to writing the warranted 5-star review. In fact, for a lot of my favorite spots, I tend to never get around to posting anything up and I really cant say why. Maybe it's a subconscious tendency that wants to have a place like the Farm all to myself; less stars and less reviews means less people waiting to get their grubby hands on the food I want so badly . I don't know what it is, but this phenomenon persists. This really should have been my first Yelp review, not my 90-somethingth review.  So here is my review of the casual dining and restaurant portion of the experience. I also got married here. I guess I really do like this place, but that's going to be a review for another day. I've been coming to the Farm every so often since 2009, with brunch being the overwhelmingly common timeslot of attendance. Not to say I like dinner here any less, I just happen to have fallen too deep into brunch-life over the past few years. I don't want to bore you with long-winded paragraphs so I'll make a list. People love lists. And if they don't, they should. What I Love-Farm to table is an awesome, laudable concept, and the Farm has been up to par with the quality of their local and natural ingredients for a long time; way longer than many others who followed . The menu changes based on seasons, availability, harvests and other factors. This makes eating here fairly guilt-free. -The rustic, white brick décor had me from day one. There is something outright relaxing about sitting here, just from the ambience of the space. The backyard is great , but makes it easy to overextend your visit by a bit.-Coming here during off-peak hours is possible is advisable. Friday and Saturday nights get packed, and reservations help. Saturday and especially Sunday brunch gets very busy, too. Sometimes, that's just when you can make it out with your friends, and so be it. But during the week, while there is a crowd in the evenings, during the daytime, like all very popular restaurants, you will really get your essential Farm experience in. -Service has never been anything besides good or great. -The craft  beer selection , while not tremendous in the number,  always revolves including more than a handful that will have something for everybody. Whiskeys and spirits are not the usual brands you're used to but low-key, more local names of seriously high quality. - In terms of menu items that stand out, I have to say for dinner the farm burger (also available for brunch), the filet mignon (when available) are personal favorites. For brunch/lunch , the Pollock cake and the red flannel hash are fantastic , as well. I have honestly never regretted order any particular item.  The French dip is a lunch favorite of mine and a few friends who have tried it; they've really mastered the jus that its served with. While I can't recall all the items I've ordered over the years, they've all been outstanding and delicious. -Chocolate bread with their coffee is an ideal way to close off any meal, but can equally be used to start any meal. Or just right in the middle. Point is, the chocolate bread rules. It's restaurants like the Farm on Adderley that helped turn Brooklyn into a culinary destination and I hold gratitude for this for as long as I shall live.",5.0
The burger and fries for lunch is what I go for here. Haven't had anything else. They are both solid. It's hipster pricey for sure. The patio is stellar on cooler days.,4.0
"I've tried a lot of great brunch spots. But this was one of the best meals, in general, that I've had in a long time. Don't forget to try the grilled cheese with apple and caramelized onions - big and amazing! French toast is delicious too. Cant wait to go back!",5.0
"So this place is a staple of Ditmas Park and for good reason. Everything I've ordered from this establishment has been superb, often exceeding my expectations. My go to meal is definitely the cheddar burger on an English muffin with the curry mayo. Absolute perfection. Service is always great and you can't beat the simplicity of the menu. If it ain't broke, don't fix it and The Farm proves that what they lack in extravagance they make up for with a fresh, delicious, and hearty menu.",5.0
"When am I going to learn sticking a fried egg on a burger doesn't automatically make it awesome??? Case in point again this morning for brunch at The Farm, where I ordered the burger that reviewers on Yelp! have touted as being delicious. Well, I don't know what 's happened, but the burger at the Farm needs to be left on the farm and not carried to their restaurant!!! It was soooo lackluster that I hate I had to pay for it--dry bread (what a disappointment), overcooked, dry meat (I ordered medium rare), no tomato, etc... I mean, it looked super good; just take a look at the pic I posted. Oh, how I wanted to love it, but it just didn't pass for me :(Another thing that disappointed at The Farm was the chocolate bread. Dry, dry, dry! Beware of this. It didn't look anywhere close to the delicious-looking pics I've seen of it on Yelp!

"Adderley is by far my favorite restaurant in Ditmas. My husband and I are so lucky to live close. Since we are into humane eating (cage free eggs, slave-free chocolate, animals that are not tortured at factory farms and local produce) we are so happy to have found them. Not only do they use humanely sourced ingredients they also have a wide variety of foods for both adventurous eaters and those with sensitive palates. I have never eaten a bad meal here and I come at least once per week for the past year. I can't say enough good things about them. I only wish that they would add even more vegetarian items to the menu. I own a busy nanny staffing agency and I have treated some of my best applicants and even a handful of clients to dinner here on occasion. All have praise for Adderley!",5.0
"Me & boy just discovered our favorite brunch spot!Arriving a little after 10:30 AM, we were able to beat the weekend traffic & brunch rush. It is a cute restaurant with simple decor. The clean walls let you enjoy the brightly lit room and check out the backyard seating area. I can imagine sitting out there on a warm summer day. They have large and small tables that are fairly close to each other. But don't worry, you won't have time to listen to other people's conversation because the food will distract you. Food comes out super quick. And although our waiter didn't introduce himself, he was very attentive and sweet.  We order the adult grilled cheese, red flannel hash and french toast. My favorite dish was the red flannel hash. The tender hash is topped off with a sunny side up egg and paired with a fresh salad. The beet mustard sauce is placed on a little side container, which is perfect, for you to dip has or drizzle on your entire dish. It's not too sweet and you can still spot the little beet cubes in the sauce. The adult grilled cheese is sweet and delicious as well! Two thick slices of bread with caramelized onions with cheese is amazing! And the toast is to die for! You don't really need the syrup, the toast alone with the apples is a great dish to end brunch. We were so full that we couldn't order the chocolate brioche. Full to the max for roughly $40, but we're looking forward to coming back and trying the other brunch dishes!",5.0

"This is such a cute place to go on a date. I went for the first time a few days ago when the Rosé and Rhubarb event started. I would say I was a little let down by the small amount of special items for the event itself, which were good but I just wish they had more options. We ordered the pork belly which was so so good. My boyfriend had the burger, he said it was good but it wasn't the stand out. However, I ordered the corvina and it blew me away. Great place for a nice hearty meal. Oh and before I forget...that bread though. I could easily (and maybe even happily) gain 20 pounds just eating their bread everyday.",4.0
"The food is great but it's not a farm - that's for sure. Before coming here I pictured a big, spread out place with farm-like accoutrements and bales of hay. Instead, it's a tiny, trendy, upscale looking place with modern seating - it looks like a typical NYC bar/restaurant. Since it's a small place they want you out just as soon as possible. Lots of good food but obviously a bit overpriced because it's on Cortelyou. The best part about this place was the little farm animal figurine they give you at the end.",3.0
"This adorable and trendy restaurant is a great find in Flatbush. Lovely huge windows in the front of the restaurant. Farmhouse with a touch of Parisian cafe style in the decor inside. It is light and airy and so very lovely. The brunch is delicious, and the entire neighborhood knows. The place is always packed. You can make reservations for parties of 6 or more. I recommend getting their earlier than you intend to eat, putting your name in, and getting a drink at the bar or walking around the neighborhood, or getting a drink somewhere else. Know when you go there, you will have to wait, especially for brunch. I came for brunch and was able to sit at the bar because I was on my own. The service was incredible. Such a friendly woman behind the bar, who served me so quickly. The food came out very fast as well. The food is quite good. Certainly not the best I've ever eaten but very tasty. Good flavors. Prices are pretty reasonable, especially for the quality of food.",4.0

"I came here a very long time ago for brunch with friends.  Hands down, this is my most favorite Brooklyn brunch spot so far.  It's just a bit far for me so I haven't been back just yet and also there is a long wait for a table which can be very frustrating (which is why I took off 1 star). I ordered the Adult Grilled Cheese which was excellent.  I also got to try the french toast which was really good and the fries with the curry mayo which was out of this world amazing!I have to try and make my way back here.",4.0
"Let's start by talking about the food. It's good! And fairly inexpensive for what it is. I'm picky about my grits, and they were solid. The red flannel hash had just a hint of beet in it and was nice and hash-y. The fries were crisp without having to ask for them that way, and the Bloody Mary despite being on the small size, was tasty.Service was also cheerful and attentive. Seems like they run a tight ship. There was one thing that I couldn't get out of my head however... It suffers from what I'm going to call ""Roberta's Syndrome. Let me explain.Roberta's was the first hipster/gentrified/whatever restaurant to make a splash in Bushwick. It got a lot of attention based on this, and there are still crazy lines to this day. Farm On Adderley seems to have the same thing going for it. While the food is good, it's not so much better than dozens of places in Park Slope, Williamsburg, and Manhattan. The wait for brunch is longer than it needs to be. If this were my local spot where I could slide in at 12:30 on a Saturday, I'd be happy. But it doesn't seem worth traveling to.",4.0

"Had an early dinner on Saturday night.  Family friendly not overly crowded comfortable seating.  Service was very good. Choices were limited but all the food was excellent.  A bit pricey but not disappointed with the choices we made.  Homemade ketchup, squash soup, and free range chicken were just some of the delicious food.  I have food allergies, the waitress was very good at checking on some items on the menu I wasn't familiar with.",5.0
"My girlfriend and I dropped by the Farm on Adderly last week. I had heard great things about the restaurant and wanted to give it a try. We found a parking spot immediately, directly across the street. It was around 9PM on a Saturday night and there was no wait at all.They had a decent selection of local craft beers and cocktails. We ordered fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta as an appetizer.  They were pretty good but it was a snack sized portion of 3. For the main course, I ordered the spaghettini and she ordered the roasted half chicken. My dish was basically average spaghetti with marinara and capers. Her chicken was really good and the skin was perfectly crispy.Halfway through the meal, a couple sat down next to us. The tables are pretty close together and we learned that they were very pretentious vegans and made their waiter's job pretty difficult with their nagging and substitutions. I'm not complaining about their choice to be meat-free... just commenting that you can pretty much hear everyone's conversation. Other than that... I'd probably rate this place 3.5 stars. I'd go back here but it's not my 1st choice for a night out.",4.0
"I had my wedding here over memorial day weekend and it was a dream come true. When I emailed them back in August about hosting a reception here, I had no idea what level of service and attention I would be getting. From the planning, to the check in meetings, to the setup and service during the event, everything was flawless. We really wanted a wedding that didn't follow a typical mold and The Farm has been a favorite spot of ours for a while now. I emailed them to see if we could have a simple reception and to get some basic info about holding an event. Stephen got back to me within a few hours to set up some time to come in. The first thing I have to note is how flexible and responsive he was in setting up time. My husband and I both work in manhattan and have somewhat different schedules and Stephen was super accommodating in setting up time throughout the whole process. He was very thorough in going over pricing and details and even showed us pictures from past weddings they've done (they average about 4 per year). He also made us makeshift boutonnieres minutes before the ceremony because ours were lost. We decided pretty quickly after that meeting that we would like to book the venue and close it down for our event. We had 80 people total and I was very nervous that everyone wouldn't fit comfortably. Stephen was extremely great at calming my fears every time we came in. He kept track of planning milestones for us and made sure that we had all the details settled for the big day. Once we got RSVPs, we came in and created a seating plan, rearranging things a few times (which took a few hours) until we got it right. One of the things I loved most about the wedding was the fact that the tables were different shapes and held different amounts of people so it felt more homey and personal. We had free reign over decorating, but didn't change any of the wall decor that was already up, just added some touches here and there. The staff helped to set everything up and then cleaned it all up and packed it for us at the end of the night, which was so helpful. Since the menu changes so often and depends on seasonal and local ingredients (a huge reason I love the restaurant), we had to have the tasting about a week before the wedding which made me anxious because I'm a planner, but it turned out great and we had plenty of compliments about the food. We also had signature cocktails that were created specifically based on our tastes. Trey the bar tender is an absolute mixology genius. People are still talking about the cocktails. Service throughout the night was great and Nicola the manager that night made sure everything ran smoothly.I could not possibly have loved my wedding experience any more.Some basics:-80 people total and we shut down the whole restaurant-Ceremony was held in the garden area-Followed by cocktail hour in the 2 front rooms (4 passed apps)-Dinner was served in all rooms (garden was converted for dining)-Dance floor was in the garden which was converted seamlessly after the guests who were dining there were finished eating",5.0

"My boy and I love to sit at the bar and commiserate after a long day at work. The bar is stocked with many bottles you might not recognize as everything, just like the menu, is locally sourced. (This was the first place I ever remember carrying Widow Jane.)  The burgers are amazing. I wanted to wait to taste the brunch before writing a review and, as expexted, they didn't disappoint.

Besides the waiter being too preoccupied with hugging the other staff and flirting with the customers at the bar, 2 dishes of eggs were sour, the granola was salty, poached eggs were so full of vinegar they could have passed for pickled And the ketchup tasted like chemicals.   The French toast was soggy and undercooked and the bacon was burnt,black. I am a repeat customer, bringing in 3 New potentials and they were all unsatisfied. I couldn't find enough words to apologize to my friends. Not coming back.",2.0

I was surprised a wedding in such a small place could happen, but they pulled it off so well. The courtyard was magical for the ceremony and a great space for dancing after dinner. It's got all the perks of hipster culture without being pretentious.",5.0
"Had an early dinner on Saturday night.  Family friendly not overly crowded comfortable seating.  Service was very good. Choices were limited but all the food was excellent.  A bit pricey but not disappointed with the choices we made.  Homemade ketchup, squash soup, and free range chicken were just some of the delicious food.  I have food allergies, the waitress was very good at checking on some items on the menu I wasn't familiar with.",5.0
"My girlfriend and I dropped by the Farm on Adderly last week. I had heard great things about the restaurant and wanted to give it a try. We found a parking spot immediately, directly across the street. It was around 9PM on a Saturday night and there was no wait at all.They had a decent selection of local craft beers and cocktails. We ordered fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta as an appetizer.  They were pretty good but it was a snack sized portion of 3. For the main course, I ordered the spaghettini and she ordered the roasted half chicken. My dish was basically average spaghetti with marinara and capers. Her chicken was really good and the skin was perfectly crispy.Halfway through the meal, a couple sat down next to us. The tables are pretty close together and we learned that they were very pretentious vegans and made their waiter's job pretty difficult with their nagging and substitutions. I'm not complaining about their choice to be meat-free... just commenting that you can pretty much hear everyone's conversation. Other than that... I'd probably rate this place 3.5 stars. I'd go back here but it's not my 1st choice for a night out.",4.0
"I had my wedding here over memorial day weekend and it was a dream come true. When I emailed them back in August about hosting a reception here, I had no idea what level of service and attention I would be getting. From the planning, to the check in meetings, to the setup and service during the event, everything was flawless. We really wanted a wedding that didn't follow a typical mold and The Farm has been a favorite spot of ours for a while now. I emailed them to see if we could have a simple reception and to get some basic info about holding an event. Stephen got back to me within a few hours to set up some time to come in. The first thing I have to note is how flexible and responsive he was in setting up time. My husband and I both work in manhattan and have somewhat different schedules and Stephen was super accommodating in setting up time throughout the whole process. He was very thorough in going over pricing and details and even showed us pictures from past weddings they've done (they average about 4 per year). He also made us makeshift boutonnieres minutes before the ceremony because ours were lost. We decided pretty quickly after that meeting that we would like to book the venue and close it down for our event. We had 80 people total and I was very nervous that everyone wouldn't fit comfortably. Stephen was extremely great at calming my fears every time we came in. He kept track of planning milestones for us and made sure that we had all the details settled for the big day. Once we got RSVPs, we came in and created a seating plan, rearranging things a few times (which took a few hours) until we got it right. One of the things I loved most about the wedding was the fact that the tables were different shapes and held different amounts of people so it felt more homey and personal. We had free reign over decorating, but didn't change any of the wall decor that was already up, just added some touches here and there. The staff helped to set everything up and then cleaned it all up and packed it for us at the end of the night, which was so helpful. Since the menu changes so often and depends on seasonal and local ingredients (a huge reason I love the restaurant), we had to have the tasting about a week before the wedding which made me anxious because I'm a planner, but it turned out great and we had plenty of compliments about the food. We also had signature cocktails that were created specifically based on our tastes. Trey the bar tender is an absolute mixology genius. People are still talking about the cocktails. Service throughout the night was great and Nicola the manager that night made sure everything ran smoothly.I could not possibly have loved my wedding experience any more.Some basics:-80 people total and we shut down the whole restaurant-Ceremony was held in the garden area-Followed by cocktail hour in the 2 front rooms (4 passed apps)-Dinner was served in all rooms (garden was converted for dining)-Dance floor was in the garden which was converted seamlessly after the guests who were dining there were finished eating",5.0

"My boy and I love to sit at the bar and commiserate after a long day at work. The bar is stocked with many bottles you might not recognize as everything, just like the menu, is locally sourced. (This was the first place I ever remember carrying Widow Jane.)  The burgers are amazing. I wanted to wait to taste the brunch before writing a review and, as expexted, they didn't disappoint. The farm breakfast is what brunch should taste like, fresh eggs, cooked perfectly, and if you're not familiar with swiss chard, this dish will make you a fan. Between the coffee, organic sugar and fresh cream, they must have slipped in some sort of crack.",4.0

"Perfect Match of ingredients and flavors for our appetites. We had the portobello baguette, egg sandwich with eggplant and the quiche.",5.0
"Very disappointed.I spent over $100 for breakfast this morning. Besides the waiter being too preoccupied with hugging the other staff and flirting with the customers at the bar, 2 dishes of eggs were sour, the granola was salty, poached eggs were so full of vinegar they could have passed for pickled And the ketchup tasted like chemicals.   The French toast was soggy and undercooked and the bacon was burnt,black. I am a repeat customer, bringing in 3 New potentials and they were all unsatisfied. I couldn't find enough words to apologize to my friends. Not coming back.",2.0

"This is my go-to brunch spot only 6 stops from my apt. I've been here for dinner and brunch a couple of times, but finally getting around to writing a review.  I love the Parmesan kale salad! It's so simple but so tasty! I also enjoyed the French toast with apples. The French toast had a nice crunchy crust and soft center and the apples were nice and tender.  The burgers are great too, so are the fries with curry mayo. Now on to the best part: The Bloody Mary! Trey, the cute, bearded and tattooed bartender, who dances behind the bar, serves up great cocktails and makes a hell of a bloody mary (garnished with a half-sour pickle, olive and red onion rings)! Looking forward to my next meal there! P.S.  They make their own pickles! So yummy!",4.0
"Food was good. I would go back for the quiche and the ambience is great. However our service today was deplorable. No glasses cleared, we were never asked how the food was and we had to ask four times to order beers. Maybe it was an off day but it was bad enough for me to review on Yelp, so, yea.",3.0
I came here for lunch with friends on the weekday. It was raining so there was not a wait. The space inside looks very clean and has a comfy feel to it. I liked the decorations. It would have been nice to be able to sit outside but because of the rain outside seating was closed. I really wanted to try the French toast but since it was not the weekend they do not serve it so instead I got the farm omelet. The omelet came with a side of potatoes and salad. The portion was pretty decent for the price. I liked the salad taste very fresh with a very light dressing. The omelet on the other hand was a little too salty for my taste. I like the caramelized onion because it was perfect; the onions were sweet and not burnt. My friend ordered the Farm Burger and there was curry mayo that came with the fries. I tried it and it's pretty good. It's unique and the curry was not too strong where it would become overpowering.I would come back but on a sunny day so that I can sit outside and on a weekend so I can order the French toast on the Brunch menu. Their prices are good and food's good too so come check this place out.,4.0
"Wowza! I didn't know that food could taste so good. The Farm not only offers a satisfying wine list (complete with Ice wine. . . which if you don't know what that is you should definitely find out) but also moral satisfaction. They work hard to try and use the entire animal as often as possible. So if you're feeling adventurous, tonight might be the night to splurge for cow's heart pasta or gourmet chicharrones. My friend and I split the skate and the butternut squash quiche, and I would be hard-pressed to decide which was tastier. The skate was served with beets and lentils, a completely refreshing meal. The quiche was as fluffy as a croissant with big, bold flavor. All in all, this is definitely a date-friendly location that's just classy enough to impress, and just low-key enough to make all parties feel welcome.",5.0
"THANK YOU FoA. I've been looking for the perfect brunch place near me and this is as good as it gets.

"This is a favorite with locavores, not only from the neighborhood, but from other parts of Brooklyn and even Manhattan.  The Farm established itself as the best eatery on Cortelyou Road just as this section of Flatbush was on the upswing, and has shown no sign of losing that spot despite all the other options that have sprung up in the area since.  It's all about local, seasonal food here.  Expect lots of spinach in the cooler, mild months; corn on the cob in summer; acorn and spaghetti squash later in the season -- all done remarkably creatively and without pretense.  The burger is the best I've had anywhere, and my go-to item if I'm dining alone, or if I go with my finicky daughter.  If you go on a mild Friday or Saturday night in spring or fall and manage to snag a spot in the outdoor garden, your experience will be about as good as it gets in this neighborhood.  But Sunday brunch is an institution:  you'd best allow a lot of extra time to get a table, because they don't take reservations.  For me, brunch here is a bit too much of a scene.  But the food is excellent and service is always courteous no matter how busy it gets, so if you're up early enough to beat the crowds, go for it.",5.0
Good heavens if only this place wasn't so far fr me. I think there's a farm in the background and a chef cooking on it. The food is amazing I've been here 3x in 4 years and it's always good.

"Have brunch at the farm - CHECK!I'm finally able to scratch that off my to do list after years. Awesome find by Lisa Z. visiting from out of town. Ditmas is such a beautiful neighborhood, I cannot believe I don't come by here more often. Driving down the beautiful tree lined streets with the houses etched with perfectly manicured lawns was a definite sign of good things to come. We stopped in around 11am and the place was already packed. Luckily for us, a table just finished up as we strolled in. We were seated right by the yard; close enough to feel the warmth of the sun but we didn't have to work on our tans while eating.The menu is full of amazing sounding items and it was so hard to pick just one. I eventually decided on the Red Flannel Hash and I'm so glad I did. This was legitimately at least a pound of shredded corned beef colored a dark red by my new vegetable obsession: beets! I even finished the side salad which is an amazing feat in its own right. I could see myself coming over and over again. The only obstacle now being that I sleep like a pig on the weekends and usually go right through the brunch hours. The first line probably should have been ""Woke up for brunch - CHECK!""",5.0

"Tried this place for brunch this past weekend on Saturday and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a great spot in the Flatbush/Ditmas Park area nestled in on Cortelyou. The ambiance has a rustic farm vibe. The noise level was relatively low for the amount of people there--it was busy, but not packed by any means. My companion and I waited a minute or two before being seated towards the back of the restaurant, just inside from the beautiful patio, which was tented for a private event later that day.I ordered the adult grilled cheese (felt a little awkward saying that out loud) and an iced tea, which they no longer have due to the changeover in seasons. So I went with a hot tea (black, loose) that came in a small pot. My companion ordered the eggs and sausage and a cold brew coffee and we shared a side of the chocolate bread with sea salt and butter. The grilled cheese was great, had a nice combination of flavors with the apple and caramelized onion. I only tried his potatoes, which were incredibly flavorful and he had rave reviews about the rest of the food. The one disappointment was the chocolate bread, which was a little dry and, in retrospect, I don't think it had any sea salt on it. It was fine, just not up to our expectations.

"My mom and I have been trying for years to come to this place and finally fit it into our schedule. Came here on a Sunday evening at 6 pm and we were seated right away. My mom had a gin martini on the rocks and I thoroughly enjoyed my gin cocktail, the ""Betray My Heart."" For an appetizer, we split the crostini of fava beans, parm and mint on fresh bread. Delicious! The mint gave the dish a unique twist.However, that's where the fun ended. After finishing the crostini, we proceeded to wait a full hour for our entrees to arrive at the table, which was obviously a mistake on the part of our waiter, since everyone around us was being served promptly. Once the food arrived (I had the nettles and ricotta ravioli, and she had the burger), we had to flag the waiter down again to get another round of drinks, which arrived after we finished our meals.At no point did the waiter apologize or fess up for messing up our order. With all of that said, my mom said the best party of the burger was the curry mayo that accompanied the fries. To me, if the mayo is the best thing about the dish, something is wrong.The service did break our experience, and I hope if I ever make it back down to Ditmas Park again to dine here, our experience will be better.",2.0
"Came for weekday brunch/lunch, no wait. Ordered the burger medium well, it came medium rare (blood actually dripping after I cut it in half which I couldn't get myself to bite it..) and they had no problem cooking it again just a little longer. The fries came with a sauce that looks like mustard but it was their delicious curry mayo! So good. Love that they have a garden in the back.",4.0
"I live a several blocks from this restaurant and for some reason I had never tried it up until today. While we had to wait for a table the wait was not that along. After we placed our order the food was served in under ten minutes! Aside from some patrons who were talking WAY too loud the ambiance was fantastic. I had the poached eggs with grits, which was heavenly. The grits were so cheesy, creamy, and flavorful that I was left wanting more. My husband had the sausage and egg combo which he thought was also refreshingly good.

The hummus was so dry and had a weird after taste maybe it's because it had olives in it. The babaganoush was too creamy for my taste and the tabouli was not authentic at all.

Brunch was excellent here!I really recommend the french toast and the fries with curry mayo. The fries are delicious. Very crispy and flavorful and really good with the curry mayo sauce they give you. It's also a great balance with the french toast so your meal is not overly sweet or savory. The french toast is perfectly made. Crispy and soft and topped with fresh strawberries.  Little to no syrup needed. It's also really filling and I couldn't finish the dish by myself.The chocolate bread didn't hit it for me though. But then I don't really like chocolate so maybe that's why. The chocolate taste was too overpowering and wasn't anything special to me. The toast with goat butter was also meh. I can pass on this. I heard the farmer's breakfast was delicious as well.

"This place is amazing!  We got here right when it opened, so we got a table right away.  The atmosphere is nice and brunch worthy.  The waiter was nice and offered some good choices.  We went with the kale salad and French toast.  This was the best French toast I've ever had.  The outside was a little crispy and the inside was soft and yummy with fruit fillings.  The Kale salad had a nice fresh taste to it and you know its super healthy.The bottom line.. Great food, nice place for brunch, and get here early before theres a line forming outside.",4.0

Our meal was perfection from start to finish. We were seated in the rear of the restaurant, which looks out onto their patio. Though it was winter, from what we could see from our table, I'm sure that the patio is a great space to eat/drink/be merry in the warmer months.I started with a beer cocktail, the ""Barn Raiser""-- my first venture into this new trend!-- and it was one of the tastiest cocktails I've ever had. Combining ""greenpoint harbor"" porter and ""miletti cioccolato"" chocolate liqueur, it was a perfect pairing of rich, complex flavors that wasn't too sweet at all, and served as a great accompaniment to the food.We ordered the delicious, generously portioned brussels sprouts as a side, and split them between us. Not pretentious in the least-- rather, a simple and satisfying take on some really good quality brussels sprouts dressed up with shavings of a strong parmesan cheese.Finally, my entree: Tagliatelle with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and walnuts. This was one of the most satisfying and elegant pasta dishes I've ever had in my life! And I've eaten a lot of good pasta, too. The pasta was so obviously homemade and cooked to a lovely, authentic al dente chewiness. The way the mushrooms were cooked also really showcased their gentle texture and incredible depth of flavor, and the cheese and walnuts sprinkled on top lasted throughout the dish so that every bite to the last was a combination of the delicate balance of flavors. A real show stopper, and so satisfying.I can't wait to come back to NY so I can come here again and try the chocolate brioche that everyone's raving about.",5.0

I'm a local Ditmas Park restaurant and have spent a ton of money over the last couple years dining at your restaurant but it's so hard to justify continuing to go when your employees are like this.

"Deciding not to venture out of Brooklyn on a cold Saturday morning, my friends and I went to this little gem to get our brunch on. Looking a lot like Pinterest in restaurant/bar form, it's very cozy, but they manage to fit a decent amount of tables in that one space. A cute touch getting a free plastic farm animal with your meal. Very rustic, very French countryside. There was a twenty minute wait though. Not so quaint.I got the farmer's breakfast which was good. The swiss chard in the eggs really made them pop. I thought my ""greens"" were going to be mixed, not collard. Both are fine in my book, but the menu was a tad deceptive about this fact.

We were looking for a lazy Sunday afternoon Brunch and ended up at this place after some yelping around. :) This place fit the bill perfectly. The staff was extremely courteous and the food amazing! Make sure that you try the handcut french fries with curry mayo. This is apparently the house favorite. It was on EVERY table around us.,5.0
"This So I read a couple reviews and people seem to like this place, so why not give it a try.They don't take reservations so I had to get there asap if I wanted to beat the crowd. Once there, I was seated immediately and the waitress was very prompt. My water class remained full (almost like magic) and the bread looked delicious (but I already had my carbs fro the day)....that didn't stop my date though lol.The food took a little long for my taste. A simple, ""there is a brief delay in the kitchen"" would have gone a LONG way but it was pretty early in the day still so I didn't stress it much.Finally the food came out and it was delicious....sitting here typing I thinking about calling to see how late they're open :)Cash and credit",4.0
"First I have to say how FAST the food comes out. We went on Mother's Day and while there was a bit of a wait, it was well worth it. We barely had to wait for our order. Don't be deceived by the lower prices (as compared to Manhattan brunches) - the portions are great and the flavoring of each item is fantastic. The sausage and eggs were perfect and the apple french toast was incredible and cooked just enough that it's still soft in the middle. Will come back again!",5.0
"The first time I came here was for brunch. It was a long wait but well worth it. So good!! I had a corned beef dish the was delicious and then ate most of my little cousin's waffles. I love kids... Their stomachs are so small. :) The next time I was here, my friend and I stopped in for a quick drink and an app. Fries with curry mayo... I was intrigued. After my first bite, I was in love. How on EARTH had I gone this long without curry mayo? I have some catching up to do. From now on, wherever I go, I'm asking for curry mayo with my fries. A little pricey for my taste, but the menu is original and it has a great vibe so I would say its worth it. Can't wait to go back.",4.0

We were looking for a lazy Sunday afternoon Brunch and ended up at this place after some yelping around. :) This place fit the bill perfectly. The staff was extremely courteous and the food amazing! Make sure that you try the handcut french fries with curry mayo. This is apparently the house favorite. It was on EVERY table around us.,5.0
"This So I read a couple reviews and people seem to like this place, so why not give it a try.They don't take reservations so I had to get there asap if I wanted to beat the crowd. Once there, I was seated immediately and the waitress was very prompt. My water class remained full (almost like magic) and the bread looked delicious (but I already had my carbs fro the day)....that didn't stop my date though lol.The food took a little long for my taste. A simple, ""there is a brief delay in the kitchen"" would have gone a LONG way but it was pretty early in the day still so I didn't stress it much.Finally the food came out and it was delicious....sitting here typing I thinking about calling to see how late they're open :)Cash and credit",4.0
"First I have to say how FAST the food comes out. We went on Mother's Day and while there was a bit of a wait, it was well worth it. We barely had to wait for our order. Don't be deceived by the lower prices (as compared to Manhattan brunches) - the portions are great and the flavoring of each item is fantastic. The sausage and eggs were perfect and the apple french toast was incredible and cooked just enough that it's still soft in the middle. Will come back again!",5.0
"The first time I came here was for brunch. It was a long wait but well worth it. So good!! I had a corned beef dish the was delicious and then ate most of my little cousin's waffles. I love kids... Their stomachs are so small. :) The next time I was here, my friend and I stopped in for a quick drink and an app. Fries with curry mayo... I was intrigued. After my first bite, I was in love. How on EARTH had I gone this long without curry mayo? I have some catching up to do. From now on, wherever I go, I'm asking for curry mayo with my fries. A little pricey for my taste, but the menu is original and it has a great vibe so I would say its worth it. Can't wait to go back.",4.0
"This is the best brunch in Brooklyn. And it is one of like two things (the other being Sycamore down the street) that I miss about living on the south side of Prospect Park.

"Wow! I went there for brunch and had the french toast. I took one bite and I thought I was in heaven! It tasted like... cake! That's the only way I know how to describe it. The side of bacon was a bit much and enough for 2... or 3 to share. I would have given it 5 stars but my guest was not happy with the eggs and sausage. Said it was too greasy and the eggs were not consistently cooked. I'm not one for scrambled eggs so I can't them.The restaurant is quite cute. We opted for an outside table and had to wait around 10 minutes which wasn't bad for such a nice afternoon. Just beware there is an overhanging tree so fine leaves and/or thin twigs (!) can fall on your food. Service for my particular table was poor. No one checked in on us and where was our ketchup, salt and pepper?! I guess I should give it 3 stars but...that french toast was just too good! I admit I can overlook bad service for good food",4.0
"A+ for brunch!Farmer's Breakfast: scrambled eggs, swiss chard and parmesan cheese, toast with a garlicy touch, and yukon gold potatoes cooked with diced veggies which made it very flavorful.

"After driving 3 hours to Jersey and an hour long train ride to New York for a culinary adventure day, I was starving. It was close to noon and I'd yet to eat anything substantial. I walked in and the place was practically empty but I was greeted by the guy behind the bar who was playing bartender/waiter and host. He told me to sit anywhere, including the patio, so I took advantage of the beautiful day and say outside. I had my mind set on the farm omelet. I was under the impression that because it was only 7 bucks that it was simply an omelet with veggies and cheese. Well, for 7 bucks I did get an omelet with veggies and cheese... and golden brown, delicious roasted yukon potatoes and a small side salad. 7 bucks. So, figuring just an omelet wasn't gonna' hold me over until lunch time, I perked up when the guy told me about the sweet potato sandwich. Holy mother of god. Thin slices of steamed/roasted sweet potato with melted cheese, sweet pickled cabbage slaw and crispy apple slices all on a crispy bun. My mouth is watering now just thinking about it. The few other diners outside kept looking at my plates and the amount of food I was about to consume. I crushed it and walked out satisfied. After a 20% tip, 20 bucks is all that brunch cost me.

"With the demise of my favorite local restaurant , Pomme de Terre,I have been eating here more frequently and have come to realize that, if this is my backup plan, I live a charmed fucking life. Farm on Adderley is a New American restaurant that uses locally sourced meat & veggies, boast a wide selection of liquor & beer (local breweries and imports), and is largely responsible for the dining rejuvenation of the Ditmas Park area. (Yes, at some point this area dropped the Flatbush moniker)Of course none of this would matter if the food wasn't good but it is. Being locally sourced the menu changes based on availability, which in turn keeps dining here interesting.While I'm not giving up my carnivorous ways, this place could make being a vegetarian pleasurable. The secret to getting me to eat veggies? Throw some cheese on it. The grilled asparagus with ricotta and shaved pinenuts  appetizer is fantastic. I view plain asparagus as wrong now. The Homemade Tagliatelle is a another winner. Pasta with mushrooms, brown butter and walnuts is simple and delicious. Satisfying dining without meat?Yes it is possible.When i want to feed on something that bleeds, the farm burger is a consistent choice. It's juicy, huge and it's served with some of the best fries I've ever had. While not Belgian fries, they reminded me of them, especially when combined with curry mayo dipping sauce. Recently they started doing breakfast during the week (8am-11am). I really hope this continues. The tomato, basil & mozzarella omelette with hash browns is good way to start a Tuesday morning. Strangely the breakfast menu favors the savory side of the things. Omelette's, grits and hash are available but no pancakes or french toast?Seems like a strange omission.The only downside, which really isn't  the restaurant's fault, is the wait.

HA!FOR BRUNCH - we enjoyed the burger (served on an english muffin and with fries - the curry mayo is DELISH!) The bf got an omlette - the eggs were underdone for his taste (which actually means they were perfect from a technical standpoint lol) and flavor was spot on. OJ was fresh and good in my mimosa. Only disapopintment of this meal with the chocolate salted toast side, was greasy, not hot and a bit too salty - thought I would love it but couldn't have more than 2 bites.  Later that week FOR DINNER our waitress was an adorable but more importantly helpful red head who suggested the Hawthorne Trail drink (has heirloom tomato soda and sparkling wine) - very crisp/refreshing.

"The Farm on Adderley is a great restaurant.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you step inside and sit down, the space opens up.  It is bright and airy and quite nice inside. The food was delicious, except the dessert I sampled.  I'm sure the ice cream is a better bet than the sweets I tried.  I ordered a cocktail named the Crooked Soley, which is a jalapeno tequila based drink, it was delicious and not too spicy.My boyfriend ordered the Steak and I ordered the Pan-Roasted Fluke, both dishes were delectable and I could live on the Sweet Summer Corn that accompanied the Fluke.I would gladly visit The Farm on Adderley again!Suggested menu options: Crooked Soley cocktail, Steak, Pan-Roasted Fluke.",4.0

"Came for breakfast.Sausage and Eggs- Their sausages are made in the restaurant. I liked it, but the texture was weird to me. Eggs were good, but their potatoes were great. I love a restaurant that makes great home fries. :)Handcut Fries w/ Curry Mayo- Friends loved it, but I thought it was just meh. Curry mayo was too sweet, needs a little more salt. Fries came out lukewarm. Still good, but I wish they were flaming hot. However, after my day went on, I couldn't help but crave for more of that curry mayo and those fries... Toast w / Goat Butter & Maple Sugar- They ran out of chocolate bread, so we got this instead. It was still good, but we were really looking forward to chocolate bread. ):Tuna on Country Bread- Both friends loved it, and was definitely filling. I don't know how it tasted, as I detest tuna. But it sure did look good!French Dip- Friend also loved it, but when i took a bite of her sandwich, I couldn't really taste the jus. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Mile End's French Dip...Very quaint decor; They serve water using wine bottles. The waiters/waitresses were very helpful and polite. They have a backyard patio that I assume is open during the summer. We were seated in the back, and the sunlight pouring out through the glass door lit up the whole place. Definitely put you in a happy mood if you're not a morning person. Very cozy setting, and I love the exposed brick wall and paintings. I guess that's why it's called The Farm On Adderley.

I love farm on adderley. I have been coming here since this spring and i never get tired of it. I just walk-in and usually wait maximum of 10 minutes at times. The waiters/waitress are very attentive. Food: the food is really really good to start wt the mix green market. The flat bread wt ricotta cheese and cured ham taste superb. I always order the chicken with polenta a my main entree. The burger with fries was also good.Service: As i said the customer service is great. The waiter/waitress always make sure they get what u need. They refill your glass with water even if its half full.,5.0
"The breakfast I had this morning was good, especially the grits.  However, my concern is about the failure of the waiter to explain the additional price for the grits.  I ordered the sausage and eggs and asked if I could substitute grits for the potatoes.  The response was yes, nothing else was said.  My first clue was when the server delivered my food and said ""sausage and eggs and a side of grits"".  I was puzzled by the terminology ""a side of grits"" especially since the potatoes which were included on the menu were not on my plate.  I was particularly surprised when I received the check and was charged $6 for grits.  That was a 50% add-on to the bill for sausage and eggs (without potatoes).  When I asked the waiter about it, he tried to explain the difference in the portions of the potatoes which would have been on my plate and the side of grits which I received.  Really, portion size is the explanation?  I would have been happier with grits on my plate in the space where the potatoes should have been than with  $6 side of grits.  Of course, there was no deduction for the potatoes I was not served.  So, The Farm kept the savings on the potatoes and charged me a 50% surcharge for the substitution.  To add insult to injury, the waiter said to me, ""I am sorry you didn't understand that you would be charged extra"".  How about, ""I am sorry that I didn't tell you that you would be charged $6, a 50% surcharge to substitute grits for potatoes.""Rather than leaving with a good feeling from eating a nutritious meal, I left feeling taken.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  There will not be a second time.",2.0
Great place for brunch! The farmers breakfast and omelette were delicious. The side of bacon was enough for three people and super yummy. The chocolate toast was new and I will be back for moe.

"I live about a 15min walk away and after my first solid experience for brunch I returned the same week for dinner. Solid food, and both times I experienced nothing but the friendliest of service. Pretty packed for brunch but we were greeted and sat within 10min. The bf did lean over to me and say ""damn there are a lot of hipsters here..."" HA!FOR BRUNCH - we enjoyed the burger (served on an english muffin and with fries - the curry mayo is DELISH!) The bf got an omlette - the eggs were underdone for his taste (which actually means they were perfect from a technical standpoint lol) and flavor was spot on. OJ was fresh and good in my mimosa. Only disapopintment of this meal with the chocolate salted toast side, was greasy, not hot and a bit too salty - thought I would love it but couldn't have more than 2 bites.  Later that week FOR DINNER our waitress was an adorable but more importantly helpful red head who suggested the Hawthorne Trail drink (has heirloom tomato soda and sparkling wine) - very crisp/refreshing. Again we got the burgers. We sat down for dinner about 6:30 with the older crowd so there was plenty of seating. We'll be back, awesome to have somewhat near home.",4.0

I wanted to opt for something healthier and greener, and they had a fantastic looking vegetable main dish that I was considering.

"The Farm On Adderly deserves credit in my book for changing the culture and fine dining of Ditmas Park. However, that's where my compliments stop. Yes, they brought fine dining to a neighborhood lacking a food identity (I've lived in Ditmas Park my whole life) but their food did not deserve all the praise it received in my opinion. Their burger which people praise was expensive and ordinary at best. If I'm going to spend over $14 on a burgers, I'd rather go to Peter Lugers for lunch. I don't need fancy overthought ketchups (curry ketchup?) I need good food. The Farm is a place with fine dining prices and decent food that does not warrant their prices.

"Damn, Peter D and Lisa D gave this place 5 stars. And wow I really wanted to give them a glowing review, but things were just tolerable at best. For one, they only take reservations for arties of 5 or more. Five is a weird number. I mean, choose 6 or something. Weird. We started off at the bar and it is a nice bar, but pretty small. Our party of 5 basically took up the whole bar. I had a draft beer and we chatted with the very friendly and insanely handsome bartender. I think that might the only memorable thing about this place. We were seated immediately, so that was nice. I remember the exposed beams and pipes and one of the doors being open, so there was a nice breeze wafting through. Everyone opted for an appetizer, but I didn't want one. I just ordered up another beer. For dinner, I ordered the Amish chicken. A dining companion joked if my chicken was going to be cooked without electricity. And honestly, after the fiasco, it might as well have been.So when everyone's dish arrived but mines looked oddly different than chicken. In fact, it looked like the chickpea fritters. And really, I am an easy going gal and I probably would've gladly eaten it if I wasn't forewarned by another dining companion that it wasn't so good. The waitress apologized profusely and was so sweet about it, I couldn't muster up anything bad to say. She did bring me a complimentary salas while I waited for my entree. When the chicken arrived, it was anticlimactic. Although extremely moist, it really just blase. But then again, it's chicken right? How do you possibly work with a bland piece of meat anyway? Oh well, in life, you live and you learn. We also had dessert, but my memory is failing me. I guess my brain just erased unimportant information.This was a truly medicore dining experience, but I am willing to give it another shot for the brunch.

For one, they only take reservations for arties of 5 or more. Five is a weird number. I mean, choose 6 or something. Weird. We started off at the bar and it is a nice bar, but pretty small. Our party of 5 basically took up the whole bar. I had a draft beer and we chatted with the very friendly and insanely handsome bartender. I think that might the only memorable thing about this place. We were seated immediately, so that was nice. I remember the exposed beams and pipes and one of the doors being open, so there was a nice breeze wafting through. Everyone opted for an appetizer, but I didn't want one. I just ordered up another beer. For dinner, I ordered the Amish chicken. A dining companion joked if my chicken was going to be cooked without electricity. And honestly, after the fiasco, it might as well have been.So when everyone's dish arrived but mines looked oddly different than chicken. In fact, it looked like the chickpea fritters. And really, I am an easy going gal and I probably would've gladly eaten it if I wasn't forewarned by another dining companion that it wasn't so good. The waitress apologized profusely and was so sweet about it, I couldn't muster up anything bad to say. She did bring me a complimentary salas while I waited for my entree. When the chicken arrived, it was anticlimactic. Although extremely moist, it really just blase. But then again, it's chicken right? How do you possibly work with a bland piece of meat anyway? Oh well, in life, you live and you learn. We also had dessert, but my memory is failing me. I guess my brain just erased unimportant information.This was a truly medicore dining experience, but I am willing to give it another shot for the brunch. Everyone keeps raving about the brunch, so maybe they can redeem themselves. Too bad I just haven't gone to brunch ever.",3.0
"For the fries alone The Farm on Adderley gets a solid four stars. Those perfectly crisp morsels that are slightly soft on the inside are also perfectly sized, and come with a side of mayo (yes mayo) if you so desire. Mind you, all fries aside, the food was pretty damn good.A socially conscious and community driven restaurant, the focus at The Farm on Adderley is on local farmers and entrepreneurs and creating food made with local, (often) organic and seasonal ingredients. If you have food allergies, I found the staff were helpful in terms of leading me around the menu to dishes that would either be free of allergens or that could be adapted. I went with a helping of fries and a grass-fed piece of beef, while my friend attacked the homemade focaccia bread with zeal and settled on a rack of lamb as her main.The verdict? The helpings were generous and the food: great. My steak was a perfect shade of medium rare, the beef was wonderfully juicy and it tasted as if it had lived a good life. I already told you about the fries, so there's no point banging on about those. I also gave the focaccia bread a go and I have to say, it's some of the best focaccia I've had...in a long, long time.For more: fortheintolerants.com/?p….",4.0
"I came here for brunch on a Friday (3 day weekend anyone?) to catch up with an old friend. My friend and I, in addtion to a few others were waiting outside for this gem to open at 10:30 on a Friday. This clearly told me I was in the right place! Since we opened the spot so we had no issue with seating. I love the feel of this location. It has a warm but chic look.  Initially we were  going to sit on the outdoor patio but it was too hot for that. It looks like a great area for a summer night dinner though. My food quickly appeared after placing my order. I don't know if this was due to being one of the first to arrive or if the chef is speedy gonzales, but I wasn't complaining either way. I kept it simple with breakfast food and had the french toast and eggs. The eggs were great. The french toast was a little crunchy but still good.  The price was really affordable with 2 meals for just 30 including tax. My friend and I talked for hours because we were so comfortable.

"So I don't often give fives for restaurant experiences - but this was beyond that!Initially, we did have to wait 20 mins for a table....they dont take reservations.  But we did sit at the bar and I discovered how much I LOVE Whiskey Sours - particularly, their Cranberry Sour.  It was so refreshing!When we sat, our waiter was attentive and thorough yet did not intrude and had a very laid back casual style that we really appreciated.  He radiated the confidence of ""yeah our place is awesome and we know it - we dont have to prove it.""Kale Salad - WOW!  We didnt even know the Kale was raw!  I made myself a note to *try to duplicate this salad.  *Try.The baby carrots and pine nuts - aahhh!  yummmmThe steak was PERFECTLY cooked and everything just tasted so perfect....just perfect.Overall the atmosphere, the food, the service and the music contributed to my Mahattanite boyfriend saying ""hmmm wow I really think I should come to BK more often.""Um DUH - YEAH you should!!!! :O",5.0

"One of my favorite things in life is to sit at a Brooklyn bar with a burger and a beer. When the bar and burger belong to The Farm, and the beer is Sixpoint's Diesel Stout, I don't think anyone in their right mind can argue. If you're not a beer drinker, there are a few bourbons on the list, several more single malts, other inferior alcohol and a plethora of non-boozy options for you teetotalers. The sweet bartender will offer you bread* served with spice-infused olive oil. She might also recommend the lamb belly pasta, or a salad. Shoot her down, cruelly, if you must. Get this burger. After a long day, or a short one; a cold walk, or a warm stroll; I can never imagine a point in my life when this juicy, medium-rare beauty of a burger -- with the accompanying hand-cut fries and their curry mayo -- won't hit the spot.As an added bonus, you might receive plastic jungle animals along with your check.

"Just before I first moved to the Ditmas Park neighborhood, my then roommate and I visited this place for dinner after checking out our soon to be new apartment. The food was so amazing, we took the apartment! No seriously, while the food didn't sell us the apartment, the food, service, everything abut this place kept us coming back regularly. I cannot count how many times I have ordered from here either for pick up or to stay in. And now 5 years after I have moved out of NY back to the other coast I still make sure to make a trip out to the old hood and have dinner, lunch, or breakfast here. It's worth the trip! Hell it may even be worth the plane fare. I highly recommend the curry mayo with the fries, the salted chocolate mouse if it's still on the menu (my dad had it once and actually moaned... he's not the type to do that with food), the burger and the farmer's eggs.

"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Its cute and cozy and the food is just amazing. I came here for a late breakfast with my boyfriend and he loves to order practically everything on the menu.

We started off with Toast w/ goat butter & maple sugar and I got myself the Chocolate Bread w/ sea salt & butter because I was craving something sweet. Both very delicious but if you were to choose one I would say go with the chocolate bread, its soft and has little tiny chocolate chips inside. The bread is warm and almost melts in your mouth. My boyfriend ordered Steel Cut Oats with fresh bananas - the oatmeal is delicious and not overcooked like other places and also not too sweet nor bland. For the ""main dish"" we both got poached eggs and grits - probably the best poached eggs and most perfect grits I've ever tried. If you are going for brunch definitely get the poached eggs they are amazing. The service was quick and staff super friendly. The prices are also very reasonable.

This place is so dam trendy from the decor to the eyeglasses and side hair buns? But they do a great job making this place really comfy and they were really nice as servers.

I look forward to attending some of their events. It was about 10-12 bucks a dish. No espresso drinks though just coffee. Try their beet mustard. It's really tasty. *new reviewHad a terrible experience with just simple seating and us expressing that we wanted a different area. Plus they sat us out of order of another party that came later. Hostess just rolled her eyes. Manager fumbled about, wasn't apologetic deferred the complaint to an email on the postcard. Wtf!! I don't get these people sometimes. They try to fit too many parties for brunch. Party for two is ok after that its stupid and pain in the butt.

"Great little spot for brunch, with an added bonus of being next door to a coffee shop that had amazing iced coffee.  Score!Ham and Cheese Croque w/ sunnyside up egg on top - Amazing!  Each bite was perfectly salty and buttery...I finished up every last morsel of food on my plate.Sausage and Eggs - Even the scrambled eggs, which I normally don't care for, somehow tasted really good.  I just got a few bites of this dish, as it was my friend's (and I was too busy with my ham and cheese croque to even bother with much else), but I remember it being yummy.  But I guess it's hard to really go wrong with sausage and eggs.French Toast w/ Strawberries - Didn't really care for this one.  The french toast was too soggy for my taste, and the strawberries didn't seem fresh.  Either that, or it was like as though the strawberries had been marinating in some sweet sauce...almost like it was from a jam.  I could be completely wrong, but there seemed to have been some kind of glaze to it that I didn't care for.Everyone here was so nice and pleasant...perfect ambiance for a brunch spot.  The one thing I didn't like though, was that all the drinks were just kinda warm.  Even my bloody mary started off pretty warm, to the point where the ice cubes were all pretty small from melting away.  Maybe it was warm cuz they used fresh squeezed tomato juice?  I don't know.  But I like my food hot and my drinks cold...and the drinks weren't cold enough for me.  I know it seems like a minute point, but excellence is in the details, and it's the little things that elevate a place to a 5 star rating.",4.0

For dessert, the chocolate mouse with salted creme was heavenly. Very good coffee from Jim's Organic.Brunch:I have never seen my dad eat something so fast as he did the Red Flannel Hash. Maybe it was because he had spent all morning directing my movers around, but it srsly disappeared in like 2 minutes. The tangy beet mustard matches the hash drenched in beet juice in a really pretty display equal to it's delightful heartiness.

The goat butter and maple sugar toast was tasty too but even less worth its price. The decor was beautiful and I really liked the homey-ness of the place. The bathroom was even scented with lavender.The only thing I really disliked was the hashbrown that came with my omelet. It tasted like raw shredded potato soaked in grease. Gross.,5.0

"Outdoor brunch on a warm summer afternoon in Brooklyn. I'm hooked.

My girlfriend and I ordered the Farmer's Market scrambled eggs, chocolate brioche, poached eggs and french fries. Needless to say, way too much food as the portions are huge, but it was all so good. My girlfriend wasn't a fan of the brioche because of the added sea salt, but I had no qualms about it.

"I came to the farm after my roommate forced me. I was getting pretty tired of the ""farm-to-table"" phenomena so I wasn't exactly outrunning my bootstraps to get here. Anywho, onto the review.I had the red flannel hash that was pretty good, though not mindblowing as I had expected it to be based on other reviews. I could tell that is wasn't prepared to order but seeing their brunch crowd, it wasn't totally ludicrous to understand. I also had the toast with goat butter and maple sugar. That, on the other hand, was yummy! Now, on to why they're getting a two-star review from me:The service was ca-ca!! For those who don't understand what that means, it sucked! If any of you follow my reviews (I'm sure you don't I just have delusions of grandeur) you'll know that I'm a server and I will ALWAYS give another server the benefit of the doubt when their service is sub-par. In this case, she just seemed to not give a [bleep]. Our waitress wasn't attentive at all! We constantly had to flag her down to get something we needed and when we finally got her attention she seemed almost annoyed that we were asking her to, well, do her job! I could go on about this for another paragraph or so but I'll spare you and skip to the nail in the coffin.At the end of our meal we asked to see a dessert menu but we were promptly told ""I'm sorry, but the kitchen closes for brunch at 3:30."" I then checked the time to see that it was only 3:35! And even if it had been 5 in the afternoon how do you not offer me a complete meal, including dessert?! And to add insult to injury, a solid 15 mins after she claimed the kitchen would make an exception and brought us the chocolate mousse we ordered (Which was entirely too sweet and the salted cream was wayyyy too salty) my roomie and I see her bring dessert menus to another table!!! Are you serious?! I was majorly insulted and felt as though she tried to play us for suckers. I would mention her name in this review but the purpose is to educate, not humiliate.

My poached eggs were on the smaller end, but it was cooked perfectly. The smoke trout was very yummy but I felt it shouldn't have been mixed w/ my greens since the heat of the fish weathered most of my mixed salad and made it look unattractive and unappetizing.

"This is a great place to get a steak, or other mid-price-range ($15-$25 entrees) Americana food.  They use a lot of local and high quality ingredients.  This is reflected in the food, which is often simple and traditional with small creative twists.  The place can get a bit crowded at times, and can occasionally have a 15 minute wait, but it's worth it!

He answered all of our questions with a smile.I ordered the fisherman's eggs which is poached eggs over smoked trout, salad and potato latke. It was the best dish that was ordered among my group.  I got to sample fisherman's eggs, sausage and eggs, cheese burger, toast w goat cheese butter and maple sugar and lastly the cheddar grits.  All of these dishes were fresh and tasted good.

"Attention please, this was an awesome YELP find! Go here. I was looking for a place to eat in Brooklyn on my last morning in NYC. This place had great reviews and it was close to where I was staying. It was a Sunday morning so the place was busy so we had about a 30 minute wait or so. We were seated on the back patio which was really cute and the only down side to that was it was a really warm and humid day. We got over it. The menu was full of delicious sounding items and I was blown away by the prices...they are super reasonable for a place like this! I had the tomato, basil, and mozzarella omelet. OMG!! I'm not kidding.. this was the best omelet I have ever had. It was light and fluffy and cheesy and savory all in one. It was served with a nice side salad which was a welcoming change from a huge helping of potatoes that normally adorn the side of an omelet. Also two pieces of toast that came with yummy strawberry jam that had chunks of strawberries..... awesome! If I lived in Brooklyn or the surrounding areas I would be here at least once a month. Like I said the prices are great and so is the food! Enjoy!",5.0
Went for lunch. Staff and interior were great. It's rare that I'm blown away by a new taste. The oatmeal here did just that. Amazing! I got an excellent super juicy burger as well. The only disappointment was the brussel sprouts which were drenched in butter. I loved it overall though and will take folks from out of town here for a nice mid-range price meal.,4.0
"A friend told me of this place and it took me forever to find.  I was born and raised in BK but have left many years ago. Whenever I am visiting (which is several times a year) I like to come here for a brunch. It is on a kind of out of the way street with only a few stores that one would go to in the area but so worth it. I really like coming here in the warmer months so I can sit outside. The outdoor area feels like a million miles away from brooklyn. The vibe is pretty mellow. The menu does not have many choices but that is not needed because the variety is so good. One of my absolute favorites is the grits with eggs. I love the entire dish. A great side is the chocolate bread. There is really nothing on the menu that you can go wrong with. The grilled cheese is great, the eggs and on and on. I have only been here for brunch so I cant comment on the rest of the menu but I am sure it is as good and fresh. They dont rush you either so if you want to come linger and enjoy the atmosphere, this is a great place.Can't wait till my next visit back east to enjoy a brunch again!",4.0

But no that wasn't the case, maybe if they allowed that they would have avoided this rant from yours truly. The prix fixe menu was a bag of terrible. Okay okay maybe not that bad but I was not impressed. Long story short each dish needed to be blessed with a handful of extra spice and everything nice. I felt like I was robbed of a Vday dinner. I had a spectacular brunch though at ElBerta's earlier in the day...I wish I would have had dinner there too instead of this place...SMH...seriously. One more thing our waiter was perfect for the restaurant because they were equally terrible! Well that's all for now, happy eating!",2.0

"Good food or boozy oozy brunch for my birthday? WHATTTT?! Of course I picked the restaurant with 4 stars after over a hundred reviews in a heartbeat! Boozy brunch another weekend for sure.At 2PM on a Saturday afternoon, I thought the wait would be ridiculous. But for some reason they knew it was my birthday (I'd like to think of it that way) so our group was seated immediately.  Our server was friendly, helpful and charming. He answered all of our questions with a smile.I ordered the fisherman's eggs which is poached eggs over smoked trout, salad and potato latke. It was the best dish that was ordered among my group.  I got to sample fisherman's eggs, sausage and eggs, cheese burger, toast w goat cheese butter and maple sugar and lastly the cheddar grits.  All of these dishes were fresh and tasted good. Also, all are reasonably priced at $8-10.",4.0
"I was visiting a friend and staying nearby in Brooklyn so when I saw The Farm on Adderley was close by & one of the highest rated brunch spots in Brooklyn on Yelp I figured it was worth checking out. The setup is cool, definitely a hip Brooklyn restaurant-bar vibe w/ a nice little patio.  Even on a Saturday morning @ 11 we were seated right away & the staff was really friendly.  I ended up having the farmer's omelet, coffee, and mimosa.... everything  was solid.  I feel like everything was ""good"" or in Yelp terms ""A-Ok"" but I really didn't get the feeling this place was the cat's meow or deserve 5 stars.  End of the day this place wouldn't disappoint but at the same time I think there's some better brunch spots out there.",3.0
"My favorite place for brunch! This place has the freshest ingredients and their coffee is strong and dark, the way I like it. Their fries and curry sauce is good. I also like their farmer's breakfast or the burger! There's always a wait but it doesn't get too bad. On sundays, there's a farmer's market nearby that you can walk to if there is a wait!",5.0
"I grew up in this neighborhood and I am surprised by how much it changed in a couple of years. I heard about this cute brunch place from a friend and decided to try it. When I first walked in, I noticed the outdoor seating in the back but we got seated inside. The wait was pretty quick, about 10-15 minutes. I ordered the sausage & eggs and french fries w/ curry mayo. The sausage & eggs was pretty good so I finished everything on the plate. The french fries were average but the curry mayo sauce was pretty good. We practically ran out of it and had to request more.",4.0

"Attention please, this was an awesome YELP find! Go here. I was looking for a place to eat in Brooklyn on my last morning in NYC. This place had great reviews and it was close to where I was staying. It was a Sunday morning so the place was busy so we had about a 30 minute wait or so. We were seated on the back patio which was really cute and the only down side to that was it was a really warm and humid day. We got over it. The menu was full of delicious sounding items and I was blown away by the prices...they are super reasonable for a place like this! I had the tomato, basil, and mozzarella omelet. OMG!! I'm not kidding.. this was the best omelet I have ever had. It was light and fluffy and cheesy and savory all in one. It was served with a nice side salad which was a welcoming change from a huge helping of potatoes that normally adorn the side of an omelet. Also two pieces of toast that came with yummy strawberry jam that had chunks of strawberries..... awesome! If I lived in Brooklyn or the surrounding areas I would be here at least once a month. Like I said the prices are great and so is the food! Enjoy!",5.0
Went for lunch. Staff and interior were great. It's rare that I'm blown away by a new taste. The oatmeal here did just that. Amazing! I got an excellent super juicy burger as well. The only disappointment was the brussel sprouts which were drenched in butter. I loved it overall though and will take folks from out of town here for a nice mid-range price meal.,4.0
"A friend told me of this place and it took me forever to find.  I was born and raised in BK but have left many years ago. Whenever I am visiting (which is several times a year) I like to come here for a brunch. It is on a kind of out of the way street with only a few stores that one would go to in the area but so worth it. I really like coming here in the warmer months so I can sit outside. The outdoor area feels like a million miles away from brooklyn. The vibe is pretty mellow. The menu does not have many choices but that is not needed because the variety is so good. One of my absolute favorites is the grits with eggs. I love the entire dish. A great side is the chocolate bread. There is really nothing on the menu that you can go wrong with. The grilled cheese is great, the eggs and on and on. I have only been here for brunch so I cant comment on the rest of the menu but I am sure it is as good and fresh. They dont rush you either so if you want to come linger and enjoy the atmosphere, this is a great place.Can't wait till my next visit back east to enjoy a brunch again!",4.0

"The Farm is one of those restaurants that falls between a 3.5 and a 4. The food is good but not the best. We split a burger that was good but lacked the taste of some of the other burgers we have tried that cost less. We also split a delicious bibb salad that was built with enjoye, pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries and tasty goat cheese fritters and very much enjoyed their exceptional organic coffee. Also of note were their excellent fries.They unfortunately closed the backyard due to the threat of rain and thus the wait on a Saturday was about 1/2 hour at 2:00 PM. What brought the rating from a 3.5 to a 4 was the attentive service.

"I have finally tried the massive Farm burger, and I can now say that this is in the running for best burger in NY. This monster of a burger is made with pasture-raised beef, which remains juicy even if one orders it well-done, as I am wont to do, on an english muffin topped with crisp lettuce, ripe tomato,  and purple onion and accompanied by a crispy, homemade pickle and heaps of fresh cut french fries which need little more than a dash of sea salt from the bottle on every table, although the curry mayo was a very interesting dipping sauce (I don't care for mayo or curry in themselves, but the combination just somehow works, sort of like Sriracha mayo). The amount of food on my plate was easily enough for two meals, so bring your appetite, share, or order something lighter. My drink recommendation to go with this salty meal is the Fentimans ""botanically brewed"" Curiosity Cola (per the Fentimans website, this beverage is meant to emulate ""an apothecary's cola of yesteryear"" and is infused with ginger). On this most recent trip to the Farm on a Saturday afternoon, service was stellar as usual, and my friend and I didn't have to wait long for a table.",5.0

There was nothing extraordinary about the burger but it was good. My friends loved the eggs over fried fish.As girls' brunches go, we talked and drank coffees and talked and had dessert and talked some more. We talked past the brunch hours and into dinner. And no one said a word or rushed us out. In fact, we talked too much to notice the time and we were never reminded. That makes the service superb.

"We ate at the Farm several times and quickly realized it was one of our absolute favorite restaurants in NYC.  So when, suffused with Brooklyn pride, we decided to get married at the Picnic House in Prospect Park, there was really only one restaurant we seriously considered for the catering.  We chose our menu, with the Farm folks helpfully suggesting combinations that would both work well together and fit within our budget, and awaited the day itself.In most cases, this review would now continue by telling you how well the Farm staff executed our agreed arrangement, i.e., off-site catering of our event.  However, it turns out that our wedding was scheduled for Saturday, August 27, aka Hurricane Irene-pocalypse in New York City.  As calls started trickling in on Friday with several friends and relatives cancelling last-minute, we thought, well, I guess we will just have a cozy, pre-storm gathering at the Picnic House and that will be that.  And then the Picnic House called.  As of 1pm Friday afternoon, we were told that we may have to end our wedding early, which seemed like a major inconvenience until 5pm, when they called to tell us the Park would be closed and the permit for our wedding would be cancelled.  Then the truly furious last-minute wedding planning began.I spoke with Gary at the Farm many, many frantic (on my end) times that Friday night and Saturday morning and he and the whole staff at the Farm were truly amazing.  First things first, Gary made some calls and, just as we were starting to convince ourselves that the 60 or so remaining guests would be able to deal with cramming into our 5th floor 1+ bedroom to watch the festivities and enjoy their lunch (presumably while standing?), he called to say that he would be able to shuffle things around so that we could have the ceremony and reception at the Farm itself.  Crisis averted!  As if that weren't enough, when we arrived, fashionably late, on Saturday, the Farm crew had decorated with beautiful flowers (from the Farm's nearby sister establishment, a flower shop/bar called Sycamore) and arranged the restaurant in a way that was ideal for passed hors d'oeuvres, the ceremony, lunch, and, with just a couple of adjustments, dancing.  Our guests gushed about the food, and I for one made sure I tried every dish--the duck rillette hors d'oeuvre, smoked pork shoulder, and grilled whole trout were especially memorable--all of which were, as expected, awesome.  And the whole staff was very helpful and pleasant, despite the impending natural disaster and last-minute chaos.  In fact, when we walked in, Gary was there to welcome us with Champagne and a relaxed smile.All in all, I think we would both say that the wedding ended up being much more what we had hoped it would be in the first place, before the guest list swelled uncontrollably--a fun, informal, intimate party with our families, good friends, and some seriously delicious food.  Many, many thanks to the folks at the Farm for improvising so well and making that the case.",5.0

Also many things are too uncomposed so you think you're getting a traditional benedict and it turns out to be a newfangled recreation.  Stick to the basics (grits!) and just remember to not get hopes too high.  Come for the relaxation, stay for a bloody.",3.0

I cannot wait to come back for brunch or dinner. The service was a little bit slow as the place is crowded. But definitely worth the wait.",4.0

"I went for Sunday brunch and have to say, I am so glad to have found this spot so close to home. The ingredients were fresh and local. The Red Flannel Hash was delicious as was the Poached Eggs & Polenta. The bloody mary was decent. The wait time was almost non-existent but we did get there right at 12 p.m. By the time we left, there was line of people waiting to get seated. I would definitely go back. And next time, I'll try the $3 Chocolate Brioche!",4.0
This restaurant is one of our favorite brunch places in the neighborhood. LOVE! It is nice when you go somewhere once a month and the staff remembers you. Service is always prompt and friendly. The food is also always consistently made and delicious. A must try for anyone in the area!,5.0
"Every dish on the brunch menu is something I've had a thousand times before - reads really well, tastes really average.  That said, you can't beat sitting outside on a pleasant, sunny Sunday and the service is casual, not at all bothersome & feel happy to linger there for a good portion of the day.  The food can be rather sloppily composed and like everything just gets put on the plate with too much comingling, eg lettuce become limp and wan from being plated on top of sauce instead of separated. Also many things are too uncomposed so you think you're getting a traditional benedict and it turns out to be a newfangled recreation.  Stick to the basics (grits!) and just remember to not get hopes too high.  Come for the relaxation, stay for a bloody.",3.0
"I've been here a couple of times and just realized that I didn't write a review!  Excellent service, fantastic brunch and very good flame-broiled burger with fries.  High quality ingredients' loved dining during mild weather afternoons in the ""backyard.""  Will be going back here very soon.",4.0
"This restaurant has a specific clientele. The menu has barely any food on it (dinner) and their tastes are very linear. It is clear this establishment is made for the local yuppies. I ordered a burger with fries and I was not impressed. Neither of them were even that great, and I paid good money for it too. The lighting in the restaurant is very dark too, so if you plan on going to use their bathrooms, treat it like an Abercrombie and Fitch store. (bring a flashlight). The service wasn't anything special either and I would recommend this place to no one.2 stars because the water was okay.",2.0
"The bathroom soap is made of hemp. The staff wear big thick glasses and Journey t-shirts (ironically).

The scrambled eggs were smooth. The home fries were seasoned well, and cooked nice and dark. Finally, the chard made you feel unguilty about all those home fries.Don't miss the chocolate brioche with rock salt and butter. Its mix of crispy toast, sweetness, and saltiness drew raves from our whole table. My husband's corned beef hash came with a beet mustard, which he shared with the table. It was robust, dark red, and seedy. Amazing.Our servers were friendly and attentive with coffee and water refills.",4.0

"Another Brooklyn favorite. The quality of the food (locally grown or raised) is superb, and the price cannot be beat -- if this restaurant were in Manhattan, it would be considerably more expensive to eat there.Their menu seems to change seasonally, which makes it exciting to go back. The appetizer / first course items might be my favorite -- there's usually a soup worth trying, and the carrots+ricotta dish, not to mention their salads (one of which, if memory serves, usually centers around apples, walnuts and some variety of bleu cheese), are particular favorites of mine.The main courses are good across the board. Even the burger (probably the cheapest entree on the menu) is worth a try, and the fries are very tasty.Ambience is just classy enough -- usually quiet for dinner, romantic lighting, relaxed but attentive and friendly staff.The brunch is AMAZING but be warned -- the wait can be daunting (at least), and no reservations are taken.

"The Farm is generally a solid neighbourhood choice for a decent meal at any time of the day.

If you do happen to get the burger, make sure to ask for the curry mayo to go with the fries, it's awesome. The bar selection is always solid, they generally have a pretty good choice of craft beers on tap, and decent wines as well.",4.0
"I definitely am a fan.  I should mention this place is popular so arrive before 7 pm if you want a table early.  Delicious and inventive platters.  All of the dishes that we ordered were definitely hits!  I went with three other friends.  We got the following entrees: Poached Farm Egg, Steak with potatoes, Farm Burger pasture-raised beef on an english muffin, homemade french fries & homemade pickle and Pan-Roasted Fluke. My choice, the Poached Farm Egg, was an amazing packed version of salad which was made of wheat berries, quinoa, zucchini, kale, parmesan. My friend got the Farm Burger, which had to be about the biggest amount of ground meat I ever seen, and did I mention that it was pasture-raised beef?  And all of that on top of an English muffin.  My friend's girlfriend had the Fluke which came with sweet corn, fennel and potato and looked divine by the way.",4.0

"After months of hearing about the awesomeness of The Farm on Adderley, I am very pleased to say that my first meal here did not at all disappoint.

I had the burger, which alone was good, but didn't really show off how esteemed a restaurant Adderley is. The two outstanding appetizers (plus a few bites off my husband's plate) did it -- highly recommend the House Cured Bresaola with strawberries and pickled fennel and the Apple & Arugula Salad.

It's extremely rare that pictures of food look as good as the real thing, but these images were so mouth watering I couldn't contain myself as we drove in last night. Once there, I ordered the Cauliflower Soup with smoked apple (not exactly what I expected but still yumma in the tumma) and the Tagliatelle (yesssss baby!!!)... and also picked off of my boyfriends' steak (rib eye with cauliflowers and what looked like a miso/sesame type of sauce) and his FANTASTIC Maitake Mushroom Tempura.  Honestly, the mushroom tempura may have been my favorite part of the meal.  The other couple enjoyed their dinners as well (they shared the kale salad appetizer, had a burger and the trout). We concluded with a spot of tea (my friend had a mint one, my boyfriend the 5 roses, and myself the white tea blend).  All in all, I was plenty satisfied and would definitely come back, hopefully when it's warm out so we can sit in the back patio...

What can I say? Sometimes you have to be willing to travel some for good food. The store front was already very appealing. Very much in the style that I love. We walk in and the was greeted by the long front bar. I love the look of the mismatched chairs and tables. Feels like you're having dinner at a neighbors house, the next ranch over. This place is adorable and pictures don't do it justice. You can tell they put in thought when this put this place together. We were led to one of the tables in the back dining room. I think they even have outdoor seating for the warmer months. Great big windows let you eat bathed in ample sunlight. It felt very refreshing. A decent but sort of limited drink list. I stuck with a rose and she got a glass of chardonnay. Together, we shared the bread and dip (hummus, eggplant, assorted breads), the buffalo mozz with arugula and apples and the delicious french dip which was basically a housemade roast beef stuffed between a baguette.

Both of our serves, David and Conrad, were great too.Don't skip on the coffee...we loved it so much we went home and threw out our store bought Dunkin' Donuts coffee and started searching for some locally roasted deliciousness to mimic our experience at The Farm.

"The place was packed! I came here with my boyfriend for brunch. We decided to try a new place and did not expect it to be so packed. The wait time for a table was about 30 minutes but the hostess did mention that we can have our brunch at the bar and we were seated right away. The bartender was very polite and attentive. He brought us our menu's right away and had our drinks ready within five minutes - coffee and a delicious mimosa. After looking at the menu my boyfriend decided to get an egg white omelet with tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, mushrooms and grilled onions which came with a delicious salad and whole wheat toast. I ordered the Fisherman's eggs. To my surprise our food was in front of us in three minutes tops!!! THAT was unexpected because they were sooooo busy! Needless to say everything was absolutely delicious. My mouth was watering every single time i took a bite of a piece of smoked trout with the potato latkes. The portions were big too, which was a relief since we are both big eaters. The atmosphere of the place was cozy. It reminded me of the village in the city a bit. portion of the walls were made of brick and portion of it were wood. They have a wine rack down one side of the wall and pictures of old Coney Island. I also noticed that they have a backyard which looked really cozy (it was sunny outside). I will definitely come back here again and bring my girlfriends, maybe next time I will get to sit in the back yard.",5.0

Both of our serves, David and Conrad, were great too.Don't skip on the coffee...we loved it so much we went home and threw out our store bought Dunkin' Donuts coffee and started searching for some locally roasted deliciousness to mimic our experience at The Farm. Perfect addition to a wonderful Brooklyn weekend.",5.0
"Vibe= Rustic, Food= Awesome! I came for brunch during a dreary Wednesday so I'm not sure how bad the weekend crowd is but if they're coming to eat the same food I experienced this place MUST be crowded. I def will be back to try the lunch and dinner menus.",4.0
"I've been here a few times for brunch - if others are willing to make the trek then its always a winner.  Great coffee, egg dishes, fresh veggies - no matter what you order you'll be happy.  Ambiance is nice, aesthetically pleasing, call ahead and get the bigger table by the back window for a group if you can.  Staff is more of a 4 star, but it's overall still a 5.  Take a walk through the nearby neighborhood as well - it is a pleasant change from the concrete corridors of the city.",5.0
"The place was packed! I came here with my boyfriend for brunch. We decided to try a new place and did not expect it to be so packed. The wait time for a table was about 30 minutes but the hostess did mention that we can have our brunch at the bar and we were seated right away. The bartender was very polite and attentive. He brought us our menu's right away and had our drinks ready within five minutes - coffee and a delicious mimosa. After looking at the menu my boyfriend decided to get an egg white omelet with tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, mushrooms and grilled onions which came with a delicious salad and whole wheat toast. I ordered the Fisherman's eggs. To my surprise our food was in front of us in three minutes tops!!! THAT was unexpected because they were sooooo busy! Needless to say everything was absolutely delicious. My mouth was watering every single time i took a bite of a piece of smoked trout with the potato latkes. The portions were big too, which was a relief since we are both big eaters. The atmosphere of the place was cozy. It reminded me of the village in the city a bit. portion of the walls were made of brick and portion of it were wood. They have a wine rack down one side of the wall and pictures of old Coney Island. I also noticed that they have a backyard which looked really cozy (it was sunny outside). I will definitely come back here again and bring my girlfriends, maybe next time I will get to sit in the back yard.",5.0
"This is a dining haven in Ditmas Park.   I would give it four stars in Manahattan due to   pleasant yet common interiors - but the sheer genius of its cocktails and menu along with the quality of the ingredients is enough for me to give it a perfect rating in in this neck of the woods.  I will go out of my way again to repeat this experience.  First star for the green tomato Michelada, second star for the chicory, cherry, bluecheese, hazelnut salad, third star for the Mackerel Escabeche, fourth star for the second Michelada, and fifth star for the great bartender and crowd.  Went alone and loved every minute of it.",5.0
"Four of us went here for dinner, and found it delightful. The steak and chicken sausage were both highlights.  Added to this were the pleasant ambience and attentive, professional staff.",5.0
"#1. This place gets my vote for best bathroom in all of Brooklyn.#2. It's inexpensive and really good#3. It's a little out of the way, but because of that, you get the above.#4. At first glance I was nervous when I saw the amount of children that were there, but once you remember that you're out of Williamsburg, it's easy to digest....and watch your mouths, motherf*ckers.  #5. It's a locavore joint, and I hear the chickens have 4 acres to roam free in.#6. Did I mention that it's reasonable? It's reasonable.",5.0
"Whoa, awesome holy moly deliciousness!  I felt kind of stupid because I really did think I was going to a farm.. errr.. but once I recovered from my moment of embarrassment (a farm? in brooklyn? really??), I cozied up to the counter, and dug right in.Coffee: amazing.  Bloody mary: perfect. Water: plentiful (the trifecta hangover cure was in full force this morning..err.. afternoon)I ordered the Fisherman's plate which simultaneously fulfilled every taste/texture craving I was having:  salty-fried-oniony potato latke (so thin!) - smokey trout - light crunchy fresh greens - and two perfectly poached runny eggs perched right on top.  It was a masterpiece of epic proportions.  My friend got the tuna sandwich - which was light, flavorful and delicious.The shining star was the toast w/ goat butter and sugar -- GET IT!The bartender was kind, no wait for counter service (though there was certainly a long list for a table), space is great, prices are right.",5.0

"Such a gem. Come for brunch and your mouth will just water looking at all the happy patrons eating their food. All the egg dishes are SU-PERB.Oh, and the decor is adorable. Some super interesting screen prints of (maybe of Istanbul?) line the walls. It's like a restaurant and mini art gallery in one.Oh, and bring the little ones. They'll each get a little plastic farm animal. So cute, right?",5.0
"I'm not sure why there are so many mediocre reviews for the dinner menu at this place, because it was pretty damn good. i'll grant that not everything was *perfect*... some flavors didn't mesh as well as they could have, for example, but i give this place points for creativity. the poached egg is a really, really good vegetarian dish... to the point where i didn't even think of it as a vegetarian dish until i was halfway through it. the fish dish was slightly over-cooked but still very tasty. flavor combinations ranged from ""mild-but-still-interesting"" to ""wow! that's bold!"". rhubarb shortcake dessert was probably the most interesting presentation of rhubarb i've had. drinks were unique AND delicious. best part was, the final bill was a shock - for all the right reasons!  all in all, it'll be on my regular rotation.oh - and the back yard is really cute.  it had the feel of a west village bistro, in ""the tourists will never find me here!"" ditmas park.",4.0
"not many places have a drink special called the ""Bard Alum"" and you can be in on the joke. I am not a bourbon drinker though so this was sort of money down the drain.I was hemming and hawing about what entree to get so i opted to make a meal of apps and sides. Cauliflower soup with an oyster fritter-creamy and yummy despite the fact that in its raw form I cannot stand cauliflower. The Bibb salad-has its namesake lettuce, pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries and goat cheese fritters. Finally the french fries with curry mayo.Then I opted for dessert which was Chocolate, Banana upside down cake-to die for. This nice meal made it a little less bitter to return outside into the snow and a Q train issue getting home.",4.0

"My friends took me to this restaurant Saturday night where we were delighted by earth-friendly dishes, each and every one was delicious. Everything vegetarian  on the menu looked wonderful so I asked the waiter to recommend one, which he did: the hâché. After the butternut crostini, and a Bibb salad, and a side of fries which we all split, I could only make it through half of my entrée. There were two burgers at the table, both of which were thoroughly enjoyed by my friends, as well as an order of fluke. We were all thrilled to have left overs to savor after.The service was great. The ambiance & decor were very comfortable. I'd definitely recommend checking the place out.",4.0
"I went to the The Farm On Adderley this past weekend for brunch. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was very impressed by this restaurant. The decor, atmosphere and staff are great. Even though I sat at the bar and the bartender was basically my waiter, when my water glass was half full another server that was waiting on tables came by an refilled my water without me asking. Impressive! I was also impressed because I received my food within 10 minutes of placing my order although the place looked like it was at capacity. Now the food was a little better than average, but not great. I ordered the french toast and a side of scrambled eggs. The french toast was a little burnt and dry, but the eggs were good. If my french toast wasn't burnt then I would have given this restaurant four stars.",3.0
"Went on a Sunday afternoon, only a 10 minute wait for a table.  Not bad considering the timing. Food was good, served on time.  Staff were very friend and attentive. I had the french toast with caramelized apples, my gf had the farmers breakfast.   My french toast was pretty good, presentation was nice.  I tried some of the scrambled eggs from the other plate and they were a bit on the bland side.  We both had Cheddar grits for a side, they were delicious.  Next time I may just have those alone. I'd go back.  I'm interested in trying the burger.",4.0
"I love the Farm but my wallet doesn't like it so much. THE high-end restaurant on the block it has some of the more adventurous and RICH dishes your heart will ever know. A perfect place for brunch with the folks, a date, a starting point with your best friends. It has your expected poached egg on polenta in the morning then when the sun goes down and the snow starts to fall out comes the beef heart and artery clogging mash. The service is excellent if a little in your face but at least they're always there when you need them. The best thing is that usually there's a very little wait if any for walk-ins and they are always accommodating. Plus the bar is exceptional and the bartender is pretty laid back and on point. The atmosphere and decor is pitch perfect. I'll be back because to be honest the pickings in this area are good quality but few and far between I just wish I made more money. The only downside is you can't change the dishes like if you wanted collard greens instead of polenta it's a no go its a rule printed on the menu.",4.0
"I ate here a while back and I have to say i enjoyed the food and experience. We sat outside in the  ""garden"" and took in the great food as well as the sun.

"My boyfriend and I are regulars here. We love the daily breakfast/brunch and we love the dinner menu.Seriously, almost every single dish I've tried here of late has been fantastic. For breakfast I'm a big fan of the ham and cheese croque with sunny-side-up egg, the cheddar grits with poached egg, the lentil and kale soup with poached egg, and the omelettes . Also the chocolate sea salt toast is amazing. I know I've just named about half the menu....The burgers and fries are fantastic, and the spinach salad (dinner menu) is one of the best salads I've ever had anywhere. The quinoa-kale-poached egg entree is really awesome, as is the steak (though we aren't big fans of the sirloin). The cocktails are superb as well! Love their bloody mary for brunch and the lemon toddy with dinner!Cannot get enough of these guys!P.S. Waiters are friendly and cute and decor is very pleasant.P.P.S.

"It's early Friday morning and I am so excited to finally getting the chance to have brunch with one of my closest friends. I wanted to find a new place to have brunch so I did what I normally do, I turned to Yelp for help. After a few reviews, I settled on The Farm on Adderley because of the look of the place, the brunch options and the fact that it was easy to get to from my crib. I arrived first and had a chance to take in this beautifuly rustic restaurant. It was cozy and the staff was extremely attentive; which I like. The light music was eclectic and added to the over all ambiance of the place. While waiting for my friend to arrive, I had a black tea that was served to me just as I requested, with milk and honey. I also asked, who I assumed to be the owner for an opportunity to check out the outside back patio.  It was very clean and cozy, I would however add a few more colorful flowers and a few other ideas  to really utilize the space. Yet, that was not why I was there but I am glad I got a chance to check it out.  My friend arrived and our waiter quickly swooped in to address her drink needs. Soon after, our food order was taken.  My friend and I both opted to have their mushroom omelet. We asked to have tomatoes and egg whites only added just for good measure.  You know, put the chef to the test. Well he passed with flying colors. The food arrived very promptly and hot. At some point between all the laughing we were doing, we both looked at each other and said "" Dam"" this food is sooooo good!  And then we joked and laughed and enjoyed our fresh pie/slice shaped hash brown and the delicious red and green side salad. AMAZING!I'm so glad I followed my first mind and went with The Farm on Adderley, was an amazing experience I'm sure to repeat again and again! Do yourself a favor and experience a gem in Brooklyn. Take it from me,one who enjoys going out to eat as expressed in my reviews. This place ROCKS!",4.0

"RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS!My husband and I ate here the other night before walking over to Sycamore for a beer and show.  Just thought we were going to get a cute, decent meal but didn't realize it was going to be this phenomenal.  ENTREE: It seems others around us were getting the simpler faire; burgers, fries, veggies, etc.  We went for the two fish dishes; the Fluke and Artic Char.  Both were very good but the Fluke was incredible!  It was seasoned heavily with ground cumin, both on the fish and its sides; cumin/pickled carrots and this amazingly delicious wilted spinach (seriously some of my favorite spinach ever.DESERT:So we were stuffed but its one of those places that's so good that you just assume they have amazing deserts.  Indeed they do!  We got the chocolate upside down banana cake with coconut ice cream.  Just delicious.Seriously one of our new favorite places in the city (our other fav is Peasant)",5.0

"Very nice brunch with large group. The large table is in the front window separated from the rest of the restaurant by the bar so it feels private yet lively. The food was very good although not spectacular, say a 1/2 step behind Buttermilk Channel. The service was attentive although the waiter seemed a little odd, not in any functional way but aesthetically maybe. Overall, very enjoyable meal.Another nice thing is that we were able to make a reservation because our group was so large.",4.0
"ok,  let me start off by saying, this place is not in my neighborhood (so I need to take a $15 car service to get here),  and I'm not a vegen. The place and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed, and a little crowded, but that can be good sign.Our hostess was very nice and friendly, and we were seated immediately.Our waiter arrived promptly and took our drink order.When ordering a coke,  don't just show up with the ""organic"" equivalent without giving me a heads up about that.The entrees are reasonably priced, at around $8 or $9 for a simple egg meal, that shows up with dry texas toast.  (no spreads? at all?)No green peppers for my omelet?  What's up with that?All in all, the meal left me unfilled and very unsatisfied.",2.0
