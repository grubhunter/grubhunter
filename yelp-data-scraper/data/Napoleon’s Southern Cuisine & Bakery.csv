"You won't need no hot sauce in yo bag, swag!Let me just start off by saying that I'm from Atlanta, my dad's fam is from Jacksonville, FL and my mom's is from Birmingham, AL. I have the kind of family that tells you to unbutton your pants at the table so you can eat properly (which mind you, I never do).I know soul food! & this place is the way, the truth, and the life! No man shall come to the Father until they have sank their teeth into Napoleon's Sweet Potato Cheesecake. Baaaaaaby! But let me not skip to the desert yet.I live walking distance from here so there is a lot of this menu that I have explored, but there is much that I have yet to explore bc my ""good ol faithfuls"" make it hard for me to waiver. The Honey BBQ Wings are basically what I order every time. They're big, they're drenched in honey bbq sauce sauce and have the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. The collard greens, potato salad, candied yams, and mac & cheese are the side dishes that I alternate with. All delicious although I feel that since the mac & cheese is baked it could stand to be much cheesier. For desert I never, ever ever ever ever... leave this place without getting a slice of the Sweet Potato Cheese Cake. & I don't even like cheese cake. But this right here... WOOO. Listen, if you do nothing else, take my word on that. One more honorable mention that I'll give is to the Arnold Palmer. It's not for everybody. It's so sweet it might make your eye twitch. But that's how I like it, bc if you can't tell already, I'm a little crazy. Enjoy!",5.0

"I'm a southerner to the bone so I expect my southern/soul food to taste a certain way.Napoleon's was ok but I wouldn't make it a routine to go there. I had the BBQ turkey wings, macaroni and cheese, and yams. Oh, I had a taste of the macaroni salad and I had the banana pudding as well. Pudding was good and macaroni salad was great! Turkey wings were a little tough to me, mac and cheese? my aunts is wayyyy better, and yams? I prefer them to be sweeter.Service is great though...I ordered through Yelp. The staff is so polite and they do give you generous portions for your money so that's always a plus. Glad I got that experience out the way.",3.0
"Everything I've had here has been delicious! My absolutel favorite, which actually keeps me from exploring more of the menu, is the turkey wings.  The wings are smothered, falling off the bone and so perfectly seasoned.  My mouth is salivating as I write this.   I also love, love the potato salad, probably the best I've ever had.  The collards, the corn bread, the candied yams and the mac n cheese are also delicious!  I've also had the buffalo wings which were finger-licking-good! I highly recommend this spot for some delicious, well-seasoned soulfood.  When I'm eating solo, I usually make two meals out of the entrees I order.  Well worth it.  Plus everyone who works here is super friendly.  I'll be back again soon!",5.0
"The food from here is absolutely disgusting!!!  I ordered a tilapia sandwich, a whiting fish sandwich, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread. Everything we ordered was inedible! The fish sandwiches had absolutely no flavor. The mac & cheese was way too salty. The collard greens were bland and the corn bread was dry. I was completely shocked by the fact that this place has 4.5 stars and the food was so nasty. I'm truly convinced that this place is paying for reviews!

"I always order my food to go/pick up! No complaints on taste. Everything is delicious. I have to give only 4 stars because i really think a little more can be given on the side dishes that come with your meal. For the dinner prices, a little dollop just won't do. Also the yams could be less stringy and sweeter/darker in flavor. My preferred choices are the baked turkey wings (so tender they fall off the bone), with a side of mac&cheese and yams. I don't like the desserts at all. Service is great as long as you're dealing w/the owner. She's a sweetie pie!",4.0
"Please, give me a minute to gather my thoughts, I'm coming out of a food coma!My family and I went to a different Southern restaurant in the area but a notice on the window informed us that the restaurant is closed for renovation and upgrades. I was still in the mood for southern food and searched for other restaurants in the area. I pulled out my phone and tapped my trusty ole' Yelp app and found Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery. So, I gathered my peeps, hopped back in my ride, and sped off (figuratively speaking) to this restaurant. When we arrived, we were greeted by a woman who is presumably the owner of the restaurant. She smiled at my son when he yelled ""Am I going to get rice? Mommy, I want rice!"" (My child was asking for rice since 10am... smh). The woman was very pleasant and patient with us while we wrapped our heads around all of the delicious options on the menu. After ordering, we sat down at the large wooden table and my sons entertained themselves with the free magazines.We ordered:- BBQ chicken wings w/ Candied Yams and Mac and Cheese- Friend Chicken Wings- Fried BBQ Shrimp w/ fries- Fried Talapia w/ Rice and fries (I hope my physician is not a Yelper; he would definitely not approve our choices...lol) My boys are VERY picky eaters, and so is my husband. My little rice eater destroyed the rice and my other child put a hurting on the Talapia!!! I lost all of my manners when I opened the container with the BBQ chicken; my poor poor fingers. NOW, if my husband says a meal is really good, then it's actually great! He is not much of a talker but her was sure to let the nice lady know that the food was delicious! Now, the lemonade and Arnold Palmer (half lemonade/half Iced-tea) OHH EMM GEE!!! When my son took a sip and said ""THIS LEMONADE IS AWESOME"". I'm not sure if our drinks were made with a secret ingredient but they tasted like they were made with magic fairy pixie dust. My husband almost broke my hand (figuratively speaking) when I accidentally picked up his cup (lol). Bottom line, I LOVE THIS PLACE and will definitely return. I am going to bring more family and friends. I left Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery full and satisfied. I will continue to support this local business. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Next time, I will be sure to get dessert. P.S. I forgot to take pictures of our food when we received it. I took pictures of what I could before it was too late.",5.0
Ordered a smothered fried chicken sandwich. Received a wing and a breast still on bone between 2 pieces of Wonder bread and doused in gravy. How can that be called a sandwich? I was so disappointed. Mac and cheese is slightly better than kraft. Food took 1.5 hours to arrive while I only live half a mile away. Fried chicken is pretty good. Gotta work on the rest of it though.,1.0
"According to Yelp they close @ 9pm. I went in at 9:15/9:20 to get a side of jerk chicken. According to the girl @ the counter I can't get a side of jerk chicken alone, I can only get the dinner. I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't honor just a side of a menu option. Is this standard? So if it's 9:15 and they allegedly close at 9 I'm going to assume that they're going to reheat the jerk chicken that they do not sell tonight and sell it tomorrow. I'll stick to island grille on the corner of Fulton and nostrand.",1.0
"First off, I never write reviews lol. But here we go... Felt for some chicken & waffles... Looked on Yelp and saw these great reviews. So I said lets venture out to Napoleon's.

The waffles were cooked to perfection, and the chicken was seasoned & cooked just right. Wowwww I'm giving them 10 stars!!!! I can't wait to come back. Actually, we'll be back for dinner to try something else from their spectacular soul food menu.",5.0
"Since I'm from the South, I am always on the lookout for great southern cuisine in the north. Napoleon's is definitely good, but not authentically southern. Which is honestly sometimes not a bad thing, seeing as how I feel like I could live a longer life eating Nay's than actual southern food.I ordered the fried chicken - leg/thigh dinner, which comes with your choice of of two sides for $10. I won't even bother comparing New York prices to prices back home, but the Mac n cheese and green beans were so good! The mac had limited cheese on it, which I actually like. The green beans actually tasted refreshing and yummy at the same time. Honestly the sides were my favorite part since I didn't think the chicken was meaty or juicy enough. Tasted healthier though. (I think there's a trend here...) The sweet tea wasn't the sweetest and had a lot of lemon flavor. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, and they don't even put the chicken on top of the waffles because they're wings with bones in them. No sauce is drizzled over them. Not the most authentic, but the waffles were pretty good. Again I thought the chicken was too skinny. Service was definitely nice though! Just don't expect the cheapest, largest meal just because it's southern food. It was just the right portion.",4.0
This place is simply outstanding. Writing my first every yelp review because of an outstanding dinner I just had. Fried chicken dinner is the way to go. Big generous pieces that come with two sides. Candied yams are spiced so well and collards are perfect.Rarely do I find places that make great food and delivers quickly. About a .5 mile out and this place has consistently delivered in under 30 minutes. Comfort food at its best!,5.0

My absolutel favorite, which actually keeps me from exploring more of the menu, is the turkey wings.  The wings are smothered, falling off the bone and so perfectly seasoned.  My mouth is salivating as I write this.   I also love, love the potato salad, probably the best I've ever had.  The collards, the corn bread, the candied yams and the mac n cheese are also delicious!  I've also had the buffalo wings which were finger-licking-good! I highly recommend this spot for some delicious, well-seasoned soulfood.  When I'm eating solo, I usually make two meals out of the entrees I order.  Well worth it.  Plus everyone who works here is super friendly.  I'll be back again soon!",5.0
"The food from here is absolutely disgusting!!!  I ordered a tilapia sandwich, a whiting fish sandwich, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread. Everything we ordered was inedible! The fish sandwiches had absolutely no flavor. The mac & cheese was way too salty. The collard greens were bland and the corn bread was dry. I was completely shocked by the fact that this place has 4.5 stars and the food was so nasty. I'm truly convinced that this place is paying for reviews!

Also the yams could be less stringy and sweeter/darker in flavor. My preferred choices are the baked turkey wings (so tender they fall off the bone), with a side of mac&cheese and yams.

"Please, give me a minute to gather my thoughts, I'm coming out of a food coma!My family and I went to a different Southern restaurant in the area but a notice on the window informed us that the restaurant is closed for renovation and upgrades. I was still in the mood for southern food and searched for other restaurants in the area. I pulled out my phone and tapped my trusty ole' Yelp app and found Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery. So, I gathered my peeps, hopped back in my ride, and sped off (figuratively speaking) to this restaurant. When we arrived, we were greeted by a woman who is presumably the owner of the restaurant. She smiled at my son when he yelled ""Am I going to get rice? Mommy, I want rice!"" (My child was asking for rice since 10am... smh). The woman was very pleasant and patient with us while we wrapped our heads around all of the delicious options on the menu. After ordering, we sat down at the large wooden table and my sons entertained themselves with the free magazines.We ordered:- BBQ chicken wings w/ Candied Yams and Mac and Cheese- Friend Chicken Wings- Fried BBQ Shrimp w/ fries- Fried Talapia w/ Rice and fries (I hope my physician is not a Yelper; he would definitely not approve our choices...lol) My boys are VERY picky eaters, and so is my husband. My little rice eater destroyed the rice and my other child put a hurting on the Talapia!!! I lost all of my manners when I opened the container with the BBQ chicken; my poor poor fingers. NOW, if my husband says a meal is really good, then it's actually great! He is not much of a talker but her was sure to let the nice lady know that the food was delicious! Now, the lemonade and Arnold Palmer (half lemonade/half Iced-tea) OHH EMM GEE!!! When my son took a sip and said ""THIS LEMONADE IS AWESOME"". I'm not sure if our drinks were made with a secret ingredient but they tasted like they were made with magic fairy pixie dust. My husband almost broke my hand (figuratively speaking) when I accidentally picked up his cup (lol). Bottom line, I LOVE THIS PLACE and will definitely return. I am going to bring more family and friends. I left Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery full and satisfied. I will continue to support this local business. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Next time, I will be sure to get dessert. P.S. I forgot to take pictures of our food when we received it. I took pictures of what I could before it was too late.",5.0
Ordered a smothered fried chicken sandwich. Received a wing and a breast still on bone between 2 pieces of Wonder bread and doused in gravy. How can that be called a sandwich? I was so disappointed. Mac and cheese is slightly better than kraft. Food took 1.5 hours to arrive while I only live half a mile away. Fried chicken is pretty good. Gotta work on the rest of it though.,1.0
"According to Yelp they close @ 9pm. I went in at 9:15/9:20 to get a side of jerk chicken. According to the girl @ the counter I can't get a side of jerk chicken alone, I can only get the dinner. I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't honor just a side of a menu option. Is this standard? So if it's 9:15 and they allegedly close at 9 I'm going to assume that they're going to reheat the jerk chicken that they do not sell tonight and sell it tomorrow.

The waffles were cooked to perfection, and the chicken was seasoned & cooked just right. Wowwww I'm giving them 10 stars!!!! I can't wait to come back. Actually, we'll be back for dinner to try something else from their spectacular soul food menu.",5.0
"Since I'm from the South, I am always on the lookout for great southern cuisine in the north. Napoleon's is definitely good, but not authentically southern. Which is honestly sometimes not a bad thing, seeing as how I feel like I could live a longer life eating Nay's than actual southern food.I ordered the fried chicken - leg/thigh dinner, which comes with your choice of of two sides for $10. I won't even bother comparing New York prices to prices back home, but the Mac n cheese and green beans were so good! The mac had limited cheese on it, which I actually like. The green beans actually tasted refreshing and yummy at the same time. Honestly the sides were my favorite part since I didn't think the chicken was meaty or juicy enough. Tasted healthier though. (I think there's a trend here...) The sweet tea wasn't the sweetest and had a lot of lemon flavor. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, and they don't even put the chicken on top of the waffles because they're wings with bones in them. No sauce is drizzled over them. Not the most authentic, but the waffles were pretty good. Again I thought the chicken was too skinny. Service was definitely nice though! Just don't expect the cheapest, largest meal just because it's southern food. It was just the right portion.",4.0
This place is simply outstanding. Writing my first every yelp review because of an outstanding dinner I just had. Fried chicken dinner is the way to go. Big generous pieces that come with two sides. Candied yams are spiced so well and collards are perfect.Rarely do I find places that make great food and delivers quickly. About a .5 mile out and this place has consistently delivered in under 30 minutes. Comfort food at its best!,5.0

But OMG...those chicken wings are the BEST chicken wings I've ever had in all of my life!!! The collard greens are too good, and they don't even use pork. The mac and cheese is even on point! The staff is really friendly and totally deserve a tip every time you go. Get there now. Seriously. Just go!",5.0

The Honey BBQ Wings are basically what I order every time. They're big, they're drenched in honey bbq sauce sauce and have the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. The collard greens, potato salad, candied yams, and mac & cheese are the side dishes that I alternate with. All delicious although I feel that since the mac & cheese is baked it could stand to be much cheesier. For desert I never, ever ever ever ever... leave this place without getting a slice of the Sweet Potato Cheese Cake. & I don't even like cheese cake. But this right here... WOOO. Listen, if you do nothing else, take my word on that. One more honorable mention that I'll give is to the Arnold Palmer. It's not for everybody. It's so sweet it might make your eye twitch.

Also the yams could be less stringy and sweeter/darker in flavor. My preferred choices are the baked turkey wings (so tender they fall off the bone), with a side of mac&cheese and yams. I don't like the desserts at all. Service is great as long as you're dealing w/the owner. She's a sweetie pie!",4.0
"Please, give me a minute to gather my thoughts, I'm coming out of a food coma!My family and I went to a different Southern restaurant in the area but a notice on the window informed us that the restaurant is closed for renovation and upgrades. I was still in the mood for southern food and searched for other restaurants in the area. I pulled out my phone and tapped my trusty ole' Yelp app and found Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery. So, I gathered my peeps, hopped back in my ride, and sped off (figuratively speaking) to this restaurant. When we arrived, we were greeted by a woman who is presumably the owner of the restaurant. She smiled at my son when he yelled ""Am I going to get rice? Mommy, I want rice!"" (My child was asking for rice since 10am... smh). The woman was very pleasant and patient with us while we wrapped our heads around all of the delicious options on the menu. After ordering, we sat down at the large wooden table and my sons entertained themselves with the free magazines.We ordered:- BBQ chicken wings w/ Candied Yams and Mac and Cheese- Friend Chicken Wings- Fried BBQ Shrimp w/ fries- Fried Talapia w/ Rice and fries (I hope my physician is not a Yelper; he would definitely not approve our choices...lol) My boys are VERY picky eaters, and so is my husband. My little rice eater destroyed the rice and my other child put a hurting on the Talapia!!! I lost all of my manners when I opened the container with the BBQ chicken; my poor poor fingers. NOW, if my husband says a meal is really good, then it's actually great! He is not much of a talker but her was sure to let the nice lady know that the food was delicious! Now, the lemonade and Arnold Palmer (half lemonade/half Iced-tea) OHH EMM GEE!!! When my son took a sip and said ""THIS LEMONADE IS AWESOME"". I'm not sure if our drinks were made with a secret ingredient but they tasted like they were made with magic fairy pixie dust. My husband almost broke my hand (figuratively speaking) when I accidentally picked up his cup (lol). Bottom line, I LOVE THIS PLACE and will definitely return. I am going to bring more family and friends. I left Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery full and satisfied. I will continue to support this local business. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Next time, I will be sure to get dessert. P.S. I forgot to take pictures of our food when we received it. I took pictures of what I could before it was too late.",5.0
Ordered a smothered fried chicken sandwich. Received a wing and a breast still on bone between 2 pieces of Wonder bread and doused in gravy. How can that be called a sandwich? I was so disappointed. Mac and cheese is slightly better than kraft. Food took 1.5 hours to arrive while I only live half a mile away. Fried chicken is pretty good. Gotta work on the rest of it though.,1.0
"According to Yelp they close @ 9pm. I went in at 9:15/9:20 to get a side of jerk chicken. According to the girl @ the counter I can't get a side of jerk chicken alone, I can only get the dinner. I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't honor just a side of a menu option. Is this standard? So if it's 9:15 and they allegedly close at 9 I'm going to assume that they're going to reheat the jerk chicken that they do not sell tonight and sell it tomorrow. I'll stick to island grille on the corner of Fulton and nostrand.",1.0
"First off, I never write reviews lol. But here we go... Felt for some chicken & waffles... Looked on Yelp and saw these great reviews. So I said lets venture out to Napoleon's. I had the plain Chicken wings & waffles, and my girlfriend had the chicken wings & red velvet waffles. This was the BESTTT chicken & waffles they we've ever had. The waffles were cooked to perfection, and the chicken was seasoned & cooked just right. Wowwww I'm giving them 10 stars!!!! I can't wait to come back. Actually, we'll be back for dinner to try something else from their spectacular soul food menu.",5.0
"Since I'm from the South, I am always on the lookout for great southern cuisine in the north. Napoleon's is definitely good, but not authentically southern. Which is honestly sometimes not a bad thing, seeing as how I feel like I could live a longer life eating Nay's than actual southern food.I ordered the fried chicken - leg/thigh dinner, which comes with your choice of of two sides for $10. I won't even bother comparing New York prices to prices back home, but the Mac n cheese and green beans were so good! The mac had limited cheese on it, which I actually like. The green beans actually tasted refreshing and yummy at the same time. Honestly the sides were my favorite part since I didn't think the chicken was meaty or juicy enough. Tasted healthier though. (I think there's a trend here...) The sweet tea wasn't the sweetest and had a lot of lemon flavor. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, and they don't even put the chicken on top of the waffles because they're wings with bones in them. No sauce is drizzled over them. Not the most authentic, but the waffles were pretty good. Again I thought the chicken was too skinny. Service was definitely nice though! Just don't expect the cheapest, largest meal just because it's southern food. It was just the right portion.",4.0
This place is simply outstanding. Writing my first every yelp review because of an outstanding dinner I just had. Fried chicken dinner is the way to go. Big generous pieces that come with two sides. Candied yams are spiced so well and collards are perfect.Rarely do I find places that make great food and delivers quickly. About a .5 mile out and this place has consistently delivered in under 30 minutes. Comfort food at its best!,5.0

Food is delicious.2 Mini Red Velvet Waffles and 2 Wings $9Waffles had a nice texture and the cream cheese frosting was sweet. Wings were seasoned nicely and were crispy when they arrived. Would order again!Honey BBQ Wings Dinner with Mac n' Cheese and Candied Yams $10.99Wings are sweet and have a nice crisp to them. These are consistent since I have ordered them before, months ago. Mac n' Cheese was decent, nothing spectacular. Candied Yams were bomb! Not too sweet, seasoned perfectly, and delicious.Would definitely order from Napoleon's again. Really want to try their breakfast!",4.0
"HOLY. SHIT.I mean that in the best possible way. The food is AMAZEBALLS!!! I've already eaten it twice in the past week! The red velvet waffles are soft and delicious, and the frosting is great if you like cream cheese frosting (I don't but it was still pretty good). But OMG...those chicken wings are the BEST chicken wings I've ever had in all of my life!!! The collard greens are too good, and they don't even use pork. The mac and cheese is even on point! The staff is really friendly and totally deserve a tip every time you go. Get there now. Seriously. Just go!",5.0

No man shall come to the Father until they have sank their teeth into Napoleon's Sweet Potato Cheesecake. Baaaaaaby! But let me not skip to the desert yet.I live walking distance from here so there is a lot of this menu that I have explored, but there is much that I have yet to explore bc my ""good ol faithfuls"" make it hard for me to waiver. The Honey BBQ Wings are basically what I order every time. They're big, they're drenched in honey bbq sauce sauce and have the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. The collard greens, potato salad, candied yams, and mac & cheese are the side dishes that I alternate with. All delicious although I feel that since the mac & cheese is baked it could stand to be much cheesier. For desert I never, ever ever ever ever... leave this place without getting a slice of the Sweet Potato Cheese Cake. & I don't even like cheese cake. But this right here... WOOO. Listen, if you do nothing else, take my word on that. One more honorable mention that I'll give is to the Arnold Palmer. It's not for everybody. It's so sweet it might make your eye twitch.

Turkey wings were a little tough to me, mac and cheese? my aunts is wayyyy better, and yams? I prefer them to be sweeter.Service is great though...I ordered through Yelp.

"The food from here is absolutely disgusting!!!  I ordered a tilapia sandwich, a whiting fish sandwich, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread. Everything we ordered was inedible!

I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't honor just a side of a menu option. Is this standard? So if it's 9:15 and they allegedly close at 9 I'm going to assume that they're going to reheat the jerk chicken that they do not sell tonight and sell it tomorrow. I'll stick to island grille on the corner of Fulton and nostrand.",1.0
"First off, I never write reviews lol. But here we go... Felt for some chicken & waffles... Looked on Yelp and saw these great reviews. So I said lets venture out to Napoleon's. I had the plain Chicken wings & waffles, and my girlfriend had the chicken wings & red velvet waffles. This was the BESTTT chicken & waffles they we've ever had. The waffles were cooked to perfection, and the chicken was seasoned & cooked just right. Wowwww I'm giving them 10 stars!!!! I can't wait to come back. Actually, we'll be back for dinner to try something else from their spectacular soul food menu.",5.0
"Since I'm from the South, I am always on the lookout for great southern cuisine in the north. Napoleon's is definitely good, but not authentically southern. Which is honestly sometimes not a bad thing, seeing as how I feel like I could live a longer life eating Nay's than actual southern food.I ordered the fried chicken - leg/thigh dinner, which comes with your choice of of two sides for $10. I won't even bother comparing New York prices to prices back home, but the Mac n cheese and green beans were so good! The mac had limited cheese on it, which I actually like. The green beans actually tasted refreshing and yummy at the same time. Honestly the sides were my favorite part since I didn't think the chicken was meaty or juicy enough. Tasted healthier though. (I think there's a trend here...) The sweet tea wasn't the sweetest and had a lot of lemon flavor. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles, and they don't even put the chicken on top of the waffles because they're wings with bones in them. No sauce is drizzled over them. Not the most authentic, but the waffles were pretty good. Again I thought the chicken was too skinny. Service was definitely nice though! Just don't expect the cheapest, largest meal just because it's southern food. It was just the right portion.",4.0
This place is simply outstanding. Writing my first every yelp review because of an outstanding dinner I just had. Fried chicken dinner is the way to go. Big generous pieces that come with two sides. Candied yams are spiced so well and collards are perfect.Rarely do I find places that make great food and delivers quickly. About a .5 mile out and this place has consistently delivered in under 30 minutes. Comfort food at its best!,5.0
"Crumbles. This apple crumble has a lot of 'em. And how. I could go on for 30 or 40 pages but suffice it to say, it's basically a coffee cake that a bunch of apples fucked. Crumbly, as well.",5.0
"DELIVERY: 3 StarsFood arrived 2 hours after ordering on Seamless. Called twice. First time was 45 minutes post ordering to double check they received my order since I did not receive a confirmation email. Said it was coming in 10 minutes. Called a second time an hour and a half later and they said it was on its way. Food came half an hour later.FOOD:Even though it was 2 hours late, the food was still fresh and warm. Food is delicious.2 Mini Red Velvet Waffles and 2 Wings $9Waffles had a nice texture and the cream cheese frosting was sweet. Wings were seasoned nicely and were crispy when they arrived. Would order again!Honey BBQ Wings Dinner with Mac n' Cheese and Candied Yams $10.99Wings are sweet and have a nice crisp to them. These are consistent since I have ordered them before, months ago. Mac n' Cheese was decent, nothing spectacular. Candied Yams were bomb! Not too sweet, seasoned perfectly, and delicious.Would definitely order from Napoleon's again. Really want to try their breakfast!",4.0
"HOLY. SHIT.I mean that in the best possible way. The food is AMAZEBALLS!!! I've already eaten it twice in the past week! The red velvet waffles are soft and delicious, and the frosting is great if you like cream cheese frosting (I don't but it was still pretty good). But OMG...those chicken wings are the BEST chicken wings I've ever had in all of my life!!! The collard greens are too good, and they don't even use pork. The mac and cheese is even on point! The staff is really friendly and totally deserve a tip every time you go. Get there now. Seriously. Just go!",5.0
Excellent food always good. The mac and cheese is very good. The fried and smothered chicken with collard greens are very very good. Also loved the seafood. The delivery time at least for me was  good. I will be ordering from this place again.,4.0
"You won't need no hot sauce in yo bag, swag!Let me just start off by saying that I'm from Atlanta, my dad's fam is from Jacksonville, FL and my mom's is from Birmingham, AL. I have the kind of family that tells you to unbutton your pants at the table so you can eat properly (which mind you, I never do).I know soul food! & this place is the way, the truth, and the life! No man shall come to the Father until they have sank their teeth into Napoleon's Sweet Potato Cheesecake. Baaaaaaby! But let me not skip to the desert yet.I live walking distance from here so there is a lot of this menu that I have explored, but there is much that I have yet to explore bc my ""good ol faithfuls"" make it hard for me to waiver. The Honey BBQ Wings are basically what I order every time. They're big, they're drenched in honey bbq sauce sauce and have the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. The collard greens, potato salad, candied yams, and mac & cheese are the side dishes that I alternate with. All delicious although I feel that since the mac & cheese is baked it could stand to be much cheesier. For desert I never, ever ever ever ever... leave this place without getting a slice of the Sweet Potato Cheese Cake. & I don't even like cheese cake. But this right here... WOOO. Listen, if you do nothing else, take my word on that. One more honorable mention that I'll give is to the Arnold Palmer. It's not for everybody. It's so sweet it might make your eye twitch. But that's how I like it, bc if you can't tell already, I'm a little crazy. Enjoy!",5.0
"This review is primary based on the service, or lack of customer service adjusted for the food. Is it too much to ask for kindness at the counter, consideration of a request for half/half with your customer and a smile. Instead the woman at the register is short and unapologetic. This is the 4th time I've eaten here and it's simply because they do salmon croquettes better than most, despite calling them salmon cakes. Overall, the food is  okay but the service sucks like shit. Ladies, sometimes a smile goes a long way, a genuine apology goes further and just pure kindness speaks volumes. You know what, I get what it is.....it's that Black on Black mean-ness because she was just laughing and smiling with other customers. I'm done with this place, despite the deliciousness of their food. I continue to be reminded to follow my first mind, I told him I will be so outdone of the customer service sucks again. Twice in one week - damn!",2.0
"I'm a southerner to the bone so I expect my southern/soul food to taste a certain way.Napoleon's was ok but I wouldn't make it a routine to go there. I had the BBQ turkey wings, macaroni and cheese, and yams. Oh, I had a taste of the macaroni salad and I had the banana pudding as well. Pudding was good and macaroni salad was great! Turkey wings were a little tough to me, mac and cheese? my aunts is wayyyy better, and yams? I prefer them to be sweeter.Service is great though...I ordered through Yelp. The staff is so polite and they do give you generous portions for your money so that's always a plus. Glad I got that experience out the way.",3.0
"Everything I've had here has been delicious! My absolutel favorite, which actually keeps me from exploring more of the menu, is the turkey wings.  The wings are smothered, falling off the bone and so perfectly seasoned.  My mouth is salivating as I write this.   I also love, love the potato salad, probably the best I've ever had.  The collards, the corn bread, the candied yams and the mac n cheese are also delicious!  I've also had the buffalo wings which were finger-licking-good! I highly recommend this spot for some delicious, well-seasoned soulfood.  When I'm eating solo, I usually make two meals out of the entrees I order.  Well worth it.  Plus everyone who works here is super friendly.  I'll be back again soon!",5.0
"The food from here is absolutely disgusting!!!  I ordered a tilapia sandwich, a whiting fish sandwich, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and cornbread. Everything we ordered was inedible! The fish sandwiches had absolutely no flavor. The mac & cheese was way too salty. The collard greens were bland and the corn bread was dry. I was completely shocked by the fact that this place has 4.5 stars and the food was so nasty. I'm truly convinced that this place is paying for reviews! This was honestly the worst soul food I've had in my life!!!",1.0
"Ok, so I had breakfast here this morning, and it was great. I see the potential, I imagine that breakfast is very simple in comparison to the interesting food on the menu. I had two scrambled eggs, sausage, and grits. The grits come with any breakfast platter you order. The only slightest compliant I have is the grits were a bit runny, than how I would like them. Other than that it was cool. The place was clean, and the women at the front desk was cool. I will be coming back, and recommend that u try this place.Jussjess",4.0
"I just figured out what it is that makes their food taste sooooo goooood! It's their attitude. Simple. Everyone in this establishment is so very courteous. From management to bottle washer. If you guys ever read this please don't change unless it's to get even more fabulous. Yes, an updated review on a restaurant strictly about the customer service. As you guys tell your customers...BLESSINGS TO YOU. The End.",5.0

"Today is the first time I came here in person, instead of ordering on Seamless. Usually when the food is delivered, it takes forever but it's always good and hot. Now that I'm experiencing the customer service here in person, I won't be patronizing again. The girl at the counter is very brisk and rude. I asked her ""what do you like here?"" She replies ""everything (hastily) can I help the next customer (rudely peeking her bread around me)."" My indecisiveness took less than a minute but that was clearly too long for her to do her job with any type of manners. If not for her, they would get 4 stars with the only complaint being the prices.",3.0
"I always order my food to go/pick up! No complaints on taste. Everything is delicious. I have to give only 4 stars because i really think a little more can be given on the side dishes that come with your meal. For the dinner prices, a little dollop just won't do. Also the yams could be less stringy and sweeter/darker in flavor. My preferred choices are the baked turkey wings (so tender they fall off the bone), with a side of mac&cheese and yams. I don't like the desserts at all. Service is great as long as you're dealing w/the owner. She's a sweetie pie!",4.0
"Please, give me a minute to gather my thoughts, I'm coming out of a food coma!My family and I went to a different Southern restaurant in the area but a notice on the window informed us that the restaurant is closed for renovation and upgrades. I was still in the mood for southern food and searched for other restaurants in the area. I pulled out my phone and tapped my trusty ole' Yelp app and found Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery. So, I gathered my peeps, hopped back in my ride, and sped off (figuratively speaking) to this restaurant. When we arrived, we were greeted by a woman who is presumably the owner of the restaurant. She smiled at my son when he yelled ""Am I going to get rice? Mommy, I want rice!"" (My child was asking for rice since 10am... smh). The woman was very pleasant and patient with us while we wrapped our heads around all of the delicious options on the menu. After ordering, we sat down at the large wooden table and my sons entertained themselves with the free magazines.We ordered:- BBQ chicken wings w/ Candied Yams and Mac and Cheese- Friend Chicken Wings- Fried BBQ Shrimp w/ fries- Fried Talapia w/ Rice and fries (I hope my physician is not a Yelper; he would definitely not approve our choices...lol) My boys are VERY picky eaters, and so is my husband. My little rice eater destroyed the rice and my other child put a hurting on the Talapia!!! I lost all of my manners when I opened the container with the BBQ chicken; my poor poor fingers. NOW, if my husband says a meal is really good, then it's actually great! He is not much of a talker but her was sure to let the nice lady know that the food was delicious! Now, the lemonade and Arnold Palmer (half lemonade/half Iced-tea) OHH EMM GEE!!! When my son took a sip and said ""THIS LEMONADE IS AWESOME"". I'm not sure if our drinks were made with a secret ingredient but they tasted like they were made with magic fairy pixie dust. My husband almost broke my hand (figuratively speaking) when I accidentally picked up his cup (lol). Bottom line, I LOVE THIS PLACE and will definitely return. I am going to bring more family and friends. I left Napoleon's Southern Cuisine & Bakery full and satisfied. I will continue to support this local business. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Next time, I will be sure to get dessert. P.S. I forgot to take pictures of our food when we received it. I took pictures of what I could before it was too late.",5.0
Ordered a smothered fried chicken sandwich. Received a wing and a breast still on bone between 2 pieces of Wonder bread and doused in gravy. How can that be called a sandwich? I was so disappointed.
