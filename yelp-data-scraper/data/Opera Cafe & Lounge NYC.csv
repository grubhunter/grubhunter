"Although I never go this far south in Brooklyn, a friend of mine pulled me to Opera for breakfast and couldn't have had a better brunch experience. This Turkish cafe definitely serves up some of the best breakfast dishes I have come across. They do have an extensive menu which makes it a little confusing and indecisive but when you settle on a dish, it does not disappoint. We were seated next to the window, with lots of sunshine and great view of the street and water. We ordered pancakes, a salmon salad and some omelets. Every dish was perfect, with purely phenomenal flavors. Free refills on our coffees (Hell yeah) I wish they were further up North so I wouldn't have to go to Sheepshead Bay (The place gives me the creeps)The bill was great too. Cheaper than I expected it to be and parking was pretty easy to find too. I would love to go back and try the dinner menu as I heard that is good too.",4.0
"Highly recommended for desert, it is the best place for a small or large gathering over tea. They have variety of food, desert, coffee and tea Staff is very nice, friendly and  helpful. Prices are decent and location is perfect. The place is amazing in the summer.",4.0
"We started off as goof balls pretending to take puffs out of Cigar Rolls. Not real ones, they're just tasty cigar shaped deep fried cheese sticks, mmm. We also shared and got a little taste of 6 different sides on the small Mixed Meze Plate (consists of sweet and savory sides served with warm bread) before a massive Lamb Shank took over the table. I thought the shank was a big serving compared to any normal lunch portion, thought wrong! I managed to finish! Fork tender, fall of the bone. The sauce was the perfect touch. Nat. had the Salmon Scaloppini, she almost cleared her plate as well. We were so full, we did not have room for dessert. I mean, who doesn't save room for dessert? Everything  was amazing.Nat. and I did a lunch play date with our little girls here today. I don't really come to this quiet part of Brooklyn, but since she's raving about this place, I decided to venture out and see for myself. The atmosphere was just marvelous. Impressive racks of wine lined up against the walls, the ceilings were lit with beautiful bulbs of colorful lights. Not only is the interior big enough for large crowds, they also have outdoor seating during the warmer seasons. This place is perfect for any occasion. I truly had a great time having our much needed chit chat time. We definitely took the advantage of walking off the meal, along the pier right outside, while enjoying our little princesses feeding the ducks in the water.",5.0

Great tasting place. A bit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. Tastes fresh and delicious every time. Ive been there in every season and enjoy it every time. I love getting their cappuchinos and salads.,4.0
"This is a pretty spacious restaurant. I love the décor too, especially the seats. We had the small mixed meze plate ($16) for appetizer. It comes with six different spreads like hummus and spinach yogurt dip. Each spread has its own unique taste and they were all good, although my favorite is the spinach yogurt dip. They give you bread for the spreads and the bread is really good and comes to your table warm. I got pretty full trying to finish the meze plate. The small size meze plate is enough for four people to share, but we were only a party of two.I had the beef shish as an entrée ($19.75), which is grilled marinated beef served with rice and house salad. There were three skewers of beef shish. It wasn't heavily marinated, just slightly. Not the best beef shish I had, but still good. Portions were generous. I was stuff at the end of the meal. The rice was good with some seasoning and the salad was a basic salad. It came with some pita bread and grilled tomato and pepper. They have an array of desserts, which I didn't get to try because I was so full. It was definitely worth the drive to this restaurant to try some Turkish food.",4.0

"I seem to be doing really well this month, knocking off my fourth bookmark in two weeks. This may seem incomparable to some people, but to a person who rarely eats out and has a part-time job with a low salary, this is an accomplishment.The atmosphere is amazing. Everything from the Christmas decorations to the wood textures to the light fixtures are on par. The whole block seems to be competing over aesthetics, but I do not know if they can outcompete this restaurant with their food.We started off with the cold platter that came with many dippings for the crunchy, toasty bread. Loved every one of them, especially the spinach dip. But I have to warn you that you might be full from this appetizer. Our waiter had to give us three baskets of bread because we wanted to make sure none of the dips would go to waste. Then we had the fried calamari, which was great, but the sauce was all right.My whole family each ordered our own entree but we shared with each other. I recommend the salmon scopolini, beef kebabs, mixed beef, roasted beef, and lamb chop. The entrees are huge too, with salad, rice, and/or mashed potatoes.Still unsure what umami is, but this may be the place that sparked my fifth sense.Afterwards, the waiter took our empty plates away, wiped the table, and brought out the birthday cake. She played the birthday song for the fourth time since we were here. Those other three familirs also chose a great place for a birthday celebration.The waitress cut the cake. It had chocolate plates on top, but she threw away those pieces. That was odd...did she think those were not edible? She basically threw away some of our money! $40 quality tiramisu cake right there.Regardless, I was very satisfied with my dining expetience here.",5.0

"Hate when places start out good and then once establish start cutting corners. Ordered their goat cheese arugula salad. It used to be served with beets, well no more beets.

The arugula was drowning in vinegar and the entire dish was just way too sour. it def needs something sweet to balance it off (CHEF PAY ATTENTION!!!).

"I was so set to like this place after reading all the reviews and couldn't wait to eat there. We showed up and it was half full yet we were put in a corner by the door where it was freezing and the sun was beaming in my eyes. Next we asked for a specific drink which they didn't have. Ok no problem. The problem was the snarky comment the waiter made AFTER telling us they didn't carry the drink. ""We only serve, you know, REAL drinks."" I was immediately ready to walk out but I was starving and couldn't wait for my eggs Florentine. Yeah about that......Anytime I have ever had eggs florentine it had hollandaise sauce on it. This came with some weird foam on top, to which there was no mention of this on the menu. So when I received it I was extremely confused. The waiter said this is how it comes. Umm ok, putting that on the menu would help. But I tasted it anyway. So gross. The only thing I ate was the salad that comes on the side with the pseudo eggs florentine.

"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant! It's huge and I like the outdoor seating. Service here is hit or miss, that is my major complaint. Our waiter the last time we went was excellent! We told him we were fasting and requested the food to be ready by a certain time, he was very accommodating. He even brought us a plate of dates, as that is a traditional way that we break fast at he end of the day.We enjoyed all of the food that we ordered. The hommus, baba ghannouj, and bread were delicious! I love a good baba ghannouj and theirs really hit the spot. Lamb chops were excellent although not quite well-done as requested, Adana kebab was juicy and flavorful, chicken curry was spicy, and the grilled chicken skewers were tangy with perfect seasoning. The fries here are excellent.For dessert, the kunafa was excellent, I would get it again next time. The stuffed figs were just ok, not that great. I took one star off because service is not consistent, our order is always messed up. Last time our chicken curry came a half hour later than everyone else's main dishes. The next star I took off is because for their prices, their portions are too small. My husband was still hungry after his lamb chop meal, and our bill was around $50 per person. For that much, no one should leave still hungry.",3.0

"I've been here about twice now: once before they renovated and once after they did and it has become a huge mecca along Sheepshead Bay. The place has become quite big and surprisingly their service is pretty good and they are fairly attentive to everyone. Last time I came, I was here with a rather large party of 10-12. They were very accommodating with us. Some great choices:American Style Oven Baked Potato: I love every variation of potato and this did not disappoint. There are delicious sausage pieces with cheese- super filling and super delicious. Babaganush: It tasted very fresh, perfect compliment with their nice warm bread. Salmon Scaloppini: I was surprised at how good their salmon was. I expected much less from their description, but the salmon was cooked to perfect: very light and flaky, not dry at all.Baklava: My gauge of baklava is it it either tastes good or tastes like potpourri. It luckily tasted great. You get 3 small pieces which will be enough to finish off your dinner.  Kunefe: I wish they provided descriptions of their many different types of desserts since I'm not familiar with Turkish cuisine. This is a cheesy type of dessert that is semi sweet and very hearty. It was amazing and I really loved it. This is a great spot for a party or just dinner: great location and wonderful view since you are by the water.",4.0
"Great location, very large and open restaurant. Great for brunch, lunch, and dinner. The food is good but not great.

However, with that being said i would still recommend this place.",4.0
"I've been to this restaurant twice now, and I've absolutely loved it both times. As a newbie to Sheepshead Bay and Eastern European cuisine in general, the restaurant was at first off-putting when I thought about coming. I've found that Opera Cafe offers a unique menu that isn't too exotic, and the service is always professional and helpful. There is a very large outdoor dining area which is nice in the summer and the space inside is also HUGE and absolutely beautiful, feels very fancy. My go to has been the Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken. I'm normally not a grilled chicken fan because of how dry and bland it can be, but Opera's is incredibly flavorful and the salad is HUGE. Opera puts a lot into it, lettuce, tomatoes, corn, olives, cucumbers, etc. The hummus here is definitely authentic and probably among the best I've had. The mussels were OK, tiny and not too flavorful, but I don't think that's a specialty of Opera's Cappuccinos are strong and flavorful, I love the sugar cubes on the table, very cute. Nice place to visit with friends, family, or a date. Fresh food, great wine, no complaints!",5.0
Great time!! I was there tonight for dinner. It was the three of us and had a wonderful time. The service was great and very friendly. We sat near the bar. We shared mussels and hummus for appetizers. The mussels was to die for!!! Delicious!!! Two of us had mixed grill for main course and one had caesar salad with grilled chicken. Everything was great and served on time. I will definitely be back!,5.0

I ordered their hummus, which was served to me with bread and the house special which was a Turkish plate. The food was excellent! I will be recommending it to family and friends.",4.0
"I've wanted to come here for a long time and finally got the chance when my boyfriend's grandmother celebrated her 80th birthday here. The food was better than their sister location, Rocca, and the waiters were more attentive. They did a pretty good job of bringing the food out timely for about 20 people in our party.The chicken kebabs were delicious and the avocado salad was fresh. We finished the meal w/ turkish coffees and teas and assorted desserts from their glass case.FYI, they do BYOB but charge a corkage fee of $10 per bottle.",4.0
"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant! It's huge and I like the outdoor seating. Service here is hit or miss, that is my major complaint. Our waiter the last time we went was excellent! We told him we were fasting and requested the food to be ready by a certain time, he was very accommodating. He even brought us a plate of dates, as that is a traditional way that we break fast at he end of the day.We enjoyed all of the food that we ordered. The hommus, baba ghannouj, and bread were delicious! I love a good baba ghannouj and theirs really hit the spot. Lamb chops were excellent although not quite well-done as requested, Adana kebab was juicy and flavorful, chicken curry was spicy, and the grilled chicken skewers were tangy with perfect seasoning. The fries here are excellent.For dessert, the kunafa was excellent, I would get it again next time. The stuffed figs were just ok, not that great. I took one star off because service is not consistent, our order is always messed up. Last time our chicken curry came a half hour later than everyone else's main dishes. The next star I took off is because for their prices, their portions are too small. My husband was still hungry after his lamb chop meal, and our bill was around $50 per person. For that much, no one should leave still hungry.",3.0
Food is delicious always fresh and very generous prices very reasonable waitresses were polite and the restaurant it self is really clean I like that the owner always pass by the tables and ask if everything the way you like overall it's really one of the best in brooklyn .,5.0
"Not a bad place if you're looking for something to eat in the neighborhood. The ambience of this restaurant is great, it is right by the water the restaurant itself gives off a nice Mediterranean vibe.Food is tricky it's either hit or miss pending on your palette. But it's always a go to for a weekday brunch. In the evening and weekends this place gets packed out and service weakens.",4.0
"I've been here about twice now: once before they renovated and once after they did and it has become a huge mecca along Sheepshead Bay. The place has become quite big and surprisingly their service is pretty good and they are fairly attentive to everyone. Last time I came, I was here with a rather large party of 10-12. They were very accommodating with us. Some great choices:American Style Oven Baked Potato: I love every variation of potato and this did not disappoint. There are delicious sausage pieces with cheese- super filling and super delicious. Babaganush: It tasted very fresh, perfect compliment with their nice warm bread. Salmon Scaloppini: I was surprised at how good their salmon was. I expected much less from their description, but the salmon was cooked to perfect: very light and flaky, not dry at all.Baklava: My gauge of baklava is it it either tastes good or tastes like potpourri. It luckily tasted great. You get 3 small pieces which will be enough to finish off your dinner.  Kunefe: I wish they provided descriptions of their many different types of desserts since I'm not familiar with Turkish cuisine. This is a cheesy type of dessert that is semi sweet and very hearty. It was amazing and I really loved it. This is a great spot for a party or just dinner: great location and wonderful view since you are by the water.",4.0
"Great location, very large and open restaurant. Great for brunch, lunch, and dinner. The food is good but not great. I often get the opera special wrap with french fries and have found the quality in food to be inconsistent. The food used to taste great but recently the food has been dry and over cooked. However, with that being said i would still recommend this place.",4.0
"I've been to this restaurant twice now, and I've absolutely loved it both times. As a newbie to Sheepshead Bay and Eastern European cuisine in general, the restaurant was at first off-putting when I thought about coming. I've found that Opera Cafe offers a unique menu that isn't too exotic, and the service is always professional and helpful. There is a very large outdoor dining area which is nice in the summer and the space inside is also HUGE and absolutely beautiful, feels very fancy. My go to has been the Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken. I'm normally not a grilled chicken fan because of how dry and bland it can be, but Opera's is incredibly flavorful and the salad is HUGE. Opera puts a lot into it, lettuce, tomatoes, corn, olives, cucumbers, etc. The hummus here is definitely authentic and probably among the best I've had. The mussels were OK, tiny and not too flavorful, but I don't think that's a specialty of Opera's Cappuccinos are strong and flavorful, I love the sugar cubes on the table, very cute. Nice place to visit with friends, family, or a date. Fresh food, great wine, no complaints!",5.0
Great time!! I was there tonight for dinner. It was the three of us and had a wonderful time. The service was great and very friendly. We sat near the bar. We shared mussels and hummus for appetizers. The mussels was to die for!!! Delicious!!! Two of us had mixed grill for main course and one had caesar salad with grilled chicken. Everything was great and served on time. I will definitely be back!,5.0
We came for brunch of Valentine's Day and I want to over the top love this place but I didn't. The place is amazingly decorated and really gorgeous- but my latte was served so hot it I burned my mouth. A lot. my food and my husband's food came out at different times and if I have a choice I'll probably go down the block to Rocca and sit on the water because the food is basically the same but the waiters are friendlier. I do want to come back in the summer and give it a second try when they have outside dining. And maybe get an iced drink instead.,4.0
"A great replacement for El Greco Diner which is gone.  We sat inside but the space felt like open air with the big windows and breeze.  Food comes out fast, less than 5 minutes even during a Sunday brunch.  My husband's turkey omelette was kind of flat seemingly like it lacked egg.  I got the turkish omelette which was more tomato than egg and served with nothing else so I paired it with the bread on the table.  Fried calf's liver was tasty but small portion.Kunefe dessert is delicious - try it!Overall, I would give the food a 3 but the space gives it another star.",4.0

This is one of my go to spots in the Sheapshead Bay Area. My favorite thing to eat here is the grilled chicken Caesar salad or the Adana kebab wrap.

"Opera is located in a prime location-right on Emmons Ave across from the bay. The menu is extensive. The restaurant is large and well decorated. However, execution is lacking.My friends and I came for a weekend brunch. We were seated immediately. Being a lover of Turkish cuisine AND breakfast, I opted for the Turkish Breakfast Platter and it was indeed very similar to the breakfasts I enjoyed in Turkey: various cheeses, salami, olives, cheese omelet served with tea and sides of honey, jam, and clotted cream.Despite being a table of 6, my cheese plate was served first, followed by my omelet, and then everyone else's food. The food should come out at the same time...No one wants to eat alone or wait for everyone else to finish eating. I did enjoy all the items on my platter especially the fresh jam and cheese which were reminiscent of my time in Istanbul.  The pot of tea seemed never ending. I don't love tea usually but something about Turkish tea that makes me want to go back for more.2 of my friends ordered an eggs benedict dish and neither of the eggs came out poached...they were basically hard boiled eggs.

"This restaurant has great decor comfortable seating but the service is horrible, the food is lacking, I have been going w my husband and kids here about 3 or 4 times this year. Somedays are better than others. The waiters dont know what they are doing. Last time i was there they didnt even fill our glasses w water or ask what we wanted to drink before rushing to bring our order. We flagged down one of the bus boys to at least get us water. We waited 15mins just for the water to be poured in our glasses. Our food came out before the water came. It was ridiculous, that happened more than once. Even to get a soda was a 15-20 min wait. What propelled me to write this review is this last incident this evening. My husband and I went out for a date night dinner. We ordered the opera salad, it was dry and a ton of wilted lettuce just a mess of a salad it turned out to be. I hardly tasted the balsamic dressing. They brought the salad 5 mins before the serving plates were placed on the table. No drinks either. Not even water. We ordered dessert which was a hot mess. How do u mess up Baklava. They brought a plate w some wierd pumpkin pieces, fake whip cream and lychee fruit and 4 different baklava not what we expected. The plate was put down w no fork or plate to use. We tried one tiny bite of baklava and asked the waiter if that was what we ordered he didnt really answered and walked away. We didnt like the other items on the plate and requested to change our order to just the baklava we took a small piece of. He brought the manager over and said he could not accommodate us and they would not switch our order because we touched one item on the plate and they could resell it if we had not touched one baklava. And they would not remove it off our bill. That was so ridiculous we didnt touch any other items because they looked nothing like baklava. Very disappointed, they asked if we wanted to eat it or not. We said no and the waiter asked ""do u want us to throw it out""? We said throw it out, it wasnt what we ordered. Boiled Pumpkin and canned lychee fruit that was also not appealing to eat its not necessarily baklava to me. The plates are always chipped at the corners and so big for the amount of food served. Not going back there. Not a friendly atmosphere.",1.0

"Come here pretty often. They have a great menu selection for throughout the day. I came here last week for breakfast and the poached egg selection was very good. My cousin got waffles hard to mess up waffles and ice cream. The offer both indoor and outdoor seating. Ambiance inside is great, but since it was a beautiful day we opted for outdoor. The only downside is service can be slow and i literally had to wave down someone to serve us. Their dinner options are pretty vast as well. The seafood pasta is very good. I'd say there is something for everyone on the menu. Overall it's somewhere I enjoy coming.",4.0
"A perfect afternoon- sitting on the patio on a breezy summer day in July eating delicious Turkish food. Love the decor too, especially the colorful lamps.

"Living in Sheepshead Bay, I always searched for a perfect place to get breakfast.  My family and I tired of Diner food decided to try out Opera. Due to its Turkish/Russian customers it can be a little akward.But I love this place and we've decided to make this a weekend breakfast/lunch spot.  Food never disappoints and service is spot on.  Some may gripe about the price, but you get get what you pay for.  The lamb is marinated well, I love the Baked Potato Dish, desserts are good.  A great experience overall and a great family place.",4.0
"This restaurant has great decor comfortable seating but the service is horrible, the food is lacking, I have been going w my husband and kids here about 3 or 4 times this year. Somedays are better than others. The waiters dont know what they are doing. Last time i was there they didnt even fill our glasses w water or ask what we wanted to drink before rushing to bring our order. We flagged down one of the bus boys to at least get us water. We waited 15mins just for the water to be poured in our glasses. Our food came out before the water came. It was ridiculous, that happened more than once. Even to get a soda was a 15-20 min wait. What propelled me to write this review is this last incident this evening. My husband and I went out for a date night dinner. We ordered the opera salad, it was dry and a ton of wilted lettuce just a mess of a salad it turned out to be. I hardly tasted the balsamic dressing. They brought the salad 5 mins before the serving plates were placed on the table. No drinks either. Not even water. We ordered dessert which was a hot mess. How do u mess up Baklava. They brought a plate w some wierd pumpkin pieces, fake whip cream and lychee fruit and 4 different baklava not what we expected. The plate was put down w no fork or plate to use. We tried one tiny bite of baklava and asked the waiter if that was what we ordered he didnt really answered and walked away. We didnt like the other items on the plate and requested to change our order to just the baklava we took a small piece of. He brought the manager over and said he could not accommodate us and they would not switch our order because we touched one item on the plate and they could resell it if we had not touched one baklava. And they would not remove it off our bill. That was so ridiculous we didnt touch any other items because they looked nothing like baklava. Very disappointed, they asked if we wanted to eat it or not. We said no and the waiter asked ""do u want us to throw it out""? We said throw it out, it wasnt what we ordered. Boiled Pumpkin and canned lychee fruit that was also not appealing to eat its not necessarily baklava to me. The plates are always chipped at the corners and so big for the amount of food served. Not going back there. Not a friendly atmosphere.",1.0
"Cute place for weekend brunch with a group of friends right before heading to Plumb Beach with your dog! Place is very spacious and sitting outside gave us a nice breeze in the sunny weather we have been having. I had the egg's florentine which was pretty decent. My friends ordered a few omelette platters which they were happy with. Service was attentive, mostly because we sat right by the waitstaff's computer - they even offered my dog some water!",4.0
"Great ambiance. I went to Opera with a friend. I was a tad bit skeptical, as I don't dine in Sheepshead Bay, but it was a great experience. Outdoor seating. Reasonable prices. Dress up or dress down. Good amount of food. I had the babaghanoush. My friend had the avocado chicken salad.",4.0
"I LOOOOVVEEEE this place! The decor is absolutely gorgeous- the waitstaff are personable, funny, but very professional as well. Came here with my mama, gram & auntie. Drinks were delicious and pretty strong. The sangria is good but they should add more fruit to it. We had the fried liver- so delicious, and the cigar rolls which are fried egg rolls with cheese. Super delicious. I had fish- very tasty. Get the chocolate soufflé with pistachio ice cream for dessert it was TO DIE FOR!",5.0

"This review is STRICTLY in regards to their delivery. My boyfriend and I eat at Opera at least once a week and we absolutely love their food. So we decided to order in tonight for the first time...I don't know where to begin. I ordered a chicken shish with salad and fries on the side. My boyfriend ordered kofte with fries. Now here's the problem: we received exactly half of everything we would get at the restaurant. The lavash bread that usually comes with the chicken shish didn't come. They gave 6 pieces of chicken and a tiny side of salad. They also FORGOT the fries. I'm sorry, if you can charge the same price for the meal, I expect the exact same portion to be delivered for takeout. Of course we called back and they bought the fries. The fries were not the same fries we get at the restaurant. I was anal about the fries because I love their fries, and then for my luck we got a completely different kind. I was just absolutely so upset by their delivery service that I would never ever order again. If you eat at opera and expect your order to be a certain way, don't. It will NOT be anywhere near the way you expect it.",1.0

"Over rated. Food is mediocre, drinks are wayyyyyyy over priced....$7 for a Guinness that's not properly pored, service sucks, house bread is blah. Menu is simple and over priced. I guess if you're in this area and have outdoor seating it's ok to have overly priced bland food.  Also turn up the AC especially when it's hot out. It's not comfortable sweating and eating.

"The food was great, huge portions. Great outdoor seating area, relaxing atmosphere. Ordered for two. Chicken pacatta and Salmon scalopini. Delicious! The Kunefe for dessert, highly recommended it!! Service was outstanding.",5.0
A great place for summer nights. Their outdoor seating has a pleasant and chill vibe. My favorite here is their hot chocolate cake with ice cream. The turkish tea they serve is very strong and authentic. Definitely spent too many nights here for my own good haha!,5.0
"Expensive bad diner food, in a stinky, despite high ceilings, place with no airflow and uncomfortable seating layout. Loud music so great if you don't want to speak to your fellow diners. I seen many dates enjoying this type of quiet, sourpuss faced type of dining. Looks like a lot of money went into this place but zero thought. Same goes for the food. They're trying to be creative, and you order this weird stuff and it totally doesn't work together at all. Like their opera salad for example. One thing that did work was the semolino desert.. Didn't know what to expect, but it was surprisingly great. Unique and actually worked. If this was a bakery or a small cafe I'd come back to have it again. Also, the Russian hostess chick was cute and sweet despite the chaotic atmosphere, I give her props for that.",2.0

Great spot !  We had an early dinner here after a great day of fishing on the Marilyn Jean IV located right across the street.  I had the Grilled chicken ceaser salad and my buddy had the fried calamari both were fresh and great tasting + Cocktails outside with a nice salt breeze after a day of fishing...

Opera is a great addition to Emmons avenue. Usually it's my go to place with friends or family to have some brunch or dinner. The food is seriously so good!!!! Never disappoints! The drinks/cocktails are great too. The decor is modern and the chairs are so comfy! I really love and enjoy this place. The employees are great. Everybody seems to be really nice and will always adjust anything to your liking. Sometimes they get really busy but that doesn't stop the waiters from accommodating you quickly and nicely. Definitely 5 stars from me!,5.0
"Go there for the outside seating and not so special Turkish food. Service is ok, cocktails could be better. Inside decor makes me feel like a cafeteria in an all inclusive in Mexico somewhere, gets pretty loud. But if you're looking for a place for large groups - probably your best bet in the area, if you don't mind a hefty bill.",4.0
I'm a regular at Opera and i ve been coming here ever since they first opened their doors. Throughout my college years this place fed me well and ended many late night cravings for me. Their inegol kofte and opera wraps are the most popular food items in the menu. The other must haves is the kumpir (baked potato) and the kunefe dessert. The wait is usually not that long because the space is so big so you can always grab a table even on a saturday evening.,5.0
"Great place to go out to with friends or family. It is suitable for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The food is delicious, my personal favorites include the baked potato, meat gozlame, and the chocolate souffle for dessert. However, the food variety is not so great and so there are a limited amount of choices to pick from. Service is pretty fast and the place is usually crowded. The environment is friendly and good for occasions ranging from birthdays to casual outings.",4.0
I went there 06.05.15 and I was nice. I eat the mix grill and for the most part it was good. I didn't like the inegol meatballs (veal) which it came with and I was told I could have traded if for something else (good to know for next time). It looks like a great place to eat at in the summertime with the outdoor seating. I definitely will go back.,4.0
"It took a few years for Opera to get their act together (pun intended), and finally, I can say that this is a very good choice for a casual dinner at the canal, whatever the occasion.  It's a place where the Russians and the Turks happily mix, devouring delicious platters and aided by the full bar.  We smartly made a reservation for Sat at 4:30, which, however, we had to move twice to a later time and they were accommodating about it.  Our waiter was Stas, a very nice gentleman who was always on hand to take care of us.  We shared our usual favorite appetizers-the hummus, the baba ganoush, the fried liver and the cigars, a couple of salads and I was so stuffed that I went with a light main course, the grilled shrimp platter which I probably ate like 1/3 off as the rest was polished off by my 6 year old.  No problem, my husband ordered mixed grill which he had leftovers of, and I gladly stole half of it for lunch the next day.  We shall be back.",5.0

"Went here on a Wednesday afternoon around 5pm with my family. The decor looks good on the inside, there is plenty of room for seating and enjoying. Problem with this place is first and foremost the service. It was terrible from the start. We arrived and had to seat ourselves and then wait way too long to even get a menu. We were served water and no menu, how nice. Then to order was another long wait. Mind you that this place had about 25 customers and they literally had about 25 people working it seemed. You would think one person would be assigned to make sure we needed everything. To me it seemed like we were not even there. The whole experience left me not wanting to come back ever again. To get my bill and pay took forever as well. The only reason I give this place one star was the food was good and they managed to say goodbye on the way out. Do not go here.",1.0

"We had a horrible evening here. I may agree the food is good,  but the waiter who served us was terrible. We ordered some soups, appetizer and some main dishes. One of us ordered only one main dish and she was going to share the appetizer. We ordered and right after few minutes, the guy brought one of the main dishes (fish platter) before appetizer and before the soups. After we asked why he brought the main dish right away, he was like ""oh, since one of you ordered only one main dish, i brought it right away"". I guess everyone would agree that main dishes should come all at the same time after the soups/appetizer. The waiter disagreed, but we made him take it back (of course he had some attitude). As I was having the soup, I found some white staff (a piece of porcelain) in the soup. We called him over and told him we found something in the soup. He goes like ""it is from the lemon"" (lemon does not contain porcelain as far as I know). He again goes like it is impossible. We had some nice argument. We just wanted to tell them to be careful. We are not going back again, avoid eating there unless you want your night ruined!",1.0

Since they opened this place has been the new hot spot especially in the summer. Last summer they expanded and it's even more beautiful. The food is amazing and is always on point.

"This is place is  great!First off, the ambience is a cant beat. The bay is right across the street. And of course their outdoor seating is a must. But the interior is also wonderfully decorated. Food was really good. Authentic Turkish food. Went with a family of 4. We got the ground meat borek which was heavenly. Lentil soup was good. Te turkish dumplings were good but not great. My only complaint would be that the food was just a tad bit bland. But  The lamb shank however was cooked to perfection right down to the sauce. It was a beautiful display and tasted even better. The Best Part was the dessert. My god the Kunefah made with cheese was the best dessert hands down. Not too sweet, right amount of crunch, and warm. I would have ordered another one had I not been so stuffed. Service- Marina was our waitress and she was delightful. She was very helpful and sweet. I have never had such good authentic service in a while. I must commend her. They also mentioned they do parties which is a great plus.",5.0

"This is place is  great!First off, the ambience is a cant beat. The bay is right across the street. And of course their outdoor seating is a must. But the interior is also wonderfully decorated. Food was really good. Authentic Turkish food. Went with a family of 4. We got the ground meat borek which was heavenly. Lentil soup was good. Te turkish dumplings were good but not great. My only complaint would be that the food was just a tad bit bland. But  The lamb shank however was cooked to perfection right down to the sauce. It was a beautiful display and tasted even better. The Best Part was the dessert. My god the Kunefah made with cheese was the best dessert hands down. Not too sweet, right amount of crunch, and warm. I would have ordered another one had I not been so stuffed. Service- Marina was our waitress and she was delightful. She was very helpful and sweet. I have never had such good authentic service in a while. I must commend her. They also mentioned they do parties which is a great plus.",5.0
"Opera's renovation is beautiful, and the food is, as always, very tasty. The menu has a great selection of Turkish foods as well as others, the Kumpir is delicious, and I had a great fruit plate.Gurkan was our waiter, and he was attentive and friendly, as always. He is a great server. You won't be disappointed at Opera.You won't be disappointed",5.0
"Opera really is a great hang out place for a casual night. The decor is gorgeuos , food is amazing and pricing is very affordable. To be fair at this point, I used to work there before. Really would recommend this place to anybody. The waiters are generally friendly and competent, with some minor glitches here and there.",4.0
Opera cafe is most nice restaurant in sheepshead bay right now I am enjoying fresh brewed coffee in front of the bay view such moment place is freaking huge you can find sit even busy weekends on emmons Ave I think opera cafe is will be more popular in Brooklyn one last word try their omlet you will really enjoy it,4.0
"Just beautiful !!! Amazing service delicious food and incredible ambiance! Brunch in the outdoor area was lovely, and the walk to the bathroom uncovered the breath taking, extraordinarily designed indoor area! Extremely reasonable prices for their hearty portions!!",5.0
"I love this place! I have been here a lot of times! When I say, a lot, I mean a lot...to the point the waiters know me as ""That girl who never orders coffee but would order Gazoz"" The first time I was here is when it was my birthday breakfast, the breakfast menu has all types of yummy things! And if you are celebrating a birthday here, they put on the birthday song! (but its awkward they charge you for the slice of cake the candle goes on). This place is great if its 8:00pm and you and your family want dessert and reserve for 10 people on a Friday, they always have tables!The lamb shank is amazing, the same size as a baby. The boureks and cigars are my favorite!!Bottom Line: This place is great, amazing service, amazing food..what else do you need?P.S-Its pronounced O'Pera, not Opera. btw.",5.0
"The place is new and wonderfully decorated. The service was friendly and helpful, although I must say that it seemed as if there were too many of them and they were just getting into one another's way. The calamari was delicious and not overly fried. My friend got the penne a la vodka and I got a dish with lamb that the waiter recommended. It's not that the food wasn't good, it just didn't do it for me. Won't be going out of my way to come back.",3.0

"It's pretty laid back, but yet has a few ""fancy"" patrons. It's great that they pretty much serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Yet, the menu is not huge, but has all the necessities of each meal. The turkish treats savory and sweet were all delicious. They also have a limited selection of beers and wines if that's what you have with your meals. Whoever came up with a baked potato with a salad on top is a genius! For appetizers, we shared the cheese rolls, the turkish panini with potatos (gozleme) which was delicate and tasty, and a plate of hummus which was gone before you can say yum, with the side of bread that is given in generous portions. The lamb shank was falling off the bone and right into the mouths. Did I mention the baked potato?While we were seated at a table for 4 near the window, I saw a bunch of cushiony, loungy sitting options for bigger groups. Will have to test my bum there next time. The option of sitting outside in nicer weathers is definitely a huge plus, considering the location and the view of the bay, boats and swans.",4.0
Lets just say I haven't tried anything off the menu that I didn't absolutely find delicious.Service is great AS LONG as you're sitting inside or directly outside in the front.They are expanding and the service in the outside back is ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. It seems like the waiters and bus boys completely forgot they expanded and the section even exists. They came around ONCE in my 45 minutes of sitting there and by then I no longer wanted anything else.BUT DESPITE THIS. I only took a star off because they are going through changes and I'm sure they will RECTIFY this issue by either hiring more staff or training the staff to be more attentive of the outside back section.ENJOY THE DELICIOUS FOOD !,4.0
"A great restaurant to celebrate a special occasion or just come by with some friends and enjoy. They offer a variety of foods which all taste great, among my favorites are the baked potato, gozlame, shepherd salad, and the lava cake.

This place is really excellent. Their place is clean and staff is very nice and helpful.Honestly their food is great everything looks like its fresh and clean.

"I heard the menu was updated so was looking forward to see what the new menu items were. Unfortunately, it was the same menu as before but there are still several dishes I've been meaning to try so it wasn't a problem. I had the fried calf's liver for my appetizer. I was so hungry that by the time I realized I had forgotten to take a picture I had finished it. Anyway, it was nicely seasoned and not greasy and of course very, very good. For my main course I had the Lamb Sauté which was good but not as good as the Lamb Shank in my opinion. Still, it had some good flavors. Will be back for sure to try some more new dishes!!!",4.0
"When it comes to this place, I'm left speechless each & every time! No words to describe how amazingly delicious the food is. Most of the waiters in there are beyond friendly. The wait can take a bit sometimes but people need to understand that this place is busy/super crowded from the hour that it opens to the last hour *2am* which is when they close the kitchen. They're clearly making everything fresh so cut some slack unless you want your food cooked poorly or have other people's leftovers stop b*tch*ng & complaining! First time I bring my boyfriend here, he was obsessed with the place & wanted to go every weekend meanwhile he lives all the way out in Middle Village, Queens but it's just that worthy to come here no matter how long the drive is or how packed the belt parkway is. Definitely the BEST restaurant I've ever been to ;) I give this restaurant a 100 star ratingEverything about this place from their food, drinks to the place itself, their gorgeous bathrooms & cleanliness is outstanding without a doubt & f*#% those who think otherwise.",5.0
"Went back today, 5/6/14, to see if they got their beer thing together since my last review on 4/30/14. We went there for dinner, around 5ish, and were seated right away, good job, that was when the problems started. Even though we had our menus when we sat down, chose our meals and closed our menus, no one came near us for 9 minutes, yes I timed it. That means multiple servers went back and forth seeing 2 people, sitting right up front, not even given their first glass of water, and didn't have the sense to say ""I'll get your server"" or ""Would you like some water?"", which we never had to ask for before. Bear in mind there were only 12 people in the place, yes I counted, and 4 people outside in a place that holds probably 200. Finally, someone came over and gave us water and took our order, 9 minutes later which feels like an eternity when you're waiting. The bottled beer was cold, the food was good and the service was also, when they finally showed up, hence the 3 stars. But the wait after being seated and the inability for anyone to notice that, for so long, was just too much. I don't care how good the food is if they are going to treat you like some Manhattan bistro, where you should be honored to be there, they'll never get a dime from me, let them whack off the tourists. Plus they are expanding into 2 adjoining restaurants and I would say get your sh*t together here before you decide to duplicate it. If your wait time for a server is 9 minutes for 2 people in a restaurant with 16 that seats 200 then what will it be when you can seat 500? I'll give it one more shot then it's Masal Café or Istanbul.",3.0

Sheepshead Bay desperately needs brunch spots and I'm happy to say that Opera is a welcomed addition in the neighborhood. Rapid service & delicious food make for an excellent brunching experience. The place is made for large groups and accommodates large parties in booth style seating. Probably makes sense to make a reservation if you don't want to wait a long time.,4.0
"After their recent $1-3 hike in price on their most popular menu items, I'm hesitant to eat at this place again. Prices need to be reasonable with location, they were already more expensive than all other Turkish places in Brooklyn, now they increased their prices even more.. I hope this price increase benefits them, as for me they lost me as a customer. Manhattan prices at Brooklyn standards is a big no-no!",2.0
"Amazing food and amazing drinks. They serve the best Mai Tai's in NYC.  I live 3 blocks away so I come here pretty often.  The only thing they are missing for this area is outdoor hookah. I think that would bring this place more business. However, on the weekend this place is always packed at night.",4.0
Just ate there.  Very relaxing and spacious. Great food and great service.  Make reservations. Window seats are the best.  Big restaurant but not too noisy. Don't be shy to ask waiter about a dish!,4.0

"Came here last night on a double date in Brighton Beach.  I don't spend much time down in this area so I was extra curious about how the place stacked up against other locales in Brooklyn.  It exceeded my expectations by far - it was perfect to eat outside, drink and talk while feeling the breeze of the ocean.  The ambience inside is classy and elegant and feels somewhat exclusive.My date ordered a cheese borek for us as an appetizer (fried pastry filled with cheese and layered phyllo).  For my first time eating turkish food, it was pretty delicious.  I spent a little more time on the drink menu than the food menu, but the drink list was extensive.  They make an amazing Irish coffee!Would definitely return here and recommend for a relaxing night out with a group.",4.0

Its a nice big restaurant with prices that match the quality of food.The staff was very friendly and accommodated every need my group had, even when we got already got annoying (whoops). The portions are big and the food is pretty good. I'll definitely be going back.",5.0
"Comfortable chairs and in a good neighborhood, that's it. The food is nothing special. What MUST be mentioned is the TERRIBLE SERVICE AND RUDE WAITERS. They all seem like they hate their job and are literally mean to people. My ONE-YEAR OLD daughter held the menu just to play with it and the waiter said she can't, she must return it. They also seem drugged up.",2.0

"Large space that can fit two armies, drinks served in tall lemonade glasses, wait staff that pushes you to order a pricier version of everything.

We were there for a girls night out, so nothing could ruin our night, but the bill was rediculous and we will never go back or recommend to anyone we like.

"OPera Cafe is one of the newer additions to the flourishing expansion of Turkish eateries in Brooklyn. Housed on Emmons Avenue (second fiddle only to Brighton Beach Ave.), you know before walking in to expect a bevy of Russian women clad in colorful furs and the latest ""boutique"" interpretations of Lady Gaga evening wear, while the men, simply dressed, rest their hands on their rotund bellies and wallets. The place itself has a magnificent aura to it: a beautiful white slate wall with blueish lighting, dozens of Turkish lamps of varying colors glistening in the other wise dimly lit room, a view of the open kitchen-bar in the back, and seductive group booths done up in red and white ethnic prints on either side of the restaurant. The sexy Mediterranean ambiance transports you to a beachside lounge somewhere in Marmaris, Santorini, or even Ibiza. I was half-expecting to see beautiful bronzed women clad in summer's finest to pass by the window (it is December 28 and I'm in Brooklyn mind you). The only complaint, layout wise, I had with OPera is the bathroom situation. The bathrooms are awkwardly tucked in the back corner with the sink/waiting area exposed to the entire restaurant. It would be better that they partition if off a bit more so those of us in need of relief may do so without being gawked at. Moving on from bathroom blushing, our party, unfortunately, was too large for one of the more intimate group booths so we were seated at one of the long, rectangular tables instead. If you can, limit your party to 6 to get the booths because our table made it difficult, as is usually the case, to communicate with everyone and pass the food in a non-laborious manner. Two drinks recommendations before the food. For those of you who like an ""authentic"" experience, order a bottle of the Ayran, a salted yogurt drink. It pairs extremely well with the cuisine and has a delightful sour taste to it. A MUST was the Turkish blush wine! My mother ordered a glass and allowed me to try it. Incredibly crisp and tart, it had the perfect level of dryness for my taste. With pronounced notes of strawberries, this wine would be outstanding with anything on the menu or just savoring it alone. The restaurant's website, however, doesn't have a wine list available to view so I have to go back if only for that wine!As far as appetizers, we ordered hummus, baba ghanoush, fried calamari, liver cubes, and mussels in a white wine broth. The hummus was surprisingly decent; I usually hate almost everyone's versions of it at restaurants considering I make a damn good hummus at home. I preferred the baba, which had a nice smoked eggplant taste to it along with a not overly creamy texture. I would skip the calamari as they serve up more breading than squid here. The liver cubes were TO DIE FOR! I usually despise liver outside pâté, especially when fried. OPera's interpretation, however, was fried and seasoned to perfection, eliminating that traditionally overpowering offal taste. The mussels were a hit as well if only for the broth. Most of the shells ended up being empty so we had to go digging in the bowl to find the meat with our pide. My only problem with the dish was that there was no spoon served with it to be able to properly transfer it to our personal plates (a theme that was recurrent through the dessert course...). The real failures, in my opinion, came in the entree portion of our evening. I ordered the lamb shank thinking that the Turkish are masters at eliminating that signature lamb taste that I so thoroughly dislike when it is not cooked properly. I was wrong. I ended up leaving most of the shank as the taste was just too nauseating. Trying my brother's adana kebab, I much preferred it to my own though it was strange that it was served with what looked like a tortilla rather than lavash. I also tried the sauteed lamb which, while tasty, was too reminiscent of Uzbek lagman meat for me to think of it as anything special. The best dish, if you must come here for entrees, is the branzino fillets. Moist, succulent, and with a crispy skin, it definitely was the only star at the table. After being miserably disappointed by my dish, the desserts more than made up for my foodie depression. Go for the unbelievable künefe (cheese pastry soaked in honey), orgasmic stuffed figs, and Turkish custard! The one notable EXCEPTION that really turned me off of the entire meal was the Turkish coffee! This was supposed to be the ONE thing that a Turkish place can't screw up and they managed to. I can't even say what I drank was a Turkish coffee but, rather, brown toilet water. It was horrid. Avoid at all costs! Final verdict: sexy date spot for a night complete with wine, a few appetizers, and definitely some sweets. If you're looking for more than that in the way of Turkish cuisine, look elsewhere.",3.0

"This was out third time to Opera Cafe.  The food has always been pretty good and the service was tolerable.  However, our last visit there on Saturday (10/05/2013) will definitely be a memorable one and not for all the good reasons.  First, a few days prior, I have made a reservation for a small group of 4 people.  The day before they even called to confirm our reservation, wow! Awesome, we'll be there!  So when we get there, I inform the hostess of our reservation and they direct us to the last table by the kitchen.... really?  this is why I made the reservation? To get a crappy table in the back, next to the cake display, waiter station and the perfect view of the pathway to the bathroom?  Ok, fine. I was irritated but still determined to have a good evening.  After three different waiters came to our table... one to bring a menu, another one to ask if we are ready to order and then the third one appeared to take our order.  I must say Nataliya (out waitress) was rude from the start.  She didn't want to give us a moment to place an order or to provide any recommendation on the drinks and she didn't know much about the food.  We couldn't even ask her a question before she disappeared again and reappeared 15 minutes later to take our order.  Finely the appetizers have arrived.  The Opera salad and calamari were delicious as always.  About 5 or 7 minutes into enjoying our appetizers, we see 3 waiters hurrying to our table with our entrees! WTF?  We just started eating our appetizers!  Can we at least eat without you taking our food away and putting our entrees in front of us?  I have informed Nataliya that we just began eating our appetizers and could they please take the entrees back to the kitchen and keep them warm for 10 or 15 minutes?  Her response was: EYE ROLL.... ""The kitchen is too busy, if I told them to space it out, you'd have to wait for a long time to get your food!"" Look, I do not care how inefficient your cooks are and how mismanaged your restaurant is.  It is not my problem.  One, I shouldn't have to feel hurried to be eating my food, I shouldn't have to eat my appetizer while looking at my entree getting cold and as a paying customer, I sure as hell should not have to deal with some rude waitress.  Okay... and it didn't end there!!!  Things just went from BAD to WORSE!  The young couple sitting next to us have ordered their drinks and two salads, The Ceasar Shrimp and Ceasar Chicken salad, well... 5 minutes into it.... the girl freaked out.... there was a damn ROACH in her salad!  It was disgusting!  I do not know how they kept their cool as they had to wait for the waitress for a while to at least come and take it away or endure the fact that staff just completely ignored them or the simple fact that they had to wait for the manager to come to their table to ""remedy"" the situation.... meanwhile the idiot staff kept bringing them more food which they had previous ordered.  I mean, doesn't anyone communicate in that place?  Do you people really think that after founding a roach in their food, they would really want to give it another try? Well, finally the manager came and apologized.... DUH... the least he could have done.  In all, our experience was simply awful.  There are so many great restaurants in that area and we will definitely be taking our money to more deserving establishments.",1.0

"I've been here a few times and this place is really not here not there for me. It's bland, mediocre and way over hyped. I do however love the Turkish Delight apple tea, it's just powder in hot water except they either put too much or not enough so I usually ask for the powder in the side and I do it myself. They're food, like I said, is so-so, nothing to go crazy about but it's not awful. I do have an issue with the chocolate soufflé, they don't serve it the traditional (and universally preferred) way, what they do it's flip it upside down and slap it onto your plate and throw in a pea sized ball of ice cream, it's disappointing. If you want to go sit somewhere for a bit with a pleasant atmosphere and you're not too concerned with food, this is your place. Also the waiters typically don't care about you here, so don't expect anything short of waiting and growing impatient.",3.0
Good ambiance with amazing food. I really love to come out here after work and grab cup of turkish coffee.,5.0
"This was out third time to Opera Cafe.  The food has always been pretty good and the service was tolerable.  However, our last visit there on Saturday (10/05/2013) will definitely be a memorable one and not for all the good reasons.  First, a few days prior, I have made a reservation for a small group of 4 people.  The day before they even called to confirm our reservation, wow! Awesome, we'll be there!  So when we get there, I inform the hostess of our reservation and they direct us to the last table by the kitchen.... really?  this is why I made the reservation? To get a crappy table in the back, next to the cake display, waiter station and the perfect view of the pathway to the bathroom?  Ok, fine. I was irritated but still determined to have a good evening.  After three different waiters came to our table... one to bring a menu, another one to ask if we are ready to order and then the third one appeared to take our order.  I must say Nataliya (out waitress) was rude from the start.  She didn't want to give us a moment to place an order or to provide any recommendation on the drinks and she didn't know much about the food.  We couldn't even ask her a question before she disappeared again and reappeared 15 minutes later to take our order.  Finely the appetizers have arrived.  The Opera salad and calamari were delicious as always.  About 5 or 7 minutes into enjoying our appetizers, we see 3 waiters hurrying to our table with our entrees! WTF?  We just started eating our appetizers!  Can we at least eat without you taking our food away and putting our entrees in front of us?  I have informed Nataliya that we just began eating our appetizers and could they please take the entrees back to the kitchen and keep them warm for 10 or 15 minutes?  Her response was: EYE ROLL.... ""The kitchen is too busy, if I told them to space it out, you'd have to wait for a long time to get your food!"" Look, I do not care how inefficient your cooks are and how mismanaged your restaurant is.  It is not my problem.  One, I shouldn't have to feel hurried to be eating my food, I shouldn't have to eat my appetizer while looking at my entree getting cold and as a paying customer, I sure as hell should not have to deal with some rude waitress.  Okay... and it didn't end there!!!  Things just went from BAD to WORSE!  The young couple sitting next to us have ordered their drinks and two salads, The Ceasar Shrimp and Ceasar Chicken salad, well... 5 minutes into it.... the girl freaked out.... there was a damn ROACH in her salad!  It was disgusting!  I do not know how they kept their cool as they had to wait for the waitress for a while to at least come and take it away or endure the fact that staff just completely ignored them or the simple fact that they had to wait for the manager to come to their table to ""remedy"" the situation.... meanwhile the idiot staff kept bringing them more food which they had previous ordered.  I mean, doesn't anyone communicate in that place?  Do you people really think that after founding a roach in their food, they would really want to give it another try? Well, finally the manager came and apologized.... DUH... the least he could have done.  In all, our experience was simply awful.  There are so many great restaurants in that area and we will definitely be taking our money to more deserving establishments.",1.0

"The club type music is a distraction. Perfect for a late Fri or Sat but not a casual Thurs dinner. I enjoyed the appetizers and my meal, which was the beef shish and was plenty.

"What do you get when two knowledgeable Turkish cousins take over a Turkish restaurant and a Medical Building on the canal in Sheepshead Bay and gut the whole thing? Well at least this time you get a hybrid of an authentic Turkish cafe and lounge that also offers some traditional American entrees such as pancakes, croissants, baked stuffed potatoes, buffalo wings and chicken nuggets on the kids menu.  The restaurant itself is spacious and exquisitely decorated with furniture and furnishings imported from Turkey. You have a choice of sitting in booths or at tables with comfortable cushioned chairs. The atmosphere is quite middle eastern...comfortable and welcoming.I was fortunate to visit Opera today with one of my Turkish friends who knew just what to order....though too much of it!  We began with a very fresh Coban Salad (also known as shepherd or Israeli salad by many).  We then split a cheese and a meat Gozlemeler which are like a panini lavash. And finally we had one of the house specialties, Inegol Kopte which are cigar shaped ground lamb served with Turkish beans. Oh I should also mention that they serve you warm Turkish bread that is quite delicious.The menu contains many traditional Turkish specialties such as Simit (Turkish style sesame seed bagels), boreks, and kebabs but i was told that their best seller so far has been the Lamb Shank.The service staff seems to still be in the learning mode but the owners are there to be sure things run smoothly. Prices are average for the area.  So my recommendation is that you head to Sheepshead Bay this summer before this new restaurant becomes better known and develops long waits to get in!UPDATE: Post Sandy the restaurant was rebuilt even nicer, the food is excellent (try the grilled chicken salad) and the service has improved dramatically!",5.0
"After several more visits, I felt the need to update.  The food is stoll quite good, the service is much better, and I believe they swapped the chairs because I don't have that weird sitting thing anymore.  Sadly the rice is still not so good, and the bar service is hit or miss.  But all in all, they deserve an extra star.  Oh, and the take out is pretty quick too!",4.0

It goes along great with any of the desserts on the menu.After our meals were served, one of the owners came over personally to ask  us how everything was and if everything was to our liking.

"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! ONE STAR IS TOO MANY.We live in Park Slope (where there are many wonderful restaurants).  My son had a baseball game right in the area so we looked up and found this place.  We went in (with our babysitter, who lives with us and was at the game too) and it seemed lively and we were excited to try a new place.  The cold mixed appetizer was fine. Then came the main dishes and my chicken shish had A HOT PEPPER ON THE PLATE that was the hottest thing I had ever tasted in my entire life, no hyperbole. It burned my tongue so badly it was painful.  However, I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.  I told the waiters and two of them expressed doubt that nobody told me about the pepper. I did not think anything of it and we kept eating.  We ignored the fact that my son ordered a soda twice and never received it.  Then, when we were nearing the end of the meal, my son took a sip of water from his water glass and THE GLASS SHATTERED IN HIS HANDS AND COULD HAVE REALLY INJURED HIM.  He was taken aback and a bit frightened that he swallowed glass so I called over the waiter, who came over WITH NO APOLOGY.  I told them that I would not be paying for the meal and they said they would get a manager. After WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES, a man came over and not only was he UNAPOLOGETIC, he told us we would have to wait there, for what I don't know. TEN MORE MINUTES LATER, I went up to the back of the restaurant where that same man was.  He said YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT. I said ""I am waiting one more minute and then I am leaving"".

"Just came from lunch at this new Turkish cafe and boy was I pleasantly surprised by the food, the ambiance and the service! Food is very moderately priced, a must try! We indulged in the shepards salad, avocado salad and chicken kabobs served  with Turkish rice. This cafe will be around for quite awhile and a great addition to Sheepshead Bay!!",4.0
"Brunch was good. Dinner was not! Muscles had no flavor, oily, half were empty or not open. My mom got the lamb sauté, it was gross, very gamey, tasted like gnawing on leather. I would steer clear of this place besides brunch. The brunch was good! Shared the app plate with a friend of mine with a cheese omelette. Plenty of food! Shared a pot of tea as well. All and all the brunch was good but dinner disappointed. Too bad, consistency is key with me.",2.0
"I wish I knew about this place earlier. It's almost odd to have the same cafe lounge across the ammons ave from one to another.For some reason , Opera Cafe Lounge  was crowded each time I passed by this place i was there on Monday the food was delicious if you come this place definitely try lamb shank  ....",5.0
"When it's new, it's always good. Went there twice . Loved the lunch over there. The dinner was okay.",4.0
"Came here for dinner and really enjoyed it, price wise it is not expensive and the food is pretty good. None of the food is out of the ordinary, but it tastes really good! They have delicious Babaganush! The Humus was not great, Pera Salad with Chicken was really good as well, the kunafe and the tiramisu were pretty good. If you are in the area and want to check out a very  laid back not too pricey place Come here, its very spacey so groups are welcomed.",4.0
Breakfast of scrambled eggs and cheese toast. Yum. Service very good. Coffee very good. Clean bathrooms a welcome plus. Beautiful interior. I'm intending to return to check out dinner!,4.0
"I would give 10 stars if possible for wait staff honesty and for being very accommodating!Been here on numerous occasions and food is always yummy and fresh. They are busy, but always able to accommodate. Very kid friendly, cartoons are playing on TV during brunch.We were there for Mother's Day, and my husband dropped a $100 bill by the table and only realized when got home. He called right away and the hostess said it was found and that we can pick it up! How amazing is that?!?! They were not sure who found it exactly, but thank you for being so honest! Plus the food was delicious!",5.0
Best breakfast ever! Sausages a must. Creeps as well. Highly recommended,5.0
"Love Pera. Very delicious, modern, clean and authentic. The menu is great and so was everything I ate. Great service. I would just suggest getting pillows to place on their not so comfy chairs and couches",5.0
"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! ONE STAR IS TOO MANY.We live in Park Slope (where there are many wonderful restaurants).  My son had a baseball game right in the area so we looked up and found this place.  We went in (with our babysitter, who lives with us and was at the game too) and it seemed lively and we were excited to try a new place.  The cold mixed appetizer was fine. Then came the main dishes and my chicken shish had A HOT PEPPER ON THE PLATE that was the hottest thing I had ever tasted in my entire life, no hyperbole. It burned my tongue so badly it was painful.  However, I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.  I told the waiters and two of them expressed doubt that nobody told me about the pepper. I did not think anything of it and we kept eating.  We ignored the fact that my son ordered a soda twice and never received it.  Then, when we were nearing the end of the meal, my son took a sip of water from his water glass and THE GLASS SHATTERED IN HIS HANDS AND COULD HAVE REALLY INJURED HIM.  He was taken aback and a bit frightened that he swallowed glass so I called over the waiter, who came over WITH NO APOLOGY.  I told them that I would not be paying for the meal and they said they would get a manager. After WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES, a man came over and not only was he UNAPOLOGETIC, he told us we would have to wait there, for what I don't know. TEN MORE MINUTES LATER, I went up to the back of the restaurant where that same man was.  He said YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT. I said ""I am waiting one more minute and then I am leaving"". HE YELLED, ""YOU CAME HERE LOOKING FOR A FREE MEAL"" as if we were some kind of thieves. He really believed that I fabricated that nobody told me about the pepper and we somehow shattered the glass.  THERE WAS NO WATER SPILLED ON THE TABLE AND THE SHATTERED PART WAS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS, STILL WITH WATER IN IT,  EVIDENCING THAT IT WAS NOT DROPPED BY US, BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO LOOK AT IT (WE TOOK PHOTOS).  I would never mention if it was not relevant, but I went in to pay with my Platinum Amex card.

For the price the food should be better. The food is ok but lacks flavor they don't add a lot of spices or anything to make you go wow. Plus that the doors are open and you can see the bay,2.0
"Service is always great, lots of staff running around, very attentive. Food is very tasty traditional turkish, Huge portions. Very clean restaurant. Out of all turkish restaurants in this area this one is for sure the best!",5.0
"i like this place its a more upscale ""masal"" . really nice atmosphere food is good even thought some portions are more expensive . but overall good place to have dinner very soothing and pretty decor",4.0
"Ill be short, Food is good, service is ok, too many people for too little waiters. Some stuff don't make sense like charging extra 2$ for cheese on the side but putting cheese in the course is free. I think management needs to get it straight that charging money for extra cheese on the side is not worth loosing a loyal costumer. Haven't been there after that happened. Waiters are very friendly so that's a huge plus for the place.",4.0
"What a wonderful treat!  Hubby & I stopped in Sheepshead Bay on the way to visit a friend in Brooklyn.  Since all the Yelp (and Trip Advisor) reviews were so good, we decided to try Opera Cafe.  The food is absolutely delicious!  I had the BEST chicken-ka-bobs and hubby had Lamb shank.  Everything is fresh; the place (although a bit noisy).  Where's the music?????  Great location, terrific meal.",4.0
"Went there few days ago...But never got to eat the food. I was with my boyfriend and the place was packed, so the hostess asked us to wait 25 minutes, which was totally fine (at this point, I was still smiling and having a good day). We sat on a bench and enjoyed the view for 20 minutes then we came back to the restaurant. And that's when Opera received my 1 star review. The hostess was upset or something, but she clearly made her customers notice that she was a rude person. We gave her our name, and she looked at us as we were stupid and said ""Well duuuuh your table is taken you should have been there to look out for it"" Hmm You're kidding right ?  ... As we stayed there, shocked, she totally ignored us and gave a table to the two people behind us who had just arrived. So that's my experience at opera. Food must be good, since all of those good reviews. But seriously, one advice, if it's pack and we ask you to wait, get the hell out of here because you will wait for nothing. If I had ran this place, that hostess would have been fired, and hired again just to be fired a second time.",1.0
"This place is new, and is a great addition to the neighborhood.  The ambiance and decor are really nice.  The seating is really cool, with chairs that are like living room chairs and sofas.  It's something you'd see in the city.  The food is really good; delicious and fresh.  The service isn't the greatest, but I can deal with that.  The prices are pretty good, especially for the area. Will definitely be going back.",5.0
