"Their chicken is the BEST.It's a small shop, located on the corner of St. Marks Ave and 6ave, in Park Slope. I came here with a friend because we heard they make chicken pot pie and other chicken dishes, and we absolutely had to try. We got their chicken burger, chicken wrap and handheld chicken pot pie.Their chicken burger was delish; juicy chicken with lettuce and tomato, sitting on top of the fluffiest buns you've ever had. That burger was excellent. The chicken wrap was also great; tender, cooked-to-perfection chicken breast, sitting on a bed of sauteed cabbage, tomato and onions. Then, the main reason why we came: the chicken pot pie. So yummy, so moist, sooo good. The pot pie is in a huge, flaky, baked empanada-like crust. It looks like a triangular empanada. The inside is moist, tender and super hot. It was worth it just to make the trip all the way here. The shop itself is small, bright on the outside, dim on the inside. The staff is friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is casual and cozy. Overall, I had a great experience here and would visit again.",5.0
"First time I came here I had the chicken soup and the jalapeño Mac and cheese. Happiness in my mouth. It was a rainy day, I had a could and I couldn't have made a better choice. The service was fast and the staff was attentive and answered my unnecessarily high amount of questions. They also let me linger as long as I wanted, which I always appreciate as I didn't really want to go home. I was about to head home and decided I wanted dessert and they only had the brownies, but WOW. Those brownies man, so on point. I left happy and decided to come back. Second, revised review. No change this time. The staff is still sweet and when I chose the wrong drink from the fridge, she simply told me to throw it away and grab another. It's small touches like that that make me love a place. This time I had soup again, but with a side of fries. And once again I was not disappointed. You'll enjoy yourselves guys. Come on through. As always... Happy eating. -Marie-Madeleine.",5.0
"I usually take the bird to go, with a side dish. It's a small but very tasty bird. Perfect for two, just add a side. Whole bird is $18 and a side is $7. They just need 15 minutes to prepare it so I am sure they pre-cook it and then when you order it they just ""finish"" it on the grill. The bird has tiny drumsticks, it's cute. I am a drumstick lover so I would need 8 of those to feel satisfied :)With the whole bird you get 0ne sauce free, otherwise each sauce costs $1. I had the Chipotle creamy sauce and it was good.PurBird is our favorite place when we are out doing things around and want a good chicken meal to bring home. I would love to have it delivered but unfortunately we are a few too blocks away.",4.0
"I came here for lunch with a friend. We ordered at the counter and they brought our food to the table for us. I really liked that the chicken here was antibiotic and hormone free, and grass fed. My friend and I got jalapeño Mac and cheese to share. It was delicious! My friend had half a chicken, with mashed potatoes, and corn, which was the special of the day. Everything tasted great. The vegetables and the chicken had so much flavor. I ordered a chopped salad with grilled chicken. My grilled chicken had so much flavor and it was really great. We also had two glasses of wine. The good here was great! I can't wait to return!",4.0
"Very solid grilled chicken entrees. My chopped salad with grilled chicken thigh was great with plenty of beets, feta, juicy marinated thigh, and tomatoes in a vinaigrette. The Caesar with olive oil and Parmesan is solid as well. The grilled chicken sandwich is also very good with juicy chicken on a bun slathered with mayo and topped with LTO. I loved the sweet potato fries which are not as greasy as the standard versions and the chicken noodle soup which is cream based and made with plenty of tender slow-roasted chicken and farfalle pasta. You order at the counter and it is fast casual but the food is very good. Prices are okay - it came to about $40 for 2 orders of fries, salad, chicken thigh, soup, and sandwich.",4.0
"Bookmarked this after reading all the great reviews and it did not disappoint. The food tastes like you made it yourself in your own kitchen. I tried it and then had it three days straight. It is a little pricey but definitely worth it. The Mac and cheese is out of this world, you have to give it a try. The side portions are big enough to share, which is great because you'll most likely have leftovers.",5.0
Really loved this place. Their chicken with the purbird sauce is dynamite. Bread that they give with the food is also dynamite. Creamy spinach was too creamy for my taste but their rotating vegetable of the day cauliflower option was quite good. Lots of people ordered the mac and cheese so I might have to try that next time.,5.0
"Came at 1pm on a saturday. The place is a grab and go and/or buy and sit yourself type restaurant. The space is fairly small so i would advise against going with a large group unless you're super lucky like me :) we managed to snatch the large communal table in the back corner for the 5 of us. The food takes about 10-15min to prep because they make everything to order. I just came from the gym and was craving for carbs so i went with the Chicken Pie and couldn't pass up the Jalapeno mac and cheese; which was AWESOME. Not too spicy; just enough heat to keep wanting more. The portion of the mac and cheese is definitely sharing size (though you may not want to) The chicken pie is fairly small; I would order that again but maybe as a side to share. My friends had the lunch special which came with their chicken, string beans, a potato side (mashed), and bread. I highly reco this if you have the time to sit and dine in. It's a pretty big serving, and the empty plates suggest that it tasted good too. Looks pretty healthy as well.With the high protein healthy options and reasonable prices; I wouldn't mind making this a routine meal after the gym :D",4.0

"I was pretty unimpressed with the sandwiches/wraps during my first visit. They were pretty dry, which was disappointing for a place that specializes in chicken. THEN I started ordering the roast chicken with Purbird sauce (tangy + sweet) and jalapeño mac n' cheese, and now I'm a fan. It's really juicy and crispy on the outside. Food can take a while to come out (15-20 minutes), however.Purbird is simple, healthy-ish fare. Good to have it in the neighborhood, but not worth traveling for. Oh, and the chicken noodle soup here is really great when you have the cold/flu.",4.0
"I have stopped here multiple times for a quick bite or to get something to go. The people behind the counter are very welcoming and attentive. You order at the counter and they will bring the food to your table but you have to get the utensils and cups and the tap water bottle. I have tried the chicken pie, jalapeno mac & cheese, chicken wrap, and they are good but I really like the chicken burger with cheese !",5.0
"This place KNOWS chicken and they truly deliver on that. My husband and I had a chance to chat with the owner, who was incredibly kind and spunky. I had the house salad wrap with mac & cheese and my husband had the 1/2 chicken platter with fries, purbird sauce, and sauteed spinach. We didn't speak much while we were eating because it was that dang good. After extra napkins and many happy sighs, a nice walk around Prospect Park was in order. This is a fantastic place to come for a damn good meal, and especially on a date because it's on the small side indoors.",5.0
"Came here with a friend while visiting New York and it was a good choice! We got the chicken thigh wrap, chicken sandwich, and the jalapeno mac and cheese. It was all really delicious!

Also the location is nice it's just a teeeennnyyy bit cramped, but it wasn't too bad.",4.0
"Purbird is my kind of place for comfort food. This place is all about simple and tasty chicken dishes. We ordered the Chicken Breast Sandwich. It is a Grilled Chicken Breast with avocado, turkey bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo on a toasted roll. A simple and delicious chicken sandwich. The chicken was moist and juicy. Flavorful.  We also had the Chicken Burger. House Ground Dark and White Chicken Meat with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and special sauce. Again..simple...tasty...moist..juicy..enjoyable. I would eat this chicken burger over any meat burger any day. For side dishes, we ordered the Sweet Potato Fries. These were great sweet potato fries. Crispy on the outside. Soft on the inside. It was not oily at all. Sweet and it was made right. The Mashed Sweet Potato was even better than the Sweet Potato Fries. Very smooth, creamy, sweet, and amazingly delicious. I would sink my teeth into this everyday. I loved it. I should have licked the bowl. Our last side dish we ordered was the Jalapeno Mac & Cheese. 3 cheese mixed with jalapeno. This is a good mac & cheese. You get a good delicious cheesy bite with a little bit of heat. The mac & cheese had the right amount of heat, but it did not over power the cheese. It was oozing cheese and it was creamy. This meal was simple, comforting, amazing, and delicious. Nothing fancy about the food. Nothing that will wow when you look at. It will Wow you when you taste the deliciousness of the food. Fantastic small, cozy place to grab lunch or dinner.",5.0
"Dropped by for lunch with my partner. We ordered the 1/2 chicken lunch special with green beans, fries and mac & cheese as sides.  The chicken was moist, flavorful and most of the fat had been rendered during grilling so the skin was crispy.  Of all the sides the Mac and cheese was our favorite.  It reminded me of the stove top Mac and cheese I make at home the sauce was loose and had a strong cheese flavor it went perfectly with our string beans which still had snap to them.  Fries were fresh cut which I always appreciate.  Service was excellent.",4.0

But definitely try it with the fries! We also ordered the mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were somewhat soggy and I wished they were crispier!

"This is more of 2.5 stars.  Came here out of curiosity, as it seems to have good reviews on Yelp.There's actually nothing that special at Purbird...it's not bad food, but it's not special either, and given that this is the Park Slope area, you can find some really excellent food in the neighborhood.The chicken itself is what you should try if you ever come here.  It's pretty good and juicy, but pricy for what you get and it's not exactly all that special (something one could easily cook at home). When we got it, there was also pools of grease on it.  If I made this at home I would at least pat it down or drain that after cooking, prior to plating.  But it was still good.  Aside from the chicken, the other food is where it really gets pricy for what you get.  Jalapeno mac and cheese was alright but I felt a little ripped off because again, you can get amazing mac and cheese in this neighborhood and Purbird isn't one of those places.  It's somewhere between what you could get at a restaurant and what you can get from a box from the grocery.  No yummy crust on this mac and cheese.   You could even call it under-seasoned.  I would not order it again; not impressed.The fries were in the same boat...nothing special, and possibly the most expensive thing I ordered for the flavor you get.  Well, I had to try it at least once!To sum up, the chicken is the only thing worth trying, but even then I don't think it's special enough to warrant another visit. It is, however, the sole reason my review has 3 stars.I also deduct a star for the bad service.  After ordering, they got our order wrong by giving us a second plate of chicken (also with pools of grease/oil on top of it) instead of the fries.  It took them a long while to correct the mistake, we were nearly done eating our other 2 dishes during this time.I don't really get this place.  People post rave reviews for something not that special, and stuff you can cook at home in 20min...which is roughly how long it took for them to prepare our food.  It's alright to rate something 3 stars when it's mediocre, not everything is THE BEST EVER or THE WORST EVER, ya know?",3.0
"When a good friend of mine moved into the Park Slope area a few months back, it didn't take long for us to finalize a date to help her explore her new stomping grounds. Brooklyn is one of my least traversed territories, and although we ran into inevitable train delays and reroutings on the planned weekend afternoon, all of us managed to arrive at Purbird with our appetites in tow.Purbird is a neighborhood spot, even at first glance. It's not large by any means, and consists of a handful of tables and counter seats for guests; all drinks are self-serve (including the bottles of tap water that are kept in the refrigerator), as are the bins holding plastic utensils and condiment dispensers. After we'd settled in at a table and gotten a few cups of water, we headed towards the counter to make our orders. Purbird's menu is relatively compact, focusing on the pedestrian chicken, offered in iterations of sandwiches, salads, burgers, and grilled plates. Our group decided on two sides to share and ordered our own mains.I suppose I'll get my complaints out of the way first. The Chicken Burger I ordered was one of the least impressive ""burgers"" I've yet to try. Chicken is typically not used in patties a good reason, given that it's such a sinewy and dry protein to begin with, and Purbird's version was a perfect example of this. The cheese wasn't melted, much less warmed, and the sheer voluminousness of the airy brioche buns was almost comical in contrast to the actual petite size of the burger. Much more satisfying were the two sides that the three of us shared; the fries were well-portioned, crispy, and had just the right chew and the Jalapeno Mac and Cheese quite possibly might be the best thing on Purbird's menu. The macaroni is cooked to the right al dente, doused (in the best way possible) in melted cheese mixed with slice jalapenos, and baked so that it achieves a hint of a crust just before serving. Needless to say, it disappeared quite quickly from the table...In hindsight, I'm a little disappointed to note that the protein which the restaurant is named after wasn't done to justice at Purbird, but at the very least, the Mac and Cheese certainly made the journey into Brooklyn worthwhile.",3.0

The chicken is good - don't get me wrong - but the jalapeño mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach are sexual. Really, my choice adjective. They don't seem expensive but they accidentally are.

"Comfort Haven.  Another Father's Day lunch was taken here and my old man thoroughly enjoyed it.  He also liked the touch of freebie pamphlets that detailed things to do in the city and little outings.We shared a spread of grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, romaine salad, french fries, steamed veggies, and 2 specialty soda pops sold at the venue.  Everything tasted fresh - the chicken was moist and flavorful throughout, salad didn't taste like they emptied a bag of ""pre-washed"" nonsense and said mmm, throw some dressing and you'll be fine.

"I LOVE Purbird. I crave Purbird. I make special trips just to go to Purbird. I've eaten here many times between August 2012 and March 2014, and the food is always consistent.

"It's not often that I venture into Park Slope; too many odd experiences from my 20s cause me to avoid this neighborhood like the Plague. Haaa. However, who am I to resist the call of good food?Triple Trouble (read: Lori L, Hilary P., and myself) decided to hit up Purbird one Saturday afternoon for some lunch. What I pictured in my head did not match up with what I actually saw. I was picturing more of a sit-down BBQ-esque place. Instead, it was a smaller place, catering more of take-out orders, but there were ample seats for people to sit and enjoy their meals cooked to order. We snagged a table at the front, grabbed a bottle of complimentary cold water from the fridge, and placed our orders at the counter. In the midst of getting over a nasty November head cold, the chicken soup tempted me the most. I was blessed with a bowl of soup that was absolutely luscious and silky; the broth, their lemon egg chicken broth, was almost gravy-like in smoothness, the broth coating the back of my spoon. The chicken reminded me of my father's homemade chicken soups; the chicken was pulled straight off of the bird, with bits of brown meat and chicken skin still attached to random pieces. The farfalle pasta and bright orange carrots were cooked perfectly. After a few days of being congested, I was able to breathe through my nose for the first time in days by the time I was finished. (All praise the miracle that is Chicken Noodle Soup!) My compadres and I split an order of jalapeño mac & cheese. Creamy, but I prefer a sharper tang to my mac & cheese. Lord knows that the jalapeños were strong though. Phew! The French fries were extremely on point, everything you'd want a quintessential French fry to be: crispy, greasy, tender, earthy, and salty.

"I have a confession. Purbird is branded into my memory because of their amazing side dishes. The chicken is good - don't get me wrong - but the jalapeño mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach are sexual. Really, my choice adjective. They don't seem expensive but they accidentally are. I got a beet/chickpea salad with a side of chicken breast (+$5), and that shit cost me $17. What? The salad was good, but not 17 dollas good.",4.0

"Really tasty chicken at a cozy little spot.We came here to grab a late lunch after a show at Barclays. We ordered a chicken breast sandwich, chicken pie, and jalapeno mac n' cheese. Service was super friendly and very patient, as we took a little time to decide what we wanted. The chicken sandwich was simple, with chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, mayo, turkey bacon, but very satisfying. I really liked the flakiness of the chicken pie and the amount of creamy chicken filling was just right. The mac n' cheese had great texture on the noodles and a nice spicy kick. The cheese was slightly less impressive, as the top of the noodles are covered in a nice thick melted cheese topping but not much cheese underneath. Still, we enjoyed everything and ate every crumb.

"Chicken is probably one of more difficult meats to execute properly at a restaurant. Most places seem to overcook it. Even something as common as roasted chicken usually comes out with dry breast meat. However a great way to trap the moisture is to wrap a brick or a skillet with foil and placing it on top of the chicken. That is the idea behind brick chicken and that's what they are serving at Purbird.I've had some versions of brick chicken at different places but none came at a price of $9. The high end restaurants serving this dish charge about 3X that. Our order of half roast chicken was not 3X worse. The meat was very soft and moist including most of the breast meat. The skin was probably as crispy you could get it without actually frying it - and decent flavor too.I don't know how many sticks of butter they put in one side dish of mashed potatoes but it was one of the creamiest mashed potatoes I've had.

"While my initial visit here left me a bit underwhelmed, this place has steadily gained by respect in the ensuing visits.  The concept is great an a much appreciated option for healthier food in my general area.   Everything has been solid or good, but I would have to cast my vote for the chicken burger as the menus star item, easily besting the chicken breast sandwich, and the somewhat ordinary rotisserie chicken options.  It is juicy and extremely flavorful, and there is no need for the addition of cheese, keeping it relatively on the healthier side.  The lemony egg based chicken soup was also nice and quite unique.  I know this place caters to the hordes of families in the area who must be thrilled for healthier organic options to feed their spoiled yuppie offspring.   In keeping with the appealing to some less healthy options are offered like the much discussed jalapeño mash potatoes (good, quite light & fluffy), mac and cheese (haven't tried as of yet), and for dessert, WAAY better than average brownies.  I usually try to keep it to the healthier options as we all know i get more than enough of my share of the opposite elsewhere.  They have some nice beers on tap, although if management is seeing this I would LOVE the addition of a nice IPA.     Perhaps the thing that has impressed me the most however, even more than that chicken burger, is the customer service.  It is nothing short of top notch, with the staff greeting regulars by name, even a relative new bee like myself.  All and all the type of neighborhood establishment any hood would count itself as lucky to have.",4.0

"This review is based on a takeout order, so I can't comment on decor, ambiance or service. To start with: 5 stars for the chicken. It's really yummy, juicy, perfectly spiced and with a nice crust. Very simple, but very good. Probably the best in the area. Can't think of anyone else offering better chicken. That warrants the 5 star rating. Note that the 1/2 chicken is deboned and somewhat flattened so it's good for one reasonably hungry person, and barely for two (although with a bunch of sides, it's ok for two). The sweet potato fries were good but slight soggy (I think due to the fact they were in a bag and got a bit steamed on the way from the restaurant). They need a bit of salt though. The sauteed spinach was ok, next time I'll try the creamy.  Overall, we just discovered this place and now it will probably be one of our go-to takeout places for chicken.The folks on the phone are nice too, so I'm a fan!",5.0
"Sadly this is located in Brooklyn but this is as good as it gets for roasted chicken. For those LA transplants, this place reminds me of California Chicken Cafe (""CCC"") with its succulent chicken and delicious sides. Unfortunately, we were unable to try the jalapeno mac'n cheese but comes highly recommended from the wait staff. What can go wrong when chicken this tender and juicy leaves you sucking your fingers dry? I hope other patrons don't mind me enjoy this masterpiece. =)",5.0

"Chicken is probably one of more difficult meats to execute properly at a restaurant. Most places seem to overcook it. Even something as common as roasted chicken usually comes out with dry breast meat. However a great way to trap the moisture is to wrap a brick or a skillet with foil and placing it on top of the chicken. That is the idea behind brick chicken and that's what they are serving at Purbird.I've had some versions of brick chicken at different places but none came at a price of $9. The high end restaurants serving this dish charge about 3X that. Our order of half roast chicken was not 3X worse. The meat was very soft and moist including most of the breast meat. The skin was probably as crispy you could get it without actually frying it - and decent flavor too.I don't know how many sticks of butter they put in one side dish of mashed potatoes but it was one of the creamiest mashed potatoes I've had. We ordered it cuz it stuck out at us on the menu but we later found out they had actually gotten an award for their mashed potatoes from The Daily News.

"Call me a skeptic, but I just don't get the hype. Ordered a 1/2 chicken and 2 sides: jalapeño mac & cheese, and sautéed spinach. The chicken was properly done but lacked any flavor. It was clear the chicken was brined by the juice in the meat, but beyond that, it failed to impress. The 1/2 chicken is butterflied and does not include the entire leg. There was a small amount of rub, but it wasn't memorable. Basically, flavorless and soulless. In my opinion, and I feel guilty for saying this, the most flavorful piece of the meal was the bread. The jalapeño mac was a sin against mac & cheese. The cheese sauce was watery and thin, not very cheesy at all. The jalapeño seemed to only be diced and put into the mix raw, so the flavor was not at all complex. Just milky cheese and the heat of raw jalapeño. This dish could be something memorable with a little more love like roasting the jalapeños or boiling the pasta with an ancho chile. The spinach as similarly ok. Very bland and plain. Neither overcooked nor undercooked, but it just failed to do anything special. Purbird gets 3 stars in my book because it's just plain.I honestly believe that you can get similar quality of food from your local grocery store's hot section and pay 1/2 what you would pay here.I would return here if I was devoid of options and wanted a non-offensive choice.

"We were looking for a place near Brooklyn Botanical Gardens for lunch and we found purbird on yelp. On a rainy Sunday, purbird was empty and had plenty of seats. We were also lucky enough to find street parking a block away. The restaurant is very quaint and intimate and very clean. The guys at the counter were super friendly and funny too. The menu is very simply and they are best known for their grilled chicken so it is chicken heavy.

I didn't get to try the chicken but my boyfriend and his friend said it was delicious albiet a bit overcooked but we were reminded that it is the Hispanic way to cook chicken that way. From my point of view, it did look juicy. There was a beautiful color on the skin too. I ordered the chopped salad which was huge and had lots of fixins in it. The salad, however, was just okay--not bad but not the greatest. I loved the side dishes especially the brussel sprouts.The brussel sprouts were tiny ones and roasted with olive oil. They were addictive and easy to eat! The jalapeno mac and cheese had the right amount of heat that gave a kick that you could tell was jalapeno but wasn't too spicy to eat. It was super cheesy as well. Mashed potatoes were soft and buttery. The fries were standard. They also have some beers on tap here which is convenient.

Purbird serves the best tasting chicken I've ever eaten. They use Amish raised chicken and the quality is always outstanding. All of their chicken sandwiches are excellent. My favorite dish is the half chicken which is a butterfly with the leg and just melts in your mouth. The sides are all great but what stands out are the mashed potatoes which are probably the best in New York City. It's a small restaurant with a genuinely friendly staff. All dishes are prepared to order and this usually takes about 10 minutes. Their delivery service is prompt and efficient. The only problem is that now if I eat chicken anywhere else I'm disappointed but It never matches Purbird.,5.0
"This place is great! I have only gotten food to go so I imagine eating there is even better. Their chicken is as delicious as they claim, but my favorite thing in their menu is the soup. It's one of those things that make you feel better about a crappy day with every spoonful. The sides are really good as well, but their brownies are unfortunately nowhere as good as they look. I have gotten them a couple of times thinking the last one might have been a fluke, but they are consistently bad. Hope they use a new recipe soon.",4.0
"You go to a steakhouse, you expect good steak.  You go to a first place, you expect good fish.  You go to purbird, and you'll get good chicken.  That goes without saying, especially since it has a 5 star review.  But, whats sets apart the good from the best is doing everything else well too; and it's with everything else that Purbird shines.Having eaten here more often that i care to admit, i've always found the chicken to be solid.  Granted, I was a little surprised at the presentation of the half chicken order the first time i ordered it, but it's consistently good.  And that, in and of itself is a rarity.  Rarer still is the quality of the sides.The creamed spinach, the mac n' cheese, the mashed potatoes are all solid.  Order any of those, and you'll likely not be disappointed by either the quality or the quantity for the price.  But two things stand out as stellar items on their menu.  The jalepeno mashed potatoes and the chicken pot pie.The jpm is an awesome mix of creamy spiciness.  Not so spicy as to be overpowering, but just spicy enough for a little kick every now and then.The pot pie though is my hands down go to order.  Baked in phyllo dough, though the appearance isn't what you may have in mind, the taste is spot on delicious and evokes some seriously good childhood memories with every bite.",5.0

"OHHHHH MY GODDDD _ Their chicken is just amazing.. The french style de-bones chicken is packed with juice and flavor. The sauce they give you is also amazing. The fries, spinach and all other sides are amazing. Except for the mac and cheese which seems to be a little greasy. They also give you a side of pita grilled bread pieces with every chicken, and I wish they gave more. because they are so delicious.",5.0

Purbird serves the best tasting chicken I've ever eaten. They use Amish raised chicken and the quality is always outstanding. All of their chicken sandwiches are excellent. My favorite dish is the half chicken which is a butterfly with the leg and just melts in your mouth. The sides are all great but what stands out are the mashed potatoes which are probably the best in New York City. It's a small restaurant with a genuinely friendly staff. All dishes are prepared to order and this usually takes about 10 minutes. Their delivery service is prompt and efficient. The only problem is that now if I eat chicken anywhere else I'm disappointed but It never matches Purbird.,5.0
"This place is great! I have only gotten food to go so I imagine eating there is even better. Their chicken is as delicious as they claim, but my favorite thing in their menu is the soup. It's one of those things that make you feel better about a crappy day with every spoonful. The sides are really good as well, but their brownies are unfortunately nowhere as good as they look. I have gotten them a couple of times thinking the last one might have been a fluke, but they are consistently bad. Hope they use a new recipe soon.",4.0
"You go to a steakhouse, you expect good steak.  You go to a first place, you expect good fish.  You go to purbird, and you'll get good chicken.  That goes without saying, especially since it has a 5 star review.  But, whats sets apart the good from the best is doing everything else well too; and it's with everything else that Purbird shines.Having eaten here more often that i care to admit, i've always found the chicken to be solid.  Granted, I was a little surprised at the presentation of the half chicken order the first time i ordered it, but it's consistently good.  And that, in and of itself is a rarity.  Rarer still is the quality of the sides.The creamed spinach, the mac n' cheese, the mashed potatoes are all solid.  Order any of those, and you'll likely not be disappointed by either the quality or the quantity for the price.  But two things stand out as stellar items on their menu.  The jalepeno mashed potatoes and the chicken pot pie.The jpm is an awesome mix of creamy spiciness.  Not so spicy as to be overpowering, but just spicy enough for a little kick every now and then.The pot pie though is my hands down go to order.  Baked in phyllo dough, though the appearance isn't what you may have in mind, the taste is spot on delicious and evokes some seriously good childhood memories with every bite.",5.0

"Purfect score for a purfect meal at Purbird.First up was the Chicken Pie {chicken, veggies and special sauce wrapped in phyllo, $5.50}.  The pie itself was awesome.  I was a bit worried it would be dry, as it looked like it was mostly dough-  that thought dissipated as soon as I took my first bite.  Purfectly flaky, proportioned right, and all around creamy deliciousness.  The menu says ""hand held"" implying that you could take it to go and eat/walk.  I don't recommend that - with the mixture inside one bite and you'd be wearing it. I think plate & fork is the way to go.  Hubs decided to try the Chicken Breast Sandwich {grilled chicken breast, avocado, turkey bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo on a toasted roll, $7.95} and didn't waste any time diving in.  The sandwich was a bit larger than either of us thought it would be and the chicken was seasoned and grilled up very nicely and was still juicy when it came out.  I don't think you could ask for anything more in a chicken sandwich.Sides came next- we opted to go all-carb and try the Jalapeno Mashed {original mashed served with jalapeno puree, $5.50} and the Mac & Cheese {made to order with three cheeses, $7.00}.  Both were outstanding.  Taters were super creamy and I loved the jalapeno puree.  If you like a little bit of heat you have to try these!  The mac was totally cheesy and didn't lose that creamy factor.  Loved every bite.  If I had to choose only one I'd have to go with the jalapeno mashed- they went purfectly with the chicken pie.  Just like Sunday dinner with a bit of a twist. A few notes: The sides are big enough to share... so don't be shocked by their price tag.  We each had a generous helping of both taters & mac.  {Free} water carafes & glasses are available for your table if you don't feel like buying a soda... and they were purfectly chilled, right from the cooler.The atmosphere in the place is pretty lax.

"I enjoyed my meal here but I'm still astounded at the number of five star reviews. The prices are a little too high and not everything is 5 star worthy here. Purbird is a small place, you order/pay at the counter and they bring you your food. The service is friendly, they automatically give you a wine bottle of water for the table, serve food on real plates with metal utensils, and they take credit cards ($15min). All the main food options are chicken based but they do have non chicken related sides if you insist on bringing one of those vegetarian types here.I ordered the half chicken ($9) and a side of mac and cheese ($7). My friend ordered a chicken cheese burger ($7). Supposedly they have beer and wine here, I didn't see it on the overhead chalk board and I just saw a lonely can of Sixpoint beer in the fridge so I don't know what the deal is. The chickens they use are of the smaller variety and they remove the bones before cooking it so 1/2 a chicken is not a gluttonous amount of meat, just the right about for a meal for a single person. It seemed odd that it was all white meat so I doubt that it's truly half a chicken, I prefer white meat anyway so I enjoyed the portion. The chicken has a great fire grilled flavor and the skin was mostly nice and crispy. The chicken itself was cooked perfectly and was juicy enough to not need any more seasoning or sauces. If you want sauce they have a few options available. The first is 50 cents, more are a dollar each. As I mentioned, $9 for a portion of chicken without sides is pricey, you can get an entire succulent rotisserie chicken in Bushwick at Inca for only $7.25. The mac and cheese was a very large portion (I expect most of the sides are meant to be split) and was tasty but definitely not the best I've ever had. It had a tad too much butter in it and pretty ordinary cheese. Despite their use of whole grain pasta it didn't have a taste or texture any different than any other elbow pasta. It was properly cheesy, not over cooked, and was properly hot. Seven bucks for a side of mac and cheese is pricey but if you're splitting it with someone then $3.50 is a more reasonable price to consider for the side. My friend got their chicken burger and said it was on point. I had a couple bites and it was definitely tasty with a lot of flavor and juiciness. The burger is actually $6, cheese is a dollar more. Very good deal for what you're getting. My only gripe would be that the actual chicken patty was very thin. Though I disagree with all the 5 star reviews I do enjoy Purbird and they're a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
I found this place on Yelp while looking for a place to eat in Boerum Hill while on my way to The Chocolate Room. After reading such great reviews we stopped by. The chicken was delicious! Our kids enjoyed the Mac & Cheese but the cream of spinach was just okay. A little bitter - I prefer sautéed spinach. A small place with great service - although very cold in temp when we visited - and delicious food. We will visit again when we're in the neighborhood.,4.0
A must go! Fresh chicken and amazing sides will fill you to the brim. Its easy to order too much so watch out - their portions are very generous and you will go home with leftovers! The mac and cheese is number 1 in my book as well as their homemade ice tea. Located downstairs its fun to sit at the window and watch the passerby's.,4.0

"Purbird seems to have embraced what I believe to be the best route for small businesses: Do one thing, and do it very well.Their one thing happens to be chicken, and in my experience, everything they make is so juicy. So flavorful. So chickeny. They use quality birds, and they complement their simple recipes with ingredients that let the flavor of the poultry shine through.Personally, I'm a fan of the chicken burger. At only $6, it's an excellent deal in the Slope, and can be a snack or a meal (depending on where you rank on the gluttony scale). This mix of dark and light meat, topped with grilled onions and a house sauce infused with zucchini and Indian spices hits whatever spot you want it to, and it doesn't even need the cheese that you are more than welcome to add. And I must say, I love the staff. They are friendly, visibly happy, and rock out to the Zeppelin, Dylan and Beatles that are constantly coming through the speakers. It's nice to eat in a place where people don't look like they hate their jobs. I've come in at off hours, and it seems that they all eat off the menu, which is always comforting as well.",5.0

"Open letter to Purbird:Purbid, you've spoiled me. Before we met, I used to be able to enjoy chicken wraps at any grease truck, cafeteria, rest stop, fast-food joint, or diner because they were all pretty much the same and, and, and...I didn't know any better. I didn't know that chicken could taste so good. So damned good.But now I know. And there's no going back. Every time I'm within shouting distance of St. Marks and 6th, I try to find an excuse, any excuse, to come by for a Chicken Thigh Wrap (spicy) with a side of mashed. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. But just know that it's the first thing I think about when I'm in your neighborhood, and the last thing I want in my stomach if chicken is involved.Sincerely,your most satisfied customer",5.0
"It's really very simple. Purbird. Is. The. Best. Truly awesome place. We live outside their delivery zone and my husband puts on his long john's on these cold winter nights to bike to them and pick up their delicous spicy chicken wraps. They are perfection. Particularly the sauteed cabbage. I've had the chicken burger as well, which is also great, albeit a little bit small for my tastes. We always get a side of mashed potatoes as well. It's all so good. If we are in the neighborhood we stop by as well. My only complaint is that they need to expand their delivery zone!",5.0
really good food. I had the half chicken. I liked how they prepared it so its easy to eat. The bread was really good. The purbird sauce was not particularly special but did add more flavor to my chicken. My friends and I shared a side of fries and jalapeno mac and cheese. Both were really good. Descent serving size.

I had the chicken breast sandwich and it was not disappointing at all. The turkey bacon went really well w/ the chicken breast. The chicken breast itself was really good. It had that charred taste on the outside and and moist inside that wasn't fatty or greasy at all. We had a side of sweet potatoes, which tasted really fresh and not too mushy like most places make it. The dips were all pretty good, but I think the Purbird dip was my fav. I'd def like to come back to this place again!p.s. - I also forgot to mention this important note - SERVICE WAS AMAZING. Our server was really friendly and funny.",4.0

When you order your food, you stand at the counter and do so and then you take your seat and wait for it to come to you. The wait was minimal under 10 minutes or so.

"Open letter to Purbird:Purbid, you've spoiled me. Before we met, I used to be able to enjoy chicken wraps at any grease truck, cafeteria, rest stop, fast-food joint, or diner because they were all pretty much the same and, and, and...I didn't know any better. I didn't know that chicken could taste so good. So damned good.But now I know. And there's no going back. Every time I'm within shouting distance of St. Marks and 6th, I try to find an excuse, any excuse, to come by for a Chicken Thigh Wrap (spicy) with a side of mashed. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. But just know that it's the first thing I think about when I'm in your neighborhood, and the last thing I want in my stomach if chicken is involved.Sincerely,your most satisfied customer",5.0
"It's really very simple. Purbird. Is. The. Best. Truly awesome place. We live outside their delivery zone and my husband puts on his long john's on these cold winter nights to bike to them and pick up their delicous spicy chicken wraps. They are perfection. Particularly the sauteed cabbage. I've had the chicken burger as well, which is also great, albeit a little bit small for my tastes. We always get a side of mashed potatoes as well. It's all so good. If we are in the neighborhood we stop by as well. My only complaint is that they need to expand their delivery zone!",5.0
really good food. I had the half chicken. I liked how they prepared it so its easy to eat. The bread was really good. The purbird sauce was not particularly special but did add more flavor to my chicken. My friends and I shared a side of fries and jalapeno mac and cheese. Both were really good. Descent serving size.

"We went for the lunch special (half chicken, bread, vegetable of the day [cauliflower], and a potato [we got mashed])We thought it was kind of expensive for lunch...the special was $15, but the food was worth it. The chicken was some of the most juicy and succulent Iv eaten in a fast food setting. The mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth. They tasted real (vs out of a box). My only complaint was the 'regular' was a little salty. The mashed sweet potatoes were grand. I'm not normally a fan of cauliflower, but I loved these.Everything was fantastic.

Good sign #3. After about a 12 minute wait, the wrap came out. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It was warm. The cabbage was tender, the onions were perfectly pickled and the tomatoes were fresh. The mayo and sauce was good. Indescribable. I have no idea what it was, but I'm certain that the wrap wouldn't have been nearly as great without it. It also came with a surprise pickle.

"Cool little spot in Park Slope. I got the chicken burger, which consisted of freshly ground chicken and spices, and they topped it with a nice chipotle mayo and some lettuce.

"On the way to see a show at Barclays Center, I dropped into Purbird for a pre-concert meal, and I'm so glad I did. Purbird offers counter service (meals & drinks are brought to the table) which makes for a fairly quick & casual meal. Much healthier and tastier than most grab & go options. As noted, their specialty is chicken, and their reputation is well-deserved. A 1/2 chicken order with dipping sauce is a great single portion. Juicy, and flavorful. The chopped salad is also very good; you can add chicken to it as well which makes for a fairly large meal. Beer & wine on tap too (Allagash is a great compliment to the flavor of the chicken).",4.0
"I've been walking by this place for a while and we finally decided to give it a try. We ordered the half grilled chicken with a side of fries.

We opted for the purbird sauce (sweet and spicy -- def my ave) and the mango chutney (also very good). I noticed that a few other patrons order sandwiches and they all looked amazing. I got a Gus blackberry soda -- not too sweet and full of flavor and we got a big, thick moist piece of one of the best brownies I've ever tasted as dessert to go.

My boyfriend and I love dark meat so all thighs for both of us. This helps a lot because we waste the white meat when we get the half or whole chicken. I was really dying for the beet salad but for our sides we decided on the creamed spinach. It was a lot of food for so little money!!! The place was cute, very small but had outdoor seating. We sat outside since it was a really nice night. The chicken was soft, juicy, and oozing with flavor. One of the best! The creamed spinach was also delicious. Not too salty, very creamy and a bit on the heavy side.

"I'm a vegetarian.So I came to Purbird for... their Veggie Burger? Go figure.Being that I stopped eating meat about 17 years ago, I've had my share of veggie burgers to the point that I feel 'meh' about them in general, as they're as generic and bland as a standard garden salad. Most places use the same patties, so they all taste the same to me... unless they actually make their own.Purbird does that. And does that really, really well. The newest addition to their menu--the veggie burger is a flavorful and delicious blend of mushrooms, black beans, chick peas, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, and brown rice... on a pillowy soft brioche-y bun with shredded lettuce and pesto mayo. OH DAMN was it scrumptious. Most say a good (beef) burger doesn't need ketchup, it wasn't needed at all here. The texture was hearty, soft, not dry or rubbery, and I admit it does fall apart and come out the sides when you bite (a usual dilemma for veggie burgers), but it's because there's no binder (usually eggs) and it's actually vegan.I also ordered the jalapeño mashed potatoes. Creamy, smooth, buttery... with a pool of jalapeño puree in the middle instead of gravy. The right amount of lumps, and super comforting like a warm blanket. Correction: a HOT blanket.Washed it down with a refreshing pomegranate mint tea. And finished the meal with super moist, dark, decadent brownie. So moist that it was like a not-so-molten chocolate lava cake--the right amount of sexy, seductive lusciousness, without the ooziness.And I'm sure the chicken here is great too.Also, Jorge is the man...

Correction: a HOT blanket.Washed it down with a refreshing pomegranate mint tea. And finished the meal with super moist, dark, decadent brownie. So moist that it was like a not-so-molten chocolate lava cake--the right amount of sexy, seductive lusciousness, without the ooziness.And I'm sure the chicken here is great too.Also, Jorge is the man... Just come here.",5.0

"I had the half chicken and a coke for $10. Adding a single side adds another 5 or 6. Expensive, but ok if it were worth it, but it wasn't. The chicken was extremely greasy (Is that what passes as ""moist"" in the other reviews?) and otherwise nothing special. The cucumber raita sauce tasted neither like cucumber or raita.The diet coke was excellent.",3.0
"I would give this place five stars except I'm continually frustrated when I go in there for a bite to eat alone in the evening. The cost is $8+ for a half chicken (the smallest order you can get) and then if you want to order a side, that's another $6+ for one side. So for a single person a chicken dinner is $16 or more after the tax is added. That doesn't make sense. Why the restaurant owner doesn't have some kind of combo plate for dinner is beyond me. I'm sure she'd have way more people coming in for that. If you don't mind spending that much for a (very good) chicken dinner, then I recommend this place. Or if you come in 2's or 3's it's a nice option. But coming solo, I wouldn't do it. There are other places in the area with a similar casual vibe for less.UPDATE: I've discovered my favorite thing to order here: the chicken thigh wrap. It's ridiculously good. Juicy, full of good stuff. I start to crave these and have to come back for more.",4.0
"LOVE this place. The chicken is first-rate quality, and cooked marvelously.

"Hungry for some comfort/home-cooking type food, I ordered the creamed spinach, the mashed potatoes, and a piece of chicken (the breast). First of all, these 3 things cost $20.14. That is kind of absurd. If they'd been delicious, I could have gotten over it, but they were not, which made the cost extra ridiculous.Creamed spinach should be creamed. Like, shredded up a bit in a creamy thick sauce. This was not that. Instead, it was basically a bowl of steamed spinach with milk and butter drizzled over it and settled at the bottom. Sort of like spinach as a hot breakfast cereal, minus the delicious goodness? I was really looking forward to having a hearty and well made bowl of creamed spinach, and I actually found this gross enough that I didn't finish more than a quarter of it. For $7, I think it was warranted that I'd have high expectations. They were not met.The chicken breast was not actually a chicken breast, but rather two pounded thin boneless skinless grilled chicken cutlets. The sauce was good and buttery and the grilling produced that nice grill flavor. But the texture was pure rubber. When the chicken is pounded to only 1/4 inch thick, it doesn't have much choice but to be a weird texture. Not what I was expecting since the menu item I ordered was a ""piece of chicken"" with the choice being thigh or breast. Those are actual parts. This was a gummy grilled former piece of chicken. So sad.The mashed potatoes were fine. I'd guess 50% boxed potato flakes and 50% potato. Served with zero condiments (no butter, salt, or pepper), I dredged them in some of the butter sauce that the chicken left on the plate. That was good. Otherwise they were fluffy but needed a bit of accoutrement.A disappointing showing for such a highly rated place. Could have been an off night, but I'm unlikely to visit again to find out.",2.0

"I am not averse to run-of-the-mill chicken establishments - having lived near Chirping Chicken, I know a mediocre chicken salad when I see one and, in most cases, it does the trick. With that, upon noticing a takeout chicken vendor with a 4.5-star rating on Yelp, I had clearly hit the jackpot. This was the chicken I had been awaiting my whole life - with all those glimmering stars, I could envision the beasts now: happy, frolicking chickens, skipping to-and-fro, singing kumbaya.We had heard that the fare was greasy, however, and so avoided it until one fateful night after a taxing excursion to Target. Stumbling up Flatbush, thoroughly defeated by the masses, we both came to the same conclusion: Chicken. It was 8 p.m. on a weekday and the place was quiet - quick and easy, we thought. Quick and easy.We looked at the rather limited menu, made our decision, and then stood at the counter. We stood. And we stood. And five minutes later, one of the three people behind the counter finally graced us with their presence. ""Know what you want?"" ""Yes, gracious chicken provider, yes we do."" The minutes passed and then, thirty minutes later, food appeared before us. It wasn't to be, however, for that was not our order. Ten minutes later, another order appeared before us: oh cruel temptation, it wasn't ours either. Finally, the meal appeared, looking rather sad and pathetic.I ordered the salad with chickpeas, feta, beets and added a piece of chicken for shits and giggles. For thirteen dollars, I can't say I was very impressed - the chicken was, as promised, terribly greasy and the salad was uninspired to put it simply. My girlfriend ordered the half chicken and sweet potato fries. Suffice it to say that the sweet potato fries were, by far, the best thing we ate there, and they weren't particularly remarkable.Conclusion: There's nothing wrong with a greasy chicken joint. The problem, however, is when a greasy chicken joint fails to realize that it is exactly that. The food is okay for a fast-food outlet, but that's about it. The service is poor, the food is mediocre, at best, and there is no ambiance to speak of. Treat it as if it's one step above a food truck and you'll be pleasantly surprised, but if you think this is good quality chicken, produced by experts, you are setting yourself up for a huge disappointment.",2.0

"This is a little place but damn do they make good chicken. The staff here are great and friendly. The food is great. My favorites are the half a chicken, sweet mash potatoes, and sautéed spinach. A bit pricey but worth it.",5.0
"Awesome find!!  It is a little strange that they only have chicken, but they get chicken. They make it well, and have lots of different things, which I found quite impressive. The half chicken was really good, and the grilled flatbread it came with was awesome. Definitely get the dipping sauce too, it was a fun addition. The dark-meat chicken wrap was tasty, but more of a lunch thing than dinner I'd say. The best thing we had was actually the special side of mashed sweet potatoes. You could practically see the butter that went in there, but oh man was it creamy & sweet. This place is the best value for money in the area. They also have a pretty sweet delivery area. Hurray!",4.0
"I love, love this place!  Very tasty yet healthy food. They even have great veggies. I had the grilled thigh wrap with sautéed broccoli. Amazing. Even the toasted pita bread was yummy.  Definitely will be ordering here a lot!  And the prices are very reasonable to boot!",5.0
"So simple - makes it easier to choose when starving.What can I say? This place does chicken well - basic yet flavorful. There's no fancy sauces (you can choose a hot sauce of your liking) or over gourmet-ed flavoring that drown out any true flavor. The chicken is always tender and juicy and yum!Their menu expanded just enough to add a few more simple options such as a chicken burger.

Simple sides with a twist.And did I mention that every time I walk in to pick up my food I'm greeted with a smile. Bonus!",4.0
"OOoOoo This is a nice little addition to the Atlantic-Pacific end of Park Slope.  It's pretty inexpensive and you can get 2 items for around 10-12 bucks.  My favorite items were the mac & cheese because it was rich and very cheesy without being over-saturating nor over-worked with breadcrumbs, bacon, herbs etc.  The chicken soup I also really liked.  It has a bit of citrus in it which is nice, perfect for the cold days and clearing stuffed sinuses.  The Jalapeno mashed taters I found okay, the jalapeno element wasn't kicking enough and though the potatoes were well whipped I wish they had been worked with some more seasoning because it was a bit bland for me.  The chicken pot pie as the esteemed yelper caitlin h. pointed out below is more like a chicken hot pocket snack than a mini-cutesy-pot pie but still tasty.Some of the staff is quite friendly and checks up on you.  I like too that they have a table of frank's red hot on standby.  I am a bit curious to try some of the sauces they have.  It irks me a little that I have to pay a dollar for a sauce cup but maybe they are out of this world.  Easy grab-n-go, food comes out good-n-hot if you stay.  Am I the first to use this here--Winner, winner, chicken dinner.",4.0

"I love single-purpose restaurants that specialize in one item.  Compare your roasted chicken at Purbird with one at your typical diner with a 500+ item menu, and you see the point of specialty joints.We wandered in hungry, cold and tired and ordered a chicken with some sides.  We were too famished to even wait to get home to eat, so we ate the chicken at one of the small cozy tables in the back.  The chicken is split open into a flat layer and grilled, ensuring even cooking, thorough saturation of seasoning and general deliciousness.  Ours was succulent and we ate half a chicken in a blink, occasionally interrupting ourselves to eat the sides.  The mac and cheese was a nostalgic riff on Kraft, with a discernible orange sauce but with real ingredients.  The mashed potatoes were properly buttery and an excellent version of the classic.  Complimentary pitas were soft and very buttery.  Yum.The service is warm and hospitable, and we definitely are making this a part of our regular rotation.  What's better than a freshly roasted chicken on a chilly winter's night?",4.0
"I think I come here once a week. I generally get their Chicken Breast sandwich and jalapeno mashed potatoes. Both are fantastic.  I recently tried their Chicken Pie and Chicken Thigh wrap. Both are tasty too. Ordering a ""whole chicken"" consists of a flat, de-boned, small bird. It's not much meat but it's very tasty. I've tried their jalapeno mac and cheese and it was plenty spicy but too rich for me. I couldn't tell if it was cheese or oil. The employees are very friendly.  Don't expect to get served but there is plenty of seating. If you're taking your meal to-go, make sure you emphasize this. I don't know why they screw this up sometimes but they do. And at least once, they ended up giving me mashed potatoes without the jalapeno. So check your bag before you leave! Otherwise, really solid chicken. I haven't tried any of their salads but I'm sure they would be tasty too.",4.0

Went to Pur Bird for lunch w a friend and being a new place we took it upon ourselves to order as much as possible to get the full effect. Portions are perfect for splitting, so keep that in mind. Plus, price point is around 6 bucks so if you order 3 things you're pretty gold and makes it about 10 bucks per head. We had the Jalapeño infused mash potatoes...shut your dirty mouth they were tasty....also, the home made chicken soup, great as well, and not too salty. My favorite hands down was the mac and cheese. I loved that it had thick cheese on top but underneath was my favorite runny almost soupy cheese....YES PLEASE. We also had the chicken pot pie, which I really didn't care for, but I generally don't like pot pies anyway. It was more like a hot pocket pot pie though. The counter staff was AMAZING, Super sweet and checking in on how we liked the food-love that about a new place....it's always smart to make an effort and take notice of the customer. The place was clean and plenty of seating. Also love that you don't have to bother with a waiter aka no BS or tip to deal with. And they take Credit card. It's great food for a cold day!",4.0

"If you're going to eat out, this is the place to do it!  Organic, fresh, and made to order all for a fairly low price!  My hubby and I met here for dinner on a very cold night and feasted on a grilled half-chicken, creamed spinach, grilled chicken sandwich with turkey bacon and pomegranate-mint iced tea.  The menu has an upscale, summer cook-out vibe that go so nicely with the decor.  It's small and simply designed - but they really go out of their way to make sure things are reusable, recyclable and efficient.The friendly staff behind the counter came around to refill our drinks periodically and ask how we liked the food - ""hmm"" was all we could manage with our mouths full.

There are no menus, you get your own silverware, and clean up after yourself - all of which is fine, but I just think you should know that when making plans. This is really a take-out place.

"I'm so glad that we finally have a healthy chicken place in our neighborhood.  I ordered the flame grilled chicken, chicken burger, chopped salad and purbird fries for my family.The chicken was amazing, very juicy and burst with flavors!  We loved the spicy (jalapeno) sauce!  The chicken burger's grounded patty was high quality and perfectly cooked.  My favorite was chopped salad - roasted beets, chickpeas, little bit of lettuce and feta cheese in a flavorful but light balsamic dressing.  When I'm in the mood for diet, I should definitely get this salad again because it's healthy yet very filling.  Their fries were very flavorful but I wish they double fried to make them crispier. Overall, we were very satisfied with our first try at Purbird, not to mention the very friendly service by owner's wife(?).   I wish them all the success and will definitely go back to try other dishes.",4.0

I know a lot of people say they love chicken, but seriously I LOVE chicken, to the point that it's most likely bad for my health, LOVE chicken.When we first started ordering from these guys its was heavenly, everything was perfect and amazing. Their grilled chicken is simply the best chicken Ive ever had from a restaurant. The soup, mac and cheese, jalapeño mash. Freakin tits man! Oh shit! and their grilled flat bread!!! OH MY FREAKIN STARS!Its been about 6 months since we've been regularly eating from this place and it has gone a little down hill with there weird ass delivery guys and questionable recipe change with some of there sides. But the Grilled chicken, still aces. Try them, you really wont regret it. Unless that is, you're really not into tranny delivery dudes that arent careful with your food and NEVER have change. Seriously these guys never have change. And one time the guy handed me a bag that was just a freakin mess inside. No judgement tho ;)",4.0
"I love single-purpose restaurants that specialize in one item.  Compare your roasted chicken at Purbird with one at your typical diner with a 500+ item menu, and you see the point of specialty joints.We wandered in hungry, cold and tired and ordered a chicken with some sides.  We were too famished to even wait to get home to eat, so we ate the chicken at one of the small cozy tables in the back.  The chicken is split open into a flat layer and grilled, ensuring even cooking, thorough saturation of seasoning and general deliciousness.  Ours was succulent and we ate half a chicken in a blink, occasionally interrupting ourselves to eat the sides.  The mac and cheese was a nostalgic riff on Kraft, with a discernible orange sauce but with real ingredients.  The mashed potatoes were properly buttery and an excellent version of the classic.  Complimentary pitas were soft and very buttery.  Yum.The service is warm and hospitable, and we definitely are making this a part of our regular rotation.  What's better than a freshly roasted chicken on a chilly winter's night?",4.0
"I think I come here once a week. I generally get their Chicken Breast sandwich and jalapeno mashed potatoes. Both are fantastic.  I recently tried their Chicken Pie and Chicken Thigh wrap. Both are tasty too. Ordering a ""whole chicken"" consists of a flat, de-boned, small bird. It's not much meat but it's very tasty. I've tried their jalapeno mac and cheese and it was plenty spicy but too rich for me. I couldn't tell if it was cheese or oil. The employees are very friendly.  Don't expect to get served but there is plenty of seating. If you're taking your meal to-go, make sure you emphasize this. I don't know why they screw this up sometimes but they do. And at least once, they ended up giving me mashed potatoes without the jalapeno. So check your bag before you leave! Otherwise, really solid chicken. I haven't tried any of their salads but I'm sure they would be tasty too.",4.0
"Oh, park slope you're like the super nice guy i never went out with but I am always reminded how great you are when we have that once a year run in at a party. Went to Pur Bird for lunch w a friend and being a new place we took it upon ourselves to order as much as possible to get the full effect. Portions are perfect for splitting, so keep that in mind. Plus, price point is around 6 bucks so if you order 3 things you're pretty gold and makes it about 10 bucks per head. We had the Jalapeño infused mash potatoes...shut your dirty mouth they were tasty....also, the home made chicken soup, great as well, and not too salty. My favorite hands down was the mac and cheese. I loved that it had thick cheese on top but underneath was my favorite runny almost soupy cheese....YES PLEASE. We also had the chicken pot pie, which I really didn't care for, but I generally don't like pot pies anyway. It was more like a hot pocket pot pie though. The counter staff was AMAZING, Super sweet and checking in on how we liked the food-love that about a new place....it's always smart to make an effort and take notice of the customer. The place was clean and plenty of seating. Also love that you don't have to bother with a waiter aka no BS or tip to deal with. And they take Credit card. It's great food for a cold day!",4.0
"Purbird is your one stop chook shop. If its chicken, they cook it. My wife and I had the grilled chicken sandwich, we found to be dry and unpleasant.The chicken noodle soup should be called lemon soup with lemon and chicken. The star of the soup is lemon, supporting actors are lemon and lemon. Perhaps one of the guys in the background is chicken. If you like lemon, I recommend this soup.I'm going to give this place another shot, but judging by most previous reviews, I stand alone in saying this place is over rated.",2.0
"If you're going to eat out, this is the place to do it!  Organic, fresh, and made to order all for a fairly low price!  My hubby and I met here for dinner on a very cold night and feasted on a grilled half-chicken, creamed spinach, grilled chicken sandwich with turkey bacon and pomegranate-mint iced tea.  The menu has an upscale, summer cook-out vibe that go so nicely with the decor.  It's small and simply designed - but they really go out of their way to make sure things are reusable, recyclable and efficient.The friendly staff behind the counter came around to refill our drinks periodically and ask how we liked the food - ""hmm"" was all we could manage with our mouths full. Our plates were clean and tummies full!  We will be back!",5.0
"First, I just want to let everyone know that there is no table-service here. I did not realize this from the reviews and website when I went and it definitely would have been helpful to know, so I just wanted to put that out there. You order at the counter and the staff literally will not approach you at all. There are no menus, you get your own silverware, and clean up after yourself - all of which is fine, but I just think you should know that when making plans. This is really a take-out place. That said, the food is good. The mac and cheese is delicious, the chicken burger is great and amazingly juicy for poultry, and the chicken sandwich and fries are great too.",3.0
"I love this place! The chicken burgers are to die for and the service is always super friendly. The french fries are okay and so are the mashed jalapeño potatoes- I haven't explored much more from the menu, why fix something if it isn't broken.",5.0
"I'm so glad that we finally have a healthy chicken place in our neighborhood.  I ordered the flame grilled chicken, chicken burger, chopped salad and purbird fries for my family.The chicken was amazing, very juicy and burst with flavors!  We loved the spicy (jalapeno) sauce!  The chicken burger's grounded patty was high quality and perfectly cooked.  My favorite was chopped salad - roasted beets, chickpeas, little bit of lettuce and feta cheese in a flavorful but light balsamic dressing.  When I'm in the mood for diet, I should definitely get this salad again because it's healthy yet very filling.  Their fries were very flavorful but I wish they double fried to make them crispier. Overall, we were very satisfied with our first try at Purbird, not to mention the very friendly service by owner's wife(?).   I wish them all the success and will definitely go back to try other dishes.",4.0

"I'm amazed by how much we liked the half a chicken.  It was deliciously flame-kissed on the outside, very juicy and naturally flavorful throughout, and was easy to tear into since it's fully de-boned (well, there was one bone in the wing, but those things are mostly bone anyway).  And it's marinated/finished with a mix of olive oil, lemon, and herbs (oregano?).I'd been looking at other people's pictures of this place, and the chicken tasted exactly as I'd imagined and hoped.The sides we got were also very good.  The creamed spinach was light and filling with a hint of lemon, and the mac and cheese was hearty.  Some of the other sides seemed like they might be too expensive, but these were the right price.Casual atmosphere with great decor inside and out.  The outdoor seating is a plus on warm nights.  We'll definitely be back soon, and often.",5.0

"Purbird--where the lady behind the counter will gladly tell you that she won't put your order in because it's too much to eat for one person--and you should listen to her even though you think you can down it all. If it's your first time and you're hungry, get the grilled chicken with the sauces. I liked the purbird sauce, zucchini and chutney. If you're not as hungry, get the chicken breast sammich. Both of these choices, with a side of jalapeno mash..... it'll haunt you in your sleep. I wasn't a big fan of the whole wheat mac and cheese... something about whole wheat in my cheesy greasy goodness just doesn't seem right. Also wasn't a big fan of the chicken burger--it was good, but the patty absorbed too much grease, which over powered everything else in the burger.",4.0

It was not enough to split between two people, but as a one, I didn't want to get a wrap. So I ended up getting too much side, just barely enough chicken and it was pricey.

"I took a mile-and-a-half walk to this place since I was craving some grilled chicken and it was a nice day out. I decided to get a spicy half chicken instead of a sandwich because some Yelpers mentioned that it was prepared with most of the bones taken out and I wanted to give it a try. While walking back I noticed that they gave me some grilled pita bread, which was warm, soft, and prepared with some olive oil and salt. I'm not sure if I was just really hungry by this point, but I finished all the bread on the way back since it was delicious.The chicken was very moist and prepared just like I heard, you can just tear or cut off a piece of meat and eat away. I got it with the lemon parsley sauce which was pretty good. I also got a side of the jalapeno mashed potatoes - I expected the mash to just be potatoes with bits of jalapeno in them, but it was so much better than that. The potatoes tasted homemade, and was topped with butter and this green jalapeno sauce. I thought they went together great.I'm definitely going back to this place and trying some of the other stuff they have.",5.0

"Delicious chicken in this new spot in the Slope, just below a yoga studio. Organic, free-range, antibiotic-free chicken comes in grilled, chopped salads, and an amazing chicken thigh-whole wheat wrap (with special sauce, pickled onions and slaw). I thought the wrap would be tiny and not-so-filling (for $6.25, a suspiciously sweet deal) but it ended up satisfying this Hungry Girl appetite. FIVE STARS!Casual patio-seating, great for people watching and enjoying a leisurely meal on a sunny day. The menu is a bit limited and the salads ($7-8) and sides ($5-6) seem pricey compared to the chicken wrap, sausage, and burger options - so minus one star for that.

"Me, hubby and our two small dogs were on a day excursion to Brooklyn. Purbird had caught our eye on a previous outing (strictly through curb appeal, we had no idea what they even served..although the name should have been a dead-give away). When I realized they only served chicken, I wasn't as excited, but after my first bite, Purbird won me over.We ordered the whole chicken and jalapeno mashed potatoes to share, and both were amazing. I've never seen a whole chicken served like that before...butterflied but with no bones. Incredibly juice and flavourful, and the chipotle sauce for dipping was the final perfecting touch. The garlic flatbread was also delicious. The woman owner was fabulous; was completely welcoming of our dogs and let us BYOB because she's still working on her liquor license. Highly recommend for a super casual summer lunch or dinner.",5.0

"I am a sometimes-vegetarian that RARELY eats poultry but Purbird is the greatest place. I say that with unexaggerated sincerity for two reasons: their food is great and their service is great. Just great!!! So great in fact, that after discovering it, I went twice in one week.The menu is small but they do everything on it perfectly. My favorite item is the chicken burger with American cheese, and a side of jalapeño mash (always!!) and also a side of the green hot sauce. So amazing, and so cheap!! The burger is giant and costs like $6.00?? And will rival any beef burger for flavor and juiciness. And the jalapeño mash... So fresh-tasting and delicious. And the service! The nicest people work here. They are friendly and kind and quick and treat you as if you're a guest in their home. They learn your name! I would eat here every day.The ONLY reason I'm not giving Purbird 5 stars is because I wish they would add wings and fried chicken and beer to their menu and maybe they'll see this review and do that ;)Also to note: this place has outdoor seating and they don't mind if you bring your dog to an outdoor table, so I am counting it as a dog-friendly place to eat.",4.0

"As the guy behind the counter who took our order said, ""It's a great bird."" And it was! Half a chicken and the jalapeño mashed potatoes, and my boyfriend and I were pleasantly sated, not stuffed, but definitely content. I can't remember the last time I had such moist, tasty chicken. And they serve it deboned, which was a nice surprise. We had the green sauce, which I believe is the same as the sauce on top of the jalapeño mashed. It was spicy and delicious. The service was so friendly. We actually tried to eat here the night before, but arrived just as they were closing the kitchen, and everyone was so apologetic.

"Pretty darn good! This is definitely going to be a go to weeknight spot for take out!I was not that impressed with the wrap, but the whole chicken was great! Don't forget the sides, because they are very good too. Next trip i'm trying a milkshake.",3.0
"Chicken is really easy to cook, but few things are as satisfying as an expertly cooked chicken. Purbird does it pretty well. I've ordered from here about a dozen times. Only once was the chicken not up to par. Other times, it's terrific. The mac and cheese is delicious as well. Probably the most delicious mac and cheese I've ever had that uses whole grain pasta. Although, after leaving leftovers in the fridge it's pretty clear why- it's SUPER cheesy and greasy. But that's not a complaint.The chicken pie in phyllo is also surprisingly tasty. But 90% of the time I just get the flame grilled chicken. Can't go wrong with that.",4.0
"I was starting to run out of decent lunch options while I was in Park Slope, so after a little exploring I decided to find out what Purbird was. I checked out the menu and was intrigued, so I got the chicken thigh wrap and the jalepeno mashed potatoes. I have to say, that was one of the best wraps I ever had-- and I don't even like whole wheat wraps. It was fairly healthy (whole wheat, chicken, veggies) and it was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The jalepeno mashed was excellent, too. Not too spicy but definitely had a kick to it. And for a side, it was awfully large. i can't imagine one person finishing it alone (although I did). It's meant to be shared. The staff was also very friendly, so that was a nice little bonus.",4.0

"Maybe I haven't eaten enough chicken dishes yet, but I have never encountered roast chicken that is deboned. That is until I came to Purbird. Upon reading about how this place serves up all natural chicken at reasonable prices, I have had it on my list for months. It proves to be worth the wait (it took about 10 minutes for my half chicken to be served up) and these positive Yelp reviews. The friendly service from this establishment, along with its moist chickens, definitely makes it worth a trip.",4.0
"Me, hubby and our two small dogs were on a day excursion to Brooklyn. Purbird had caught our eye on a previous outing (strictly through curb appeal, we had no idea what they even served..although the name should have been a dead-give away). When I realized they only served chicken, I wasn't as excited, but after my first bite, Purbird won me over.We ordered the whole chicken and jalapeno mashed potatoes to share, and both were amazing. I've never seen a whole chicken served like that before...butterflied but with no bones. Incredibly juice and flavourful, and the chipotle sauce for dipping was the final perfecting touch. The garlic flatbread was also delicious. The woman owner was fabulous; was completely welcoming of our dogs and let us BYOB because she's still working on her liquor license. Highly recommend for a super casual summer lunch or dinner.",5.0
"Delicious mouth-watering chicken. Tried the chicken pot pie which was just right, flakey buttery crust. Fresh french fries. And the green spicy jalapeno mash potatoes were an amazing combination of spicy and salty. Will be coming back again.",5.0
"I am a sometimes-vegetarian that RARELY eats poultry but Purbird is the greatest place. I say that with unexaggerated sincerity for two reasons: their food is great and their service is great. Just great!!! So great in fact, that after discovering it, I went twice in one week.The menu is small but they do everything on it perfectly. My favorite item is the chicken burger with American cheese, and a side of jalapeño mash (always!!) and also a side of the green hot sauce. So amazing, and so cheap!! The burger is giant and costs like $6.00?? And will rival any beef burger for flavor and juiciness. And the jalapeño mash... So fresh-tasting and delicious. And the service! The nicest people work here. They are friendly and kind and quick and treat you as if you're a guest in their home. They learn your name! I would eat here every day.The ONLY reason I'm not giving Purbird 5 stars is because I wish they would add wings and fried chicken and beer to their menu and maybe they'll see this review and do that ;)Also to note: this place has outdoor seating and they don't mind if you bring your dog to an outdoor table, so I am counting it as a dog-friendly place to eat.",4.0
"Not your average chicken! We have been by this place too many times to count, but finally went in tonight. We were fools not to go in previously.We split a whole chicken and sides. The chicken is moist, extremely flavorful, with crispy skin. The sides are huge, we could have easily split one and still had plenty.The staff is extremely friendly and genuinely glad to have your business. We will definitely be going back.",5.0

"Very tasty, fresh food with consistently high level ingredients.  The charcoal broiled chicken is especially good when it comes in a little bit of the marinade juice to pour on to the rich mashed potatoes.  We like the salads topped with chicken and the beet-based salad is nutritious, delicious and good for two meals.  I hope this place thrives, as it is one restaurant where we can consistently count on the high quality of the chicken, the good taste of the food, and the integrity of the ingredients.  If you are watching your food intake, you can always score a good-for-you meal here.   I also recommend their beverage with fresh lemon juice, fresh mint and pomegranate as a refreshing and unusual flavor combination.  My one quibble is that some sides that would naturally complement each other are offered ala carte (e.g., the chicken breast and mashed potatoes) and prices can add up.",5.0

"Finally stopped by Purbird yesterday and after a quick chat with Christine, I opted for the half chicken and chopped romaine salad.

Boy was I wrong! I devoured every last bite (and shared a few with my dog- lucky dog!). The romaine salad was shockingly AMAZING (tons of fresh herbs and a light but very enjoyable lemon dressing). The chicken- like everyone has said- was one of the best I have ever had.I don't normally consider chicken a ""go to"" dish but in this case, it certainly is. The yummy homemade dipping sauces and flat-bread really topped the meal off. I enjoyed everything so much that I had to call Christine to thank her for dinner!",5.0
It's some of the best grilled chicken I've ever had--I kind of didn't know it could be this good and that's before you've even gotten to the sauces which run the gamut from sweet and tangy to spicy and creamy.  The macaroni and cheese is out of control too.  My wife's a vegetarian and loves the salads.  I too enjoy them when I steal a bite of hers but it's all about that bird.,5.0
"If you are looking for a really great meal (and deal) in Park Slope, run, don't walk, to Purbird! This place is amazing.

The chicken burgers, chicken breast sandwhich and the chicken wrap are all excellent as well. And they also make fantastic salads, much better than most places and I have eaten many salads! The sides and sauces are winners too. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have not been disappointed yet! The owner and staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating.

"Incredible. What's left to say that hasn't been said here already? Incredibly juicy and delicious chicken, amazing with chipotle. To-die-for mac and cheese. Great garlic bread. AND they deliver - and it was still hot and amazing when it arrived. The people who work there are super nice too. Great, great place, hands down.",5.0
If you want something quick and healthy purbird is good... the salad is not good for the cost.  The chicken is juicy.,3.0

"We tried Purbird while visiting Brooklyn and were pleased by the quality of the food and the service.  I had the chicken pie which was like the filling of a really good pot pie wrapped in a flaky crust, almost like phyllo dough but not quite that flaky.  It was really good.  My husband had a side of jalapeno mashed potatoes which he loved. Wish we had a Purbird where we live!",5.0
"okay, third time's a trend. this place is officially brilliant. armando, who greets me every time, may be the friendliest person in new york.",5.0
"The best grilled chicken I've ever had!! Ordered the 1/2 chicken. Definitely enough for two people, but I ate it all myself. Tender, moist, juicy, and full of flavor. Lots of meat and boneless (thanks Purbird). Had the house salad on the side--perfect veggies and a just-right vinaigrette, simple and tasty. I hope this place sticks around for a long time. It's hard to find succulent grilled chicken anywhere, let alone one that is organic and hormone-free. Also, very friendly kitchen staff and owner. So glad they're in the neighborhood.",5.0
"Finally stopped by Purbird yesterday and after a quick chat with Christine, I opted for the half chicken and chopped romaine salad. Secretly, I wasn't thrilled about the salad- but Christine insisted. (Right behind me, a guy was eating the most fragrant and delicious smelling fries...)  The portion was generous so I thought that I was going to save half of the chicken and salad for lunch the next day. Boy was I wrong! I devoured every last bite (and shared a few with my dog- lucky dog!). The romaine salad was shockingly AMAZING (tons of fresh herbs and a light but very enjoyable lemon dressing). The chicken- like everyone has said- was one of the best I have ever had.I don't normally consider chicken a ""go to"" dish but in this case, it certainly is. The yummy homemade dipping sauces and flat-bread really topped the meal off. I enjoyed everything so much that I had to call Christine to thank her for dinner!",5.0
It's some of the best grilled chicken I've ever had--I kind of didn't know it could be this good and that's before you've even gotten to the sauces which run the gamut from sweet and tangy to spicy and creamy.  The macaroni and cheese is out of control too.  My wife's a vegetarian and loves the salads.  I too enjoy them when I steal a bite of hers but it's all about that bird.,5.0
"If you are looking for a really great meal (and deal) in Park Slope, run, don't walk, to Purbird! This place is amazing. I am totally addicted; the chicken is grilled and cooked to perfection, it is always moist and tender. I seriously have never had a better chicken anywhere. The chicken burgers, chicken breast sandwhich and the chicken wrap are all excellent as well. And they also make fantastic salads, much better than most places and I have eaten many salads! The sides and sauces are winners too. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have not been disappointed yet! The owner and staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating.

"We love Purbird. We've ordered nearly weekly since they opened. The food is really great. However, we've never, ever received our entire order. Usually it's only one sauce or order of bread missing. But still. It's plain grilled chicken. It's all about the sauce!! Without it, you've got a sad night of take out ahead of you. The service is pretty discombobulated and it doesn't show any sign of improving.",3.0
"low key, great food, super nice service - doesn't oversell or undersell itself - all the chicken dishes we had were moist, juicy and delicious... you come here for the chicken and beer... forget the wine!",4.0
"This place has delicious food and super nice workers.  My boyfriend and I got half a flame-grilled chicken, which was as juicy as promised, along with some fantastic mac and cheese.  We also had the mashed sweet potatoes, which were a little too buttery for my taste but still very good.  The prices were great as we both left feeling very full and like we had eaten a high-quality meal.",5.0
"As the other reviews highlight, the food at Purbird is incredible. I'd be remiss, however, if I did not highlight the delivery service. It was raining heavily tonight and our food arrived perfectly warm (all the way out in Prospect Heights). The delivery man was soaked with a smile. I can't thank him enough.",5.0
"Love this place. FINALLY went there after months of passing by. Owner Christina so nice to me and my 9-month old baby. And the best chicken sandwich I have ever had. Do not pass up the brownie, which is cakey and delicious. I can't wait to try to the grilled chicken and sides.",5.0

"yum yum yum!! I always have the chicken wrap because not only is the chicken cooked to perfection, but it comes with the pickled onions, delicious sauce and the wrap is soft and fresh. The fries are great and they have had in the past home made unique flavors of ketchup. We also get the chicken burger which is also delicious. Don't think you can go wrong with this place for food!",4.0
