"What a lovely restaurant! The best Italian food I've had in New York! Everything was amazing: people who work there, ambience, wine, and of course the food! Gnocchi with butter and sage are indescribable, so so good.And don't forget the dessert, the tiramisu is a real melt-in-your-mouth experience",5.0
"Noodle pudding is definitely a Brooklyn heights gem. There's not even a visible sign from the outside for anyone to figure out the name of the restaurant. But you'll def know about it bc the restaurant gets filled with people night after night.   The service was excellent and our server was very attentive and patient. We stayed for almost 2.5 hours and he didn't give us the bill until we asked. Pretty uncommon in NYC restaurant scene if you asked me. We tried...- fettuccine with seafood: this had plenty of seafood. If you can take the heat, I would definitely try it with some red pepper flakes on side. The restaurant has a special kind where they dry their own. - gnocchi with butter sage sauce: this was the hit of the night. Sauce is so creamy and gnocchi is perfectly cooked! Definitely surprised me.",4.0
"Best place we have eaten in Brooklyn, great atmosphere, food and servers. We wish we had bough more cash for desert!",5.0
"Noodle Pudding is a charming rustic Italian cafe with a neighborhood friendly vibe. The majority of its menu is stellar and the prices are affordable, especially considering the location in Brooklyn Heights. It is CASH ONLY and has virtually no signage, so it has absolutely no qualms with doing its own thing. They're family friendly and have a great location near Brooklyn Bridge to continue a nice evening out. On one particular date night we showed up at 6 pm - they do NOT take reservations - but we were lucky enough to get a great table to by the window immediately (which they open up to the street in summer months). Service is a bit rushed, but super knowledgeable and try to give you space to have a good time.  We ordered:Tomatoes and stracciatella soft cheeseSpaghetti and stewed octopusSalmon and escaroleThe meal was excellent, with very fresh ingredients, superb execution, quickly delivered plates, and a lovely crusty rustic loaf of bread to sop up all the leftovers. They offer lots of seasonal and daily specials, which is awesome. If you're in the neighborhood and the wait isn't longer than 20 minutes, I'd say this is a great option.",4.0
"I loved the food, but getting a table is such a hassle, I'm not sure if it's worth it coming back just because of that. We came on a Wednesday close to 9pm. You would think it would be easy to get a table, but far from it. We had 6 in our group, and they refused to seat us anywhere else except the round table in the back. The previous group who occupied it ordered more food after paying their bill. I noticed there were also a lot of couples taking up entire 6 people tables.The food did make up for the annoying wait.Appetizers:Fried Whiting Fish - Must order. The fish was so flaky and came in two long skinny fishes. This was shareable among our group of 6, so don't listen if they encourage you to order more.Calamari - Always a good thing to order to share.Bruschetta - Portion size is small, only 4 small pieces. Came with olivesGarlic Bread - We also got complimentary bread, but still had to order the garlic bread. They put a lot of butter, cheese, and herbs on the bread to make it worth the $6.Pasta:Ricotta Gnocchi with Butter and Sage - Soft and pillowly. One of their popular dishes, so order this..Linguine al Pesto - They were out of linguine so subbed with fusilli, which I like better anyways. The pesto sauce coated the ridges well. Favorite pasta of the night.Rigatoni with Sausage and Meatball - This was my 2nd favorite pasta. Large chunks of mozzarella, delicious pasta, okay meatball, barely any sausage. Pasta with Broccoli Rabe - There were a lot of ingredients in this, but this wasn't my favorite pasta.How they handle seating and service could use some improvement, but the delicious food makes it 4 stars for me. As it says in most of the reviews, cash only.",4.0
"Good food is worth waiting for. Local, farm fresh organic and delicious Italian food without the pretentiousness. Warm, inviting staff. No sign out front but look for the hordes of people waiting. As a person that hates tomatoes when I come to Noodle Pudding I eat a whole plate of them. Their food is delicious and prepared and balanced excellently. Cash only. Service is attentive without being overbearing. It's simply the best Italian food in Dumbo and Brooklyn Heights.",5.0
"Very fantastic food and wine. Good for dinner only. Just a little noisy since too many people in a not-so-big restaurant. If you want to go, which I do recommend, bring CASH. This restaurant has decades of history and never accept credit cards.",5.0
"Came here last night for an exquisite dinner.Service: Great. My water glass was always filled, we never felt rushed to leave, and everyone was friendly.Food: Great. Minus the calamari appetizer which I found to be a bit too tough. But other than that small mishap it was all delicious. The bread with oil is a great complimentary starter. I had the half roasted chicken which was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. My boyfriend had the short ribs with polenta and that was just as good if not better! They have a nice wine selection as well.Great night with great food.",4.0
"Got here because someone recommended it. Read the menu and it said no Credit Cards accepted, so we almost left, I am glad we stayed the place and the food were great, fresh pasta good wine, delicious bread. You can tell its a place where people go and become regulars, they stay because the food is great and it's a place for conversation and enjoying your food, no rush.So, there's an ATM a block from there, get money out and enjoy this cozy place.",4.0
"I should smack myself for not having tried this restaurant until now.  I've been living in the neighborhood four years already, and for good reason, avoided most Brooklyn Heights restaurants, since I generally avoid Brooklyn Heights restaurants - especially on Montague Street.  I find them overpriced and just average.  Not so, with Noodle Pudding (which is not on Montague St, but on Henry St, incidentally), which serves a homestyle brand of Italian, at reasonable prices, with friendly service to match.  Although I'm not overly fond of their soft bread, it comes with a tomato, garlic EVOO dipping sauce which is fantastic.  I tried their fried sardines, which were perfect in consistency and seasoning.   Not greasy in the least.  The angel hair pomodoro was average, but at around, $11, I felt it was perfectly fine.  The shrimp and squash risotto of the day was flavorful and delicious.  This place is a gem, and I plan to return again.",4.0
"We haven't been to this area for dinner in a long time, it's a little out of the way usually.   Glad we made this trip though, it was totally worth it.  Parking around here is not easy, one should usually take the train.  We came on a Wednesday evening so we had no wait for a party of 2, which was quite nice.  The restaurant seems a lot more fancy than it actually is.  The waitstaff is uniformed in white shirts and the hosts are in suits.  However, once you're inside, everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back.  There is no pretentious air where the customers/staff look down on you if you're not in a suit, just a nice restaurant.We ended up ordering from the daily specials menu for both appetizers and entree.  The app was an oxtail ragut and the entree was grilled black bass served with Maine mussels, clams, and cherry tomatoes.   The oxtail ragut was served with ribbon pasta and it was just delicious.  There was a comfortable taste and feeling to it, it was basically comfort food.  Surprisingly, the dish was pretty filling and easily shareable for two people.  Then came the main seafood entree.  The bass was perfectly grilled and the meat was tender.  The fish had just enough texture that you can bite into it without it falling apart in your mouth.  The skin, my favorite part of a fish, was flavorful and crisp, magnificent.  The fish was surrounded by mussels and clams.  Only complain is the clams were about the size of my pinky nail, tiny clams, not satisfying.  Good thing the mussels more than made up for it.  The mussels were sweet, hearty, and flavorful being brewed in the seafood broth.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and would love to come back many times.",5.0
"Venue - Easy to miss because there's no real sign outside.

"How does this place have good reviews? The food is just ehhhh-ok (more toward the ehhhh.) Please try Forno Rosso (it blows this place away and has a better selection.) I've tried the same things at both places and certainly will not be back to Noodle Pudding, despite being only a few blocks away. Got lasagna, tagliatelle, gnocchi and the salumi cheese app- best thing was the salami on the app. The lasagna was decent, barely any sauce mostly meat and no cheese, but it was still not bad. The tagliatelle was a little under al dente, so it didn't really feel cooked and the gnocchi was luke warm which is a shame because it was in a butter sauce and no one wants to eat congealed butter. The service was also bad. My server first checked on us after our plates had been cleared for quite some time, we'd had empty drinks since the app- good thing I had a water bottle lol.Skip it... OH AND it's cash only.... Definitely skip itAlso forgot to mention the wait was an hour at 5:45 on a saturday- so get there when it opens or a bit before- if you must try this placeKids EVERYWHERE",2.0
"This place is amazing. I'm at a loss for words because my brain is scrambling to think of what to highlight first! Is it the pillowy gnochi?! That the g is silent in gnochi?!-How cooky!

Is it that the ""cheap"" wine is not ""cheap"" at all because that would be a negative, it is only $15 and mild and delicious? That the special of goat with goat cheese pasta was crafted on a whim and turned out to be excellent? That the waiter was so cool and laid back yet professional and informative? Oh.

"Noodle Pudding happens to be my 1000th Yelp review...it's been ten years since I started writing reviews and I wanted this one to be super special. I've been wanting to try Noodle Pudding for five years (what's been stopping me, I know), ever since I moved to Brooklyn Heights and a friend recommended this restaurant. I finally made it! My friend and I went for dinner on a Friday night. We knew to get there early since they don't take reservations, and we definitely just beat the crowd by arriving around 6pm. The restaurant is located on Henry Street near Henry's End, but it's a bit hard to find since it has no real sign. When you walk in, there is a small front dining area by the window, then tables near the bar, and a larger back section. Most of the tables are two or four tops, but larger groups can be accommodated. We started our meal with some prosecco, wine and garlic bread, which I really enjoyed. It had a bit of a spicy kick to it, which I liked though my friend found it a bit too overpowering. For our entrees, we took the recommendation of our friendly server and ordered some of the homemade pasta. I opted for the Fettuccine with Clams, Mussels, and Shrimp in a red sauce and my friend tried the Tagliatelle Bolognese. Both meals were nice-sized portions priced around $13 - $19. I loved my meal, but would have preferred a white sauce with the seafood. Though the restaurant was very busy and there was a line of people waiting to be seated, we never felt rushed. We even stayed for dessert, getting the Bread Pudding and a second round of cocktails. Overall, I really enjoyed my Noodle Pudding experience, but I wish they took credit cards.",4.0

Rest assured, what ever you order will be tasty at a minimum, but probably fantastic!  (Leave the credit card at home, they only take cash).",5.0
"CASH ONLY is a big turn-off for me. Went here on a Saturday date night and the place was slammed with families. Kids running around knocking things over, flashing sneaker lights, laser pointer toys and general yelling really killed the vibe. This place is the paper table cloth and saw dust on the floor type, which I wasn't getting from previous reviews. Food is okay. I don't think they're making all their noodles by hand other than the gnocchi, which was way too salty. For that reason, the menu seems overpriced.Bring your parents, who are probably the only people carrying cash these days anyway.",3.0
"Noodle Pudding is our favorite date night spot in Brooklyn Heights. They always have amazing, fresh specials (for appetizers, entrees, and sides) and all of their dishes are spot-on. Troy's service tonight compelled us to sit down and write a review - he (and all our servers in the past) have been extremely friendly, helpful, and courteous, offering honest recommendations and great service. Not too pricey at all, but the food is fantastic. The vibe there is also excellent. It's on the border of upscale, but not snotty or stuck up. It's classy but has a neighborhood, laid back feel.

Here I go again with 5 stars. Service is great. No rushing even with a line out the door (as there usually is). $5 red wine a bit too sweet for me. But palatable.

Salmon over escarole and white beans is a plate of heaven. Roasted chicken with potatoes was the best chicken myFriends ever had!

"Noodle Pudding is a delightful (yes, delightful!) Italian restaurant with an odd name.While checking out the DUMBO Arts Festival this weekend, my friends and I decided we were starving and needed food stat. I called a few restaurants but this had the shortest wait (we were quoted 40 minutes). Fortunately, it only ended up being about 10 minutes when we got there. The restaurant seemed really disorganized and frantic at first and a woman even collapsed outside the restaurant (she ended up being fine), so fire trucks came by. It was really bewildering and the owner/host seemed stressed. But as soon as we were seated, our experience was amazing. The waiter was funny and helpful, our wine was only $15 a bottle (the waiter mentioned the owner doesn't like to upcharge it as much as other places), and the food was honestly delicious. The pastas all had a twist that made the meal less conventional since Italian food can be more or less the same. They also have a number of daily specials with a focus on seafood. A little pricey, but worth it! What we ordered:*The calamari = Came with a spicy aioli sauce instead of marinara, which was a nice touch). This was awesome. *Seafood fettucine = Probably the best dish. It was tomato-based instead of Alfredo-based. *Pasta with broccoli rabe and clams = an interesting dish but the clams were a little too small and the rabe was very bitter. I think I preferred the fettucine though.*Tiramisu = consumed in 1 minute flat.I also have to sing praises about the free bread and olive oil.

"Brooklyn Heights is known for its strange dearth of quality restaurants -- but this place is the exception, and has been for years. Lively atmosphere, solid pastas, generally excellent fish, reasonably priced wines ... two thumbs up, which is a lot more than I'd say for most other places in the vicinity, including the ones that also have four stars on Yelp. Moving out of the hood soon after many years here, and it's really the only restaurant I'll truly miss.",5.0
"Noodle Pudding is a delightful (yes, delightful!) Italian restaurant with an odd name.While checking out the DUMBO Arts Festival this weekend, my friends and I decided we were starving and needed food stat. I called a few restaurants but this had the shortest wait (we were quoted 40 minutes). Fortunately, it only ended up being about 10 minutes when we got there. The restaurant seemed really disorganized and frantic at first and a woman even collapsed outside the restaurant (she ended up being fine), so fire trucks came by. It was really bewildering and the owner/host seemed stressed. But as soon as we were seated, our experience was amazing. The waiter was funny and helpful, our wine was only $15 a bottle (the waiter mentioned the owner doesn't like to upcharge it as much as other places), and the food was honestly delicious. The pastas all had a twist that made the meal less conventional since Italian food can be more or less the same. They also have a number of daily specials with a focus on seafood. A little pricey, but worth it! What we ordered:*The calamari = Came with a spicy aioli sauce instead of marinara, which was a nice touch). This was awesome. *Seafood fettucine = Probably the best dish. It was tomato-based instead of Alfredo-based. *Pasta with broccoli rabe and clams = an interesting dish but the clams were a little too small and the rabe was very bitter. I think I preferred the fettucine though.*Tiramisu = consumed in 1 minute flat.I also have to sing praises about the free bread and olive oil. BEST BREAD AND OLIVE OIL EVER.If you're in the area, definitely go here.",4.0
I'm so sorry but I have been coming here for years.  I think they have a new chef.  The food dosen't taste the same.  The wait staff is still great but I'm disappointed in the food.,3.0

"Noodle Pudding is the kind of restaurant every neighborhood needs. It has a courteous, attentive wait staff serving delicious Italian dishes (both from their regular menu and nightly specials) in a casual setting. I am particularly a fan of the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana, but have never been disappointed with any of my selections. For an appetizer, the calamari impresses, and for dessert the tiramisu is delicious (though I recommend reviewing all the options, as they serve seasonal treats too; I most recently had peaches with gelato and blueberry sauce...yum!). There is a bar as well, but I have always gone for dinner. This place is definitely one where you will go and most likely return again and again, if you live in the area.

"I came here on a Friday night and there were still tables available, which was great! I found the place to be a tad loud even though it wasn't full.To start, I got a baby arugula with beets and feta salad. It was a very refreshing salad, but it also isn't a very original idea. Enjoyed it nonetheless. As the main, I got the Fettuccine with mussels, clams and shrimp in a shellfish ragu. The dish was alright. I found the slices of garlic in the pasta sauce overwhelming every time it was in my biteful of pasta, I wished they were smaller pieces. The homemade fettucine was enjoyable, but not as good as other homemade pasta I've had. And the sauce was slightly fishy, but tolerable.

"I'm a neighborhood guy, grew up in the area and grew up with this place. I've eaten here pretty often in my lifetime. I've been holding off on the review hoping things would change but they have not, sadly. To start, the bartender, nice guy, could easily handle the few people at the bar. Few!, easily, but the demand of wine for the full floor keeps him from doing so. Maybe with that kinda wine demand, teach your servers to pour, and let them do so to save time, you guys have your bartender working his B@lls off for little return. Also, do something about the sound in there, put up some drapes or something, it sounds like a basketball court, feel like I'm at a Knicks game every time I go there. Generally I love the food there. The rabbit is hard to find anywhere and it's always good there, and not easy to find in NYC, so that I love, but they totally screwed my Risotto. On top of that, they had 86 two of the dishes we ordered. For a Saturday night, and the years they have been open, you would think they would have this on lock, and shouldn't have had an issue.

"Not worth it. The wait was so long as there was no reservation available. No place to sit while you wait. I stood and kept getting hit by the customers and waiters coming through.

I understand that pork belly has a lot of fat.. I've eaten it at a lot of places. But if I order the entree version, I expect some meat on it! The tagliatelle was less disappointing. It was a homecooked pasta, something you can make yourself. Not exciting. Not innovative. But this place isn't that.

My other complaint is that they don't take credit cards. Don't even get me started. A restaurant this successful, and they can't take a credit card in the 21st century. I wish the IRS had an app to report suspected tax fraud all over NYC for all of the restaurants and bars that won't take cards. It's time to get a clue, folks.

My other complaint is that they don't take credit cards. Don't even get me started. A restaurant this successful, and they can't take a credit card in the 21st century. I wish the IRS had an app to report suspected tax fraud all over NYC for all of the restaurants and bars that won't take cards. It's time to get a clue, folks. Using Square and an IPAD would be a nice start. Ok, I'm done preaching. The food is good, but take your credit card to Vinegar Hill Cafe and enjoy the convenience and the reservation.",3.0
"Homemade burratta was ridiculous (In a good way); gnocchi was light and fluffy; eggplant delicate, crispy and melt in your mouth ... Service friendly, warm and non-rushed (despite the madness of a line waiting for tables). Loved loved.",5.0
"Couldn't even eat here because we were waiting for ten minutes to be seated. It was not that the place was busy because there were tons of tables available but that the host just never helped us.

It was a bunch of olives spread out (some good, some bad) amongst a few chunks of parmesan cheese, ruggedly sliced salami (which tasted sour and like supermarket quality) and these little pretzel things. Halfway through our cheese plate, the entrees came out. The waitress was upset that someone served it too soon and topped off our wine towards the end of the meal which was nice.

"What is a noodle pudding? Haha. I don't know why this restaurant is called Noodle Pudding, they certainly did not have puddings made out of noodles, but they did have delicious pasta indeed.Its really popular, even on a Thursday night, there was a short line. You can wait at the bar if you want to. Its kinda open to the outside, so we could feel the outdoor breeze. The bread that they serve comes with the most delicious olive oil ever. We ate all the bread and asked for more.I ordered the fettuccine with mussels, clams and shrimp in a shellfish ragu. It was delicious. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the shellfish didn't cause a stomachache. The portions are pretty good too. We also ordered the $1 meatballs (make sure you look at the bar, there is a special bar menu but you can order those items at your table). If I had room, I would have tried the $1 rice balls as well.

"This place is fantastic. Service is exceptional, very professional, patient and attentive. The food is simply delicious. The only reason why I gave this a 4 and not a 5 is because of the bread and a little too much salt and spicy in the food. For such a great place, the bread offering needs to be improved. It didnt taste fresh and was a bit too dry. I had an order or calimari, which was outstanding, possibly the best calimari I ever had. The only problem is that too much salt was added to the coating and something was spicy. Less salt and no hot pepper will make it perfect. I also ordered the black sea bass, which again, was delicious, but there was something really spicy on there that the dish just did not need. On a light and delicious fish like that, anything spicy should be on the side so the person can adjust the intake. I dont like spicy fish. These are all minor things, that a conversation with the waiter ahead of time can sort out. Otherwise, this restaurant is quaint and inviting.

"Strange name, no sign out front, cash only, very loud.  But the food was good. Although I know I didn't choose the most representative menu choice - hangar steak and wedge salad.  The steak was good and cooked properly on the inside.  But the outside was over charred for me.  I still enjoyed most of it.  The bread and oil served when I sat down was superb!  The oil had chunks of red peppers and spices.  And the bread was very fresh and just plain good!  And for desert I had a chocolate cappuccino cake that was super delicious.  It was closer to a flourless cake.  It paired very well with my after dinner glass of super tuscan - which was really good also!The bar is very small.  It fits 7 people.  There are tables that face the outside with giant opened windows.  So that is nice.  The dining room decor and setting is quite comfortable - except for the super lively and loud crowd.  And the service was good.But what is the deal with all these NYC restaurants that don't take credit cards?  For that reason alone I won't be returning here.  Especially as a business traveler whose charges are automatically identified and reimbursed by my company through use of my corporate card.  Instead I have to 1) find an ATM 2) take out my own money 3) fill out paperwork to be reimbursed.  Who carries cash anymore?   This is an inconvenience that isn't worth it in a city full of great restaurants.  I'd give it 3 1/2 stars but Yelp doesn't allow that.

"Such a cute spot, great food but terrible service. Our server only gave us one menu between 4 of us and we waited a considerable length of time for him to take our orders. The rest of the party had got there earlier and already had drinks so I ordered a glass of wine with my food. When the food came I had to ask again for the wine, no apology. Slow service in between courses taking away our plates. Before dessert our wine glasses were take away without being asked if we cared for more. After around 15mins we had to ask for the dessert menu which took a further 10mins to arrive and then another 10mins for us to get the servers attention to order. Such a shame as aside from the terrible service everything else was great.

"This is our favorite Brooklyn spot!

The mussels were in a spicy tomatoe sauce that I just scopped up in every mussel and slurped it down.Leslie had some pasta dish that was also very fresh tasting and reminded me to just get pasta, instead of my previous choices.The one thing that I was annoying with was they said 2o minutes for a table which wound up being like 45.",4.0

"The boy had never walked the Brooklyn Bridge, so I made him cross it this past Sunday to catch the sunset he wanted to see the night before. Halfway across the bridge, the McDonald's he'd had on his way out of Bayside caught up with him: soda and coffee toyed with his bladder and I was hungry so we decided to find somewhere to eat close by. Yay for the Yelp app!Actually, I had neglected to notice Noodle Pudding was cash-only, and we almost missed the restaurant like other reviewers, because the address and establishment sign are inside the restaurant instead of outside...please explain yourself, Noodle Pudding. We were seated, I opened the menu, rifled through my wallet, and then waited for Scott to come back from the bathroom to ask him if he had cash on him. Back to the smartphones we went. We left without a word, and wandered back in a half hour later. The host greeted us, ""You're back!""""Yeah, we had to go to the bank.""""In Manhattan?""The nearest Chase ATM is at the Duane Reade on Court (the actual, ornate Chase branch on Montague was impossible to get into despite its beckoning blue ATM light). Capital One was nowhere to be found, so I paid for dinner. We tipped a little extra, because I didn't feel like asking for a 5 and singles to break my 10 in change, which is fine since our waiter acted as a living water fountain and we are very thirsty people, and service was prompt and courteous.We cracked open the menu a second time, and realized we had little to no idea what we were looking at...and Noodle Pudding's spelling is questionable sometimes. The waiter asked if we needed some help, and I informed him I don't eat pigs or cows - he walked me very quickly through the entire menu. Once in a while, though, I delight in being boring as can be. I love a good, interesting meal, but food doesn't always have to be out of the ordinary to hit that magical sweet spot. The preamble is to prepare you for the fact that after all that, I ordered Capelli D'Angelo Al Pomodoro, otherwise known as angelhair in tomato sauce. With a sandstorm's dusting of Parmesan, I was a happy girl. This was after I ate 5/6 of the bread and olive oil. Scott was more adventurous and got the fettucine with mussels, clams, and shrimp. He was full, I had finished off my entire pasta dish, but I couldn't shake the craving for dessert.The host found us first. Did Noodle Pudding have a dessert menu? Why yes, would we like to see it? Of course. The waiter: ""There are no pigs and cows on this menu, by the way."" Haha, okay. We opted to split the hazelnut gelato and the espresso chocolate cake, which must have been flourless because it was closer to a delicious fudge than a real cake, rich with coffee. The hazelnut gelato was flavorful and wonderfully nutty, but I wonder if it took a minute too long to be served (or if the glass dish it was served in was still hot from its last cleaning) because it had melted along the edges more than I thought it would. We heartily enjoyed both desserts anyway, and since I am now owed a dinner, I might find my way back over here again.",4.0

Yay for the Yelp app!Actually, I had neglected to notice Noodle Pudding was cash-only, and we almost missed the restaurant like other reviewers, because the address and establishment sign are inside the restaurant instead of outside...please explain yourself, Noodle Pudding. We were seated, I opened the menu, rifled through my wallet, and then waited for Scott to come back from the bathroom to ask him if he had cash on him. Back to the smartphones we went. We left without a word, and wandered back in a half hour later. The host greeted us, ""You're back!""""Yeah, we had to go to the bank.""""In Manhattan?""The nearest Chase ATM is at the Duane Reade on Court (the actual, ornate Chase branch on Montague was impossible to get into despite its beckoning blue ATM light). Capital One was nowhere to be found, so I paid for dinner. We tipped a little extra, because I didn't feel like asking for a 5 and singles to break my 10 in change, which is fine since our waiter acted as a living water fountain and we are very thirsty people, and service was prompt and courteous.We cracked open the menu a second time, and realized we had little to no idea what we were looking at...and Noodle Pudding's spelling is questionable sometimes. The waiter asked if we needed some help, and I informed him I don't eat pigs or cows - he walked me very quickly through the entire menu. Once in a while, though, I delight in being boring as can be. I love a good, interesting meal, but food doesn't always have to be out of the ordinary to hit that magical sweet spot. The preamble is to prepare you for the fact that after all that, I ordered Capelli D'Angelo Al Pomodoro, otherwise known as angelhair in tomato sauce. With a sandstorm's dusting of Parmesan, I was a happy girl. This was after I ate 5/6 of the bread and olive oil. Scott was more adventurous and got the fettucine with mussels, clams, and shrimp. He was full, I had finished off my entire pasta dish, but I couldn't shake the craving for dessert.The host found us first. Did Noodle Pudding have a dessert menu? Why yes, would we like to see it? Of course. The waiter: ""There are no pigs and cows on this menu, by the way."" Haha, okay. We opted to split the hazelnut gelato and the espresso chocolate cake, which must have been flourless because it was closer to a delicious fudge than a real cake, rich with coffee. The hazelnut gelato was flavorful and wonderfully nutty, but I wonder if it took a minute too long to be served (or if the glass dish it was served in was still hot from its last cleaning) because it had melted along the edges more than I thought it would. We heartily enjoyed both desserts anyway, and since I am now owed a dinner, I might find my way back over here again.",4.0
"This place is great! Excellent food, bustling atmosphere, and friendly wait staff. The bread and whatever-it-is-that-they-give-you-to-dip-the-bread-in were the highlights of the meal, but our entrees were also very good. We will certainly be coming back.",4.0

"I came here with my family while they were visiting me in NY. We planned out a schedule for dinner each night but the last, saving that night for a return trip to our favorite place of the week. We unanimously voted on returning to Noodle Pudding.The staff was delightful, and the mood of the restaurant had such an authentic feel to it. It felt like being at home.And then the food. So. So. Good. The fish! The vegetables! The pasta! I would have been happy with just the bread and olive oil they served up before the meal. I would recommend ordering family style so everyone can taste everything. Highlights were the diver scallops wrapped in pancetta and the bruschetta al Ischitana, as well as the blowfish, shrimp linguini... and everything else we ate. For dessert we ordered four things (espresso cake and panna cotta stood out) for the table and it was the most heavenly 10 minutes of our entire trip.I also highly appreciated their wine selection, including the $15 bottle on the menu. I would recommend putting the $30 you save by ordering that for the table toward a filet of the fresh-caught fish of the day. Fish that good is a rarity. It was absolutely perfect.",5.0

"My friends and I came here last Friday night, and I was really disappointed with the quality of food and the price. First things first, though, I will admit that we didn't order ""smartly:"" I got a fish dish, one of my friends got duck, and the other got the tagliatelle bolognese. Here are my tips based on this experience: 1) DON'T waste time and money on the appetizers. The bread and oil is quite good (not the best quality olive oil, but it's free so whatever), and the apps just weren't worth the money.2) DON'T order anything other than pasta, and have a backup plan in case they're sold out. I ordered gnocchi, but 15 minutes after I ordered the waiter came back to tell me that they had run out. I ended up ordering salmon trout which was so mediocre I got a burger from shake shack after we ate here. (Don't judge me, I have needs). 3) DO bring cash, and lots of it.

"The food was pretty good here, but the service was awful.  I was really surprised since it has gotten good reviews on this site.  We chose this place to eat because it's near Brooklyn Bridge Park and we wanted to go see the Manhattan skyline at night after dinner.  When we got there, the hostess (very sullen) said it would be a 45 minute wait.  At the end of the wait, when we asked if our table was ready, she pointed to a huge table that was being cleared off.  Apparently, she thought we were a party of 10...we were a party of 3.  So we ended up waiting another 20-25 minutes to be seated.  After we got our table, which was very pretty and at the front of the restaurant near the large open window, we had to wait forever for our server to bring us anything and take our orders.  I had gotten used to a slower pace of service while in NYC, but this was ridiculous.  At the end of the meal, our server brought a dessert menu and then never came back to ask if we wanted anything.  We had to flag down another server to ask for our check.  And even then, it took another 10-15 minutes for our server to come back.  When we left, not a single server or host even looked at us.  I don't expect people to trip over themselves in gratitude for our business, but for no one to thank us for coming or inquire if we enjoyed our meal...especially after we had waited so long...was crazy to me.  All in all, we were there for 3 hours and didn't leave until 11:30pm.  The ambiance in the restaurant was very pretty and the food was good, so that made it not a total bust.  But, my friends and I were very disappointed that this was our last dinner in NYC.  Maybe we just came when they were having an off night, but regardless of how busy you are (and they weren't that busy) servers should be visible and available to their tables.  I would not go back and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone else do so.",2.0
"With so many options - why would anyone ever go to the same restaurant twice? Noodle Pudding's answer is their gregarious owner and clientele. The italian food is medicare to good depending on your dish BUT there is always something going on here to capture your attention.

"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night for a party of six. Initially I read reviews and learned that this was an Italian restaurant with an intriguing name.Seated promptly, I ordered the red wine carafes since I wasn't sure how bad the bill was going to be at the end of the night (and I had cash ready in my moth filled wallet). This was very good considering the price. While osso buco, bass, mussels and pasta dishes were absolutely delicious (see photos), the fact that they had liver on the menu damned me. I ordered the calf liver, took 3 bites and reminded myself: ""it's still effing liver."" This would have been a strong 4 star restaurant, but if you're going to put liver on the menu (a bold move) it better be good. Too bad liver sucks any way you make it.

"The food was pretty good here, but the service was awful.  I was really surprised since it has gotten good reviews on this site.  We chose this place to eat because it's near Brooklyn Bridge Park and we wanted to go see the Manhattan skyline at night after dinner.  When we got there, the hostess (very sullen) said it would be a 45 minute wait.  At the end of the wait, when we asked if our table was ready, she pointed to a huge table that was being cleared off.  Apparently, she thought we were a party of 10...we were a party of 3.  So we ended up waiting another 20-25 minutes to be seated.  After we got our table, which was very pretty and at the front of the restaurant near the large open window, we had to wait forever for our server to bring us anything and take our orders.  I had gotten used to a slower pace of service while in NYC, but this was ridiculous.  At the end of the meal, our server brought a dessert menu and then never came back to ask if we wanted anything.  We had to flag down another server to ask for our check.  And even then, it took another 10-15 minutes for our server to come back.  When we left, not a single server or host even looked at us.  I don't expect people to trip over themselves in gratitude for our business, but for no one to thank us for coming or inquire if we enjoyed our meal...especially after we had waited so long...was crazy to me.  All in all, we were there for 3 hours and didn't leave until 11:30pm.  The ambiance in the restaurant was very pretty and the food was good, so that made it not a total bust.  But, my friends and I were very disappointed that this was our last dinner in NYC.  Maybe we just came when they were having an off night, but regardless of how busy you are (and they weren't that busy) servers should be visible and available to their tables.  I would not go back and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone else do so.",2.0
"With so many options - why would anyone ever go to the same restaurant twice? Noodle Pudding's answer is their gregarious owner and clientele. The italian food is medicare to good depending on your dish BUT there is always something going on here to capture your attention. They held an impromptue Operetta with a few local performers who were dining during with us the last time I ate here. Overall the food should be rated 3 starts, but the atmosphere is a solid 4.",4.0
"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night for a party of six. Initially I read reviews and learned that this was an Italian restaurant with an intriguing name.Seated promptly, I ordered the red wine carafes since I wasn't sure how bad the bill was going to be at the end of the night (and I had cash ready in my moth filled wallet). This was very good considering the price. While osso buco, bass, mussels and pasta dishes were absolutely delicious (see photos), the fact that they had liver on the menu damned me. I ordered the calf liver, took 3 bites and reminded myself: ""it's still effing liver."" This would have been a strong 4 star restaurant, but if you're going to put liver on the menu (a bold move) it better be good. Too bad liver sucks any way you make it. I would return for the other savory entrees.IFHTP 1",3.0
"Noodle pudding is my favorite restaurant. I've been to all high end fancy restaurants noodle has them beat hands down. Antonio is a Magician in the kitchen. The bolognese is out of this world, the reason everything is so good is because he puts his heart and soul Into every dish. Nothing is bad on this menu. Highly recommended.",5.0

"Came here on a Sunday waited almost an hour to be seated, the food was nothing to brag about, I was very disapointed we ordered quite a few dishes and not one was good, the gnocchi was very bland and flavorless  along with everything else we ordered. I'm giving it the second star because the bread and olive oil was very good  but not enough to be returning  save your money",2.0
"My friend was visiting from out of town and after not being quite sure where the restaurant was, we found Noodle Pudding :) What a wonderful surprise. We'd heard good things but this exceeded all expectations. It was a Saturday night, we were told there would be a 20 minute wait (that was accurate) and we're glad we stuck around. The place was super busy but the wait staff was very attentive. We ordered the endive salad, the fettuccine with seafood, and the pappardelle with oxtail ragu. After getting the complimentary bread and olive oil, we got our entrees (seriously- like 10 minutes later). My friend mentioned that we hadn't gotten the salad we ordered and the waiter was suuuuuper apologetic and said he would make it up to us. This is where things went from delicious to spectacular. In addition to the great entrees (the dishes were well seasoned, piping hot, the pasta was house made, the oxtail meat was tender...), we also got the following complimentary items: a fava bean side dish, two desserts, and two cappuccinos. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed every moment of our evening. What a great way for us to spend a Saturday night. We'll definitely be coming back and highly recommend others give the restaurant a try.",5.0

"Like everyone else, we almost walked past this restaurant, as there is no sign at all, but I'm so glad we found it and went in! We got there around 5:15, not realizing they didn't open until 5:30, but they were nice enough to let us sit and chill at a table until they opened. The complimentary bread was so, so delicious, as were the peppers...the name of which I can't remember, but they were like spicy grilled peppers. Good stuff. My friend said their gluten-free pasta was solid, but my tagliatelle bolognese was so good, it was like the pasta melted in my mouth! The best part of the meal, by far, though, was the dessert. They had a basil pannacotta with strawberries on the menu. When I let our waiter know I'm allergic to strawberries and asked if I could just have the pannacotta, he said, ""I'll see what I can do"" and brought out the best dessert I've ever had. INCREDIBLE basil panacotta with honey and red and golden raspberries. Oh. My. God. So unreal. The last few days we've just kept talking about the panacotta. If you go, you MUST get it!",5.0

I'll start with the food. I ordered a pasta dish with Bolognese sauce, and everything about it was on target.  If you're not familiar with Bolognese, it's essentially Marinara sauce (or some similar tomato-based sauce) typically mixed with sausage and/or beef. This rendition was served over Campanelle pasta... you know, kinda like the wavy shaped pasta that was in the now discontinued Chef Boyardee Roller Coasters. Well, let me tell you-- the meal was awesome.... and leaps and bounds above a Chef Boyardee meal. The sauce was seasoned and spiced perfectly, and the meat melted in my mouth. Vinny ordered a pasta dish as well and was equally pleased with his choice. As for the service, it was spot on and impeccable. In fact, we could tell that our waitress was having a bad night (earlier we saw her accidentally mess up an order and get scolded by a manager), but she kept a smile on her face the entire time and was attentive throughout the evening. In fact, she could sense that we were sympathetic, and I think we helped make her feel a little better. The ambiance at Noodle Pudding is nice as well-- intimate and classy yet rustic with low light-- perfect for a romantic night out. I was a little surprised to see so many couples bring their kids in, but they all seemed well-behaved, so it didn't bother me too much.",5.0

Told that there was a 20 minute wait which ended up being an 45 minutes to an hour. The host/bartender service isn't the best; took us 20 minutes to order a bottle of wine at the bar; $29 bottle of Cab Franc. The way the seat people is confusing. People who had just walked in the restaurant would get seated right away and we had been sitting there for 45 minutes. They don't take reservations so you have to just got there and wait.

"3.5 stars.Being a New Yorker for nearly a decade and not walking the Brooklyn Bridge is blasphemous that upon my return to my hometown, it prompted me to go get this must-do-in-NYC over with.  As a reward, I trusted fellow Yelpers and walked a short distance post-bridge to Noodle Pudding.I am not sure how much it was a reward.  When we arrived to the restaurant, it took 10 minutes of standing in the restaurant clueless before a waiter seated us.  Then it took 10 minutes of sitting down waiting for our waiter to come.  You know where this is going--practically every step of the dining experience (order, getting bread, asking for pepper/cheese) was well-separated with 5-10 minutes of lag time.  Overall, the service was sub-par.On the other hand, the entrees (gnocchi with butter and sage and the papardelle special) were tasty.  We ended the meal with a decent expresso semifreddo.Aside from the many ""little"" waits, Noodle Pudding is simply a charming cash-only (which is a bit questionable considering the prices of the dishes) eatery with good Italian food.",3.0

We started with a fava bean and dandelion green side that was heavenly.  I had a pasta special that had smoked mozzarella perfection on it!!

It was perfection!!! We will certainly be coming back!",4.0

"AMAZEBALLS!!Noodle Pudding is everything you'd want in a homey Italian unpretentious neighborhood restaurant. From the dimly lit dining room to the quaint decorations in the bathroom, everything is set to make you feel like you stepped into a warm and inviting environment. Peruse the main menu, which is fairly small, to the daily specials, which is large and diverse and really get a feel of what you want before ordering. Last night, some friends and I shared the Mushroom Tortellini (a daily special), which was some of the best pasta I ever had with a very light and perfectly salted mushroom sauce with chopped, firm mushrooms. I had the Fettuccine with Seafood Ragu, which had ample seafood with giant Mussels. My friends had Rigatoni with Eggplant and Ricotta and the Fluke with white beans (a daily special, I think). The bread with sun-dried tomato and olive oil dipping sauce that came at the start of the meal was divine. I was trying my best not to scarf all of it down, taking more than my friends and filling me up before the real meal. The Pear and Ricotta cheesecake that our waiter suggested was divine.

"2 things you need to know about Noodle Pudding. 1) The food is good. 2) There is definitely something strange when it comes to the hospitality. I totally understand the negative comments from other posters after eating there for the first time.  When you first walk in, you just stand there.  Nobody acknowledges your presence and its like you have to know something to be noticed. Two well dressed, groomed and polite patrons seem like a layup customer to me, especially right at the opening before you are really busy. I can't find any downside to making people feel welcome, but hey I don't own a restaurant, so what do I know.   It could also be that all their good food makes up for this shortcoming in the eyes of their patrons. This place is seemingly proof positive that a fair segment of the population is willing to overlook certain idiosyncrasies in favor of a tasty meal (the food WAS good).  Me personally I am somewhere in the middle. I'm not completely put off by my experience, but I doubt I'll be in a rush to go back.  Instead I'll keep trying new spots, and rewarding those that have BOTH good food and service with my patronage dollars. For me Noodle Pudding will have trouble becoming a favorite destination since I'm past the point in life (high school) where I feel the need to impress someone I don't know simply to feel like I belong. A note on the service: It was VERY hit or miss. Our first waiter asked if we were ready 3 times within 10 minutes of our arrival. Both of our menu's were still open... and we were clearly discussing our options every time he came over. What's the rush, really, I must know... it's not like your shift is about to end (you just opened) and you don't have other tables to wait on so please enlighten me.  Our 2nd waiter (who seemed to take over for the first on his own) was MUCH better.

"Sunday afternoon a little after they opened at 5pm. There were a few people in there at tables. I got a table right away. This place filed up very quickly. When I left there was a small line outside the door.I did have to wait for bread & oil which came out after my appetizer. I think that should have been the first thing placed on the table besides a glass of water. I ordered the fresh mozzarella for an appetizer, it was good enough for two people to eat. On the plate was 4 pieces of fresh mozzarella, 6 slices of tomato, & some fresh greens & olives. For my main dish I ordered the Rigatoni with Eggplant, it was good but the pasta was a bit undercooked. I was disappointed with the portion. Any italian place I've been too theres always like entire meal to take home, not here. For dessert I ordered the taramusi, I was very disappointed it was watery not fluffy or moose like. It tasted like it was watered down & not much flavor. The service was ok, my waiter never even asked me how my meal was! I know it did get busy in there fast but at least ask how I'm doing.As for price for the amount of food I got & the service it was not worth $40. **CASH ONLY**",2.0

"God this place has gone downhill.  As you can see from my previous reviews, I really loved this place.  I don't give out too many 1-stars, but this place finally warrants one.  My glass of water from the beginning to the end, refilled only ONCE.  I had the Caesar salad as an app and the seafood fettuccine as my entree.  15 minutes after being seated, the bread comes out.  20 minutes after that, my salad.  45 minutes after that my entree.  At this point, I was so disgusted, I asked the check, paid and then left.  I thought this was a one-off experience but some friends that went recently encountered the same thing.Also, they've completely redone their dessert menu and have left off essentials such as cheesecake and tiramisu.  I will never be going back.*",1.0
"4 stars for the food, 3 stars for the service = 3.5 stars.  It's been awhile since I've dined here, but I was certainly glad we decided to take our visiting friends here for a cheap bottle of wine and simple, fresh Italian cuisine.  Calamari, braised octopus, gnocchi, grilled chicken, and risotto special were all very straight forward dishes (what I expect from Noodle Pudding after previous meals here).",4.0
"To be fair, I can understand where the negative customer-service reviews are coming from. The scene upon entering can be daunting for a first-time diner, as there's almost always a line and no host(ess) to speak of. There is, instead, a list held by one of the waiters and if you get on it, you'll find that the wait time is generally no longer than half an hour. If you're not dying of hunger, waiting it out at a local bar is well worth it.When seated, you'll find the waitstaff straight-forward, friendly and helpful, albeit, VERY busy. I've never been to this restaurant and NOT seen it full (even immediately following Hurricane Sandy), and it's important to note that there's a reason for that. This place is very much a local favorite, and there are frequent regulars that get their due attention. After our third visit, one of the waiters who most commonly holds the coveted list recognized my boyfriend as well, and it's nice to know that that many visits warrants a lasting (positive!) impression as well.As for the post important part, the food: excellent all around. I firmly believe the negative reviews about the food show an overall lack of knowledge about authentic Italian cuisine on the part of the reviewers. If you came looking for a fried chicken cutlet covered in cheese, you definitely chose the wrong place. I've had the risotto, the pasta, and the steak (in addition to a number of appetizers, including the sardines) and I've been very happy with everything I've tried. The wine selection is consistent and the house wines are completely acceptable (though, as with most places, the better vintage is sold only by the bottle). To date, my favorite dish is any of the seafood specials, as they handle shellfish preparation excellently here (no drowned oysters and the like). All dishes are prepared to bring out the best of the main ingredients and not overpower them; you can taste your steak, appreciate the homemade texture of your pasta, and little touches like adding chili peppers to the olive oil make the experience unique and memorable. Dessert is similarly delicious. I for one will be very sad to see the pumpkin panna cotta (which I suspect to be a seasonal offering) go.In short, be patient, bring cash, and you will not be disappointed.",4.0
"Prompt service, remarkable food, great desserts. The restaurant itself gets a lot of street noise when the bay doors are open in nice weather. But that goes for most restaurants in NYC. I had the sliced chicken breast with summer salad. It was tender and well seasoned. The salad was very unique and a good balance to the chicken. For dessert, I had some hazelnut chocolate thing. It was a nice not-too-sweet end to a great meal. I also had the calamari and octopus for appetizers, which were flavorful and...well...appetizing. I'd give it five stars if they could figure out a way to make the space more comfortable and less noisy.",4.0

For my main dish I ordered the Rigatoni with Eggplant, it was good but the pasta was a bit undercooked. I was disappointed with the portion. Any italian place I've been too theres always like entire meal to take home, not here. For dessert I ordered the taramusi, I was very disappointed it was watery not fluffy or moose like. It tasted like it was watered down & not much flavor. The service was ok, my waiter never even asked me how my meal was! I know it did get busy in there fast but at least ask how I'm doing.As for price for the amount of food I got & the service it was not worth $40. **CASH ONLY**",2.0
"After high recommendations, I was disappointed. Caesar salad tasted like they forgot to put the dressing on it. Service was slow, and the bottle of wine we ordered never showed up. The hanger steak special was the highlight of the visit.",2.0
"God this place has gone downhill.  As you can see from my previous reviews, I really loved this place.  I don't give out too many 1-stars, but this place finally warrants one.  My glass of water from the beginning to the end, refilled only ONCE.  I had the Caesar salad as an app and the seafood fettuccine as my entree.  15 minutes after being seated, the bread comes out.  20 minutes after that, my salad.  45 minutes after that my entree.  At this point, I was so disgusted, I asked the check, paid and then left.  I thought this was a one-off experience but some friends that went recently encountered the same thing.Also, they've completely redone their dessert menu and have left off essentials such as cheesecake and tiramisu.  I will never be going back.*",1.0
"4 stars for the food, 3 stars for the service = 3.5 stars.  It's been awhile since I've dined here, but I was certainly glad we decided to take our visiting friends here for a cheap bottle of wine and simple, fresh Italian cuisine.  Calamari, braised octopus, gnocchi, grilled chicken, and risotto special were all very straight forward dishes (what I expect from Noodle Pudding after previous meals here).",4.0
"To be fair, I can understand where the negative customer-service reviews are coming from. The scene upon entering can be daunting for a first-time diner, as there's almost always a line and no host(ess) to speak of. There is, instead, a list held by one of the waiters and if you get on it, you'll find that the wait time is generally no longer than half an hour. If you're not dying of hunger, waiting it out at a local bar is well worth it.When seated, you'll find the waitstaff straight-forward, friendly and helpful, albeit, VERY busy. I've never been to this restaurant and NOT seen it full (even immediately following Hurricane Sandy), and it's important to note that there's a reason for that. This place is very much a local favorite, and there are frequent regulars that get their due attention. After our third visit, one of the waiters who most commonly holds the coveted list recognized my boyfriend as well, and it's nice to know that that many visits warrants a lasting (positive!) impression as well.As for the post important part, the food: excellent all around. I firmly believe the negative reviews about the food show an overall lack of knowledge about authentic Italian cuisine on the part of the reviewers. If you came looking for a fried chicken cutlet covered in cheese, you definitely chose the wrong place. I've had the risotto, the pasta, and the steak (in addition to a number of appetizers, including the sardines) and I've been very happy with everything I've tried. The wine selection is consistent and the house wines are completely acceptable (though, as with most places, the better vintage is sold only by the bottle). To date, my favorite dish is any of the seafood specials, as they handle shellfish preparation excellently here (no drowned oysters and the like). All dishes are prepared to bring out the best of the main ingredients and not overpower them; you can taste your steak, appreciate the homemade texture of your pasta, and little touches like adding chili peppers to the olive oil make the experience unique and memorable. Dessert is similarly delicious. I for one will be very sad to see the pumpkin panna cotta (which I suspect to be a seasonal offering) go.In short, be patient, bring cash, and you will not be disappointed.",4.0
"Prompt service, remarkable food, great desserts. The restaurant itself gets a lot of street noise when the bay doors are open in nice weather. But that goes for most restaurants in NYC. I had the sliced chicken breast with summer salad. It was tender and well seasoned. The salad was very unique and a good balance to the chicken. For dessert, I had some hazelnut chocolate thing. It was a nice not-too-sweet end to a great meal. I also had the calamari and octopus for appetizers, which were flavorful and...well...appetizing. I'd give it five stars if they could figure out a way to make the space more comfortable and less noisy.",4.0
"This place is pretty darn good.  I came on a super rainy night, and given that my friend hadn't yet arrived, I was able to snag a seat beforehand (a lot of NYC restaurants don't let you do that).  It would have been nice to have been asked, but I had to request it.  In either case, my waiter was very excellent.  The free bread in the beginning is just so delicious with their olive oil concoction.  I want to know how to make it because it's probably the best olive oil dip I have ever tried.  I also ordered the pasta (with eggplant and tomatoes) and I just loved the big FAT pasta.  So yumz.  My friend ordered the clams which looked delicious, and they give you a generous amount.  All in all I believe I would definitely return.",4.0
"As I browse through the reviews, it appears that this restaurant is a bit hit or miss. Sad face.Imagine a party of two on a Saturday night. We give our name to one of the staff members who tells us it will be a thirty minute wait, which was more or less accurate. There is nowhere to sit outside and wait. Your options are the street curb or on top of someone else's car. What are you left with? Standing and watching people eat their food. So we wait, we get seated. Our server is very knowledgeable about the menu. We order the golden beet salad that comes with olives, the hand rolled whole wheat pennette dish, and a pasta dish with sausage and veggies on the specials menu.  Before our meal arrived, we were served a small portion of bread with some olive dip. Now, that was pretty good. The salad was gross. Something was not right. Ew. My whole wheat pasta dish tasted a bit undercooked (or maybe the texture is that way because of being whole wheat?) and my date's dish was pretty good (I had a little taste of the pasta and he finished his plate).In the middle of our discussion (not recommended at this joint as the noise level is loud), two male staff members got into a verbal argument. I am not joking. I couldn't quite make what happened but one staff member threatened to physically assault the other one. Very unprofessional. The two were separated but later on one staff member (who is probably either the manager or floor manager or something) decides for the two men to explain what happened...INSIDE the restaurant. Wouldn't it be common sense to take it outside and discuss?! So more yelling, angry faces, finger pointing, etc. Needless to say, one of those guys was our server and we didn't see him again that night. Overall, we were disappointed. Boo. Oh, and P.S.

"One of the best Italian places I've been to, and without a doubt the best for the money.

Its something that can easily come out rubbery and gross if not done right, but they do it perfectly, its incredible. I got a mushroom ravioli that was over-the-top delicious; very mushroomy with lots of other little flavors darting in and out. The pastas in general are very good, as was the gnocchi, which was perfectly cooked. The service is friendly and helpful, and the place has a nice low-lit, classy but casual atmosphere; good for a date or a group of friends/family.",5.0

"I recently moved to downtown Brooklyn and needed a place to have my birthday in mah new hood, so I headed on down to Noodle Pudding on Henry Street.  Now, since it was a Friday night and we were a party of 10, I probably should have called ahead...whoops!  But they took my name down and told me to be back in an hour.  Cut to an hour later, we are seated at a table in this lovely establishment full of candlelight and rough-hewn wood and we order our food.  At this point, we felt a little ignored by the staff who neither seemed to acknowledge us or give us updates on our food or whether it would ever actually make it to our table...but to be fair they did supply us with a lot of delicious bread and an accompanying amazing infused olive oil.  Finally, the moment arrived when our food emerged steaming from the kitchen, and the group saw it and saw that it was good.  About half the table got the gnocchi with butter and sage, but I'm gonna say that my rigatoni with eggplant and ricotta on top was friggin amazing.  I don't know what they did to the eggplant but it was killer and had I not eaten so much bread beforehand I would have loved a second plate!  Then, since it was my birthday and all, my friends told the kitchen to bring their flourless chocolate cake topped with espresso ice cream...yeah just let that one sink in for a sec...which was brought to me by two waiters with surprisingly good singing voices.  The cake was amazingg, more like a chocolate mousse than a cake, and obviously dripping with espresso ice cream is really how any dessert should be served.  YUM.  So, despite the slowww service and weirdo name that doesn't sound Italian, Noodle Pudding's food and delightful ambience win it 4 whole stars!",4.0

The lasagna was so flavorful and it did not taste too heavy. The balance of cheese, meat, and pasta was perfect. It was heavenly. The risotto of the day was a seafood risotto with mussels, clams, and shrimp. I normally would never order risotto and the only reason I ordered it this time was because it had mussels, but I am so glad I did. The white cream sauce complimented the seafood and the risotto. There wasn't too much of it and it wasn't too heavy. It was divine!! Ok, now that I've discussed the food, I will touch on everything else. Finding this place can be a little tricky because the name isn't really visible. You kind of just guesstimate where it is. It's really convenient - I might away from the A,C High Street stop.

"From reading past reviews, it's clear this restaurant has off nights. However, we wondered in randomly, loved every moment of our meal, and didn't even know the name of the restaurant until we paid the bill.According to the waiter it was a slow night, there was no wait, 90% of tables were taken, but as a party of four, we were seated right away.The bread and olive oil were mind-blowing. I ordered the Chianti per the waiters rec (I had asked for an inky wine) and it was exactly what I was looking for. The caesar salad is huge and definitely should be shared between at least two people. We also had the broccoli with oil and garlic (daily special), this too was amazing.For entrees, we had pork chops, lasagna, and linguini with rock shrimp (one of the daily specials) ... and everyone LOVED their meals.We had the flourless chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato, also ridiculously good.This was one of the best dinning experiences I've ever encountered.

Nothing fancy or original here, but the ingredients used are definitely a notch above average and the preparation makes you feel like your Italian grandmother just cooked for you.

"A-OK. I'm not quite a fan, but I do like the place, the space, the location and the food is good. So why 3 stars? Because I'm applying the Italian scale of measurement. Arugula and shaved parmigiano: This simple salad combines the pepperiness of the arugula and the butteriness of the parmigiano. Everything was good, but the arugula could've been more peppery and the cheese more buttery. I'd order it again just cuz I like it.Tagliatelle bolognese: The pasta wasn't quite al dente. The bolognese was good, but again, didn't take me back to Italy. Flavorful, but should've been more flavorful.Wheat panette w/ spring veggies, in this case baby zucchini and fava beans. Simple and fresh. The veggies melded together making it harder to discern individual flavors. Tiramisu: it's good.Pear ricotta cheese cake: It's better than the tiramisu. It's not a bad 3 star review, but I can't say I liked it enough to be a fan.",3.0

We shared two tomato appetizers - one w. mozzarella and the other with cucumbers and onions. I enjoyed both, especially with the table bread and olive oil.

"Still as good as it was a few years ago.  They made me a special pasta sauce just by me telling them what I was in the mood for (basically and aribbita or however the hell you spell it with ricotta.  Oh.God.So.Yum.I love this place so much, it's like reason enough to visit NYC.  The food never disappoints and the service is always very genuine and fun.LOVE IT!",5.0
"From reading past reviews, it's clear this restaurant has off nights. However, we wondered in randomly, loved every moment of our meal, and didn't even know the name of the restaurant until we paid the bill.According to the waiter it was a slow night, there was no wait, 90% of tables were taken, but as a party of four, we were seated right away.The bread and olive oil were mind-blowing. I ordered the Chianti per the waiters rec (I had asked for an inky wine) and it was exactly what I was looking for. The caesar salad is huge and definitely should be shared between at least two people. We also had the broccoli with oil and garlic (daily special), this too was amazing.For entrees, we had pork chops, lasagna, and linguini with rock shrimp (one of the daily specials) ... and everyone LOVED their meals.We had the flourless chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato, also ridiculously good.This was one of the best dinning experiences I've ever encountered. Even though our coffee came out long after we finished the dessert.Note, this place is cash only.",5.0
"Solid Italian joint. Nothing fancy or original here, but the ingredients used are definitely a notch above average and the preparation makes you feel like your Italian grandmother just cooked for you. Well, at least it does if don't actually have an Italian grandmother...There are plenty of better (and more expensive) Italians in the City, but if you live in the hood (I do) it's a reliable little restaurant for those nights you don't feel like cooking.I'd skip the dessert there... and go buy something at Almondine ;)",3.0
"A-OK. I'm not quite a fan, but I do like the place, the space, the location and the food is good. So why 3 stars? Because I'm applying the Italian scale of measurement. Arugula and shaved parmigiano: This simple salad combines the pepperiness of the arugula and the butteriness of the parmigiano. Everything was good, but the arugula could've been more peppery and the cheese more buttery. I'd order it again just cuz I like it.Tagliatelle bolognese: The pasta wasn't quite al dente. The bolognese was good, but again, didn't take me back to Italy. Flavorful, but should've been more flavorful.Wheat panette w/ spring veggies, in this case baby zucchini and fava beans. Simple and fresh. The veggies melded together making it harder to discern individual flavors. Tiramisu: it's good.Pear ricotta cheese cake: It's better than the tiramisu. It's not a bad 3 star review, but I can't say I liked it enough to be a fan.",3.0
"I wasn't that impressed by the food but I really liked the friendly neighborhood atmosphere. I'll definitely be back. I had the Tagliatelle Bolognese which was okay but a little bland. It could have benefited from a little more meat. My friend had the bass which she liked but I wasn't crazy about. We shared two tomato appetizers - one w. mozzarella and the other with cucumbers and onions. I enjoyed both, especially with the table bread and olive oil. We sat by the window. which is opened to the street in the summer. Total tab, w/ a glass of wine, before tax/tip was $69",3.0

"this is an update. noodle pudding has redeemed itself in my eyes!i was able to walk in with 4 other members of my family and get a table for 5 without a wait, received excellent and very prompt service from all of the staff (who were ridiculously kind that night) and even saw the owner himself.what we had:caprese salad - nice and freshbeef short ribs - pretty goodseafood soup - amazing - this is a must try!porchetta - very goodlasagna - very goodgnocci - very goodoctopus - ridiculously fresh and delicioustiramisu - goodbread pudding - okall in all, this was a wonderful experience. we could have also ordered one less main dish because we had left overs. the portions were very generous.yay! i'm glad this place is looking up again since the food is always so great but the service and ridiculous wait had been the nightmare factor.",4.0
"We went here tonight to celebrate my parents' 40th anniversary. The food was great. That's where the greatness ended. The service was SOOOOOO slow. We were there over an hour and a half before we received our entrees. Thankfully we'd eaten apps and weren't starving anymore. The food was very good. Some highlights: the mussels were delicious in tomato sauce, the pesto special and rigatoni special were both really very good, the gazpacho was velvety goodness. The Caesar was meh as was the zucchini side (slathered in tomato sauce).This is a terrible place to go if you want to have a conversation. My almost 80 year old father is hard of hearing and I think missed most of the conversation. I could barely hear. It was SO LOUD. I requested that the music (Van Morrison, btw, weird) be turned down because it was pretty loud over the din of the restaurant and I was told ""I'll try but the owner likes it loud."" They did turn it down slightly, but it eventually got really loud again. I don't know if I'll go back. Too many other restaurants to try.",3.0

"My first foray into Italian dining in NY was a disappointing one. I had such high hopes and I know this isn't Manhattan so perhaps that is the difference here but I wasn't all that impressed. I had the gnocchi in butter sage sauce. The gnocchi itself was ok but the sauce was really bland. When I think of a butter sage sauce I envision browned butter, large crispy pieces of sage maybe some garlic and white wine but this was literally melted yellow butter with small slivers of sage and that's about it. At least, that's what it tasted like. I had a bite of the girlfriends red pasta (don't remember the dish) and it was mediocre as well. Nothing was really bad, it's just that I feel unless you live on the same street, you can find better options in NY. The prices were ok but they were also cash only.",2.0
"After eating at Noodle Pudding I see why it has suck mixed reviews.  I wonder if everyone who complained about the service had the same terrible waiter that I had. As the other reviewers agree, the Gnocchi is amazing. But, not good enough that I would go back.The wine selection by the glass was almost non-existent so I settled for a glass of Sangiovese.  I will say it was a generous poor. I ordered the Caesar salad which was extremely good. I was very impressed with the quality of the lettuce, very crisp and fresh. As I mentioned above, I choose the Gnocchi with butter and sage which was very tasty. I finished with a cup of cappuccino which was also good. Unlike some of the other reviewers, the man running around with a pitcher of water kept my glass nice and full. This is something I find very important so I did appreciate him. On the other hand, I did not appreciate my actual waiter at all. I placed my order with him and then he did not return to my table again until it was time to give me the check. After having my salad plate taken away I waited over 30 minutes for my Gnocchi to arrive. Again, very tasty, but not that good! When I finally saw my waiter again I did tell him that I felt I waited an exorbitant amount of time for my food. He had no reply. not even a simple 'sorry'. If you decide you want to try Noodle Pudding as the food reviews are great I will warn you of one final disappointment. Others raved about the complementary bread. I must have looked like I do not eat bread because I had to ask for it. I was very excited about it after reading the reviews, but very disappointed once I tasted it.Overall, if you are in Brooklyn and looking for reasonably priced Italian food, please try Noodle Pudding.

"Noodle Pudding is my vision of what an Italian restaurant should be.  Four of us ate there around 4 in the afternoon on Easter Sunday.  The place was buzzing with families and groups of friends.  You could imagine that some of the people were just returning from church, a christening, or whacking some Irish mobster up in the Bronx.The food was amazing.  For appetizers, we shared steamed mussels and raw clams. Main courses of various types of pasta were breathtaking -- lasagna (both the meat and the mushroom) and a spaghetti dish.  The desserts were also scrumptious.The staff was warm and funny even though they had been going at high speed for hours.  Even with occasional kids running around, the place was festive with an old world feel to it.So, after your next wedding, funeral, or shake-down, drop by the Noodle Pudding and celebrate with the family.",5.0
"FAMILY STYLE- AS LONG AS YOU DON'T BRING YOUR FAMILY:I normally wouldn't write a poor review unless absolutely warranted.  These guys have a seemingly nice Italian menu and I've read all the positive reviews.  But be it known that they're not very accommodating or friendly people when it comes to service.  I called for an early 5:30pm reservation tonight for a table of six, and a stroller with our 6-month old twin babies.  We arrived at an empty restaurant and four servers all worried about us taking up too much space from other diners - mind you, there were none.  To be polite, we moved to a quieter spot in the back, where we thought for sure we'd take up as little space as possible.  But our server then came to our table, trying to convince us that we should maybe move - or push the babies' stroller under the table with them in it!  Again, with not a single diner in the restaurant, the staff did an amazing job at unwelcoming us, as i suggested that maybe they'd be more comfortable if we left.  No one was opposed to that idea!Surely we left, with no apology from the staff, or even mild attempt to help us out.  Really dumbfounded by this - one of the most unprofessional service attitudes I've ever seen in this business.  And we work in the industry.  Sadly, I won't go back.  And hope that one of the staff may read this, so you may take consider this feedback the next time you're servicing a small family.",1.0
"I've gone back a few times and every time I have the same thought.""the food is really not that special.""  Sure, cheep wine is nice.  And the bread/oil is nice too.  But when it comes to the entrees, they simply lack anything special.  The bolognese is not delicious... it's boring.  The puttanesca tries to make up for boring with too much anchovy.  All in all, I realized I could make the same meal with some fresh pasta and ANY sauce.  OK, maybe not Ragu... but almost any sauce.",3.0

I've held off writing about Noodle Pudding because my first two experiences over the past five years were lackluster. It has quite a reputation among Bklyn Heights folk (my peeps) that I wanted to give it one more try before opining. First the good: The food is slightly better than average. That's where it ends. The NOISE LEVEL is unbearable. It's one of those places where you can't hear your companion 3 feet across the table. Maybe I've become an old fogey--but the meal was ruined by jack hammer level blowhards in stereo and everyone else trying to talk above them. We couldn't wait to get outta there. There's always a wait to get in; a no reservation policy. They only accept cash. The service is distant. Three strikes and they're out. Basta. It's Carroll Gardens for Italian from here on out.,2.0

"Noodle Pudding is my vision of what an Italian restaurant should be.  Four of us ate there around 4 in the afternoon on Easter Sunday.  The place was buzzing with families and groups of friends.  You could imagine that some of the people were just returning from church, a christening, or whacking some Irish mobster up in the Bronx.The food was amazing.  For appetizers, we shared steamed mussels and raw clams. Main courses of various types of pasta were breathtaking -- lasagna (both the meat and the mushroom) and a spaghetti dish.  The desserts were also scrumptious.The staff was warm and funny even though they had been going at high speed for hours.  Even with occasional kids running around, the place was festive with an old world feel to it.So, after your next wedding, funeral, or shake-down, drop by the Noodle Pudding and celebrate with the family.",5.0
"FAMILY STYLE- AS LONG AS YOU DON'T BRING YOUR FAMILY:I normally wouldn't write a poor review unless absolutely warranted.  These guys have a seemingly nice Italian menu and I've read all the positive reviews.  But be it known that they're not very accommodating or friendly people when it comes to service.  I called for an early 5:30pm reservation tonight for a table of six, and a stroller with our 6-month old twin babies.  We arrived at an empty restaurant and four servers all worried about us taking up too much space from other diners - mind you, there were none.  To be polite, we moved to a quieter spot in the back, where we thought for sure we'd take up as little space as possible.  But our server then came to our table, trying to convince us that we should maybe move - or push the babies' stroller under the table with them in it!  Again, with not a single diner in the restaurant, the staff did an amazing job at unwelcoming us, as i suggested that maybe they'd be more comfortable if we left.  No one was opposed to that idea!Surely we left, with no apology from the staff, or even mild attempt to help us out.  Really dumbfounded by this - one of the most unprofessional service attitudes I've ever seen in this business.  And we work in the industry.  Sadly, I won't go back.  And hope that one of the staff may read this, so you may take consider this feedback the next time you're servicing a small family.",1.0

Beef carpaccio was chuck full of mushrooms. WTF? There were far more mushrooms than beef and it totally lacked sea salt for taste and texture. Additionally, it was made with frisee in lieu or arugula. Tagliatelle was likewise light on the flavor department. I would say the seasoned oil presented with the bread was a winner though.

Just one stop from Manhattan and so much better than any other Italian place I have been to in the city - for so many reasons.Quaint, neighborhood-y, and really good quality food. I have never had a bad dish here. The rabbit is amazing, the mushroom risotto incredible and enough for two meals (or two people!), the fried squash blossoms are delectable and for dessert the goat cheesecake is light and fluffy and very mild. I have been there so many times I forget all of the dishes I have tried, but I have always loved everything. I highly recommend this restaurant and miss being able to go more often.

I was able to treat myself on a grad school budget so it's not that expensive.Expect to wait if you go at a busy dinner time. They do not take reservations and they are cash only. If you have to wait, you can always have a drink at the tiny almost difficult to sit at bar, or walk up the street to the pub which is more fun anyway.  If you happen to go on a lovely evening, the front windows might be open and the ambiance is intoxicating (aside from the pretty bad artwork).

"Wonderful spot in all ways.  A few hints from a regular:  1. The lasagne is divine -- and cheap!  2. The osso buco is top notch. But on occassion you might get a tough joint. 3. The mussels are very good -- great dipping in the broth.4. Try the daily soup for an appetizer -- a delicious surprise awaits.5. The gnocchi with butter and sage is sublime -- nutty, creamy, chewy.6. The grilled fish are always dependable.7. Tip heavily -- these cats will take care of you.The veal scallopine?  There are better places in Brooklyn  -- not a strong suit.The beef is fine but go next door to Henry's End for a steak au poivre if you want grilled meat.",5.0
"Came here last night and it went along way to overcome my  disappointment in the collapse of my beloved mets to the lowly pirates...anyway, I digress. Started with a duo of salads, one the typical roasted beats, goat cheese, arugula and really yummy cherry tomatoes(both red and yellow). The other was a burrata with really interesting and quite juicy purple heirloom tomatoes. The tomatoes were truly wonderful in both, though the burrata could have had a little olive oil drizzled over it but all in all refreshing and nice. Then I was urged to try and the lasagna bolognese and it did not disappoint. Nothing too kinky, but it was really exceptional bolognese in a healthy sized portion. Really a solid place, though I will say the service was subpar. Still for under $25 a person, I truly enjoyed......p.s. I had the prime rib the first time I went here and it was also very enjoyable but that bolgnese was pretty addictive!!!",4.0
"Such a cute, homey place. Seems like a definite local place...it looked as though lots of older Italian folks come here. We came at the right time...around 6 PM (they don't accept reservations) and didn't have to wait or get seated in the back where it was super dark. Instead, we scored the last table that looked out onto the street...I felt like a window display.The bread and dipping sauce was great. A different take on bread and olive oil. The olive oil had tomatoes, garlic and some other ingredients...very tasty. I actually ate more bread than my entree.The bf and I ordered 2 items off the specials list. I got a veal pasta dish ($16) and he got a meatball and sausage pasta dish ($16). Unfortunately, I didn't really like my dish. Seemed more of a veal stew with pasta than anything and although the veal was tender, it tasty dry (is that possible?). My bf's dish was good...the sausages and meatballs were very tasty and definitely homemade as well as the pasta...I think since the shapes of our pasta looked man-made and each piece of pasta was unique in that snowflake-type of way.Service was exceptional and the overall feel of the place is romantic and very quaint. I LOVED the back seating area which looked like it was set-up for a dinner party. They had strung mini lanterns from the ceiling lights and it looked so cute and intimate. Maybe some time I'll have to plan an event here so I can score that back seating area!Note: cash only",4.0
"Went here with a couple of friends.  I had their risotto of the day..I believe mushroom?  Very very very good.  One of the best risottos I have ever had.  The brick chicken is also very well done.  Compared to the chicken and risotto, the butter and sage gnocchi was good.  Not their best dish.  Bread is also awesome especially if you get the mussels which has a delicious tomato based sauce!

"Noodle Pudding is one of the best Italian eateries in Brooklyn Heights.  Other than pizza places, it's also the only one.  This may explain why, when we went for dinner before a movie at Brooklyn Heights Cinema, we were told it would be 15 minutes and yet waited for 40.  This is typical; sometimes the wait can be more than an hour.  On this occasion, our name had dropped to the bottom of the list, even though we were the first in line.  This is not uncommon for a place that doesn't take reservations, accepts only cash, and doesn't seem to have an organized strategy for seating frustrated patrons.The food is good--the linguini puttanesca is bright and balanced with acidic tomatoes, salty black olives, and perfectly cooked pasta; and the bread with dipping oil is also great.  The bolognese is good, too; if a little dry.Beware: this place is LOUD when it's crowded (being the only decent Italian restaurant assures a packed house).  Be prepared to raise your voice, unless you're seated near the windows.I'm not sure this place is worth the trek outside of Brooklyn Heights: Fragole in Carroll Gardens is far superior and similarly priced.",2.0

"Wonderful spot in all ways.  A few hints from a regular:  1. The lasagne is divine -- and cheap!  2. The osso buco is top notch. But on occassion you might get a tough joint. 3. The mussels are very good -- great dipping in the broth.4. Try the daily soup for an appetizer -- a delicious surprise awaits.5. The gnocchi with butter and sage is sublime -- nutty, creamy, chewy.6. The grilled fish are always dependable.7. Tip heavily -- these cats will take care of you.The veal scallopine?  There are better places in Brooklyn  -- not a strong suit.The beef is fine but go next door to Henry's End for a steak au poivre if you want grilled meat.",5.0
"Came here last night and it went along way to overcome my  disappointment in the collapse of my beloved mets to the lowly pirates...anyway, I digress. Started with a duo of salads, one the typical roasted beats, goat cheese, arugula and really yummy cherry tomatoes(both red and yellow). The other was a burrata with really interesting and quite juicy purple heirloom tomatoes. The tomatoes were truly wonderful in both, though the burrata could have had a little olive oil drizzled over it but all in all refreshing and nice. Then I was urged to try and the lasagna bolognese and it did not disappoint. Nothing too kinky, but it was really exceptional bolognese in a healthy sized portion. Really a solid place, though I will say the service was subpar. Still for under $25 a person, I truly enjoyed......p.s. I had the prime rib the first time I went here and it was also very enjoyable but that bolgnese was pretty addictive!!!",4.0
"Such a cute, homey place. Seems like a definite local place...it looked as though lots of older Italian folks come here. We came at the right time...around 6 PM (they don't accept reservations) and didn't have to wait or get seated in the back where it was super dark. Instead, we scored the last table that looked out onto the street...I felt like a window display.The bread and dipping sauce was great. A different take on bread and olive oil. The olive oil had tomatoes, garlic and some other ingredients...very tasty. I actually ate more bread than my entree.The bf and I ordered 2 items off the specials list. I got a veal pasta dish ($16) and he got a meatball and sausage pasta dish ($16). Unfortunately, I didn't really like my dish. Seemed more of a veal stew with pasta than anything and although the veal was tender, it tasty dry (is that possible?). My bf's dish was good...the sausages and meatballs were very tasty and definitely homemade as well as the pasta...I think since the shapes of our pasta looked man-made and each piece of pasta was unique in that snowflake-type of way.Service was exceptional and the overall feel of the place is romantic and very quaint. I LOVED the back seating area which looked like it was set-up for a dinner party. They had strung mini lanterns from the ceiling lights and it looked so cute and intimate. Maybe some time I'll have to plan an event here so I can score that back seating area!Note: cash only",4.0
"Went here with a couple of friends.  I had their risotto of the day..I believe mushroom?  Very very very good.  One of the best risottos I have ever had.  The brick chicken is also very well done.  Compared to the chicken and risotto, the butter and sage gnocchi was good.  Not their best dish.  Bread is also awesome especially if you get the mussels which has a delicious tomato based sauce! So good, we asked for three servings of it and they didn't care :)  which i always like in a restaurant.",4.0
"Father knows the owner so review is dependent on so.THEE MOST DELICIOUS authentic italian food!, i'm talking better than little italy and wherever places. If italian dishes doused in cheese, this isn't for you.Ambiance: great crowd, not too crazy noisy, and always has new portraits on the wall. Great service as the waiters help one another out without even speaking to one another.Food: MUST order- any pasta as they're made from scratch along with their sauce, and the steak drizzled with truffle oil- it's gunna melt in your mouth.My father comes here at least once a week, and we  celebrate family occasions here; I come at least once a month if not twice a month.= A MUST considering I eat here at least twice a month.

"Noodle Pudding is one of the best Italian eateries in Brooklyn Heights.  Other than pizza places, it's also the only one.  This may explain why, when we went for dinner before a movie at Brooklyn Heights Cinema, we were told it would be 15 minutes and yet waited for 40.  This is typical; sometimes the wait can be more than an hour.  On this occasion, our name had dropped to the bottom of the list, even though we were the first in line.  This is not uncommon for a place that doesn't take reservations, accepts only cash, and doesn't seem to have an organized strategy for seating frustrated patrons.The food is good--the linguini puttanesca is bright and balanced with acidic tomatoes, salty black olives, and perfectly cooked pasta; and the bread with dipping oil is also great.  The bolognese is good, too; if a little dry.Beware: this place is LOUD when it's crowded (being the only decent Italian restaurant assures a packed house).  Be prepared to raise your voice, unless you're seated near the windows.I'm not sure this place is worth the trek outside of Brooklyn Heights: Fragole in Carroll Gardens is far superior and similarly priced.",2.0
"This is my favorite restaurant, a charming neighborhood, rustic Italian place with exceptional & friendly service and great care taken to make simple dishes shine. I've been disappointed by many fine dining experiences in NYC, but NEVER by Noodle Pudding, and that is one of the true culinary charms of our city - the little neighborhood places that just rock, every single time.It's a small place, with seating for maybe 60 patrons at any given time, but they serve the food quickly and turn the tables over fast - it's an impressive operation. The staff are all very friendly & knowledgeable people, and in the 3 years I've been going there there has not been much turnover.The highlight is of course the food. They have a number of daily specials that vary slightly from day to day and more significantly from season to season, as well as a small staple of regular dishes, and everything's great. They start you off with loaves of peasant style white bread and spice infused olive oil, which is always heartwarming, and while you're chewing on that you might as well go ahead and order a bottle of their tasty $12 house Montepulciano D'Abruzzo. There is no better wine value in NYC.The pastas make my mouth water just thinking about this - they do an excellent gnocchi and will serve it either with butter & sage or al pomodoro, their bolognese is hearty & good, and their meat lasagna is terrific. Some memorable specials are the papardelle with lamb & olive rag (I rarely pass this up if it's on offer), the Spaghetti Sciue Sciue, and the black seafood spaghetti. For fish & fowl, their grilled herbed chicken breast over arugula is a can't miss winner, and Vinnie's line caught Montauck bass is prepared about the same way and is just as great, when they have it. The tagliata steak with grilled vidalias & tomatoes is always wonderful, and if I'm feeling really bad, I'll just stumble down there for the osso bucco. It's very special.There's a lot of Brooklyn dining places you'll hear more about, but few you'll enjoy more. Do yourself this favor real soon.",5.0

Just some noodles and some meat sauce. It was at times difficult to get the attention of the waiters amidst the busy crowds and many tables, but once I had some parmesean cheese topped onto my meal I was ready to go.We split a pastry-like dessert filled with ice cream and drizzled in chocolate sauce which was also brilliant.

The weather was nice so the front window was opening allowing a warm breeze for those lucky customers with a table close by.The service was really quick, almost too quick, though we were starving so it wasn't the worst thing in the world. We had barely finished the bread basket before our main entrees were placed before us. The bread was so fresh and served with an oil bread dip paired with chunks of tomato giving a liquid bruschetta like taste, so amazing! I ordered a classic tagliatelle bolognese which came as is. Just some noodles and some meat sauce. It was at times difficult to get the attention of the waiters amidst the busy crowds and many tables, but once I had some parmesean cheese topped onto my meal I was ready to go.We split a pastry-like dessert filled with ice cream and drizzled in chocolate sauce which was also brilliant. We agreed we must come again and try some of the other meal options Noodle Pudding has to offer as every plate brought from the kitchen past our table looked beyond great. All in all, a perfect quick dinner if you're looking for a simple yet delicious Italian meal. :)",4.0
"One of my favorites! The atmosphere is warm and lively. The food is delicious. The wine is cheap ($14 bottle of wine woohoo!) I really enjoy the gnocchi with butter and sage but everything else I've had here has been yummy as well. After dinner, it's nice to wander over to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, catch lovely views of the city and conclude your fabulous night.",5.0
"came here for dinner on a saturday night. the place was busy, but we only waited ten minutes for a fourtop, aka table for four. service was okay, nothing superb, but not horrible either. the food was quite delish and tasty! we had the octopus on top of garlic bread to start, and we devoured the whole dish, including the sauce. we absorbed every little bit with the bread they bring out when you sit down.i ordered the gnocchi in butter and sage sauce, which was great! the sauce was delish of course, who doesn't like butter?! and the gnocchi were fluffy little pillows that melted in my mouth!",4.0
"When the mercury begins to climb up the thermometer and the dogwood trees boast their blooms, New York City streets changes from canyons of stoic stares to a carnival cityscape where shops windows open like a barker's rictus. Tucked neatly into Henry Street near Brooklyn Heights, Noodle Pudding opens its windows to the summer air and stretches its awnings through cool breezes to serve regional Italian dishes at reasonable prices and glasses of wines for a mere pittance.The regional Italian menu offers classic dishes such as Penne all' Arrabiata, carpaccio, Linguine Alla Puttanesca and buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes and roasted peppers. But the menu is fitted with a list of specials that change nightly and which outnumber the standards almost two to one. Of course, favorites like burrata with baby arugula and heirloom tomatoes appear and re-appear due to availability, but recently I was able to order a plate of garganelli with duck ragu and fava beans.While the name is off-putting to some--noodle pudding (sometimes called kugel) is a dish of egg noodles, sour cream and cottage cheese, flavored with vanilla and jam and, of paramount importance, distinctly un-Italian--the quaint storefront is framed in flowers and bustles with four-tops and a wall-length bench that seats half an alley of intimate tables for two. The waiters, runners and busboys tuck their ties into their shirts and bustle about with only a modicum of banter but a bounty of helpfulness, tact and efficiency.The last time I visited, the host stand proudly displayed a basket of Zagat Guides (2008, Best Italian Restaurants in the US) in which they were awarded high marks. My girlfriend took one and was rewarded with a smile and a reminder that as a local she could share in their pride and conviviality.A simple salad of beets, goat cheese and escarole was delivered to our table quickly and we split it with a plate of beefsteak tomatoes drenched in olive oil atop mozzarella cheese; standard fare at any Italian trattoria, but constructed with color and priced modestly. Enjoying the first, delicate greens of spring we watched our dog who espied our dinner jealously from his spot near a parking meter (to underscore NP's gracious service, upon noticing we were with our dog, we were speeded to a table at the front of the restaurant!). We followed with a fine linguine with diced pancetta, fava bean puree (it is spring, after all) and pecorino cheese and a delicious Bolognese which could have been more tender, less beefy but served its function of comfort.Because Noodle Pudding is more of a local spot than a hot spot, it might underwhelm visitors. The artwork and décor are simple, unassuming; meanwhile, the house wines are table ready rather than ready to be ruminated on. But as local spot, it is a treasure. The price of a full meal here would not get you a bottle of wine in a similarly popular place in Manhattan. Likewise, Noodle Pudding is not going to insult and berate its patrons with the hipness of Williamsburg or the Yuppie-dom of Park Slope. Off the beaten path of Brooklyn Heights, in a peripheral spot not far from the Brooklyn Bridge, this restaurant is a boon to its neighborhood.",4.0

"Noodle Pudding is one of the stronger restaurants in Brooklyn.  Its devoted cult following is a bit bizarre to me, though.  It's a neighborhood restaurant.  If you do decide to make it a destination, though, confine your order to the specials menu.  This, in fact, is a good rule of thumb for any restaurant where the specials menu is so extensive and obviously variable.  If Vinnie's Line Caught Montauk Bass is on the menu, give strong consideration to ordering it.  Other highlights include rabbit (depending on daily presentation), octopus, and the heirloom tomato appetizer (they're smart enough to know when the tomatoes are good enough to merit its inclusion on the menu).  Tuna and swordfish are also generally good.The regular menu is decent.  I have probably been to Noodle Pudding over 200 times, and therefore have no qualms about occasionally ordering the chicken with leeks and pancetta, or one of the pastas.  But whenever I have been away from Brooklyn for a long time (as, increasingly, I am these days) my return visit to Noodle Pudding finds me on the specials side.I have always regretted that the beer selection is not the menu's equal.  And the desserts aren't all terrific (notably the namesake).  Go often and you might get a fruit plate.The staff is friendly and helpful.  Bear in mind that dealing with hundreds of people of variable mood and sense of entitlement nightly is no one's idea of a picnic.  You might not be pushy, but the guy with the blazer and country club visor who keeps going outside to smoke and scream at his cellphone probably hasn't lived up to your standards of decorum.  So patience goes a long way...and is repaid amply.",4.0

"Was looking for a good Italian restaurant nearby to take my fiancee out on a date this past Saturday night and saw all the great reviews for Noodle Pudding and decided to give it a try and I am SOOOO happy I did. Both of us absolutely loved this place. The next day my fiancee couldn't stop talking about how amazing dinner here was and she even said, ""That was one of the best meals she ever had.""So here's what we had: First, the complimentary bread and olive oil was very nice and as soon as one of the servers saw we finished off all the bread before getting our appetizers (because we we're starving!), he asked if we'd like more, which we agreed to.Appetizers: She had the Fried Calamari, which both of us thought was some of the best calamari we'd ever eaten and we are avid calamari-app-eaters. I had the Mussels w/Red Sauce, extremely tasty and good size portion. The sauce was so good after eating all the mussels I spooned up all the sauce like soup. Yummy!Entrees: She had the Swordfish, which was exquisite. Swordfish can often be bland or very dry if not done right, but the swordfish here was juicy and very tasty. I had the Straccetti, which I had never had before but I absolutely loved it and the salad on the side complemented the thinly sliced beef perfectly.We have been living in the Brooklyn Heights area for 6-months+ and this is by far the best restaurant we've been to so far. In fact, we have already planned a second trip here for dinner in a couple weeks. It's obvious that others feel similar to us about this place as the restaurant was packed on the Saturday night we went, but our 2-person table was available right away and the staff was very kind and courteous. Would recommend to all food lovers either for an intimate date, with family, or group of friends. Well done NP!!!!",5.0

"Was looking for a good Italian restaurant nearby to take my fiancee out on a date this past Saturday night and saw all the great reviews for Noodle Pudding and decided to give it a try and I am SOOOO happy I did. Both of us absolutely loved this place. The next day my fiancee couldn't stop talking about how amazing dinner here was and she even said, ""That was one of the best meals she ever had.""So here's what we had: First, the complimentary bread and olive oil was very nice and as soon as one of the servers saw we finished off all the bread before getting our appetizers (because we we're starving!), he asked if we'd like more, which we agreed to.Appetizers: She had the Fried Calamari, which both of us thought was some of the best calamari we'd ever eaten and we are avid calamari-app-eaters. I had the Mussels w/Red Sauce, extremely tasty and good size portion. The sauce was so good after eating all the mussels I spooned up all the sauce like soup. Yummy!Entrees: She had the Swordfish, which was exquisite. Swordfish can often be bland or very dry if not done right, but the swordfish here was juicy and very tasty. I had the Straccetti, which I had never had before but I absolutely loved it and the salad on the side complemented the thinly sliced beef perfectly.We have been living in the Brooklyn Heights area for 6-months+ and this is by far the best restaurant we've been to so far. In fact, we have already planned a second trip here for dinner in a couple weeks. It's obvious that others feel similar to us about this place as the restaurant was packed on the Saturday night we went, but our 2-person table was available right away and the staff was very kind and courteous. Would recommend to all food lovers either for an intimate date, with family, or group of friends. Well done NP!!!!",5.0
"Fantastic Italian food that still has a very local neighborhood restaurant type of feel, although the usual long wait for a table suggests its fame has spread well beyond Brooklyn Heights. A usually quite diverse daily menu, along with some really good Italian standbys.When the zombie apocalypse comes, I hope it stays open, because then we can barricade the neighborhood and keep it all to ourselves. Cash only.",5.0
"I think this place is fine. Nothing really to complain about, but i don't understand why people are giving it 4&5's. It is good but definitely not great.Also, they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait 30-40min.",3.0
"I had the lasagna last night.  Tasted good, but I was throwing up an hour or so later.  Food poisoning?  I think so, and this place has a B grade from the city. Service was very good, but I was charged $12 for a small glass of Chianti at the table when it only cost $8 at the bar.  I feel like I was overcharged, but was on a date and didn't want to make a scene.",1.0
"I absolutely LOVE this place. I force all my Manhattanite friends who refuse to ""trek out"" to Brooklyn to come just so they could try the awesomeness that is Noodle Pudding. It is also one of the first stops of my personal NYC tour for any guests I have in town (before taking a stroll along the Brooklyn Promenade, of course!).I've been here several times, and I have yet to be disappointed with my experience. The service is great (though at peak hours, you do have to track your waiter down sometimes); the wait staff are all extremely friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the dishes. I usually order from the specials (which have been different each time I've gone! amazing!), because I like trying new, creative concoctions. Their attempts to innovate are definitely not futile as the fresh ingredients blend beautifully together into a heavenly dish. From the daily menu, the mussel appetizer was spectacular as well as the organic roasted chicken entree. The complimentary bread with the dipping sauce is also amazing, that it takes a lot of restraint not to ask for a 2nd (or 3rd) helping before the main course. And, of course, we can't forget dessert. Make sure you save some room for a sweet conclusion to your meal as the desserts are equally pleasant to the palate. If you ask me, there's no better way to wrap up the evening than an extended conversation with good friends over a light, delectable dessert avec un cafe.Warning: Make sure you free up a whole evening when you plan to pay Noodle Pudding a visit, because you can't help but stay for hours and hours to soak in the fine food and cozy, cheery ambience!",5.0
"Great, honest food in a casual atmosphere at reasonable prices. The lasagna, carpacio and the stracetti (filet minon pounded thin and grilled on one side only leaving the other side completely raw) are major hits that keep me coming back. The only downsides are (1) cash only and (2) no corkage fee option despite a limited wine list. They don't take reservations, but the restaurant is fairly large by Brooklyn standards and I have never waited more than 20 minutes.",4.0

"Growing up with Sicilian Sunday dinners, Noodle Pudding is a great substitute for grandma's meals. There is nothing fancy shmancy or overly complex here, so don't come looking to be ""wowed"" or for inventive dishes. They serve standard, traditional italian cuisine. Their fresh bread and oil dip is served when you sit down (and refilled as many times as necessary). The pastas and appetizers are made with such fresh ingredients and keep you eating beyond the point of stuffed (i've been known to unbutton my pants). They have many wines and most are reasonably priced! What more is there to ask for?!For a relaxed and delicious Sunday dinner, the place to go is Noodle Pudding.",5.0
"Without question the best Italian food in brooklyn heights. Tony, the owner and a real Italian from Italy, has been in the neighborhood before it was chic to be in Brooklyn Heights. The food is authentic and simple, tasty and reasonably priced. the service is attentive and professional. Bring cash, no credit cards accepted here. Great for dates too! The pastas are al dente and usually homemade, they way they should be.

"Noodle Pudding is an Italian restaurant that emphasizes simple, straight-forward dishes in a warm, unadorned space.  It is consistent both in terms of the quality of the food and the professional, courteous service.  The dining area has a comfortable feeling that is contrasted by the cacophonous buzz of a much revered local restaurant.  The staff are attentive without hovering and are good at their jobs.Suggested dishes are the butter and sage gnocchi, lasagna, most all of the daily risottos, and the calamari appetizer. They occasionally have a fish special called ""Vinny's line-caught Montauk bass"" that is excellent.  By serving line-caught instead of net-caught fish, the chef is able to limit the excretion of a stress induced hormone that can negatively impact the flavor of the fish.  The fish is delivered fresh that day and is prepared in the careful, un-fussy manner that is a staple of the restaurant.  Always examine the specials carefully as they change often and are frequently quite good.The food has always been affordable ($15-25 entree) and in the ten years since I've been going the owner Antonio has only raised the prices once.To respond to the superlative and  occasionally negative tone of expectation of some of the other reviews it should be noted that Noodle Pudding is not ""the best"" Italian food in the city.

"This place is actually a clear 3.5 star place. The food is quite good, though in the three times I've been there, each time I've felt like I missed the really good thing on the menu. Every entree I've had has been on the good side of acceptable. Their wine list is both good and about as reasonably priced as you can imagine multi-course restaurant being.However, the service is relaxed to the point of being non-existent when you're at your table, but especially coming in the door. People are milling around in the doorway all the time and you don't know if they're in line or have already given their names or what, and no waiters or waiters bother to come up and get your name, so you have to flag someone down and give your name. It's extreme in a way that I haven't seen at a restaurant of this caliber before, and it's quite irritating. That lack of attention carries over to when you sit down. YOu might wait 15-20 minutes before you get to give your wine order, and if you have any questions about the menu they'll get answered, and then you'll get another 15 minutes before you get a chance to give your order.yeah, it's nice that they don't rush you, but I prefer to have this stuff happen _after_ I've gotten my food, not before.Anyway, the service is good when it pays attention to you, and the food is good when you get it, and they don't cram you in when you finally get to sit down.But, oh yeah. Cash only. Can you believe that there's still a place that costs on average of $60 a person and doesn't take credit cards? It boggles the mind. I guess they don't want to pay the half-dollar or whatever it costs for transaction fees.",3.0

(which is usually the house red anyway, as anyone who knows Italian food knows.)Our food took forever, and the couple sitting next to us ordered the same exact thing after us, but yet they they were served before us.  Our server was very attentive, offering us more wine (often before our glassed were done), but never apologizing for our food being late.  Once we stopped ordering wine, and ordered coffee he never paid attention to us, and our espressos never even came. The bill comes and my wife's wine costs $4 per glass for the house white.  Since I said chianti, mine are $12 a glass.  (Not the $4 house red price)  Ok, so fine so I said chianti along with house, and he chose to pick the more expensive glass.  The whole thing was so manipulative (he knew he had us) , and planned that we will never go back.

"I've been going to Noodle Pudding for at least 6 years. Every time I come to NYC to visit family we'd go here one night and to Queen's another (located on Court). I really do like the place and it has become one of my favorites in the neighborhood. The place is lively and energetic with that rich neighborhood feel. Yes it gets loud but I don't think anyone should claim this to be a romantic, mood place. It follows the Italian culture- it's loud and energetic, just like my family! Haha. But on to the food... I personally love the mussels in the spicy tomato broth (AMAZING), the calamari and all the pastas. I've heard the osso bucco is amazing but I do not eat veal.

"My favorite Italian restaurant in Brooklyn.  Antonio is the best - his dishes are simple, well done, flavorful and fresh.  Great fish - particularly the line caught fish (trout, bass).  The place is old school and the wood bar is inviting.  The wait staff have been with him for a long time and care about their customers.  Moretti on tap and an affordable wine list.  It's not babbo and doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is - a fantastic old school italian restaurant that isn't red sauce and parmigiana.  Love this place and am there enough to be a regular.",5.0
"The reviews are true. Really fresh, fantastic italian food in a nice setting. I had the risotto special which was absolutely delicious. I went with my family and everyone was impressed.Only crazy thing is they don't accept credit cards, so keep that in mind before you go!",5.0
"Let me preface this review with the fact that I HATE most Italian food (esp pasta, cheese).  Yes, I just said it.  Bring on the haterade!Anyway, I enjoyed this place!  I went with a few of my friends.  We ordered seafood risotto, gnocchi al pomodoro, mussels in spicy tomato sauce, Fra Diavolo, and gelato.  All entrees tasted very fresh and delicious.  I ordered the mussels (appetizer portion, $10) and it was plenty for me.  The dish was quite flavorful and redolent of fresh herbs.  The gnocchi was melt in your mouth goodness (according to my friend).  Everyone enjoyed their respective meals.  I'm not too picky with gelato, but as good as any in Italy.",4.0
"This place is actually a clear 3.5 star place. The food is quite good, though in the three times I've been there, each time I've felt like I missed the really good thing on the menu. Every entree I've had has been on the good side of acceptable. Their wine list is both good and about as reasonably priced as you can imagine multi-course restaurant being.However, the service is relaxed to the point of being non-existent when you're at your table, but especially coming in the door. People are milling around in the doorway all the time and you don't know if they're in line or have already given their names or what, and no waiters or waiters bother to come up and get your name, so you have to flag someone down and give your name. It's extreme in a way that I haven't seen at a restaurant of this caliber before, and it's quite irritating. That lack of attention carries over to when you sit down. YOu might wait 15-20 minutes before you get to give your wine order, and if you have any questions about the menu they'll get answered, and then you'll get another 15 minutes before you get a chance to give your order.yeah, it's nice that they don't rush you, but I prefer to have this stuff happen _after_ I've gotten my food, not before.Anyway, the service is good when it pays attention to you, and the food is good when you get it, and they don't cram you in when you finally get to sit down.But, oh yeah. Cash only. Can you believe that there's still a place that costs on average of $60 a person and doesn't take credit cards? It boggles the mind. I guess they don't want to pay the half-dollar or whatever it costs for transaction fees.",3.0

"Will never go back, such a rip off.Ok, the food is fine, but the service is the biggest turn off.  My wife and I just went for a Saturday night dinner. She ordered the house white.  I asked if they had a house red, like a chianti. (which is usually the house red anyway, as anyone who knows Italian food knows.)Our food took forever, and the couple sitting next to us ordered the same exact thing after us, but yet they they were served before us.  Our server was very attentive, offering us more wine (often before our glassed were done), but never apologizing for our food being late.  Once we stopped ordering wine, and ordered coffee he never paid attention to us, and our espressos never even came. The bill comes and my wife's wine costs $4 per glass for the house white.  Since I said chianti, mine are $12 a glass.  (Not the $4 house red price)  Ok, so fine so I said chianti along with house, and he chose to pick the more expensive glass.  The whole thing was so manipulative (he knew he had us) , and planned that we will never go back. Watch out for this scam.",1.0
"I had a very nice meal here with some regulars and I am glad I went with them. First, it's probably not a place I would stop in if I saw it passing by, it doesn't have the look of ""aw, how cute, lets' try this"", but looks can be deceiving. Homemade pasta, truly. nuff said.",4.0

"I've been going to Noodle Pudding for at least 6 years. Every time I come to NYC to visit family we'd go here one night and to Queen's another (located on Court). I really do like the place and it has become one of my favorites in the neighborhood. The place is lively and energetic with that rich neighborhood feel. Yes it gets loud but I don't think anyone should claim this to be a romantic, mood place. It follows the Italian culture- it's loud and energetic, just like my family! Haha. But on to the food... I personally love the mussels in the spicy tomato broth (AMAZING), the calamari and all the pastas. I've heard the osso bucco is amazing but I do not eat veal. They have daily specials which are all delicious as well. Also when they have it, the lemon goat cheesecake is superb.

"Tried out this place for dinner last Friday around 7:30 and hooray! No wait! I ordered the gnocci with mozzarella and tomato sauce, and it was just delicious. And awesome. Plump little pillows of awesomeness that melted in my mouth. The dish tasted extremely fresh and surprisingly light - no pools of grease at the bottom of your plate here!

"Noodle Pudding is perhaps my favorite restaurant in all of NYC.  The combination of the food, service, and a very reasonable wine list is hard to beat.  Most of the time when I go out for Italian food I think ""I could have done this better"" but that thought never crosses my mind when dining there.I have been there a number of times so I'll just share some highlights.  The gnocchi with brown butter and sage is absolutely TO DIE FOR.  I have eaten a lot of gooey gummy tasteless ricotta gnocchi in my day and these are anything but.  Little clouds that melt in your mouth and cause you to consume them until you have to skip dessert.  On one occasion the bottle of wine we ordered was unavailable so our server suggested another one.  I didn't ask the price at the time and when I got my bill the substituted bottle cost $14- $14 for a very decent red in a restaurant in NYC is unheard of.  The last time I went I had the special veal cheeks with raisins, pignoli, and...well who knows what else was in there but I was completely drunk on that baby cow.  So tender and flavorful- definitely in the list of top 5 dishes I've ever consumed.The atmosphere itself is a little hectic and there will probably be somewhat of a wait.  Get there early and enjoy a cocktail while you scope out other diner's food and plot the best way to consume as much as possible.",5.0

Noodle Pudding is great!I really enjoy sitting at the bar if there's a wait and then if there's room and having a drink while I watch all of the satisfied diners before me and the bustling waiters all delivering perfect dishes to the crowd!Once seated, almost anything you try will please you.  I've had the salmon (cooked perfectly) with garlicky greens and it was a great combination. My boyfriend ordered a special that they had that night which was beef carpaccio.  I was hesitant to try it at first but one succulent bite had me coming back for more.

"There is no kugel to be had, but this establishment totally lives up to the ""Noodle"" part of its name. My friend drove 11 hours from Michigan to NYC (another victim of the economy) to visit his former stomping grounds and I decided we had to go all out. After a beautiful day in Dumbo we made our way over to this Italian restaurant. There was a wait of 30 minutes (seems like everyone and their kids  love this place) but I entertained myself by making funny faces at the adorable children sitting near me. I'm such a creep. We were seated in a corner by the window and the table was very small. I could complain about the cramped quarters but having dined at Graffiti I now understand the true meaning of dining in discomfort. Fortunately for us we could use the ledge by the window for our wine. The servers were very professional and made some marvelous recommendations. My boyfriend and I ordered the least expensive red on the menu ($14), the meat, cheese and olive plate ($12), the gnocchi in butter and sage sauce ($12.50) and a skirt steak with tomatoes and onions ($20) As the restaurant was very busy we didn't get our complimentary bread until the antipasto had arrived. I consider this a blessing because had it come earlier I would not have had any bread/EVOO w/ peppers/herbs for my salami and cheese! The oil was totally addictive.  My dining partners and myself were constantly eying each other as we spooned the oil and pepper onto the bread, praying there would be some left for the next person. The antipasto itself was a lovely starter, but we barely had a chance to finish it before our food arrived. The gnocchi appeared first, and the portion reminded me of why the pasta course is called ""Primi"". It was such an appetizer. A basketball player's amuse bouche. I was ready to fight the boyfriend because I caught him trying to shovel it away while I wasn't looking. Sharing is caring! Especially when I'm being sugar mama for the night! Fortunately the skirt steak came around, glistening beautifully...providing him with the perfect distraction. As he admired the steak I had some much needed QT with that gnocchi. It really was divine. The sage/butter was the perfect sauce to bring out the pasta's natural flavor. All I could think was ""Why haven't I made sage butter sauce of my own? Am I insane? Am I...mentally challenged?!"". That changed when I tasted the velvety and slightly BLOODY (mmm) steak. ""Why don't I make skirt steak more often? It's not that expensive. Wow, what is wrong with me??"". It was incredible. The dishes were so good that I nearly forgot about the wine! Unheard of. Our bellies were..sort of full. So we REALLY went all out and ordered dessert (every dessert is 7.50). Tiramisu and chocolate mousse cake with hazelnut gelato. It was too much. The chocolate mousse cake was so rich I could hardly handle it. I was hunched over and ever so slowly consuming each bit. Completely sinful. Dessert should not be such a chore. By the time it was done I was convinced that I was going to pass out in ecstasy but the bill woke me up. It did some damage to my bank account but was still very inexpensive for the quality of food that we ingested. I was very, very satisfied with my dining experience. The satisfied groans in the car ride home indicated the same was true for my dining companions.",4.0

"This little Brooklyn Heights gem is the best Italian that I have had in NY. I visited this restaurant on several occasions, and have been pleased every time. This restaurant reminds me of a restaurant in Connecticut owned by good friends of mine, because it is simple, fresh italian. Don't mistake simple for red sauce and pasta- these are mostly authentic italian dishes. The dishes are just usually very elemental, created to highlight good quality components, rather than smother poor quality ingredients. My favorite dish is a special that is frequently featured- mussels in a light seafood sauce made with lobster. There is something about this sauce that is just sublime and amazing... and I can taste it as I sit here typing at my desk. The mussels that Noodle Pudding uses are large, clean, and plump, and absorb the flavor wonderfully. I also have tried and can recommend the beet ravioli, the venison ragu, and the buffalo mozzarella. That last item, the buffalo Mozzarella, is another favorite of mine, a creamy, silky cheese that perfectly compliments the drizzle of house olive oil that they pour over it. While the service at times has been curt and a little spotty, these were during very busy times, and was never rude or lacking enough to formally complain about.

"Truly 4.5 stars.  We came here after reading a blurb about NP on a NYT article about a chef and his wife loving this little Italian restaurant in Bklyn Heights.  Heck I figured if it was raved by an executive chef, it was good enough for us!Noodle Pudding turned out to be a neighborhoody joint that serves Italian rustic pastas, salads and meat dishes.  Our grilled portabello over greens with parm cheese appetizer was delicious.  The grilled sardines with tomatoes and potatoes was simple but refreshing.For entree, I ordered the broccoli rabe, sardine and pecorino cheese pasta special and although the dish was very heavy, it was tasty with the melted cheese and sauteed rabe.  My companion's dish was the osso bucco with goat cheese polenta and swiss chard. The sauce was salty!!, even for him who likes his dishes well seasoned.  I couldn't resist but steal from his plate and if you don't like goat cheese, avoid the polenta at all costs as it oozes of goat!  It was a well balanced plate, with the exception of the heavy salt hand.  Wines were limited by the glass but extremely reasonable.  They have a great wine list by the bottle though.  ""Nothing here is out of the ordinary but everything is executed excellently"" was stated by my companion; a knowledgeable restaurant goer and I couldn't agree more.  Hard to find parking in the area but don't lose patience.  Noodle Pudding is a great find.",4.0

"The boyfriend and I have been meaning to check out Noodle Pudding forever, but that 20-minute walk always seemed to get in the way. If you can make it over to Brooklyn Heights, though (and hey, first stop in Brooklyn off the A/C and you're right there), it'll be worth it. We arrived early, around 6:30, to accommodate a dad's hatred for waiting. We were seated immediately, but the restaurant filled up quickly. So get there early, folks.Food: good. Boyfriend had a braised something that was tender and delicious; the dad had a semi-spicy seafood fettucine that was awesome. I was a little disappointed with my beets gnocchi (which was made out of beets, not stuffed with 'em). Maybe regular gnocchi next time? Our waiter was nice and helpful; the wine was OK. The tiramisu was lovely. Probably the best part of my personal meal. I liked the cozy atmosphere (except when the radiators went MIA and it got a little chilly --we were sitting by the window). I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars because I don't think it's quite AS awesome as everyone here is saying. I went with 4 because my companions enjoyed their food lots and I feel like I maybe mis-ordered, but in my heart I feel it's a 3.5. I would definitely give it another try, though if I needed a surefire hit I'd probably go to Al Di La in Park Slope.  Extra fun: Go to the bathroom on the right (rather than the one on the left) and you can read a framed ""review"" of the restaurant written by a local schoolchild. It is hilarious/awesome/convincing. (He likes the butter gnocchi...kids in Brooklyn are so smart!)",4.0

"Truly 4.5 stars.  We came here after reading a blurb about NP on a NYT article about a chef and his wife loving this little Italian restaurant in Bklyn Heights.  Heck I figured if it was raved by an executive chef, it was good enough for us!Noodle Pudding turned out to be a neighborhoody joint that serves Italian rustic pastas, salads and meat dishes.  Our grilled portabello over greens with parm cheese appetizer was delicious.  The grilled sardines with tomatoes and potatoes was simple but refreshing.For entree, I ordered the broccoli rabe, sardine and pecorino cheese pasta special and although the dish was very heavy, it was tasty with the melted cheese and sauteed rabe.  My companion's dish was the osso bucco with goat cheese polenta and swiss chard. The sauce was salty!!, even for him who likes his dishes well seasoned.  I couldn't resist but steal from his plate and if you don't like goat cheese, avoid the polenta at all costs as it oozes of goat!  It was a well balanced plate, with the exception of the heavy salt hand.  Wines were limited by the glass but extremely reasonable.  They have a great wine list by the bottle though.  ""Nothing here is out of the ordinary but everything is executed excellently"" was stated by my companion; a knowledgeable restaurant goer and I couldn't agree more.  Hard to find parking in the area but don't lose patience.  Noodle Pudding is a great find.",4.0
"Fantastic very tasty neighborhood Italian. Good alternative to Grimaldi's if you're in the neighborhood. Cash only. A bit stroller-crazed with kiddies and early family dining, but the food is top-notch. Super cute old-fashioned styling.",5.0
"Really, Noodle Pudding?  Really?  Because we definitely had three bottles of wine for the six of us, feasted like kings and piled on the appetizers and dessert.  So how on earth did our check come out to only $60 per head including tax and tip and everything?  That makes no sense!  This is NY!  You're supposed to bludgeon my wallet like a boar uprooting a fern when I have these nights in this town.  Instead, my belly, my wallet, my heart and my soul left this fantastic establishment plump and happy.  I.  Will.  Be.  BacK!",5.0
"The boyfriend and I have been meaning to check out Noodle Pudding forever, but that 20-minute walk always seemed to get in the way. If you can make it over to Brooklyn Heights, though (and hey, first stop in Brooklyn off the A/C and you're right there), it'll be worth it. We arrived early, around 6:30, to accommodate a dad's hatred for waiting. We were seated immediately, but the restaurant filled up quickly. So get there early, folks.Food: good. Boyfriend had a braised something that was tender and delicious; the dad had a semi-spicy seafood fettucine that was awesome. I was a little disappointed with my beets gnocchi (which was made out of beets, not stuffed with 'em). Maybe regular gnocchi next time? Our waiter was nice and helpful; the wine was OK. The tiramisu was lovely. Probably the best part of my personal meal. I liked the cozy atmosphere (except when the radiators went MIA and it got a little chilly --we were sitting by the window). I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars because I don't think it's quite AS awesome as everyone here is saying. I went with 4 because my companions enjoyed their food lots and I feel like I maybe mis-ordered, but in my heart I feel it's a 3.5. I would definitely give it another try, though if I needed a surefire hit I'd probably go to Al Di La in Park Slope.  Extra fun: Go to the bathroom on the right (rather than the one on the left) and you can read a framed ""review"" of the restaurant written by a local schoolchild. It is hilarious/awesome/convincing. (He likes the butter gnocchi...kids in Brooklyn are so smart!)",4.0
"My favorite restaurant in Brooklyn! The staff is so friendly. Once they get to know you, they treat you like family- true Italian style. Their ingredients are so fresh and their food is generally excellent. The prices are amazing. There are several entrees around $10. The Osso Buco is the best outside of Italy. Don't miss this place!",5.0
Food is fine. Very loud and always crowded. Not a very comfortable dining experience.,2.0
"Just love the hometown atmosphere in this place and have been a patron for many years.  Just went back for the first time in a while and it is as good as ever.  Service is fantastic, food is yummy, and the owner is so friendly.  Everything about this place is perfect, and it is a wonderful addition to the great neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights.",5.0

"OK- the one thing wrong with this place is the name.Seriously, my girlfriend that lives in Bklyn hts would call me and say ""come to this amazing place called noodle pudding"" - I would always say no thanks - because I thought it was a thai place and I have to be in the right mood to eat thai. Then one night I had a craving for thai - called Julie and said I'll meet you at Noodle pudding - to find out it is an amazing Italian restaurant!While waiting for Julie I asked the bartender for a glass of chianti.

""kinda I live in manhattan"" to which he replied""Welcome to Brooklyn"".  Welcome indeed!p.s. the big long communal table is always a good time",4.0
"4 stars, because they do not take credit cards.  What's up with that!  I have been to this restaurant several times, and it has become one of my stand by Italian spots.  The food is not of the same calibre as Al di La in Park Slope, but what Noodle Pudding does, they do very well.  The food is consistently strong.  I usually order off the specials menu, as they offer interesting rotating dishes.  For my most recent visit, I had the mussels in a white wine base to start and for my main course, pasta with a seafood ragu.  The sauces were done very well, always the hallmark of a strong Italian kitchen.  Final notes: Noodle Pudding has only a few wines by the glass, but the menu does have bottles in the $30 range.  The staff is always extremely friendly and helpful.  All in all, this is a stand-out neighborhood restaurant.",4.0

"Something sad happened tonight at Noodle Pudding. Our experience was awful. After many years of eating there, I will never return. Our party of four was seated closer to the wall at a table for six, then a party of two was seated at the end of the table. They ordered, received their wine, and bread before our order was taken.  We eventually requested bread and the waitress came for the order. Only one of two appetizers arrived. We asked for the appetizer and waited ten minutes. The folks next to us received their entrees. After a very long wait, three of our four entrees arrived. One, a lasagna, was room temperature and burnt at the edges. The second had the wrong side; mine was fine. My husband's dish, the roast chicken, didn't arrive. The folks next to us finished their dinner. After a while, the waitress stopped by to say the chicken would be there soon. Still no chicken. Finally, my husband got up, found the server and canceled his entree. Someone came out to apologize, saying that the cook had forgotten to make the chicken. Then the server reappeared and said chicken took a long time to cook. When we told her that the man who apologized had already told us that the order was forgotten, she walked away.  My husband's nonexistent chicken and two glasses of wine were omitted from the bill.  It was a terrible night at what had been one of our special places, despite the incessant noise and screaming kids.  Too bad.",1.0
"This place is amazing. On my first trip to NYC I was surprised that the best meal of the time there ( and possibly my life) wad at this small Italian place in Brooklyn! we found it on yelp saw that it got good reviews and saw it was close to a subway station and decided to give it a try on out last night. It was busy but not overly crowded. It got busier after we sat down but the staff remained as attentive as the beginning. There was not one thing that we ate that we didn't like. The Cesar and fresh mozzarella ap was fresh and light, the bread is served with oil that has tomatoes in it and it gave it such a light kick! The pasta was perfect, not heavy with sauce but lightly dressed as it should be. And after seeing the desserts roll our to other tables we had to push our stomachs just a bit more but wow so worth it! The real prize though is the atmosphere. Unpretentious, friendly...and the ability to be the perfect backdrop to a festive party or an intimate meal. We had a party behind us but still felt like we were on a date not raising our voices over their festivities! It is cash only so be prepared for that, though it's worth it and very reasonably prices! Just thinking about it makes me want to fly there just to go again! gooooooo! Also, a short walk to the Brooklyn bridge :) so eat freely and knowing you can just walk it off after like we did. ;)",5.0

"I live like 3 blocks away.  It's pretty much the quintessential neighborhood restaurant.  Nice and rustic inside.  Excellent servers.  The bread and spicy olive oil is amazing.  Word of warning.  Make sure your date has some too or else your breath will scare them away.  hah.  The bolognese is delicious.  So is the spicy tomato penne.  The calamari comes in a giant portion -- perfectly fried.  The menu overall is very balanced...and huge!  The mixed drinks are under 10 bucks.  They have a bottle of wine that is actually good and is $14.  I mean, what more can you ask for?  Definitely in my top 5 of restaurants in all of NYC.",5.0

"After hearing raves from various people, I was eager to try this place while visiting friends in Brooklyn Heights. Unfortunately, we had the crap luck of the night: Kitchen/Server mixups, food wasn't put in the computer and when it finally was, our server was told by the kitchen that they were out. This was 35 minutes after we originally placed the order...yikes. My gf and I were quite perturbed, but being classy folks, we didn't raise too much hell. We were almost more dumbfounded by how it took so long for the communication to happen between the kitchen and server. I ended up ordering a straightforward linguine with a spicy red sauce (an arrabiata, probably). It was bland..kinda like the order, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there. They brought us some free dessert which saved the night from being a TOTAL disaster. Being that I'm rarely in Brooklyn Heights, I'll never go back, but even if I visited more I'd probably avoid it like the plague.",2.0

Go for the experience and you will be delighted by the food. Go for the food and you will be disappointed and miss the experience. Enjoy",5.0
"This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to.  My parents lived in Italy for a while, I took them here on my second visit and they loved it as well.  My Mom said they made the best tiramisu she ever had.What was good?  Gazpacho, grilled artichokes with arugala salad, the bread, mussels in white wine sauce, carpaccio, octopus in tomato sauce, all the pastas, desserts, wines.What was just ok?  Roasted chicken, seafood risotto.Would I go back?  every single day if I had the money and lived in Brooklyn.Oh yeah, cash only.",5.0
"back in the day, this was our neighborhood joint.  we went at least twice a week and wow did it nevereverever disappoint.  when we moved from NYC, this is the place we chose to have a farewell dinner with our friends (all hardened jersey city superhipsters) and they all adored it.two things to know:  no credit cards and there's no sign (just follow your nose).the food is universally delicious and just rustic enough that it feels like somebody's grandma could be cooking in the kitchen.  it's by far the very best dining experience b-heights has to offer.",5.0
"We went to Noodle Pudding on our weekend getway to NYC in May.  Noodle Pudding was highly recommended by a friend.  If you didn't know it was there, you'd never know it existed!  There's no sign, you just have to know.  I'm not even sure what we ate since our friend made arrangements for the restaurant to ""take care"" of us.  Every dish that they brought out was good.  We even had some sort of pasta with rabbit meat.  If I wasn't told it was rabbit, I would have thought it was turkey.  It was so so good!!  Would love to go back if we ever find ourselves in NYC again.",5.0
I am always happy with this place.  Great food and service. Big fan of their fish specials.  Great if you have toddlers b/c the noise drowns out any shouts or things being dropped on the floor. :),5.0
"Packed to the door, front windows steamy in the winter and open to the street in the summer, this is one of the most enjoyable places you could go in all NYC.  The food is classic, clearly follows the philosophy of using the best ingredients and staying out of the way.  I've eaten here several times, and each has been a pleasure - from a perfectly grilled bronzino with lemon, salt and olive oil, to the homemade pastas, the best grilled octopus I've ever had (am not a fan of octopus but theirs is truly not rubbery).  And a deep yet decently affordable wine list.  The staff are warm and gregarious and the ambience welcoming.  They genuinely make you feel welcome and not rushed.",5.0
"After hearing raves from various people, I was eager to try this place while visiting friends in Brooklyn Heights. Unfortunately, we had the crap luck of the night: Kitchen/Server mixups, food wasn't put in the computer and when it finally was, our server was told by the kitchen that they were out. This was 35 minutes after we originally placed the order...yikes. My gf and I were quite perturbed, but being classy folks, we didn't raise too much hell. We were almost more dumbfounded by how it took so long for the communication to happen between the kitchen and server. I ended up ordering a straightforward linguine with a spicy red sauce (an arrabiata, probably). It was bland..kinda like the order, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there. They brought us some free dessert which saved the night from being a TOTAL disaster. Being that I'm rarely in Brooklyn Heights, I'll never go back, but even if I visited more I'd probably avoid it like the plague.",2.0
"Good, solid food . . . Period.  No fancy bells-and-whistles, no amazing innovations.  Just good, solid, reliable, delicious Italian food.  And oh yes - the entire staff is great!  Bravo!",4.0
mmmm good! after having a so so experience with some much desired italian food in sf's north beach i was looking forward to some good italian cooking on my visit to ny. noodle pudding did not disappoint. simple and delish. not one complaint from the five of us about the food though the cash only policy is a tiny pain for those used to slinging plastic.,5.0
"Went here with my mother and my grandmother.  The steak was incredible, didnt even have to cut it with a knife.  The wine was phenominal, to bad I don't remember the name of it but it was a pino grigio.  Love this part of brooklyn. Makes me feel at home.",5.0
"When I first started going to Noodle Pudding about five years ago there was never a wait.  Now, you really have to get there early to get a table immediately.  Usually when a restaurant becomes popular the food goes down.  This is NOT the case with Noodle Pudding.  I tend to crave their food when I'm not there for a couple of months.  Their pasta with ricotta and mashed eggplant sublime, the lasagna superb, and their daily specials always with the freshest of ingredients.  Okay, now my mouth is watering....I'd head there now if I wasn't working.",5.0
"An old stand-by for our Brooklyn Heights pals, this Italian eatery is our Fragole-away-from-home spot. Our friends are major regulars and treated like royalty there, so our experience may be tainted... so too, this review. I literally have no complaints... OK, there was a wait and it was crowded... but it always is and that's a good sign. Also, our friends are breeders, so they have toddler in tow these days. No matter - the staff was still accommodating to no end. And so, a rather boring report card: Environ? A+. Service? A+. Wine list? A+. Food? A+. How dull, right? C'mon, trek up to Brooklyn Heights - God knows they need the foot traffic... it's so quiet up there!",4.0
"Long wait but I truly enjoyed my dinner here.I had bread, salad, a salmon dish, and wine. It all tasted so fresh and authentic to the flavors I experienced in Italy.The waitstaff was helpful and friendly. It was a bit loud and crowded but for good reason.I can't wait to go back this fall and try a pasta dish!",4.0
"I went here tonight with my friend around 6:30. We got seated right away but our server didn't come for about 10 minutes. Once we ordered we got our food relatively fast and it was very good. We both enjoyed our meals and we shared two desserts which were also very good. Overall we really liked it and want to go back again, just hopefully next time the service will be a little bit better.",3.0
"Noodle Pudding can get away with the long lines and the cash-only nonsense because they serve delectable food in a festive, warm and pleasantly frenetic environment.   The wine is affordable, and the food ranges from Really Good to Amazing.  Last night we had a very fresh octopus salad, fried artichokes with arugula, scallops, and veal saltimbocca.  Their lasagna is incredible.  One of my favorite places to eat in New York.",5.0

"I have been subjected to endure the mediocrity of this place way too many times and now my husband has finally seen the light!  The food is barely adequate (pasta is always overcooked and menu is sooo boring), the waitstaff are incompetent (never know the preparation of the dishes???), wine list is just awful, the NOISE is unbearable and the ""reservation"" system is a travesty.  We will never go here again and will now always enjoy places like the wonderful Al Di La where we can hang at their charming wine bar until our table is ready!",1.0
"Definitely the best Italian restaurant in Brooklyn as far as I know.  The fresh pasta dishes and the preparation of the meats and fish complimented with a modest price range make this place a place to frequent.  The wine list is decent and beer selection modest.  I would definitely recommend this place to all.  If you don't have time to wait, I suggest you go early evening as the wait tends to get long as you get into the peak hours.",5.0
"The stars are for the great food but the lines and the noise are just impossible.  Every parent in Brooklyn Heights loves it here because they just let their kids run wild, which is really tough on the other patrons.  If you want a quiet Italian this will not do.  It is so sad because the chef is solid.  But if I'm going to wait an hour or so for dinner it has to have some ambiance and I had better be able to hear my dinner companion which is impossible at Noodle Pudding.",2.0

"I went here last night with my parents. We were enjoying our meal, and were just commenting on how attentive the service had been, when we received the check. It seemed a bit too high--my mom and I had both ordered a $8 pasta dish, which should've added up to $16. It looked like our waiter had originally written 16 on the check, scribbled it out, and then wrote the double, $32. When we brought this to his attention, instead of looking it over to see what he'd done incorrectly, he just laughed and walked away with the check. It almost seemed like he was completely aware of what was going on and either he (or someone else) was trying to rip us off without us noticing. Perhaps it really was just an honest mistake, but since this place takes cash only and the check is written entirely in pen, the whole thing seemed a bit shady. So please, don't forget to check the bill before you pay!!! I'd be interested to know if this has happened to anyone else here.",2.0

"Date Visited: April 11thPeople: MeganMy tab: ~$47A lively, happy classic italian joint in my neighborhood that's no reservations, cash only. It's not the most sophisticated of places but perfect for the parents. I walk past this place a couple time a month, but rarely feel like braving the lines.

I got over it when our table was available in 15 minutes. Whenever we come here we comment on how horrible the wine list at this place. but fortunately they have a $14 bottle of  nero d'alva. I'd drink grain alcohol at that price. I started wih the carpaccio and parmesean, really getting into the tuscan, folowed by a very simple seafood fettucini with a somewhat spicy ragu.
