"There is something so satisfying about finally going to a place that's been on your list and having it not disappoint (that was an awkward sentence but whatever).The food is pretty. damn. good. Yes, it hurts to pay $13 for 3 tacos but when there's basically a whole fried avocado between the three, it lessens the pain. And the rice - it looks like boring-ass Chipotle white rice but damnnnn. It tastes like butter rice and it is delish. The chips & salsa are a decent deal with 3 pretty good salsa variations. Didn't try the guac but I'm intrigued (grapes?! sounds like some crazy NYT recipe but who knows?)Margs are good (strawberry version is on point) but a little small for the price so don't count on ordering too many unless you got $$. But I can't even deduct a star here because I'm too full and satisfied to have any bad vibes about this place.",5.0
"I'm hoping this review will help Don Chingon improve. I walked into the restaurant on a Friday night with a friend to eat dinner. When I called 30 minutes earlier, they told me to come over, that a reservation was not necessary. When we got there we ended up waiting for about 20 minutes for a table. OK, not a big deal. However, when it was our turn to sit down, they mistakenly sat a couple that had just walked in. When we pointed this out, they had to awkwardly fix the situation. We ordered our food, including the chips and salsa, which is as delicious as others have mentioned. We then proceed to wait over one hour to get our food. Since I was catching up with my friend, I really did not mind. But the waiter came over, apologized and mentioned they were understaffed. So how was the food after the long wait? I did not think the chorizo quesadillas were that good. Why am I writing this review? Because I love it when restaurants in the neighborhood succeed. I'm hoping my experience was a rare one, though if it is not, I'm also hoping this review will help Don Chingo fix these issues before they become a problem.",2.0
"Checked this out before a game at Barclays last night.  Not a very big place, but that's not a factor when it comesto the food.I started with a house margarita and it was top of the line.  I liked that it was garnished with a dried chili pepper.  The bartender was extremely friendly and welcoming.  I ordered the carnitas and could see the kitchen preparing the food.  Some of the finest carnitas I have ever eaten.  Small side of rice and black beans accompanied the carnitas and the portion was perfect.The soft corn tortillas were perfectly heated on the grill, the pork was not dry and the added toppings brought out the flavor and did not overpower the pork.I'm considering finding an excuse to go to Barclays again so I can come back and try a quesadilla!!!",4.0
"I'm not sure if a restaurant can accurately be judged on a chorizo quesadilla lunch special, but if it can, I can find no fault with Don Chingon. I came, I sat in the window and looked at the weird modular tower growing behind the Barclays Center, I ate a deliciously greasy* chorizo quesadilla, I chatted with Jose, my very accommodating waiter, and I left. (Oh, I guess I paid $10 + tax and tip before I left too, cause I wouldn't want to be rude to Jose.)And I would do it again anytime. Hell, I'd do it right now, if I wasn't sitting at home in my underwear, too many long, cold blocks away from Don Chingon. You should do it though, if you're dressed.____________*Chorizo is greasy. It's part of what makes it delicious.",5.0
"We were heading to the Barclays center and wanted to do a quick happy hour before hand a bar/restaurant near by so I searched ""happy hour"" on Yelp like I usually do. I called the day before and was informed their happy hours runs from 4-7pm but when we got there at 6:05 we were denied any happy hour specials. The waiter said happy hour ended at 6 and I explained that I called and asked that specific question so he could have given us our margaritas for a discounted price but no. None the less, dinner was great. Our drinks were over priced for the amount of tequila we got but they were really tasty. I had the sweet and sour margarita which had smoked salt on the rim. The food was the reason this small little Mexican joint goes from 3 to 4 stars for me. We started with the chips and salsa trio which was a perfect appetizer to share while we sip on our drinks. Our favorite salsa was the tomatillo salsa for sure. Our two taco platters came out next; one carnitas and one pollo. I personally liked the chicken better but one thing for sure is the taco shells themselves were amazing! Not sure if they make their own or where they get them from but amazing corn soft tortillas. Both platters come with rice and beans and is a great bang for your buck. I finished everything, it was that good. We had two beers during dinner considering we didn't feel a think from our initial drinks. The waiter, probably being apologetic for the happy hour confusion brought out two shots of tequila on the house. The shots tasted a little weak too so maybe they water down their tequila or maybe my mouths were just confused by all the hot sauce I used. Really good place, especially for your money but next time we are coming before 6.",4.0
"I came in last night for dinner around 5:30. This morning, I woke up still satisfied. When I came in at 5:30, it was empty. It was just me, a waiter and a bartender (my friend hadn't arrived yet). A little awkward, but it makes for good service, right? The I put in an order for some appetizers to start, and it came out less than 5 minutes later. The waiter was friendly and attentive. At first, I thought it was just because he was bored and was eager to do something - but he was the same way throughout the whole meal, even when the dinner rush hit. The tables are pretty small, but they did a good job or clearing out our plates to make sure we had room for everything. In hindsight, we may have gotten a little too excited about the food. - Elote ($4 each): not the biggest, but they were tasty! It had a pretty even distribution of spices and cheese on the whole cob - Guac & Chips ($11): a pretty generous serving of chips and guacamole. The chips came out warm, which I appreciate. I ordered without really reading the description on the menu, so the pomegranate and sliced grapes were a nice surprise! - Steak Quesadilla ($15): pretty darn good. You get a hearty quesadilla, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, rice, and beans - all on one plate. I had the toughest time finishing everything",5.0
"We came in one night before the nets game to get some drinks and food. It was about 6:00 when we got in and we were immediately sat. It's a very small place but cozy and I just love a place with an open kitchen - which looked small too so I assume the wait for food on a busy night could get pretty long. Thankfully there weren't too many people in the place so we got our drinks and food out for game time. My boyfriend called the day before asking about their happy hour and he was told it ended at 7. However, we were informed that it ended at 6 when we tried to order the happy hour. So that was a little annoying. Anyways we ordered our drinks saying whatevs. The drinks were delicious! I had the strawberry and mint margarita and my boyfriend ordered the sweet and spicy margarita. Both were tasty and refreshing! BUT - if you're looking to get a little buzz from these drinks just order a couple of beers since they were light on the tequila and very pricy for the size and what little was in it. We started off with the trio of salas which were all packed with flavor. It was between the tomatillo and pineapple salas for my favorite I could have eaten them all night. But since I couldn't I ordered the carnitas tacos. I had been craving tacos all week and what a way to satisfy it! It was soft shell tortillas and I was relieved it wasn't a cheap flour tortilla. The corn tortillas add so much more flavor. I also loved the avocado salsa slathered on the tacos - creamy and spicy!! And the carnitas had some nice crispy pieces of chicharron in them which was a nice surprise. There are many taco options to choose from but I wish they had a sample option so you could try some out. I think our server felt bad about the happy hour thing so we were given 2 shots of the house tequila which was fine by me! All in all, cute place, good food and okay drinks, nice service. Next time I come back here I'm definitely getting a quesadilla. Those things looks AMAZING.",4.0
"My work team and I needed some time to kill before the start of the NY Islanders game over at the Barclays Center and I went on yelp to search nearby places and Don Chingon was a winner amongst my coworkers. I called ahead to make sure they will make a reservation for 6 at last minute and they did with no hesitation and immediately let us know that when we come in that to ask about their happy hour specials #WINNING.Don Chingon is a small cozy spot on the strip of the Flatbush Avenue, they have an open kitchen with the bar area being next to it, very personal and makes you feel comfortable, you know part of the DC family. My coworkers and I ordered a round of drinks, Elotes and their guacamole that comes with pomegranate, what a great touch and went well with the guac. I got their happy hour margarita that was garnish with a chili, another great touch by DC.The majority of us ordered different types of taco dishes; everything that we had was good. The rice was cooked to perfection, no sogginess and not too salty and the black beans were to die for. I especially enjoyed my carne asada tacos. We went at a perfect time, as soon as it was time to head to the game the place started getting packed. I will definitely go back if I'm in the area again.",4.0
"Delicious carnitas tacos! Homemade tortillas, perfectly cooked and seasoned pork, two kinds of salsa, pickled red onions, cilantro... only time I've had better is in Mexico. The rice was good, and the black beans were nice and creamy, but I barely touched any of it because the tacos were filling. Service was nice and I liked the overall feel of the space. Will definitely be back!",5.0
"Found this place on Yelp, and was shocked by how tiny it was when we arrived.The elote (corn) appetizer was really good. My friends had the guacamole, they said it was really good, and the pomegranate was a nice twist. They also had the spicy margaritas, and they all liked those as well.I had the steak quesadilla, and it was good. Not fantastic, but I would go back and have it again. Only on a not so busy night. The wait was a bit much for me, when the food wasn't mind blowing.",3.0
"I actually really liked the food here. However, my initial experience is what triggered my slightly lower rating. This place is very small, only a few tables. My boyfriend and I came in around 7 and our options were to sit at a communal table or at the very narrow table against the window. We tried the window seats but I was super uncomfortable so we moved to the communal table. Luckily, it was only us at the table. Their second downfall was their menu. There was hardly anything on it! Really cliche food - burritos, tacos, quesadillas. That's it. Where's the pollo con mole??? I was looking forward to getting a margarita because they were very small (so I figured not more than $7, but they were all at least $10). I stuck with water. As an appetizer we got the guacamole and chips ($11). This was definitely overpriced, but I have to say it was very good. The guac had pomegranate seeds and grapes in it, which I loved. I could tell it was fresh and we got a lot of guac. The chips were also good with a very decent portion. For dinner, I got the steak quesadilla ($13) Amazing! The steak was of high quality and overall it was just really good. It also came with rice and beans - also good. Our waiter was very attentive; he asked how we liked our food & made sure we always had water. Don't get me wrong, this is a good place for a taco, burrito or quesadilla! All I'm saying is they could update their menu...Variety is always good.",4.0
"From the second we walked in I knew I was going to love this place.The decor, to start with, is absolutely lovely with its dim lighting, rustic wood tables and graphic wallpaper.  Don Chingon kind of gives off a romantic feel - so it'd be perfect for a date night w/ the Hubs.  But it also has a really cool* vibe - so great for a night w/ the gals or a night w/ the guys too. There were plenty of tables open when we arrived on a Friday night so we were able to 'sit anywhere'.  They have 4 or 5 tables along one side, two hightop counters, a community table in the middle of the room, and several seats at the bar - so plenty of options!We started dinner off with an order of chips and salsa for $4.  The basket of chips is plenty big enough to share and the trio of salsas are so good!  The Charro - smoky.  The Verde - refreshing. The Habanero y Pina - sweet with a niiice kick.  Make sure you get to try all three.Hubs ordered up a taco platter, selecting chicken as his protein out of the seven options available.  For $13 he got three corn tortilla shells filled with chipotle chicken, salsa, avocado cream and cilantro & served with a hearty scoop each of rice and black beans.  I chose the quesadilla, 12"" flour tortillas filled with chicken, cheese, tomato salsa, avocado cream and served with scoops of guacamole, rice and black beans.  One of the best quesadillas I've had out at a restaurant.  Perfect marriage of flavors and ingredients.  And with the rice and beans there was so much on the plate.  I was able to take half home for lunch the next day.  $13 verrrry well spent.Total bill, including beer, tax/tip, was about $40.  So I'd say it was $40 well spent.Hubs has already asked when we're going back.  And I can't think of a single reason not to get back there soon. * Check out the wallpaper in the bathroom.  One of my favorite decorative touches.",5.0

The chips were great and they're made fresh. You get 3 kinds of salsa, a standard one, a green salsa, and one with a smokey flavor. All were pretty good.

We felt a little robbed. Mesa coyacon and maya taqueria, manage to turn out awesome well seasoned Mexican food at a range of prices.Maybe jazz up the plate presentation.",3.0
"Love love love!I love a place that has a small menu because what they make, they make excellentThe queso dip, guacamole, and quesadilla were all amazing, fresh, tasty, and filling.The guacamole was very flavorful and they added green grapes for an interesting twist. I could eat by the spoon fulls.The place is coZy, could for dates and small groups.This is def a favorite",5.0
"Authentic Mexican quick fix as i like to call it. Delicious food, great pricing. Wonderful staff and the drinks on point. Great place to hang out or just to get a quick bite and a drink with a friend. If your on this side of town you'd have to check this place out.",5.0
"I had passed by here many times and I'm glad a finally decided to try it. Don Chingon has a nice atmosphere in a cozy room. The food was also very good. I got the Chorizo y Papas, which was a burrito with Chorizo, Egg, Potatoes, Crema inside. It came with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. I would definitely recommend this dish and will likely come again.",4.0
"Had time to kill before an event at Barclays and came here for some food. While it was a little more expensive then Mexican by my home, it was cheaper then any option in Barclays and much better quality. I had the house margarita- great flavor but a little pricey ($10) for the size. The chicken quesadilla came with rice and beans and was enough for two meals. The flavors were good though not what I would call authentic, and the menu was not particularly imaginative. The restaurant is small and was not crowded, which gave an intimate feel to the meal. Ultimately I left satisfied and would definitely come back if in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Stopped by here after a Nets Game. The guac was pretty good - interesting spin on it as they put pomegranate seeds on top & grapes in it. Margaritas were delicious! Chicken quesadilla was substantial, carnitas tacos were a bit greasy but very flavorful! The rice and beans that came as a side for both meals were probably the best part of it all! Nice servers and good water re-fill service. Unrelated to the food - decor was fun and different. Overall, we enjoyed our post-game meal!",4.0
"Thrilled to finally have a spectacular fish taco in the neighborhood. Hand-sized tacos of what seem like house-made tortillas perfectly balance flavors and textures. I had the fish, carnitas, and carne asada tacos. All delicious and fresh and very different from each other, but it was the fish taco we went for when we wanted more. In truth look at the pictures I posted--they taste as good as they look!The server was very sweet and solicitous. He made sure that I knew the Paloma they made for me (not on the menu--I had requested it) was made with the REAL Squirt from Mexico. Elote was good, too!It's a small lively space with lots of seating options (high tables, low tables, bar seats) unobtrusive music, and last night soccer on the TV.",4.0
"The guac was a bit expensive for the size BUT it was good, drinks were solid, tacos were incredibly fresh and good! I just wish the rice wasn't cold. Will definitely be back though, service was great",4.0
"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon, two other couples in the place, staff looked bored. Food came out quick. Guac could have used more lime and cilantro, it had huge pieces of green grapes on it, different but OK. Steak in quesidilla was tasty but the whole thing was watery. Corn had way too much cheese on it. Too many other places nearby that are better than this place, nice place but nothing special.",3.0
"I started going here when it first opened and it has has never been anything less than amazing. On the drinks side, my experience has been fantastic/artisanal beverages that are not just loads of sugar and booze. As a vegetarian/vegan, I also highly recommend their avocado tacos which is something you don't see as an option in every Mexican place and actually really does fill you up. A great option for dinner before seeing a movie at the BAM.Finally the staff has always been warm, efficient, and open for a quick chat.  I actually recommend sitting at the bar so you can see the drinks be made and get free smells from the kitchen. Love this place.",5.0
"Amazing service and unbeatable HH 12-7pm. 6$ tequila shot and a beer , I mean what else do you want ? Jose is a great bartender and very attentive , you can see he really likes he's job . Vic the owner is there all the time and makes sure every customer gets a great customer service plus he'll take care of you if you don't just eat chips and salsa for 2 hours lol . The food is great as the atmosphere is very cozy makes you feel like home . I'll definitely come back !!",5.0
"From the rave reviews I was expecting a great meal, but it was lackluster. The space is very inviting and on the smaller side, but getting a table was no issue. Service was friendly as well. The food was the let down--decent portions but nothing wowed me. I had the fish tacos and will say I was a fan of the tortillas, but the fish didn't have any flavor. The drinks were spicier than they were strong. I also felt everything was priced $1-$2 more than needed. With so many options for Mexican food in the city, you need to work hard to stand out.",3.0

"Too much tequila!Me and a buddy were leaving the game on Monday and walked into this spot. We just wanted to grab a quick drink before we trained it home. We did a chipotle bloody margarita which might be the best drink I've ever had. After we finished the bartender said if you buy 2 drinks the third is on me, whaaaaat! Deal!

"New in the hood.

I am not a big alcohols fan but their bar looks intimate and nice, great place for first dates and groups.The place is Well designed with a very cool motif Mexican modern style.

"The first snow of the year started to fall as my friend and I searched for Don's post movie date at BAM.

My expectations were high due to its placement on the YELP 100 places to dine in Brooklyn. The three salsas served with fresh tortilla chips were outstanding. My carnitas tacos served with arroz and black beans were also outstanding.  My friend's skirt steak platter was out-OUT standing, cooked medium and bleeding all over the place...mmm mmm mmm. The only thing that took a star away was the misunderstanding of the order taken by our very sweet and apologetic server, which caused my friend to wait for his platter and my carnitas to get a little cold.

Simple layout and a simple menu. Goes to show its not quantity but quality to a menu and what this place does it does well.

"Came on a Saturday night and was looking forward to trying the food. Ordered guac, chips and corn for apps. All were very good. Then it went downhill. They would not let us mix up the 3 taco plate, which seemed strange because nearly all places let you do this. So we ordered the chorizo tacos and burrito. Both tasted good but we very wet and dripping all over. They gave me beans when I said I did not want any. We asked to wrap up the leftovers and they only wrapped up part of it. Upon leaving we overheard a different waiter allow another customer to order different tacos for 3 taco plate. Which made it even more annoying.  Both of us had upset stomachs after dinner.

"Redeemed a New York Deals voucher here today. I started with a spicy margarita which packed a nice punch.

But the accompanying rice and beans were on the bland side. While the food at Don Chingon is good, I won't be rushing back anytime soon.",3.0
"It's the best Mexican I've had outside of Mexico, and the small menu focuses on their strengths: burritos, tacos, and quesadilla that have simple presentation but are exquisitely prepared. The skirt steak is tender, juicy, utterly devoid of fat or gristle, and melts in your mouth. The pork is a dark brown, pulled to perfection, and succulent. The salsas are fantastic and taste so fresh you'd think they were made just prior to arriving at the table (maybe they are, I dunno). Hands down the best guacamole I've ever tasted, with only a hint of cilantro (instead of being overpowered with the stuff, which is way too common). The carne asada tacos have the pineapple mixed in perfectly.The drinks are strong and simple, and the Maria Rojo with chipotle is a revelation: spicy, sweet, and very potent.Really excellent food, especially amusing since the name of the place roughly translates to ""Mr. Fucker.""",5.0

"Serving seven people before a concert, with people arriving at different times and each with varying degrees of hunger and dietary needs to boot, I imagine is the food service industry's idea of at least one of the seven circles of hell. But the staff at this awesome little find handled our meals beautifully. This is a very inventive take on Mexican - everything has a twist of some sort which even when not to my traditional taste was really really wonderful, and that's saying something.... ...because what I don't like much in cusine is food that's sweet. I'm eastern european - the first time I saw stuffed cabbage with raisins I almost hurled. I grew up in a house where fruit was for sangria and dessert - with savory in between; take your grapefruit segments and melon soups and shove 'em. Seriously - anything beyond a splash of lemon makes me trepidatious with all but the most assured of kitchens. So imagine my surprise when I found damned near everything Don Chingon put before me accented with some sweet spin - and it worked damned near all the time. For ME!We sat at their communal table, and tucked into their warm chips and knockout guac - sweet #1: Of the three salsas the one that hit home for me was their pinapple jalapeño, with the charred tomato salsa a close second, and the very traditional verde still memorable. Sweet #2: The guacammole arrived with accents of pomegranate and grapes - yes, GRAPES. Son of a bitch - it WORKED. Might not be something I'd make myself, but it was a refreshing surprise on the first truly hot night in Brooklyn.I opted for the taco trio for my main course. These are not big tacos, but they are of a thickness closer to a blini than a traditional taco, and were varied and delicious. I chose a tempura-fried avocado taco that was unusual and delicious, a chipotle chicken taco beautifullly complimented with an avocado salsa, and a tempura-fried pollock taco (a fish special, and sweet #3) with more of that killer pineapple salsa. It was just enough for me. Three of the friends closest to me opted for the fish of the day, which was a very un-Mexican salmon. They all loved it. Further down the table one of the latecomers waxed raphsodic about her tortilla soup. One of my guests received an entree she didn't order, but I think it was nobody's fault. Truly. And the meal came out in record time, a burrito so large she couldn't finish it. Another friend loosened his belt and helped her, pronouncing the dish 'spectacular'.The one instance, ironically, where the sweetness (#4) proved too much for me was the margarita; even without the simple syrup, it was a Cointreau overdose. Maybe had I opted for the salt it would have helped, but next time I'll probably stick to a tequila w/soda and lime, like one of our party had; I tried it and preferred it to my own drink. The decor is awesome in this small and unusual piece of real estate, with one of the coolest bathroom sinks I've seen in ages.  The manager (?), Vic, met us outside and chatted with us as we waited for our taxis - a great guy  who cares for his customers and his staff. They should all be around for a good long time.  A truly surprising and satisfying dining experience. I'll be back to try more, especially the corn and that soup.  Let's see if this place will come to earn that fifth star. They're close.",4.0

I've been eyeing it since it opened across the street from Bark & Bergen Comics. Stopped in here with a group of friends for my wife's birthday as sort a casual last minute thought. We had never been before. The seating is limited and very casual but it was perfect for what we wanted. The service was fast and friendly. The food was very tasty and came in a reasonable amount of time. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and at the end of the night we were all happy we decided to stumble into Don Chingon.

"Really great food that's not too expensive. Right off the Bergen stop. Drink service was a bit slow, but it was crowded so we'll let that slide.

"Serving seven people before a concert, with people arriving at different times and each with varying degrees of hunger and dietary needs to boot, I imagine is the food service industry's idea of at least one of the seven circles of hell. But the staff at this awesome little find handled our meals beautifully. This is a very inventive take on Mexican - everything has a twist of some sort which even when not to my traditional taste was really really wonderful, and that's saying something.... ...because what I don't like much in cusine is food that's sweet. I'm eastern european - the first time I saw stuffed cabbage with raisins I almost hurled. I grew up in a house where fruit was for sangria and dessert - with savory in between; take your grapefruit segments and melon soups and shove 'em. Seriously - anything beyond a splash of lemon makes me trepidatious with all but the most assured of kitchens. So imagine my surprise when I found damned near everything Don Chingon put before me accented with some sweet spin - and it worked damned near all the time. For ME!We sat at their communal table, and tucked into their warm chips and knockout guac - sweet #1: Of the three salsas the one that hit home for me was their pinapple jalapeño, with the charred tomato salsa a close second, and the very traditional verde still memorable. Sweet #2: The guacammole arrived with accents of pomegranate and grapes - yes, GRAPES. Son of a bitch - it WORKED. Might not be something I'd make myself, but it was a refreshing surprise on the first truly hot night in Brooklyn.I opted for the taco trio for my main course. These are not big tacos, but they are of a thickness closer to a blini than a traditional taco, and were varied and delicious. I chose a tempura-fried avocado taco that was unusual and delicious, a chipotle chicken taco beautifullly complimented with an avocado salsa, and a tempura-fried pollock taco (a fish special, and sweet #3) with more of that killer pineapple salsa. It was just enough for me. Three of the friends closest to me opted for the fish of the day, which was a very un-Mexican salmon. They all loved it. Further down the table one of the latecomers waxed raphsodic about her tortilla soup. One of my guests received an entree she didn't order, but I think it was nobody's fault. Truly. And the meal came out in record time, a burrito so large she couldn't finish it. Another friend loosened his belt and helped her, pronouncing the dish 'spectacular'.The one instance, ironically, where the sweetness (#4) proved too much for me was the margarita; even without the simple syrup, it was a Cointreau overdose. Maybe had I opted for the salt it would have helped, but next time I'll probably stick to a tequila w/soda and lime, like one of our party had; I tried it and preferred it to my own drink. The decor is awesome in this small and unusual piece of real estate, with one of the coolest bathroom sinks I've seen in ages.  The manager (?), Vic, met us outside and chatted with us as we waited for our taxis - a great guy  who cares for his customers and his staff. They should all be around for a good long time.  A truly surprising and satisfying dining experience. I'll be back to try more, especially the corn and that soup.  Let's see if this place will come to earn that fifth star. They're close.",4.0

We are vegetarians who love Mexican but it's often hard to find new, interesting options so it was a nice surprise to see tempura avocado tacos and the potato, spinach and poblano pepper burrito.

I've been eyeing it since it opened across the street from Bark & Bergen Comics. Stopped in here with a group of friends for my wife's birthday as sort a casual last minute thought. We had never been before. The seating is limited and very casual but it was perfect for what we wanted. The service was fast and friendly. The food was very tasty and came in a reasonable amount of time. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and at the end of the night we were all happy we decided to stumble into Don Chingon. If you're getting a margarita I'd favor the Dulce & Caliente over the house margarita. The house was decent but the D&C was more of a flavor experience.

"I don't get the reviews of this place, blows me away that people are saying this is a great place. We walked in thinking we'd have dinner at 9:37, not knowing that it closed at 10.

We were the only people in the joint and when the waiter comes over informs us that their kitchen closes at ten, no mention that they close at ten. so we both order a margarita, he asks ""the house one"" we say sure, i was beat and just wanted a drink. and while sitting there looking at the menu i my spider senses started tingling and at the last second we decide that no, we wont order food. thank god we didn't because the house margarita that were served to us were possibly the worst i've ever had in my life. Nothing but sour mix in a small glass that was mostly ice, mixed weakly i may add. while sucking down this abomination as fast as we could it became clear that not only does their kitchen close at ten but they were in fact shutting down, and that pisses me off because they were essentially going to let us order food and then break down the place around us. not a very conducive setting for a chill night. but i'm sure the waiter figured they could force in one more order than rush us out the door. so we finished and i just stood up and told them to close me out and while doing that the bar tender has the balls to tell me we could still hang out if wanted? why so I could pay another $22 bucks for total shit? yeah fuck that and fuck this place.",1.0

"Another one of my go to places.

Only thing is sometimes the lime in the guac can overwhelm the other flavors for me so I wonder if I can have the lime/lime juice on the side. Also love their tacos. Was hesitant to get the burritos  because I'm not much of a burrito fan and for some reason I don't trust rice dishes outside of the home. But I love their version of a breakfast burrito with egg mixed with chorizo and potatoes. And their sides are great; crema, guacamole, salsa for quesadilla, black bean sauce and their rice isn't bad. I also like their desserts, especially the mango cheese cake and their flan; it's new and I hope it stays. Then there's the margaritas. OMG. I don't usually drink but can't get enough of them. Especially the Strawberry and Mint. I liked the house margarita and dulce y caliente but this one takes the cake. Fresh strawberry puree with simple syrup, mint garnish, and sugar rim? Perfection. The staff is great too. Always friendly and attentive. Definitely a must!ETA- I checked and you can have the lime juice on the side if you prefer so that's good. Also the queso and guacamole are great as stated before. I just wish there'd be a bit more in the serving. I always end up having more chips than either dish.",4.0

We had the queso (good), guacamole (excellent!), carnitas tacos (amaze-balls), steak quesadillas (great), and chicken tacos (good). My favorite, hands down are the carnitas. Must order! Steak quesadillas and chicken tacos were also really delicious. We each had a couple margaritas which were strong, with fresh flavors/juices and well made. Not sickly sweet like some of the 'ritas in this town tend to be. One of my friends who came with us was very knowledgeable about tequilas and was impressed by the selection.

And so has no sense that, for example, rajas y papas are not just unseasoned undercooked potatoes with steamed poblano peppers (and steamed spinach?). Or that the (unseasoned overcooked mushy) rice doesn't need butter and if the beans are done right, they don't need all the extra flavors (seems the same flavoring they use for their chorizo). Also, none of the servers could speak any Spanish - which could be no big deal, but kinda stays with the theme (and seriously, you have to work pretty hard to avoid Spanish-speaking people in this city).",1.0
Great Mexican fare and awesome service. Vic is a great bartender - fab Marg.'s and food is solid!,5.0
"We got the chicken (only dark meat) and steak burritos and they were delicious. It comes with black beans and rice along with sour cream, guacamole and Pico DE Gallo on the side. The burritos are grilled and tasty. Drinks are a little pricey. The house Margarita comes with a chili pepper. It was a little slow to get served but the meal itself made up for it",5.0
"Great place. Best margarita I ever had, so far. Just delicious. Decor is super cute, trendy, rustic/industrial.  Small place but perfect.",4.0
"I've come here a few times now - and I have to say, its the most enjoyable & authentic place in Park Slope! Not to mention - the service is FANTASTIC - everyone there is so nice & down to earth & funny. I've highly enjoyed each experience I've had there and would really recommend it.",5.0
"Love this place!!! As a California transplant, I'm picky about my Mexican food and this place is great! Aside from the amazing food, the service is prompt and attentive. Check it out!",5.0
"Are there before show at Barclays and the food was spectacular.   Queso with big vegetables, fresh razor thing tortilla chips with perfect amount of salt.   Taco platter with homemade corn tortillas (the pork was the best, as well as my wife liked the avocados).   Def coming back when I'm at Barclays this Sunday for Stevie Wonder.",5.0
"A friend and I decided to stop in here for a quick meal after our Sunday afternoon trip to a play-- I'm so glad we did! The drinks were spicy, but tasty and the food was Yummy! I love the queso with the freshly made tortilla chips as well as the Chorizo quesidilla. In addition, the vibe of the place is warm and friendly. I will be returning to Don Chingon!",4.0
"Wonderful new spot near Barclays Center. The dulce caliente margarita is so good that I dream about it! Great appetizer and entree menu too, and at reasonable pricing. Service is also attentive, warm and friendly. All in all, a great experience.",5.0
"Dear lord, tasty tacos, strong margaritas, high quality tequilas, fresh salsas, handmade tortillas and excellent Guacamole (with grapes; sounds weird but was actually delicious). Myself and 2 other friends went there before the Madonna concert at Barclays and decided to split a selection of things. We had the queso (good), guacamole (excellent!), carnitas tacos (amaze-balls), steak quesadillas (great), and chicken tacos (good). My favorite, hands down are the carnitas. Must order! Steak quesadillas and chicken tacos were also really delicious. We each had a couple margaritas which were strong, with fresh flavors/juices and well made. Not sickly sweet like some of the 'ritas in this town tend to be. One of my friends who came with us was very knowledgeable about tequilas and was impressed by the selection.

Very good. I had margaritas and the 2 for 5 dollar tacos (carnitas) sooooo gooooooddd I had to stop myself from ordering more because I was being a fat ass lol. Worth stopping by.,5.0
"We stumbled upon this Mexican spot in search of a quick bite before a show at Barclay's and were running behind schedule, as usual.  They were very accommodating and the food was excellent, good portions, and authentic.  I recommend anything with the skirt steak and the fish tacos.  Fresh margaritas, made to order and super friendly service.",5.0
"Delicious, even as take-out.  The chorizo y pappas burrito was great, and my daughter loved her simple bean cheese rice burrito as well.  Interesting twist on traditional guacamole too.  Not the cheapest burritos in town, but worth ti.",4.0
"I went to Don Chignon with my coworkers one day and it is AMAZING. The margaritas are delicious, guacamole is perfect and the customer service is great. Vic the owner is a genuine great guy who will help you get a table or anything you need. I went back again for Cinco De Mayo and they even had someone walking around giving you free tequila! Awesome atmosphere and a great happy hour :)",5.0
