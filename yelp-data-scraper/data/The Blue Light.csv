"Give her a try. Andrea's the most attentive-minded host I've ever met.Delectible eats and yummy organic brewski. I'll be back with my vegan extraordinaire daughter next week...Take time to play red light, green light to 'Blue Light' every Friday. (You hit the bullseye, Andrea!)",5.0
"I was unaware of this place.  *Gasp*!  Me?  The grilled-cheese fanatic?!  In fact, I was brought here during a series of restaurant/bar-hopping by my OC escort, who will be unnamed, but elbows point to John K. Having tried tons of grilled cheese spots, the flavors were pretty much predictable, so I wasn't expecting much except just a regular good ol' sandwich.  But Hot DAMN!  I believe we had The Outlaw or Don Poblano.  It was a gooey-ness of Gruyere and Fontina in-yo-face flavors!  The bread was grilled to perfection.. soft, with a thin outer layer of crispness.  What made it extra special was the tomato soup dipping sauce - warm, rich, and acidic enough to cut all the grease from that divine cheese.It's so simple, yet so satisfying.  They don't skimp on the cheese either.. you get a nice bread-to-cheese ratio.  The portion size is slightly larger than your average sando as well.  All the future gasses in my stomach and/or butt can never keep me away from this cheesy mess! Don't act like cheese doesn't make you gassy, Miss Classy.Ambiance is clean and modern.  The space is small with tables set up closely to each other.  I could literally join the conversation from the people sitting next to me.  Reminds me of shared tables in Europe.  Small and quaint.  Thank you table-next-to-me for letting me invade your space.Can't wait to come back again!  Come hungry, come prepared.. with Beano.",5.0
"This was hardly a ""vegan night,"" more like a vegan hour. I got there at 6:30 to wait in line for over an hour, then be told that there is only one option to choose from. This was supposed to be from 6 to Midnight and I got there at 6:30. Ridiculous. Not to mention you were extremely understaffed for an event you guys advertised. While we were eating, someone arrived at 9 to be told that there was only one vegan grilled-cheese option available and that he would only get half of the ingredients it's supposed to come with. If everyone ordered as soon as they got there you guys would have lasted a total of 15 minutes before already running out of ingredients that should have lasted 6 hours. Completely unacceptable. The only reason I'm giving this place a generous rating is because the grilled-cheese was good nonetheless, but was lacking cheese most likely because they were running out and had to give smaller portions.",2.0
"Came here a few nights a go for the first time- and it turns out that it was the one year anniversary! I frequent Rialto for breakfast and thus, my expectations were high. I wasn't disappointed. The service is incredibly friendly, the atmosphere is great, and around 10:30PM there was even live music!I got the french onion grilled cheese and it was one of the most delicious things I've ever had. The tomato soup that came on the side was equally delicious. I also tried a bite of the grilled cheese that had blue cheese, brie, fig, and I don't remember what else- but that was unexpectedly amazing as well! So many flavors.I'm already excited for next Friday so I can come back and try something new!",5.0
"Came here for dinner on a Friday night with my boyfriend on our way home, best grilled cheese ever.  They might have a limited menu, but for a reason. The choices they do have, are amazing. Wish they were open more!",5.0

"i am so sad that Andrea, the propietor, is moving on from the Blue Light after the 29th of this month. It has been a great time eating her cashew cheese (vegan) sandwiches. And drinking fine craft beer at $5-8. And looking at her fine wines. And eating her delicious tots that come from the oven and did I mention her cashew cheese?",5.0
Gourmet grilled cheese!! Fresh ingredients and simply delish! I'm a fan of this delightful lil spot. Comfort food at its finest. Fridays always seem better with a perfectly cooked grilled cheese and a great beer!,5.0
"This place was suggested when looking for an establishment that is dog friendly. My girlfriend and I walked here around 10pm and there were a few tables outside that were available. I went in to place a food order and was impressed by the restaurant decor. I was greeted shortly after arriving at the country. The server was friendly and efficient. Orders the French Onion, Figgy Smalls, taters, and 21st Amendment. Everything was delicious! Will definitely come back to try the other sandwiches. Thank you!",5.0
This place is amazing. Friday night grilled cheeses before a night out.  Great beer pairings! And Andrea is just amazing in general. We went here to find a hole on the wall with great food and found it. If it is Friday night and you are looking for some great food in an amazing atmosphere look no further!,5.0
"Vegan night was amazing. The place was slammed but ABSOLUTELY worth the wait. Delicious food, and such an endearing and kind staff. My wife and I are both vegan and gluten-free. We called ahead, and they had GF bread. We came back a week later, and the proprietor not only remembered us, but made sure to have a fresh loaf of gluten free bread for us.Amazing service. Delicious food. Great ambiance. Don't wait for another vegan night though, they've got vegan options each week.",5.0

"Friday night the Rialto Cafe becomes The Blue Light where two lovely ladies make fabulous grilled cheese sandwiches. Your mouth will be delighted with the comforting goodness of a standard classic or one of their creative concoctions of cheese, meat and/or veggies on artisan bread. I'm not a tomato soup fan, but the small side that came with my sandwich for dipping converted my taste buds. If you love grilled cheese then make the effort to visit.",5.0
"When I heard this place was a grilled cheese shop, I kinda laughed. I was thinking, how good can you make a grilled cheese? Well, I am an asshole, because they make the hell out of a grilled cheese. Not to mention they're always spinning great records, playing good movies, everyone is always super nice, and they serve decent beers. 10/10, will eat these grilled cheeses many times in the future, Thanks.",5.0
I come here basically every single week and they serve the most amazing grilled cheeses ever.  Although the French Onion is no longer on the menu ( :( ) the Pasteur J (pulled pork w/ peppers) is as good.  The tater tots are also amazing and the desserts (that change every week) are also amazing.  The only bad thing is that they are only open on Fridays.,5.0
"Blue Light is amazing...I'm not just saying that because I consume massive amounts of beer and cheese on the regular.  This place needs to be open 7 days/wk! The food is orgasmic and the beer is good too. I almost crapped my pants. Ok, I did crap my pants.",5.0
"Amazing grilled cheese sandwiches!  Very creative and flavorful and they serve 1 or 2 small but tasty desserts as well a great selection of excellent beer.  Open Fridays only - enjoy, but don't go telling everybody.",5.0

"My fiancé and I love this place! It's a cute little breakfast shop that moonlights on Friday nights as Blue Light-gourmet grilled cheese and beer. Also, they make these mini cheesecakes that are to die for. My personal fav is the peanut butter and jelly cheesecake. They are small, so you don't feel too guilty.  This place is small, so you might have a hard time accommodating a really big party. But the ambiance and antique-y feel is just so cute and so downtown Fullerton. The grilled cheese selection offers something for everyone and I have tried two already and both are great. They make them low and slow and to order, just like they should, so don't expect fast food. Service is great and Andrea, (who runs the show) is super sweet and helpful, especially when I can't decide which beer to get. I can't wait to go back!",5.0
"Love love love this place! If you have a hankering for some super phenomenal grilled cheeses you must come here. I made my friends come with me so I could try a variety of the options and they were all awesome. My favorite might be the French onion, but I have yet to try all of them. Definitely come here if you're in the area!",5.0
To die for!! My gf and I split the forager and the French onion and oh my goodness- all the flavor in both melted so good together. Andrea is such a doll and has so many fun beers to offer to accompany your GC. I'll definitely be coming back for more cheesy goodness!,5.0

"My husband and I are obsessed with this Friday night pop-up! We couldn't decide on which grilled cheeses to get so we got one of each so we could sample them all. EVERY one was so incredibly delicious. My personal favorite was the French Onion. I've been craving it ever since! Also, the two girls who run this show are Andrea up front and Danielle in the kitchen. They are friendly, helpful and just genuinely excited to be sharing their food with everyone- makes you really want to support them! I love that they have a good craft beer selection to accompany the eats. Oh! And we shared a sea salt caramel dark chocolate bar for dessert that Andrea made that's probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. I think her desserts change every week so I can't wait to try what she makes next!",5.0
"Came here last night looking for a midnight snack after having coffee down the street. A pop up grilled cheese spot sounded perfect. When you get there they have a cute blackboard sign outside letting you know that you have arrived. The decor inside is so cute as well- not too bright and not too dark. The staff is very friendly. When I found out they ran out of the seasonal grilled cheese I was saddened, but still craving a grilled cheese. I ended up just going with the classic and adding bacon. I love grilled cheeses, and this is in my top 5! It was nice and crispy and cheesy and gooey and the bacon was cooked nicely. The tomato soup dip was basically marinara sauce, but it was all very delicious. They close at midnight but they didn't kick us out on the dot. And we got a cute little pot de creme for free because they were closing and getting rid of them, so sweet :) All in all I'm happy with my experience here, and I would (and will) return to the blue light!",5.0

Went to downtown Fullerton for an epic night and pregamed at this place with a wonderful snack. Had the French onion sandwich and just got addicted immediately. Will comeback definitely for the other 4 flavors of fromage. Andrea was amazing and made sure I had a drink in my hand at all times. Must visit if your in the area.,5.0
