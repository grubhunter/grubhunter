"Great burgers. Great brunch. Even better margaritas. Friendly service. The food is a cross between French and Mexican, so it's an interesting fusion of a cuisine.Their cat is the most awesome cat ever and she loves belly rubs. Ask to see the cat.",5.0
"The Quick: Delicious French and Mexican food, large outdoor patio/garden that's great for rowdy groups, delicious brunch drinks and just steps away from the L train.The Details: A birthday party forced me into Brooklyn, but luckily I loved my experience (and endured the commute) to Santos Anne. The strange combination of Mexican and French was done just perfectly. The beef tartare was incredible, as was the Mexican scramble served with corn tacos for make your own. The ginger margarita was legendary, but we were not a fan of the habanero lavender. The staff was extremely accommodating, even for a loud mouthed group of 25. If I find myself in Brooklyn again I would absolutely return to sit in that beautiful outdoor space.The Damage: Our party worked out a price fix with the venue, but all brunch options were reasonable.",4.0
Great place to have diner! Romantic yet relaxed: my husband and I have been going to this place for the last 3 years and we always had a great time! The quality of the food and drinks is very consistent (so rare in NYC) and so is the service: friendly and non-pretentious - perfect for a date night or diner with friends.They also have a great backyard so cannot wait for the summer time!,5.0
"Liked: The cozy Mexican/dive-bar feel, the hospitable staff that reconfigured their whole front bar to fit our big group at the table, the live music wafting in from the back-yard.Just meh: The food itself. So much good Mexican food around the States, but this wasn't up there at all. Also the waiter put down a whole bunch of guacamole dip no one ordered and we thought was complimentary... they were not. That old trick. If I was in the neighborhood again I'd grab a beer and listen to some tunes out the back, but eat elsewhere.",3.0
Quality food and exceptional service. Cool band on Thursday night. Happy hour until 8pm. Will visit again soon.,5.0
"HUGE fan of this spot. Food aside, it has an unbelievable ambience that makes you love it the second you enter. Service is very friendly and inviting. If you walk through the restaurant, there's a large outdoor patio/garden in the back that is just adorable and very well decorated with lights strung and a bunch of tables out there. It's a great spot for a date or hanging out with friends alike. Not sure how this changes in cold weather, but for the summer I can vouch that it's spectacular. Food is delicious. I had the mushroom risotto, which comes to your table completely flambéed...so beware that it will be steaming hot for a good 10 minutes. You'll just be smelling it and wishing you could eat it and will likely end up jumping the gun and burning your tongue like me.",5.0

Loved it. Romantic. Cozy. Cute. Adorable courtyard. Live music. Interesting fusion menu. What's not to love. I had a lavender jalapeño margarita which was delicious and perfectly spicy. I had the veggie tacos without the goat cheese and they were great. I added pineapple for a sweet addition. Super reasonable and a great time. We Weill definitely be back!,5.0
Best Mexican fusion spot in Williamsburg with even better margaritas.  Highly recommend the habanero-lavender or spicy pepper blends!  Great vibes in the backyard when they have live music.  And obviously don't miss out on their guac & chips ;),4.0
"Didn't expect Mexican-French fusion! What fun! The place I've been looking for since I've lived in the area because it has an awesome back yard and up front there was live music on Sunday night! A few mosquito bites didn't deter me from loving the place. The food was pretty good, I've had better French and Mexican but overall I was not disappointed. We had first, the shrimp and pineapple guacamole (spicy!) which means several bites tastes like pineapple and several bites tastes solely of jalapeño! Not the best guacamole I've ever had big definitely not bad. Could have used salt. Good chips. We got the duck tacos with tangy sauce and goat cheese. Mmmmmmmmm. Could have come with a side at $12 for 2 but they were juicy and tasty! Then the infamous Mexican steak tartare. Interesting. For some reason my foodie boyfriend was expecting a raw egg on top but I assured him not all steak tartare comes with a raw egg lol. It had jalapeños in it (as we had the choice of spicy or not) and came with an awesome dark greens (arugula, baby kale, etc in an awesome vinaigrette) and amazing French fries. The quality of the meat was awesome and with a bit of Cholula, it was pretty darn flavorful. The drinks we got were -ginger and st. Germaine margarita -habanero and lavender margarita. Both very good. Didn't exactly taste the lavender but oh well. Overall we hot 2 drinks, two ""entrees"" and an appetizer for $31+tip each. Not that bad! Pretty interesting tasty food! Would come back if not for the food, definitely for the backyard ambience.",4.0
"We have been coming to Santos Anne for over the past 5 years and I can honestly say, it's one of our favorite and most consistent place to frequent. It is safe to say that everything is fantastic. My wife usually gets the mushroom risotto, it is fantastic! All  the burgers are Excellent, the burger with chorizo is one of my all time favorite burgers in the neighborhood. The duck burger and the salmon burger are great! Their brunch is excellent and the drinks are really good. Just the idea of a fusion of French and Mexican, how can you go wrong. I like the fact that there  is usually always something going on. Mostly live music to a tarot card reader and it is a nice touch. But whether you choose brunch or dinner, you will never be let down. The staff are all great. The food is always first rate. I recommend the  guacamole or the French onion soup for appetizers. I can honestly say that if you are in the neighborhood and are thinking about eating here, I say go for it you will not be disappointed and it will probably  guaranteed become a favorite place for you  to frequent when you want to have a great meal, and a great time.",5.0

Brunch- bloody marys in a nice big glass, it's all good but Croque Mexicano with egg all the way, chicken chilaquiles for something different Dinner: steak tartare, salmon burger a must (seriously best one ever with a chipotle mayo crack sauce), duck burger is  they don't skimp on the duck, oh and the guac is  chunk , fresh with chips def not from a bag (made there?).",5.0

"I wanted to like this place SO bad. The ambiance is just out of this world charming, with the back patio being the highlight of our evening. They have a large lovely tree in the center that they surrounded with wood for a table, a small porch with a vintage lamp, another seating area with a canopy covered in greenery, ambient lighting everywhere- it's a relaxing and warm environment that I enjoyed being in. And while others have mentioned having trouble with the service, my waitress ended up being awesome. Tall thin blonde woman who was attentive and funny.But the food and drinks didn't do it for us. My friends mojito was ridiculous, I've never seen a drink made like this before. They cut up a whole lime and put it in there- they must have. It tasted like nothing else but limes, we counted at least 4 slices in the glass that we could see, and lime debris ended up clogging up the straw making it undrinkable. Why not just drink it straight out of the glass then? Because there was such an abundance of muddled mint that my friend said, ""I don't want to have to chew my drink"". Seriously. My Planters Punch tasted vaguely medicinal and overly tangy. Neither of the drinks came with ice so they were also lukewarm. The best part of the meal were my friends Merguez taco- lamb sausage tacos with onions, avocado, and a little chipotle salsa. These were delicious, though we both thought they tasted more like pork than lamb, but neither of us have had much lamb sausage so maybe this isn't unusual. My octopus ceviche was kinda hard to eat, didn't enjoy it. It comes in a bowl with what amounts to pico de galo, and it makes up most of the dish. It was overpowering, too much honey, too much oil, way too tangy.  My friends pork brochette was overcooked and too sweet. My steak brochette was cooked very nicely but was completely overpowered by thyme to the point that you couldn't taste the meat. Both dishes came with comically large chunks of meat on a single skewer. My dish said it was cooked with mushrooms, his with apples, and on each of our skewers these were only present in single pieces at both ends. The plates were also very crowded with the skewer, fries, and unnecessary salad that made the whole thing difficult to maneuver. I'm also not sure why they consider themselves French. Besides offering escargot and a foie gras sauce, there's no nods to French culture or cuisine, it's not even fusion. It's more of a modern, interpretative take on Mexican considering the ingredients, drinks, and decor. Unfortunately despite the lovely atmosphere and service I won't be back. Two drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees came to $80 before tip- definitely not worth it. I think if they switched to just small plates and focused more on the craftsmanship of their drinks they could be a lovely spot.",2.0

My daughter and I found ourselves in Brooklyn and didn't know where to have dinner.  Found this place here on Yelp and it did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is simply adorable; it was a bit chilly but next time I definitely want to sit in the garden that also looked great.  The food was good too; we got guacamole and that was a bit small for the price imho BUT I'd still order it again because it was SO good !  For entree I got the mushroom risotto which was also very good and my daughter got the carnitas tacos which were a little spicy for me but she enjoyed them.  Then the final highlight was the live jazz band.  Overall it was a great night,4.0

"So in love with this cozy little gem! It's my fourth time here and  I must say that it has made the list of my favorite eateries in NY. This restaurant has such a warm, welcoming staff whom are very knowledge with almost every item I've inquired about on the menu. It has great ambiance and a perfect spot for a date night. My drink of choice was the fleur spritz - -Bombay sapphire-rose water -st Germaine-belvoir elderflower lemonadeIt was fresh, not too sweet and very much enjoyable.My ultimate favorite dish - kale salad with chorizo, octopus, tomatoes and calamariThis dinner choice is just simply remarkable! It's under the appetizer list, but the portion size is huge and so filling! It comes with an anchovy dressing that is absolutely amazing! If you don't like kale or shun away from greens when it comes time to ordering dinner, I highly highly recommend this dish - trust me you won't regret it. For dessert, I had the strawberry and banana Nutella crepe which was pretty good and a great ending for my o' so satisfied tummy ;) The owner was present and I must say he got the  award for the 3 A's -  awesome, amicable, and accommodating. And, they have a live jazz band that performs---- awesomeeeee sauceeee!!!!All in all, Santos Anne - FIVE STARS.

"The backyard is so adorable and the atmosphere totally reminds me of the dinner Jess and Celine had with the family in Greece in the movie Before Midnight.

I literally wanted to try everything on their menu because they all sounded amazing! I ordered duck taco yesterday and it was fabulous. The goat cheese was slightly warmed up by the meat and the softness and creaminess was like heaven. It would be perfect if I could add some dried cranberries or sliced almond to the taco to give some crunchiness texture to the whole thing.

"I love this place. The food is a bit eclectic but freaking delicious. Apparently the owner is from France but the head Chef is Mexican, so they collaborated. Which resulted in a menu that features duck tacos, fois grois covered gnocchi, SEDUCTIVE guacamole and several rich cuts of steak.  ALL of the margaritas are incredible (ask about the seasonal!), but, the bartenders have clearly mastered the classic marg, made from scratch. This is a family owned business that's clearly run by a small staff that seems to legitimately enjoy each other. It's great for a date, a party, or solo. Hint: I think their garden is open now!! It's an amazing escape from the city! Check this place out.",5.0

The one star off is due to my very limited selection on the menu, but it's my boyfriend's favorite plus a lovely place to go on a date or to strike up conversations with cool strangers. Definitely worth peeling in!",4.0

I must say I picked the right night... apparently Wednesday is ladies night so me and my gf got a free glass of champagne.

It didn't taste like lemonade at all really. We asked for a little glass of pineapple juice to mix in and it was much better! The juice was all fresh so big kudos there. For starters we had a cheese plate and the beet carpaccio. WOW, they were both amazing. The cheese plate was huge and had lots of goodies - a bunch of cheese, walnuts, dates, arugula, apples... it was damn good. I absolutely loved my beet carpaccio... it hit every note. It was sweet with a nice twang from the goat cheese, the nuts added this killer crunch then the arugula + caper salad... wow.. really it was that good. We probably could have just had the starters - they were great size but of course we were starving and over ordered. I had the burger with fries... it was seasoned to perfection. The chipotle mayo was a nice touch too. I really enjoyed it with the fries. My veggie fried ordered the veggie tacos and really liked them. I will definitely be back! Check this place out for sure ;) ps. they do take cards ;)",4.0

"This little cozy French -Mexican restaurant carries mostly innovative Mexican-flavored items with a French style touch.  The dishes we had were very tasty and impressive. The ambience was relaxing and vibrant and the service was warm and friendly.It also has a good selection of wine.  I gave a five star review because in terms of cost and profit value, it is certainly well worth the trip and experience.",5.0
"Went there for an anniversary dinner, was not impressed. Who puts  melted mozzarella cheese on fajitas? The tacos were okay, risotto was cooked badly and the fajitas were bland with no sour cream or pico.Had the ""mezcow mule"", just tasted like straight vodka with a lime.Don't believe the hype, this place is nauseating.",1.0
"Went for the first time over the weekend for a late dinner. A very charming spot with good food, live music and a garden. I had the salmon burger and friends (great fries and the burger was solid). My friend had the kale salad and loved it. We lingered for a long time and the staff had no problem with that. Would definitely go back to try the duck burger and some of the seafood.",4.0
"I love this place. The food is a bit eclectic but freaking delicious. Apparently the owner is from France but the head Chef is Mexican, so they collaborated. Which resulted in a menu that features duck tacos, fois grois covered gnocchi, SEDUCTIVE guacamole and several rich cuts of steak.  ALL of the margaritas are incredible (ask about the seasonal!), but, the bartenders have clearly mastered the classic marg, made from scratch. This is a family owned business that's clearly run by a small staff that seems to legitimately enjoy each other. It's great for a date, a party, or solo. Hint: I think their garden is open now!! It's an amazing escape from the city! Check this place out.",5.0
"I have been there 4 or 5 times, and it has always been a blast. Yesterday was really my favorite time though. We booked the petanque court with friends, had 2 tables, and were having dinner/drinks at the same time. It was as good as it sound! This place never disappoints by any means. Food, drinks, staff & service, location, everything rocks.",5.0
"Cute ambience, tasty food, personable waitstaff, all in all a great experience! But hard to navigate as a vegetarian ( I eat those portobello tacos every time...) but carnivore bf loves them. Plus? It's just a quiet, off the beaten path joint in Williamsburg where you can feel like you're having an intimate dinner without feeling rushed along. The one star off is due to my very limited selection on the menu, but it's my boyfriend's favorite plus a lovely place to go on a date or to strike up conversations with cool strangers. Definitely worth peeling in!",4.0
"I love ordering their guacamole to go, and have had some good meals here, especially the burger.Whats always lacking is the service.  Last time I was in there, our server was so out of it, it seemed like she was on another planet. She couldn't even run a credit card accurately, and we ended up getting charged twice.  They couldn't do a refund over the phone and it was frustrating to have to go back there for our refund.",2.0
"Came in for dinner last night. I've been wanting to come for a bit - I am a sucker for anything french fusion. I must say I picked the right night... apparently Wednesday is ladies night so me and my gf got a free glass of champagne. (classy broads right?)Anyway - the restaurant is super cute, dimly lit and intimate. The live music is really cool too. We ordered lolo strawberry lemonade and boy oh boy it was STRONG. It didn't taste like lemonade at all really. We asked for a little glass of pineapple juice to mix in and it was much better! The juice was all fresh so big kudos there.

"This place is foul. Straight up. Don't eat here, unless you're sole intention is to do mezcal shots at the bar.  Tacos looked like they were ordered off the taco truck at N. 7th but tasted worse. Those tacos are actually aight. El pastor taco had some sort of tendon, shredded iceberg lettuce and a random slice of cucumber. Gross. My $10 mezcal cocktail tasted like lighter fluid and warm piss.

"New fav restaurant alert! I've been to Santos Anne the past few weekends and it's really great. The crepes are amazing and the margaritas are excellent. Their bloody mary is really unique tasting - lots of cilantro and jalapeno but still super light. They have a great brunch happy hour too with $5 drafts and $7 margaritas and bloody marys. The staff is super nice as well, especially the one guy who gave us a free shot of their infused tequila.The best part is that you can go there (for right now) on the weekends and not have to deal with a 500 hour wait.

"Pretty awful experience. They seated us next to the bar which meant we were constantly butted up against a gang of smokers and attendees of a loud bday party.

"I debated whether to post this in Craiglist's ""Missed Connections"" or Yelp. Yelp won.I am guessing you are looking at your smartphone, standing on a street corner in Brooklyn searching for something that's open and serves good food. You probably don't have time to read the anecdotal musings of a girl who has fallen in love. I understand. If you want a straight-to-the-point review of Santos Anne, scroll to the bottom of this absurdly long post. If you want a story of passion, hope, love and loss -- keep reading.In order to understand the importance of this night, you must first know that I live in Taiwan. Taiwan is the land where eligible bachelors are not only few and far between, but they also are NOT interested in awkward Jewish girls who drink a lot and talk too much. I moved to Taipei from New York for a job and had the opportunity to visit Brooklyn a year later. My friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner after some comedy at the Knitting Factory (I highly recommend you go to their free shows on Sunday nights).We saw that Santos Anne was open until 12am and decided to power walk over at around 11:50pm. Last minute customers are a servers worst nightmare, but the staff welcomed us with open arms. As soon as we sat down I saw him. He was sitting in the corner with a plate of cheese and a glass of wine (or was it beer?). I don't think I have ever seen a man so beautiful in my life.You can imagine my shock when he got up and walked right over to us. Turns out, he was our waiter and he was French. The accent! I die.* I stammered through my order and accepted wine from the bartender who insisted we drink. Team, listen: A man hasn't so much as looked my way in a year. That is precisely why I acted like a giddy 12-year-old girl who just spotted Justin Bieber every time this guy came to our table. I scarfed down my duck tacos, which tasted like love and possibilities, and proceeded to imagine all the things I'd do to the waiter (you know, things like stare at him in his sleep, buy cupcakes and pretend I made them, hide the fact that I am a crazy lady until we were married) if I lived in the States. At the end of the night, the drunk bartender poured more wine for me and said, in a very difficult-to-decipher slur, that a man was going to fall in love with me really soon.Now I don't know if the waiter and bartender set up some sort of ponzi scheme where insecure women who have intimacy issues believe they can sustain a successful relationship with one of the wait staff, but I asked for a job application after dinner. When he came back with the bill (sans application) I saw we were only charged for our tacos. FREE DRINKS! As we were getting up to go, my waiter/boyfriend looked me in the eyes and said, ""We go make out now, no?"" He felt it too! I smiled coyly. Could I kiss this man I hardly knew on my last night in Brooklyn? He was so beautiful. His eyes were the ocean! His skin, the sand! Despite his beauty, I knew what my answer was. ""No, not tonight."" When I said it out loud, my heart attempted to punch my brain in the face. Alas, I am a woman of class. I cannot make out with a man unless he's bought me flowers or at least six shots of whiskey. I left Santos Anne with nothing more than a kiss on the cheek.I am back in Taiwan now, but my heart just isn't in it anymore.If you are reading for a review on the food, atmosphere and all that other crap Yelp is useful for, then here you go:Food = Excellent. Order the tacos you can't really go wrong. Atmosphere = Adorable, friendly, cool.Other Crap = Great. This is a good restaurant. That's it.*Just to let you know, I am an intelligent girl that is not easily fooled by a pretty boy with an accent but you try living in Taiwan for a year and not getting so much as a Herro!P.S. Stay away from my boyfriend.",5.0
Love this little place. They always use fresh fruit for the margaritas and they're only $5 during happy hour. The hangar steak is excellent and the fries were great too! I'm excited to come back and try the burger next time.,5.0
"The food here is on the better side of average, but there is one dish that is absolutely, utterly, unbelievably exquisite: the kale salad with seafood. Ask for the hot pepper powder (it comes in a vial with a skull and cross bones, not all waiters will know what you're talking about but the bussers might). The decor is charming!! But not in that irritating campy previous kind of way. It's genuinely charming. And reasonable prices too. And presentation is great. Go!",3.0

"So disappointing the second time.  The first time I went, we had great service, food, drinks and atmosphere.  That being said we were going to dinner with someone who lives near the restaurant and had never been so we highly recommended to him and we all went.  We passed up the lovely looking Le Barricou.  Should have tried a new place.  -Waiter stated that it was his first night.  He didn't know anything.  Besides that was absent.  We were never asked if we wanted more drinks when we were finished with ours.  -Drinks- margaritas were watered down.  I ordered the habanero/lavender and didn't notice either flavor just some limes and geez so much ice that I took a few swigs and all I had left was ice in the glass.  -Food- Cheese plate to share.  Cheeses and portions were decent.  No explanation of what cheese we got when they gave us the plate.  We just guessed.  -Salmon Tacos- super greasy -Veggis Tacos- Bland-Pork something- Bland Should give it a one but giving it the benefit of a doubt that maybe they had an off night.  They should train their new staff.",2.0

"4 for the food, 2 for the service.I came here on the early side of brunch, and the restaurant was half full. By the time we were trying in vain to grab our check, it was almost completely packed. This place suffers from some serious logistics issues.Environment is great! The outdoor patio is such a city oasis. I absolutely love the atmosphere.Our waiter was nice enough, albeit a bit on the slow side. He spent about 5 minutes introducing himself and the menu with his personal recommendations, which is TOTALLY fine with a nearly empty restaurant and when you have your tables under control, but when you're pressed for time, you might want to speed up the speech. It took us 10 minutes to get our food and drink orders in and then our waiter went ghost on us. In fact, I didn't see him again after he brought our drinks because the bus boys ran the show after that. However, they didn't speak a lick of English, so when I asked for a side of home fries (that were delicious, by the way from the sample I took from my friend's plate - hence the need for a side order), he said ""one second"" as if to grab someone and never came back. So, I didn't get my home fries, and after we got our check, no one would come to pick it up. I was running tight on making a train home, so after another 15, 20 minutes, I had to pull a power move and go to the bar and cash myself out.I'll admit it. I am probably going to return. My brother ordered the Steak and Eggs and I ordered the Mexican Breakfast. Wow! Amazing. I think I had plate envy because my brother's Steak and Eggs was so flavorful! Overall, the Mexican inspired brunch was phenomenal and their picante sauce was some of the best I've ever had. I just hope next time, I can upgrade my review after service that matches the quality of the food.PS. Hot restaurant owner alert.",3.0
This was a great spot for our group out celebrating my friend's birthday. The margaritas were amazing (especially the ginger one!) and our server was super attentive.

"I debated whether to post this in Craiglist's ""Missed Connections"" or Yelp. Yelp won.I am guessing you are looking at your smartphone, standing on a street corner in Brooklyn searching for something that's open and serves good food. You probably don't have time to read the anecdotal musings of a girl who has fallen in love. I understand. If you want a straight-to-the-point review of Santos Anne, scroll to the bottom of this absurdly long post. If you want a story of passion, hope, love and loss -- keep reading.In order to understand the importance of this night, you must first know that I live in Taiwan. Taiwan is the land where eligible bachelors are not only few and far between, but they also are NOT interested in awkward Jewish girls who drink a lot and talk too much. I moved to Taipei from New York for a job and had the opportunity to visit Brooklyn a year later. My friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner after some comedy at the Knitting Factory (I highly recommend you go to their free shows on Sunday nights).We saw that Santos Anne was open until 12am and decided to power walk over at around 11:50pm. Last minute customers are a servers worst nightmare, but the staff welcomed us with open arms. As soon as we sat down I saw him. He was sitting in the corner with a plate of cheese and a glass of wine (or was it beer?).

"This review is overdue, but I just want to say that I had a great experience here with my boyfriend and I would like to come back again. The food here is very delicious. I didn't give a five star because the service is a bit depending on the person who serves you. There were two waiters while we were there, the first waiter who ordered for us gave us drinks, and never came back to order us food (for like 30 min), even though we told him we are here for dinner! Finally we had to find someone else to serve us so that we can actually eat something, and the second waiter who served us was AMAZING! Not only did he recommend the best dish on the menu, but also gave us free round of shots since I liked them on facebook. The shots taste very good, it was not a simple shot but a recipe in which tequila is mixed with other things, yum! I was really surprised because usually I have low expectations for shots, even mixed ones due to many past experiences. I didn't finish the shot in one time because I wanted to save it for the entree. Seeing my unfinished drink, he came over and asked if I didn't like it. After I explained, he said he will give us another round of free shots if I finish it, so I don't need to save this one! Obviously I did and he delivered another round as promised. We finished our dinner in happiness and satisfaction.Btw, their bathrooms are very funny. The sex of the image on the men and women's doors are not easily identified, so people go in the wrong one all the time.",4.0
"My review is based solely on their brunch. French-Mexican fusion? Say what? In my neighborhood too? Destined for greatness.I have been here twice and both times the food was absolutely amazing.

Again mouthfuls of amazing flavor.Service is quick and simple, no rude waiters here.Definitely recommend this place for brunch.",4.0

"This place is sensual to the 10th power!The space is small and seating is tight, but the dimly lit Spanish courtyard decor makes for a very intimate setting. Seriously, you'll only want to come here with people you like.  Eight of us rolled up for a birthday shin-dig with no reservation. The inevitable happened: wait time 1 hour. No problem, we got our drink on at a neighboring bar and awaited their call when our table was ready. I'm still swooning over the  grown and sexy vibe. A lot of it really had to do with the  live, sotto voce jazz music that really spoke to my soul. It was some next level shit!  [re: sensual]  But enough of that,  we were there to eat not make sexy time, so onto the food:- Guacamole: cilantro haters will foam at the mouth and lovers will get weak in the knees. I belong to the latter group. - Vegetable tacos: interesting combination of portobello, cilantro-mint, avocado, raw onions, tomato salsa, goat cheese. I tore that bitch to pieces! - I couldn't tell you what the meat lovers ate, but they ripped their meals to shreds in record time, so there's that. Service was fast and very attentive. The manager did well to check in on us ever so often. One minor, almost major blip was the entree mix up. I was accidentally given a very meaty taco. Said  meat was hidden under a bed of veggies which I discovered while poking around before getting my grub on. I told the waiter and he quickly rectified the problem. Shit happens, but they've got to be very careful to avoid these kinds of careless mistakes. Overall, a fantastic experience. Shout out to my homeslice and  Bk's OG Yelper, Lans S for an evening well worth the trek.",5.0
"You know it's not everyday that a restaurant surprises you in so many special little ways as Santos Anne did me.  Maybe it was on a short walk towards destinations unknown, a gorgeous Saturday night unfolding in front of us, and our hearts open?  Maybe it was the funny & friendly owner who peaked out the door of this spot that we almost walked right by?  We explained to him we had been thinking of pizza and he offered some very clever alternatives.  Perhaps you'd like to sing tonight?  We asked if he had heard of the famous Grammy nominee Jennifer Fingers, a good friend of ours.  He hadn't but offered us a table instead.Walking in all smiles, we are surrounded by happy Breukelleners, some at the bar chatting with the bartender, and others scattered about at the many cute tables.  The first thing I notice is the decor, lime green walls and bright red pillows.  Something about it was really sexy.  The owner then offers us possibly the best table in the house, right next to the raised music set.  Sweet!We sit down, and begin looking at our menu very casually.  It's amazing how this boro slows you down almost imperceptibly, and while you're not in a hurry, you notice little things.  Like the laughter at the table next to you, or the waiters and how friendly they are.  While we're pondering what we might imbibe, a few musical fellows make their way up the tiny stairs behind us and setup to begin playing.  I order tacos, and ceviche for my nameless damsel or is searching for words, and being all of shyness extraordinaire.  I also a tecate for me, and muscle her into a mulled wine knowing full well she would love it.  Who doesn't like mulled wine?As our food order makes it's way from notepad to kitchen, Greg Green and his band begin playing and treating our grateful ears.  Jamaican Jazz sure makes a sweet sound for a non-date date, one of those where you just wanna have a really good time, letting life go whichever serendipitous way it might.  If I haven't gushed enough already, your guess is spot on to say that the food matched the quality of this restaurant in every other way, and that is sumptuous.  Delicious.  Delightful.  Memorable.  Really kinda perfect.I'd go back to this spot in a second, and I'd line up to take your date here now, before this little secret becomes less of one.  You know how wildfires travel in NYC.",5.0

The staff took fabulous care of us. We were a group of 8 and it was a Saturday night, but they made it happen - and even hooked my peeps up at the bar...The drinks were inventive and oh so fine! The octopus ceviche was also fine -  mighty fine. A french twist on mexican can easily cross that fine line and end up right smack in bougie-town - but Santos handled it. Did I mention the musica? Live music is so key. I love how the space was constructed w/a deliberate focus on the stage. The music. The ambiance. Down to the cubby holes built into the wall in true mexican form. The 4pc band jammed the night away. It seemed the owner couldn't keep from tappin his toes, and ended up finding his way on stage, as well, to drops some beats on the drum box type device. It was a fine night and a lovely way to spend a cold Saturday evening w/ the lovelies!",4.0
Fantastic garden and a wonderful atmosphere. I went on a date on a Friday night and the service was excellent.

"I encountered the most spectacularly offensive service at Santos Anne that I can remember of any restaurant experience. I came here for dinner with a group of friends for a late dinner after a performance in the neighborhood. And I get that it was late, and we were closing the place out, and that our waiter probably was at the end of a long day and eager to get home. I understand. But such circumstances notwithstanding, I still expect some measure of civility. Instead, our waiter acted out, treating us to shockingly heinous attitude. I would rather have just been told upon arrival that the kitchen was closed than been subjected to the treatment that was in store for us.First, there was a simple mathematical mistake in dividing up our check. (We didn't realize that tip had been included.) Instead of coming back to our table and politely clarifying, our waiter came back and straight-up berated us, talking to us like we were stupid. The level of disrespect was breathtaking.One of my friends then asked if she could have her food boxed up to take home. Our waiter snatched the plate off the table with an aggressive sigh, like a teenager being asked by his mom to take out the trash.And when he came back with our bill and credit cards, he literally threw them onto the table in front of us and said, ""Whatever, just do what you want to do.""I plan to take that advice and, in the future, do what I want to do, which is to take my patronage elsewhere. Life's too short to be treated like garbage.P.S. Here's where I might otherwise say that, while the service was atrocious, I have to admit that we really enjoyed the food... - but to be honest, the food was nothing special, and, given its mediocrity, the price was almost as offensive as our waiter.",1.0
Ive gone a couple times so Ive had different experiences. happy hour is well priced but the margaritas are a bit to strong were  I had to force myself to drink it in order to not waste money.

Live music is so key. I love how the space was constructed w/a deliberate focus on the stage. The music. The ambiance. Down to the cubby holes built into the wall in true mexican form. The 4pc band jammed the night away. It seemed the owner couldn't keep from tappin his toes, and ended up finding his way on stage, as well, to drops some beats on the drum box type device. It was a fine night and a lovely way to spend a cold Saturday evening w/ the lovelies!",4.0
Fantastic garden and a wonderful atmosphere. I went on a date on a Friday night and the service was excellent. I had the pork brochette and it was delicious.  Portions were very generous - my entree came with mixed greens and french fries. Only disappointment was no live music! I guess I will just have to come back soon and try again.,4.0
"I encountered the most spectacularly offensive service at Santos Anne that I can remember of any restaurant experience. I came here for dinner with a group of friends for a late dinner after a performance in the neighborhood. And I get that it was late, and we were closing the place out, and that our waiter probably was at the end of a long day and eager to get home. I understand. But such circumstances notwithstanding, I still expect some measure of civility. Instead, our waiter acted out, treating us to shockingly heinous attitude. I would rather have just been told upon arrival that the kitchen was closed than been subjected to the treatment that was in store for us.First, there was a simple mathematical mistake in dividing up our check. (We didn't realize that tip had been included.) Instead of coming back to our table and politely clarifying, our waiter came back and straight-up berated us, talking to us like we were stupid. The level of disrespect was breathtaking.One of my friends then asked if she could have her food boxed up to take home. Our waiter snatched the plate off the table with an aggressive sigh, like a teenager being asked by his mom to take out the trash.And when he came back with our bill and credit cards, he literally threw them onto the table in front of us and said, ""Whatever, just do what you want to do.""I plan to take that advice and, in the future, do what I want to do, which is to take my patronage elsewhere. Life's too short to be treated like garbage.P.S. Here's where I might otherwise say that, while the service was atrocious, I have to admit that we really enjoyed the food... - but to be honest, the food was nothing special, and, given its mediocrity, the price was almost as offensive as our waiter.",1.0
Ive gone a couple times so Ive had different experiences. happy hour is well priced but the margaritas are a bit to strong were  I had to force myself to drink it in order to not waste money. The food is good but sadly food portions keep getting smaller and smaller :( The ambiance is cool and the have out door seating yay,3.0
"Amazing!  Was here for brunch and I want to eat EVERYTHING on the menu!  I ate an amazing sandwich that came with fries and a salad.  French press coffee served in small or large.  Beautiful backyard with live music and trees that block out the sun and rain perfectly.  I want to come back every weekend.  No iced coffee or credit cards, but everything was sooooo amazing it is fully deserving of it's 5 star rating.",5.0
"I'm a big fan after just one experience. We came in, 6 of us at 8:00 on a Friday eve without a reservation, after being told of a 45 minute wait at Dumont a few doors down Union street. We were warmly greeted by the bar keep, a handsome  Australian chap who helped us with drinks and delicious guacamole. The atmosphere and vibe was warm, friendly, hip and grounded. We were told that they had large party reservations but would get us a table in less than 20 minutes and they did.A trio, started playing some of the sweetest guitar tunes from the jazz catalog we dream of and the place took off into dinner heaven.Food and drinks were well priced, ample portions and real tasty. I had a terrific salmon burger. A few skirt stakes and a brochettes were served and everyone was happy. We didn't have desert but I will go back!",4.0
Easily the worst service I've ever experienced. Drinks and food were about average but we saw a server once an hour. Just paying our tab took serious effort.

"Checked out this place a few times now and the food is great every time. My fave so far is the Salmon Burger, highly recommend it. Iv gotten the Calamari app every time I came because it tastes super fresh every time. This place has some GREAT Margaritas!

"I seldom go to Williamsburg.. Had a brunch outing with some ladies friend that I just met in NYC.. :) I saw many reviews saying the service here is kinda weird.. but I had no problem with it.. :) I guess I am lucky???It was a mixture of french and mexican.. I always like my brunch with toast, eggs.... but this restaurant has a little twist.. the waitress was really friendly.. she told us that the chef had some specialty on that day.. 1) salmon, goat cheese, spinach, fried eggs2) lamb sausage, swiss cheese, bell peppers, onion, fried eggsso I ordered the first one without the goat cheese (sorry not a fan of cheese).. one of my friends ordered the 2nd one... I will only review on my meal because I never try the others...So the smoke salmon and spinach had the right amount of ""saltiness"".. The fried egg.. a little over medium.. was perfect.. I wished it was sunny side up.. with the raw egg yolk melting with the salmon and spinach.. It was served with 2 slices of toast.. I dip it with the egg yolk.. mixed it with the spinach and salmon.. mmmm.. I love it!! A different kind of healthy brunch.. :DA guy came and asked us how was our meal since it was their first day experimenting the 2 special dish.. I really like it...

"An utter disappointment. Upon arrival, my date and I were taken by the adorable decor and vibe in the place. A Brazilian (?) musical trio were playing on a stage in the middle of the restaurant - vocals, guitar, and muted trumpet - which was really quite lovely. We really wanted to like Santos Anne. We did.And then it all starting going south. We were not impressed with the waiter. He wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu, and he actually served me a mug of mulled wine without even noticing that it was at room temperature. Then we noticed there was a woman basically following a few steps behind him the entire evening. Was he training a new server?! I certainly hope not. If he is the role model for other servers, this place is in trouble.The food was mixed.. at best, it was nothing special. At worst, it was a complete waste of money. The biggest lowlight was the cheese plate. Not only was it served to us without any explanation as to what any of the cheeses or accoutrements were - but I swear each cheese tasted like the next. And this included a blue cheese! The entire plate was bland.

"My best friend and I came here for my birthday on a whim because I was intrigued by the idea of a French-Mexican restaurant.  We figured it was either the greatest idea we'd ever heard of or the worst.  I'm happy to say it's the former!  Santos Anne is cozy and quaint, making it a perfect spot for a date, special occasion, or dinner where you don't have to shout to be heard.  We went on a Monday night, so it was probably quieter than when they have live music, but I still can't imagine this place ever being too boisterous.Our waiter, who was French, was attentive, knowledgeable, and warm, offering suggestions and a little bit of fun flirtation.  The margaritas are perfectly mixed (I recommend the Ginger St. Germain) and totally delicious.  The menu features both French and Mexican dishes and a few hybrids.  I ordered the Steak Brochette which came with a generous helping of steak plus a light side salad and fries.  It was cooked exactly as ordered and the flavors were wonderful.  My best friend ordered the  Chilaquiles, which also came in generous portions.Upon finding out it was my birthday, our waiter brought us both a free shot of their signature tequila which was infused with rosemary and fig.  It was so smooth I could have drunk it straight all night (but probably a good thing I didn't).  To finish out our dinner, we ordered the classic creme brulee for desert, and the textures were perfect.  The top was crunchy but not overdone, and the custard was divine.Overall, we had a fantastic evening for a ridiculously reasonable price.  I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their dinner dishes and also brunch!  My new favorite place.P.S.---despite what it says up above, this place DOES accept credit cards",5.0

As someone who has worked in industry I would have at least apologized and offered something else off of the menu or even a free drink.

Yesterday, Memorial Day, we went over for dinner for the first time in a few months to give them another chance and were reminded of why we stopped going in.The first of the issues was service. The backyard was packed but there was one waitress for at least a dozen tables. To her credit, she was extremely nice and didn't stop smiling for the hour we were there, so the issue here was the management who decided to staff one waitress on a busy holiday, but the end result was the same: at least 15-20 minute wait to put in our drink order and another long wait to put in our dinner order. Dinner arrived quickly but the first of our two drinks arrived at least 10 minutes after that and we were told the second one was delayed because they made the wrong thing; it took 5-10 minutes for our second margarita to arrive. The whole process was slow and frustrating.The second issue was the food. We noticed it arrived very quickly, which was odd since everything else was crawling along, and it seemed that corners were cut across the board. The presentation seemed off; in particular, my girlfriend's steak seemed to have its components just tossed on the plate and the portions were strange, with a massive steak (a nice problem to have!) but very small portions of sides. Not a huge problem since the steak tasted OK but it contributed to the sense that something was going wrong in the place. The big problem was my mushroom risotto, which was a bowl of watery rice with some mushrooms and cheese thrown in. It was what you might expect if you described risotto to someone who had never read a recipe, tasted it, or seen a picture of it and then asked them to make it. I ate most of it and then had some pieces of my girlfriend's weird giant steak before leaving as soon as possible.The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because we have had a few very good brunch experiences.

It's straddling that line between authentic affordable mexican and the Dos Caminos fancy expensive Mexican which is usually just what I want.

"I was so excited about the Kale salad with chorizo. In fact, it's how I dragged my bf there in the first place instead of our usual old haunts.How do you make a bad kale salad? ... is what I was thinking as I munched on the terribly fishy Kale Caesar. It was laborious to get through and that's not usually how I feel about food. Especially Kale which is the ambrosia of the gods.My bf always eats everything and then some of the food on my plate, but he couldn't get through his Merguez either. My jaw dropped! He said it was drowning in a sticky sea of floppy peppers and cheese and he was going to be sick if he continued.I think they have some good ideas, but they really need to work on the food. If the food was better, we would be here all the time because we live so close!!",2.0

"Everything about this place is awesome and I'm so pleased it's right on my doorstep for the summer. I'm tempted to give it 1 star just to keep it a secret. It's so much better than Elote, and Elote was pretty amazing!A group of us went there for Cinco de Mayo for brunch and we ended up staying for about 6 hours. They have a mixture of French / Mexican (Frexican) cuisine. I had the croque madame and it was TO DIE FOR. The portion size was huge and very reasonably priced. The micheladas are pretty amazing too.They have beer and shot specials for $6 - great deal. There's a bocce ball court there, the outdoor garden is really cute, and there were some very French men when we were there!But best of all was our bartender/waiter David...he was absolutely hilarious! One minute he was wearing a black shirt, and the next he was wearing full on mexican attire. He also came out wearing a homemade holster ready to shoot shots with us. Unfortunately he had to work a double shift otherwise it would have been great to take him out after!As much as I would love to keep this place a secret, it's pretty hard to not tell everyone about it. Love this place!!",5.0
"Props for good food and a wonderful backyard atmosphere, but unfortunately the service was distractingly lacking. It took quite a while for anyone to approach our table (in the back corner, which smelled faintly like vomit or old garbage), let alone take our order. And our drinks and guacamole came almost immediately before our entrees, which weren't themselves prompt. Anyway, the cocktail selection was cool and I got a michelada with an add-shot of tequila, which was a nice kick. The two-taco options were a good budget-conscious choice especially if you wanted to share but probably aren't filling enough without another plate. My burger was solid but uninspired. And other than the oysters with french fries, there wasn't much that struck me as especially French. Cool atmosphere but go elsewhere for better Mexican.",3.0
Not bad but very far from great.Octopus ceviche had great meat but it was too brothy and too little. Escargot was good but nothing special. Steak Tartar was mediocre and came in an unappetizing burger patty shape.Cocktails were most disappointing.

It isn't like little slivers of meat delicacy laid out like I'm used to, No its a heaping mound of seasoned raw beef goodness. For those less adventurous the duck was cooked perfectly and their drinks should also get honorable mention. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the band was awesome. I will defiantly continue to go back again and again!!",5.0
"I'm smitten! This place is so good. The food is great, but the service is out of this world. Our server was a doll and the owner of the restaurant kept checking to see if we were happy.

"Found this place thanks to the great Yelp reviews & it didn't disappoint. Came here with my fiance for dinner and we had an amazing time!!Cuisine is French / Mexican and, though the combination may sound non-intuitive, it's fantastic. They have a lengthy menu (so no shortage of choices), live music, really nice staff, and a ""moody"" interior. Great neighborhood spot with reasonable prices.Things to be aware of:- Cash only- Don't leave without ordering at least one daily drink special- It's super dark so bring glasses (if you need them!)- The spicy guac isn't really spicy- They have an outdoor garden with a bocce ball court- Great and helpful staffI definitely need to come here for brunch!",4.0
"Love this place!In short, the food is great, the drinks are great, the service is friendly and warm, the backyard is lovely, and they've often got pretty decent live music. This place is never empty but also not so popular that you have to wait more than like 15 minutes or so for a table. It's probably just a really well-kept secret?Anyway Santos Anne is a great spot to meet with friends to start up your night with good drinks and good food. It's straddling that line between authentic affordable mexican and the Dos Caminos fancy expensive Mexican which is usually just what I want. They've got some unusual things on the menu too, like escargots (yum!) and changing guac specials, one of which was a pineapple & shrimp guac that was really delicious.",4.0
"If you're looking for a cozy french-mexican place with great food and positive energy, Santos is tops! I went here on Cinco De Mayo with a few friends and we were treated like we were VIP! The staff are very friendly and personable.  They had a great pineapple margarita like no other. I will definitely be back!",5.0
"I was so excited about the Kale salad with chorizo. In fact, it's how I dragged my bf there in the first place instead of our usual old haunts.How do you make a bad kale salad? ... is what I was thinking as I munched on the terribly fishy Kale Caesar. It was laborious to get through and that's not usually how I feel about food. Especially Kale which is the ambrosia of the gods.My bf always eats everything and then some of the food on my plate, but he couldn't get through his Merguez either. My jaw dropped! He said it was drowning in a sticky sea of floppy peppers and cheese and he was going to be sick if he continued.I think they have some good ideas, but they really need to work on the food. If the food was better, we would be here all the time because we live so close!!",2.0
Amazing brunch. Hands down. I thought I was never going to eat again afterwards. Entirely worth it and the food was amazing! The service was also very accommodating to my friends who had food allergies.,4.0
"Everything about this place is awesome and I'm so pleased it's right on my doorstep for the summer. I'm tempted to give it 1 star just to keep it a secret. It's so much better than Elote, and Elote was pretty amazing!A group of us went there for Cinco de Mayo for brunch and we ended up staying for about 6 hours. They have a mixture of French / Mexican (Frexican) cuisine. I had the croque madame and it was TO DIE FOR. The portion size was huge and very reasonably priced. The micheladas are pretty amazing too.They have beer and shot specials for $6 - great deal. There's a bocce ball court there, the outdoor garden is really cute, and there were some very French men when we were there!But best of all was our bartender/waiter David...he was absolutely hilarious! One minute he was wearing a black shirt, and the next he was wearing full on mexican attire. He also came out wearing a homemade holster ready to shoot shots with us. Unfortunately he had to work a double shift otherwise it would have been great to take him out after!As much as I would love to keep this place a secret, it's pretty hard to not tell everyone about it. Love this place!!",5.0
"Props for good food and a wonderful backyard atmosphere, but unfortunately the service was distractingly lacking. It took quite a while for anyone to approach our table (in the back corner, which smelled faintly like vomit or old garbage), let alone take our order. And our drinks and guacamole came almost immediately before our entrees, which weren't themselves prompt. Anyway, the cocktail selection was cool and I got a michelada with an add-shot of tequila, which was a nice kick. The two-taco options were a good budget-conscious choice especially if you wanted to share but probably aren't filling enough without another plate. My burger was solid but uninspired. And other than the oysters with french fries, there wasn't much that struck me as especially French. Cool atmosphere but go elsewhere for better Mexican.",3.0
Not bad but very far from great.Octopus ceviche had great meat but it was too brothy and too little. Escargot was good but nothing special.

"I've stopped in to Santos Anne for margaritas before (delicious margaritas, I should add) but hadn't eaten there until last week. I went there on a whim, and was very pleasantly surprised by how freaking awesome everything tasted. To start, I tried the Santos Anne cocktail - very strong, tasty, and a great remedy for a hard day. Then, my companion and I shared the pork tacos- flavorful, juicy meat with a fresh salsa and perfectly toasted corn tortilla. For dinner I tried the burger topped with chorizo (I might have been a little emotional that night) and it was soooooo good. Burgers have a tendency to be pretty good a lot of the time, but when you get a really excellent burger, it's a very special thing. And at Santos Anne, an excellent burger you will have.

I brought a date there and it took 25 minutes to get our first round, and 30 minutes to get our second round. They couldn't have been less prepared. But the real kicker is that there were two of us at a 4 seat table, and as we were finishing our second drink the waitress asked us if we could move to the bar, which had no open seats, so they could seat 4 people at our table. Unbelievable. Can you imagine an irish bar having one bartender on St. Paddy's day and having it take 25-30 minutes to get every beer, cause thats basically what happened here.",1.0
"Santos Anne is fantastic. Thanks to its combination of a large menu (on which everything seems to be excellent), the welcoming servers, daily live music and the beautiful interior, it's becoming a favorite neighborhood spot.So far, we've had:- kale caesar with seafood- beet carpaccio- pâté- guac (the spicy isn't very spicy)- sausage, duck, veggie and brie tacos (I get those without the bacon)- pork brochette- special casoulette- churros- petit pot chocolaté creamSo, um, yes, we go there a lot. All the drinks so far have been dangerously good, as well. I recommend the lavender-habanero margarita, the Rosé d'Anjou and the El Puebla.

"After reading all of the reviews here, I feel like it might have been an off day, or perhaps brunch is not their high point.  Normally I would have been more skeptical of French/Mexican fusion, but when I read they were related to Pates Et Traditions (one of my favorite places) I was excited to give it a go.Went here late on a Saturday for brunch.  They did a really nice job decorating the place and giving it a distinctively different feel than Elote/Santa Fe/Hope & Union Cafe.  The staff was very friendly too.  It was just the food that didn't quite do it for either of us.  My girlfriend had a pork sandwich and I had the Mexican Tartare.  The pork sandwich had what could only be described as a Velveeta-y cheese substance melted all over it.  The pork itself was ok, but the ""cheese"" really took away from the experience.  The tartare basically just had some cilantro and onions ground with the meat and didn't really taste all that appealing.  And paying $6.50 for a french press of Brooklyn Roasters coffee (that only amounted to a little over 2.5 cups) was also not a highlight.The whole fusion concept just seemed a little uninspired.  The basic formula seemed to be:[CHOOSE A WELL KNOWN MEXICAN OR FRENCH DISH] + [A FEW INGREDIENTS FROM MEXICAN/FRENCH cuisine] = MENU ITEM It was probably one of the least impressive meals I've had for a while in NY.  In fairness, everyone can have an off day so I might be down to come back for dinner sometime, particularly if there's music playing.  They were friendly, and the place was cute.Just wanted to offer a different/honest perspective of what didn't strike me as a 5-star yelp'd restaurant.",2.0
"I went here twice. The first time it was probably a 4 star experience and yesterday it was a 2 star experience. Hence, the 3 stars. Atmosphere - 4The place is small and cozy. They have live music which i guess can be a hit or miss. Last time i was here it was kind of late so the music wasn't there all the time. This time around it was way too loud and the singer was terrible. They have an outside area in the back, which is great especially when the music is not that good.Service - 1Service was pretty bad on our last visit. I don't know how common this is, but I see another review on the same date that we went there so it might have been a one time thing (It was Labor Day). They had only one server. Our entrees came before our appitizers, which came before our drinks. We waited forever and then everything was dumped on the table with no regard for space. The service was pretty disappointing and I hope it was a one time thing.Food - 2.5First time i think the food was better. This time around everyone around the table thought the food was just ok. Tacos are bland, pate is tasty, but nothing special. Steak was too hard. Price/Value - 3.5The prices are still reasonable, but their appetizers cost almost as much as their entrees so this is not a place to go to try many different things.

"Wow! What a great night. Greeted by our perky server and warm chips and salsa, we were immediately fond of the place. We chose the beets appetizer and the chicken tacos and the fish special which were all delicious. Not the biggest portions, but super fresh ingredients and flavor. Mixed drinks were definitely potentent and enjoyable. I didn't really like the organic chardonay I had ordered, but easily switched it for another glass which was much better. The best part by far, however, was the great atmosphere--loved the jazz music and the super friendly owner who came over and introduced himself. Also loved our waitress and some of the waitstaff who came over an talked to us for a good while. We had so much fun that we were actually there for 4 hours(?!)--I kid you not. A great place to enjoy a well prepared meal in a fantastic environment. Looking forward to coming back sometime soon.",5.0

I brought a date there and it took 25 minutes to get our first round, and 30 minutes to get our second round. They couldn't have been less prepared. But the real kicker is that there were two of us at a 4 seat table, and as we were finishing our second drink the waitress asked us if we could move to the bar, which had no open seats, so they could seat 4 people at our table. Unbelievable. Can you imagine an irish bar having one bartender on St. Paddy's day and having it take 25-30 minutes to get every beer, cause thats basically what happened here.",1.0
"Santos Anne is fantastic. Thanks to its combination of a large menu (on which everything seems to be excellent), the welcoming servers, daily live music and the beautiful interior, it's becoming a favorite neighborhood spot.So far, we've had:- kale caesar with seafood- beet carpaccio- pâté- guac (the spicy isn't very spicy)- sausage, duck, veggie and brie tacos (I get those without the bacon)- pork brochette- special casoulette- churros- petit pot chocolaté creamSo, um, yes, we go there a lot. All the drinks so far have been dangerously good, as well. I recommend the lavender-habanero margarita, the Rosé d'Anjou and the El Puebla. And if you're lucky, you get a shot of fig tequila on the house at the end of your meal.With everything reasonably priced, Santos Anne is a treat you can indulge in often.",5.0
"Minus one star for cash only. We would have stayed longer and spent more if we weren't limited to this restriction. With that being said, this place is great. It has an intimate/eclectic setting that made me feel like I was out of the country. I had the habanero and lavender margarita w/the salmon burger (w/o bacon.) the fiancé the veggie tacos and the ""Mexican boiler maker"" aka shot of tequila and a tecate. Everything from the house made chips and salsa to the last bite was worth going back for more. Huge plus, our waitress was super sweet and helpful with ordering.  Stop by the ATM and check this place out!",4.0
"After reading all of the reviews here, I feel like it might have been an off day, or perhaps brunch is not their high point.  Normally I would have been more skeptical of French/Mexican fusion, but when I read they were related to Pates Et Traditions (one of my favorite places) I was excited to give it a go.Went here late on a Saturday for brunch.  They did a really nice job decorating the place and giving it a distinctively different feel than Elote/Santa Fe/Hope & Union Cafe.  The staff was very friendly too.  It was just the food that didn't quite do it for either of us.  My girlfriend had a pork sandwich and I had the Mexican Tartare.  The pork sandwich had what could only be described as a Velveeta-y cheese substance melted all over it.  The pork itself was ok, but the ""cheese"" really took away from the experience.  The tartare basically just had some cilantro and onions ground with the meat and didn't really taste all that appealing.  And paying $6.50 for a french press of Brooklyn Roasters coffee (that only amounted to a little over 2.5 cups) was also not a highlight.The whole fusion concept just seemed a little uninspired.  The basic formula seemed to be:[CHOOSE A WELL KNOWN MEXICAN OR FRENCH DISH] + [A FEW INGREDIENTS FROM MEXICAN/FRENCH cuisine] = MENU ITEM It was probably one of the least impressive meals I've had for a while in NY.  In fairness, everyone can have an off day so I might be down to come back for dinner sometime, particularly if there's music playing.  They were friendly, and the place was cute.Just wanted to offer a different/honest perspective of what didn't strike me as a 5-star yelp'd restaurant.",2.0
"I went here twice. The first time it was probably a 4 star experience and yesterday it was a 2 star experience. Hence, the 3 stars. Atmosphere - 4The place is small and cozy. They have live music which i guess can be a hit or miss. Last time i was here it was kind of late so the music wasn't there all the time. This time around it was way too loud and the singer was terrible. They have an outside area in the back, which is great especially when the music is not that good.Service - 1Service was pretty bad on our last visit. I don't know how common this is, but I see another review on the same date that we went there so it might have been a one time thing (It was Labor Day). They had only one server. Our entrees came before our appitizers, which came before our drinks. We waited forever and then everything was dumped on the table with no regard for space. The service was pretty disappointing and I hope it was a one time thing.Food - 2.5First time i think the food was better. This time around everyone around the table thought the food was just ok. Tacos are bland, pate is tasty, but nothing special. Steak was too hard. Price/Value - 3.5The prices are still reasonable, but their appetizers cost almost as much as their entrees so this is not a place to go to try many different things. I don't think I'll be returning any time soon.",3.0
"We had an exceptional evening here last week.  Kind of an impromptu date-night out, we happened to arrive before the late set of music.  Little did we know we were in for a real Twangy, Old Timey Treat!!   The enchanting vocal stylings of Hillary Hourke and her 3 piece (plus guest Cajon Player, that may have been the owner of the spot), added a great deal to the Intimate and Good Vibes.  The food and service was excellent.  Torta Croutons on the salad were particularly delicious.  My Steak Croquette was tender and well seasoned.  Fresh-made restaurant chips and complimentary smoked chipotle, salsa which we nibbled as we enjoyed the tunes hit the spot and matched the interesting beer selection, I had the Hoppy Seasonal Ale.   We're definitely coming back to this delicious French-Mexican Fusion spot.  So Much Alma So much Corazon!",5.0
"Wow! What a great night. Greeted by our perky server and warm chips and salsa, we were immediately fond of the place. We chose the beets appetizer and the chicken tacos and the fish special which were all delicious. Not the biggest portions, but super fresh ingredients and flavor. Mixed drinks were definitely potentent and enjoyable. I didn't really like the organic chardonay I had ordered, but easily switched it for another glass which was much better. The best part by far, however, was the great atmosphere--loved the jazz music and the super friendly owner who came over and introduced himself. Also loved our waitress and some of the waitstaff who came over an talked to us for a good while. We had so much fun that we were actually there for 4 hours(?!)--I kid you not. A great place to enjoy a well prepared meal in a fantastic environment. Looking forward to coming back sometime soon.",5.0
"Great restaurant, will come again!I've been here two times now and it's a really delightful place. Really cozy interior, and they have a backyard too.The food was amazing along with the drinks. I got a mojito and it seriously was one of the best mojitos I ever had (and I've been to Puerto Rico!). Live music was playing when I was here one time, not sure how often they have it, but it was great.I'll be back for that backyard once the weather is less shitty!",5.0
"The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic evening and small groups. Lovely decor and a diverse menu (French/ Mexican fusion is on point). The service was great, no complaints here. Enjoyed the ""Lolo Cassolette"" and the ""Spicy Escargot"". Both were cooked well and were full of flavor. NOT BLAND...MUST TRY! The highlight of Santos Anne was definitely the live music. Spanish guitar and jazz works very well with smooth vocal talent. An excellent place to relax and schmooze.",4.0
"Great food and wonderful service. My buddy is a pescatarian and his fish came out with sausage on it. They replaced his meal with an all fish version. Plus the food is amazing. Highly recommended!

Drinks are great too but you never know which one is going to come in a girly or manly glass.Check it out!",5.0

"I'm surprised that this place has favorable reviews. The service is friendly and fast, sure, but the food and drinks are pretty abysmal. My husband and I ordered margaritas, as one usually does at a Mexican restaurant, and they were horrible. Just sickly sweet and not enough liquor; they tasted like syrup, came in wine glasses, and with a thick straw. Weird. My husband ordered the steak brochettes medium-rare, and they can out totally raw, like, impossible to cut through with a steak knife raw. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were soggy and bland; no salt, no seasoning, just wet chicken in a wet taco. I'd avoid this place at all costs.",1.0

Can't get over the Mushroom Risotto Flambee! I love the fact that the plate it's on fire when they bring it out. I have been there twice and I have no complains about the service.

"My boyfriend and I have dubbed this place our favorite brunch spot (although dinner is great too)-- we've been about 4 times. What originally drew us in was the eclectic decor and great vibe....and then we tasted the food. Seriously delicious. I love the unique, mixtures of french/ mexican cuisine that leave you full and happy--and the prices are unbeatable.

"DO. NOT. EAT. HERE.This is my second time to this establishment. The first time I went. when it has first opened months ago, I ended up leaving after waiting 45 minutes for a drink.

So tonight, months later, we go again. Service at first is much better! But then, sadly, it went down hill. The mussels were uneatable. The white wine broth was tasteless and the mussels-- so so sad but true-- were DEFINITELY not fresh and possibly frozen. The guacamole was only diced avocado. Maybe some salt and pepper with whole leaves of cilantro, baby (maybe canned) shrimp and lemon (not lime).They didn't bring us silverware and as soon as food was put in front of us we were ignored. Paying them was almost impossible (and I have no problem with cash only) and the bartender didn't know how to make any of the drinks on the menuI want to say that I love eating out and I love all sorts of service and food.

"I came here last night with a party of six around 10:30, hoping to be able to get a table at this restaurant I had read so many good things about. When I peered inside it was packed, and I was worried they wouldn't be able to seat us. But seat us they did in 10 minutes, as they said. They even came back after five to tell us our table would be ready in another five minutes. While a bit cramped (where isn't?), the ambience was warm and welcoming. There was good live music playing, and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. Our waiter was attentive and professional, as was another man who I presumed to be the owner, who was always checking up on everything.The cocktails were pretty good. I'm afraid I was spoiled by the margaritas at Barrio Chino (best ever) and artisanal cocktail bars in Manhattan during our last month there, but these still were great, and not $15! I had the Sweetback, which was very interesting, and my boyfriend had the lavender-jalapeno margarita which was very good.But oh, THE FOOD! We started out with the guacamole, which, to compare to Barrio Chino again (my 5-star standard for mexican) was just as good, if not better! Huge chunks of tomato and avocado, so good. For my entree I got the shrimp risotto, which was more delicate than I had expected, with subtle hints of truffle oil and parmesan. In a word: delicious. I also tried the mushroom risotto, which came out on a flaming plate. While that one was also good heed the menu when it says ""TRUFFLE OIL."" There is a lot of it in there. And if you love it, you will love that dish. For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake, which was a glorious ending to our meal. So, so great.So all in all this place is awesome.

I got the mussels as my main dish and they were way too mussel-y. The sauce was really watery and didn't really do much flavorwise. Might have been a mistake to order mussels since I had just gone to Flex Mussels 2 days before and was blown away, but regardless...mediocre. My friend got the salmon burger and it was also just ok.

"Went to this place on a whim last night for the first time. We will totally be back. It was casual, relaxed, romantic yet fun. We ate dinner at the bar and were transported to another world. ...Intimate space, live jazz, and a great vibe. Inventive cocktails -- I had the Desert Rose which had gin, agave and rosewater and it was delicious! The owner was greeting people at the door (a must for a new restaurant, I think) and the bartender gave us free tequila shots.The food was awesome too. Not your standard French fare. They do a nice job of infusing homestyle Mexican with casual French. The escargot had a ton of garlic and butter and also was a bit spicy. A pork bouchette was severed with prune, pear but also a dipping sauce with chipotle. And the soft tacos were divine. Very reasonably priced for what you get. A neighborhood gem for sure.",4.0
"I have been here a few times now, it keeps getting better and better every time I go. The gourmet fusion French/Mexican food is great ! The duck tacos and the beef brochette are two of my favorites, but by no means the only good things on the menu. Everything is good! They octopus appetizer is recommended if you like a nice vinegar sauce, and the escargots is recommended if you really want something traditional French. They have live music throughout the week and a huge outdoor garden with a Petanque/Batchiball court. This place will be a lot of fun this summer. I can't say enough about the food, but the real reason to come back is the service. Everybody that works here is very nice and makes you feel like a rock star. They don't try to rush you out either, so eat, drink, enjoy the music, and enjoy this great place. It is my understanding that this place opened up recently, I consider it a real lucky find. It's close the G train, so easy to get here from pretty much anywhere.",5.0

"I was pretty excited when i was told someone opened up where Elote' used to be. We went last night for dinner and sat in the back patio.  We ordered a large swath of the menu, excited for what seemed to be a very worded interesting menu. We had the spicy guacamole.  It was not spicy. It was not medium or mild.  It was pretty bland.  truly.  We ordered a kale caesar salad with calamari and squid.  I'm not sure why i thought it would be good but I'm a sucker for squid.  pun.  It was not good. at all. Kale and romaine lettuce with gigantic hunks of squid. It was without exaggerating one of the strangest things I've tasted in many years. My lady tried both the pork and duck taco as her main course. Both were misses.  I had a burger. For $14 burger, if you ask how i would like it cooked, please know medium rare from medium well.  It was without a doubt one of the worst meals start to finish I've had in nyc for $85. As far as the physical space, they did a beautiful job inside renovating.  It's quite nice.  The backyard had a few concerns. namely the ghetto wiring job from the building to the what looks to be a in the works bocce court.  Exposed wires? jesus.  Also the grease fan has a plywood cover with grease leaking down the side of the building. That's nice.  The drinks were nice and that is why it's two stars and not one.  I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to food, but good lord, we wont be back.",2.0

This place is incredible.  I've held off on doing a review on it because I wanted it all to my self.  There has been a couple of nights when I went to try and have dinner and the place has been packed and no seats available outside or inside.  But after the last few times I think I owe it to this great establishment to share my experience about Santos Anne.  Santos Anne is owned by an incredible nice French man.  He is almost always there.  Either socializing with the customers or performing with an amazing band that plays easy listening / foreign music.  On monday nights there is free tarrot card reading.  It is a lot of fun.  The drinks are delicious.  The food is the best part about this place.  It is a little pricey but the atmosphere of the restaurant is worth the price.  The manager also a French man is so friendly and just a super nice guy.  The staff is funny and polite... Very european feel about the whole place... Although the staff is not always attentive because they are a bit laid back and the place is always packed... it is not something that will ruin your night.  Like I said.  The French Mexican food is delicious!  Amazing guacamole...  The tacos are on the small side but everything that isn't over sized in America seems small.  The portions are filling!  The home made salsa is delicious.  The salmon burger and their salads are like no other.  This is a cash only establishment.  They do have an atm in the back.  Oh.... the court yard!  How can I forget.....  The court yard is absolutely beautiful.  It is a great place to get brunch on a nice sunny day.  I come here when ever I want to feel like I'm some where in Europe.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.,5.0
"Wow~ I went here last week with a friend to have some cocktails and chips and guacamole and think we have found our new favorite place! We were left deeply saddened by the loss of Elote and knew whatever took its place had to be excellent ....and it is!  We sat at the bar ,started with a lavendar infused spicy margarita and I had a mojito - these cocktails are beyond delicious, I have had many a mojito at places all over Nyc and i am going to go ahead and say the sweet and talented bartendar at Santos made the best mojito I have ever had. This place is so cozy the lighting and decor and as a bonus there was a live Jazz trio playing that evening and they were excellent. The guac was delicious and the owner and manager introduced themselves and made us feel more than welcome. We said we would spread the word and bring more people and tonight we are headed back with a group for a birthday celebration and look forward to trying some new dishes, more mojitos and live music as well!",5.0
"Great food, great atmosphere, great service...Santos Anne has all the makings of an awesome eatery. Not to mention a unique menu that fuses seemingly unlikely flavors (to those of us non-Parisians) and prices that won't break a Brooklynite's budget. I recommend this place for an intimate date by candle light in the cozy dining area, or a fun brunch with friends in the backyard at a picnic table. Oh, and there's always live music. But I don't mean distracting, loud bands that throw off dinner. They choose tasteful, talented musicians who complete the Santos aura. The staff is super friendly (Waverly is my favorite server--she's quick, attentive, AND super nice) and the food is freaking awesome.",5.0
"Went to this place on a whim last night for the first time. We will totally be back. It was casual, relaxed, romantic yet fun. We ate dinner at the bar and were transported to another world. ...Intimate space, live jazz, and a great vibe. Inventive cocktails -- I had the Desert Rose which had gin, agave and rosewater and it was delicious! The owner was greeting people at the door (a must for a new restaurant, I think) and the bartender gave us free tequila shots.The food was awesome too. Not your standard French fare. They do a nice job of infusing homestyle Mexican with casual French. The escargot had a ton of garlic and butter and also was a bit spicy. A pork bouchette was severed with prune, pear but also a dipping sauce with chipotle. And the soft tacos were divine. Very reasonably priced for what you get. A neighborhood gem for sure.",4.0
"I have been here a few times now, it keeps getting better and better every time I go. The gourmet fusion French/Mexican food is great ! The duck tacos and the beef brochette are two of my favorites, but by no means the only good things on the menu. Everything is good! They octopus appetizer is recommended if you like a nice vinegar sauce, and the escargots is recommended if you really want something traditional French. They have live music throughout the week and a huge outdoor garden with a Petanque/Batchiball court. This place will be a lot of fun this summer. I can't say enough about the food, but the real reason to come back is the service. Everybody that works here is very nice and makes you feel like a rock star. They don't try to rush you out either, so eat, drink, enjoy the music, and enjoy this great place. It is my understanding that this place opened up recently, I consider it a real lucky find. It's close the G train, so easy to get here from pretty much anywhere.",5.0

"The service at this restaurant is excellent. Every staff member were very attentive and friendly. The food was ok. Mostly traditional French  - Escargot and Mexican - tacos dishes. Interestingly, the bed of salad underneath was very tasty. The outdoor area seems like a nice place to sit and have dinner with friends.",4.0
"I was pretty excited when i was told someone opened up where Elote' used to be. We went last night for dinner and sat in the back patio.  We ordered a large swath of the menu, excited for what seemed to be a very worded interesting menu. We had the spicy guacamole.  It was not spicy. It was not medium or mild.  It was pretty bland.  truly.  We ordered a kale caesar salad with calamari and squid.  I'm not sure why i thought it would be good but I'm a sucker for squid.  pun.  It was not good. at all. Kale and romaine lettuce with gigantic hunks of squid. It was without exaggerating one of the strangest things I've tasted in many years. My lady tried both the pork and duck taco as her main course. Both were misses.  I had a burger. For $14 burger, if you ask how i would like it cooked, please know medium rare from medium well.  It was without a doubt one of the worst meals start to finish I've had in nyc for $85. As far as the physical space, they did a beautiful job inside renovating.  It's quite nice.  The backyard had a few concerns. namely the ghetto wiring job from the building to the what looks to be a in the works bocce court.  Exposed wires? jesus.  Also the grease fan has a plywood cover with grease leaking down the side of the building. That's nice.  The drinks were nice and that is why it's two stars and not one.  I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to food, but good lord, we wont be back.",2.0
"The food was delicious- I'm really happy we found this place! The prices are very reasonable, too, which is hard to find in this area.  The place itself is inviting and cozy, but it got quite warm... Overall, the extremely attentive service, tasty food, and and good prices make this a place that I will definitely return to and recommend to friends.  Oh, and did I mention the live music was great!",4.0

"went to santos anne last night and had a great experience! the atmosphere was great, awesome live music. the tables were kind of close together, but my friend and i enjoyed listening to the OK Cupid first date going on next to us. complimentary chips and salsa made me feel like i was back in texas! the menu was reasonably priced and the drinks were great. the house cocktail, the santos anne, was great, as was the lavender habanero margarita. the guacamole was good, but not spicy (you can chose mild or spicy) i had the mushroom risotto, which was amazing! and my friend had some tacos, which i didnt try because they had meat in them. we split the creme brulee and double chocolate thing, which were both good. i would definitely go back to santos anne and possibly check out their brunch. the patio looked nice. its kind of weird how this place is cash only though.",4.0
"There is a reason this place is consistently rated 5 stars. My wife and I visited on a busy Saturday night and the manager had informed us if our party of 4 was late by 15 minutes he would have to give our table away. Although the two of us made it on time, our friends were stuck waiting for the the ever unreliable L train. While we had to give our first seating away, a fantastic assortment of tasty (and unknowingly potent) drinks served by their friendly bartender, kept us happy, entertained and delightfully inebriated. Sit at the bar long enough and she'll also pour shot-after-shot of their own special blend on the house. All the meanwhile, the manager kept checking in trying to get us a new table once our friends had finally arrived. Finally sitting down, we were treated to one of the best meals we had in a long time. The guac' was unbelievably fresh, full of chunky avocados and tomatoes; the fried oysters unreal, but the real treat for all pig-lovers is the Pork Brochette. It was tender, tasty, and seasoned to perfection. Live music was also great! We will be back again and again for sure.",5.0
