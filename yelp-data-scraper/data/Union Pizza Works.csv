"I've been there already 3 times, and I was amazed every time The staff is sooo nice Their pizzas are just delicious we had the artichoke special, with the risotto and the polenta.The 4 of us loved everything :))))Don't hesitate to taste the tiramisu also ... So goodThank you so much guys for sharing your Italian gastronomy",5.0
"Perhaps I've just crossed that age gap in which I think Bushwick is hip, cool, and worth the trip on the L Train for. (And, honestly, pre-Age 31, I was pretty neutral regarding the ""charms"" of the neighborhood, anyways...) However, continuously changing artwork at the Bushwich Collective and Union Pizza Works are the two things that'll get me to take the L to Jefferson.After a late afternoon street art stroll, the beau and I decided pizza was in order, despite the fact that we both had pizza for lunch. (Hey, when you've got a craving...) I've passed UPW on a previous trip to the collective, and I made a mental note to return. (Or, more realistically, I put a bookmark on Yelp. Ha!) I was drawn to the warm and comforting smell of a wood stove fire wafting from the entrance. Once we got inside, the smell was even more intense, and the photos perched upon fellow diners' tables was making my mouth water.Once we were seated, we perused through the relatively small yet comprehensive menu. We opted for a starter of Burrata con Prosciutto and decided to split a Pizza con Cippole. First things first: That was some of the best damn burrata I've EVER had. EVER. Ever. Ever. EVER. Did I mention ever? It was the epitome of perfect burrata. The inside straight up tasted like cream. It was so milky. I regret not getting two! The pizza was also wonderful, though the Gorgonzola became a little too rich for my taste buds as I had to Man vs. Food* the final bites of my last slice! Kudos to UPW for nailing the art of making a crisp crust; so many thin-crusted pizzas are so moist, but this one stayed dry. Wonderful! Between a pizza, appetizer, and two cans of Crispin, any Date Night is a success when the food is excellent and the total bill is less than $40. ;-) Haha! UPW is definitely a gem! * - I use that as a verb. No shame.",4.0
"I'd like to call myself a pizza connoisseur, but a more accurate designation is 'pizza enthusiast'. Perhaps as my New York pizza experience grows and my palate becomes more discerning, I'll come to regard myself as the former. For now, I'm just a simple man with a love for a good, fresh pie.It had been a good day. I'd knocked out all the items on my list--I'm a big list guy--including making that dreaded trip to the laundromat. I was feeling pretty accomplished, and figured I'd treat myself. After my cathartic experience at Roberta's a few weeks back, I strongly considered Round 2, but when I thought of my deep-rooted goal of trying to become a well-rounded pizza consumer, I knew I needed to diversify. Upon seeing some-thirty mentions of Roberta's in reviews for Union Pizza Works--including one claiming it was ""thousands of times better""--my task, and a subsequent comparison review, seemed manifest.Keep in mind this is a cash-only establishment, but there's an ATM right out front. I owed my sweet woman some coin, so I offered to pick up the tab this night. I arrived minutes before my lover was due to meet me and, upon sitting down and realizing my Visa debit would not be accepted (I couldn't have gleaned this from the very specific 'No credit cards' designation on Yelp?), headed out to the ATM. Three ""insert and remove quickly""s later, and I still couldn't pull a dime out. A call to Wells Fargo revealed they'd shut my card down due to questionable online purchases (don't judge me), and they'd sent the replacement to my old stead in Florida. Fuck. I hadn't ordered anything yet, but now I had the unfortunate task of informing my lady I'd need an increase on my house tab.After a few playful quips that I was ""twenty fucking six"" and she was ""getting pretty sick of me not being able to manage money"", and a commitment to ""getting, like, every dinner next month,"" it was time to devote my full attention to the menu. I first noted all of the authentic Italian-named pies. In fact, I believe many of the employees here could, perhaps, be Italian gentlemen as well..? Perhaps a bit presumptuous of me, and I do not mean to offend. Regardless, this felt like an authentic experience, in terms of menu nomenclature and, *potentially*, employee nationality.A margherita for her--so predictable, LOL!--and a change-up from the main menu for me: 'Pizza Feel The Bern', listed on the Specials card. I'm trying to remember everything on this--the pie was loaded: Italian sausage, red onion, olive oil, some thicker, richer cheese--some high-grade mozzarella, plus something akin to bleu, or gorgonzola?--and oregano. I didn't get the backstory on the name--did the man himself phone in the recipe for his ideal pie? Is this common knowledge in his inner circles? Regardless, it fit.It was loaded, and quite filling. I'd hardly eaten that day, and needed every bit of it, but normally I would have taken a slice or two of a pie this hefty back to the abode. Crust-wise, the consistency was almost identical to that of Roberta's, but with one crucial difference: oven temperature and bake time. I believe Union Pizza Works' oven either burns a little hotter than Roberta's, or they cook their pies a little longer. I'm willing to bet it's the former, because by and large, the crust was still light, soft and airy; however--and this isn't necessarily a bad thing--there was slightly more char on their crust than Roberta's, more of what I associate with a wood-fired pie. Take that for what you will. I like a little less char, though this certainly wasn't off-putting.Thanks to a mid-day dose of amphetamine salts, my sweet woman was picking at her margherita like a bird, so I took the opportunity to swipe a slice while it was still hot. Excellence through its simplicity. A wonderful pie. Opposite end of the spectrum from my meat-laden variant, but top marks in the style.A wonderful meal, and the second-best pizza I've had both in Bushwick and in New York overall. I will say, this place is slightly more economical than Roberta's, though negligibly so. Not like I was paying for it, so no worries as far as I was concerned. I'll undoubtedly be back to Union Pizza Works, but I think it may be after I've run the gamut on the menu at Roberta's.",4.0
"Oh so good. I am so freaking glad this place exists. It seems so authentic and whats better is the vibe it gives off. It is set up very nicely and appears to be able to accommodate potentially large groups. The food is splendid. Their pasta, pizza and apps were really good. We ordered a $45 bottle of red wine (apparently the fullest one they have available), burrata and meatballs for starters. My guest and I shared their smoked salmon pasta special and a pizza pie (sorry I forgot the name and ended our meal with two desserts: the mousse and tiramisu. YUM YUM. I cant wait to come back. LITERALLY cant wait.",5.0
"This place is adorable! A really cute place to come on a first date or with a single group of ladies (the staff is attentive and very attractive) and next door is a really happening bar.

"CASH ONLY!!! Wish they told us, or had a sign somewhere, or mentioned it on the menu.  But, this is not about that, this is about their food and service. Both were great.  They serve 'real' Neapolitan pizza without all the buzz or selectiveness around it - just a good pizza place.  They also serve a few salads, brunch on the weekend.  For drinks - FULL bar + white Sangria, which was super refreshing on a hot summer afternoon.  Overall, beautiful place with great food and drinks - just make sure you have cash.",5.0
"Love this place! Today was my first day but I can already tell it won't be my last. To me the bread of the pizza is equally important as the toppings or sauce, and let me tell you the bread tastes amazing. When you finish a pizza you won't ever leave the crust uneaten.  The bread is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My family and I finished to baskets of bread and they gave us more. The pizza, however, is a little bit soggy because of the fresh sauce and mozzarella. Yet, this does not effect the taste of the pizza because the chewy bread is drenched in the delicious sauce and seasoning. I have also tried the mussels and the quality of the mussels is the best and fresh. The lasagna I good but I wouldn't come looking for this restaurant just for the lasagna. The best is the pizza and the second best are the mussels. I haven't yet had the pleasure of trying the chocolate mousse yet but I must say based on the main dishes it won't disappoint.-the place is cash only -quite pricy",5.0
I think UPW is better than Roberta's. Definitely my top 3 favorite places in the neighborhood. The pizza is light and fluffy. The lasagna is delicious. And they have the smoothest panna cotta! It is cash only but they conveniently have an ATM at their entrance. Great for brunch or dinner!,5.0
"Awesome pizza, awesome staff, awesome location.Loosely traditional Italian style pizza. Lots of sausages, veggies, and burrata! If you are looking for an alternative to Roberta's, this is it. Prices are reasonable and so are the wait times. Definitely worth your dollars in this neighborhood.Highlights of the evening were the artichoke and spicy salami pizza, and the porcheta pizza. Everything is super light, and the house red sauce is very bright. The wood charcoal oven really chars the pizzas and gives them the ever so popular black marks and soot.",4.0
"Had a really good time here. The whole place is just very cool, so reminiscent of the restaurants in Varenna, Italy. We actually mentioned this to our waiter who happened to be from Lake Como in Italy! He recommended great dishes and informed us that all of their meals are made in-house.Our first time here:Two of us shared the margherita pizza and the bresaola salad off the special menu. Both very good, but I especially enjoyed the pizza. It was all in the crust and the sauce - so good. The tiramisu was the bomb.Second time here:Focaccia pizza was more like a sandwich pizza. Very tasty but it could've used actual tomato sauce. We asked for marinara as a dipping sauce and that made it 10 times better. We also had the meatballs and they were soooooooooo good. Super tender and great flavor. There were even small pieces of garlic in them, yum. For dessert, we had the chocolate salami - FYI this has no meat. It's a crispy yet soft chocolate cookie covered in blueberry sauce cleverly made to look like a salami slice.Cocktails:Paper planes - pretty small but packed a mean punch and is the perfect summer drink. Milan julep - solid strong cocktail.Real deal brick oven, great outdoor space and awesome industrial construction.",5.0

"Through hear-say, I heard about UPW's wood oven pizza and stopped by one evening to pick up a margherita pie with the idea of taking it home. Well, by the time I got to the car, I was tempted to sample a slice and ended up eating the entire pie in one sitting. Impatiently greedy? Yes. But was it good? YES. I returned for brunch the following Sunday as I wanted to sit and experience the outdoor seating. My party chose to sit outdoors but under the covered roof. The only negative, if the sun is HOT you're going to feel it blazing down under the clear plastic covering. We ordered two salads--the apple (eye-appeal but taste okay) and the fresh mozarrella and tomato drizzled with fresh basil oil (very good) along with three pies--chorizo (1) and spicy sausage (2) the latter being the group's favorite and two glasses of wine--sauvignon blanc and a rose. The pizza options were good especially when you add their spicy olive oil atop. I'll likely return for an evening meal.",4.0

We also ordered the Cipolle, their version of a cheese pizza, but they ruined it by putting an insane amount of white onion, made the pizza bitter and overpowered the cheese (even the gorgonzola!).Service left a lot to be desired, they just seemed to be interested in turning tables and not very friendly. Music was very loud and the waiter had a hard time hearing me but made no effort to lean in or speak up... really strange service in general. Also it is cash only which sucks...

"If you don't mind waiting at the bar for 45 minutes after you place your order only to be told your pizza hasn't been put in the oven...then I highly recommend. I should also note that I was the only person at the bar and the place wasn't busy. . Other than the unhinged service it's got a pretty nice vibe. Pizza to go never taste good IMO - it was cold, unsliced - yes unsliced, clear evidence of non New Yorker's making pizza - and under cooked. Perhaps the bartender was pushing the oven cook to rush my order but still no excuse for unsliced undercooked pizza. Was told after sitting 50 minutes that it was cash only, at that point after I expressed my distress did they buy my glass of Chianti. While waiting in the cold on a shady street alone at an atm, did I realize how ridiculous this place is - also confirmed by hearing another couple saying they were walking out due to bad service, they said they bolted! Also one of the tall bearded waiters, of which there happens to be  many, pushed past me and told me to ""watch out""Do we not know about service and etiquette, Roberta's certainly does. 40 bucks for take out and bad attitude - FAIL. Entitlement and attitude needs to cease in north Brooklyn restaurants it makes for an unpleasant dining experience- we pay to live here and have dedicated good service like you would have in Manhattan or brownstone Brooklyn.

"I really enjoyed this cute little pizza place. Went with a small group of friends. It was a great environment for just having some good pizza and hanging out  with a couple friends.

In a group of three we got two pizzas an a side pasta dish and it worked out great. There were not many options of different kinds of pizzas, but honestly they all look so yummy and there's definitely something for everyone.

"If you don't mind waiting at the bar for 45 minutes after you place your order only to be told your pizza hasn't been put in the oven...then I highly recommend. I should also note that I was the only person at the bar and the place wasn't busy. . Other than the unhinged service it's got a pretty nice vibe. Pizza to go never taste good IMO - it was cold, unsliced - yes unsliced, clear evidence of non New Yorker's making pizza - and under cooked. Perhaps the bartender was pushing the oven cook to rush my order but still no excuse for unsliced undercooked pizza. Was told after sitting 50 minutes that it was cash only, at that point after I expressed my distress did they buy my glass of Chianti. While waiting in the cold on a shady street alone at an atm, did I realize how ridiculous this place is - also confirmed by hearing another couple saying they were walking out due to bad service, they said they bolted! Also one of the tall bearded waiters, of which there happens to be  many, pushed past me and told me to ""watch out""Do we not know about service and etiquette, Roberta's certainly does. 40 bucks for take out and bad attitude - FAIL. Entitlement and attitude needs to cease in north Brooklyn restaurants it makes for an unpleasant dining experience- we pay to live here and have dedicated good service like you would have in Manhattan or brownstone Brooklyn. I don't need attitude from some 22 year old from Middletown CT",1.0

The staff was attentive upon arrival with the how is everything when you make eye contact as they past to receive another patron entering. It took almost 10 minutes to wrap my leftovers and get my check. Mind you there were only five table occupied by the time I finished I was the third table sat. I can not imagine if they were busy.Their business strategy does not appear to have growth in it. The hours are limited to the evening and weekend. No lunch during the week. There are local businesses and a hospital close by that have no idea they are there. I don't think they are even attempting to have a to-go business.

Met up on a rainy evening to indulge on UPW's delicious offerings. We got the Salsiccia pizza with mushrooms, the burrata and tiramisu. Everything was delicious. The pizza was perfectly cooked.

The tiramisu came in a pretty small portion, but was rich and worth it.Can't wait to dine at UPW again.",4.0
I had been eyeing this spot for weeks and am so glad I finally went in! We were there during off hours so it was dead quiet.

"The word ""works"" conjures up massive industrial structures from the early 20th century, the kind you'd see in black and white news reels where workers are assembling steamboats, receiving raw material via train and mass producing widgets. Think Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" or for the computer gaming enthusiast, the ironworks city improvement in Civilization. Union Pizza Works resides in what is surely a former warehouse or factory in an area rich in 20th century manufacturing. Travel back in time 100 years and Williamsburg, Bushwick and other now desirable neighborhoods were polluted, overcrowded and humming with industry. Fortunately, Union Pizza works hums with the production of pizza perfection and nothing noisier.On a cold Sunday we were early and the metal fence was just being slid aside to indicate that the UPW was open for business. Yes, a sliding metal fence, one of the many industrial touches, including the heavy door lead into a dimly candlelit interior that is a total makeover and repurposing of the original structure.It's like the Highline of pizza joints!The 1950's bebop jazz soundtrack, combined with the free and  casual speaking of the beautiful Italian language, gave the place the feel of an underground pizza speakeasy, where Sophia Loren would suddenly show up to avoid the hordes of paparazzi while filming a new Fellini flick. I recommend that every diner order their own whole pizza, especially if you aren't ordering a salad or appetizer. There's nothing intimidating about the size either as I was able to complete the margherita with minimal effort. The balance of cheese to sauce was just right, hitting a golden ratio while resting atop a malleable crust that was easy to fold and easier to eat. Different than the Angelo's, Patsy's and Grimaldi's, the pizza here is more intimate and personal, based on the serving size but also the execution. The crumbled sausage sprinkled on my wife's pizza had a chance to breathe without being suffocated with layer upon layer of mozzarella that sometimes runs the risk of becoming far too thick and impenetrable. Here each ingredient had a fighting chance to be noticed and evaluated on its own merits as opposed to being assimilated into the mozzarella collective.Two pizzas and a pellegrino came out to $32. Service was friendly, with multiple staff members stopping by to ask how we were. There are a few tables for two mixed in with the larger tables for groups and I suspect that in the warmer months outside seating will be an option too.May the pizza eating proletariat of the world unite at Union Pizza Works.",4.0

"I haven't written a review for a long time... I was trying to hold off to write one until I found a place that was worthy to write about because I mean -  I am the modern day J.K Rowlings and people just are dying to see what I'm writing about right? Incorrect.What is in fact 100% correct, is how amazing Union Pizza Works is. I've recently moved back to Bushwick  and came back to a plethora of brand new bars, restaurants, shopping, etc. Being that Roberta's is the only pizza place around I was extremely excited to check out UPW. So - one snowy Saturday night the Mister and I decided on one thing.. PIZZA DATE NIGHT needs to happen. Well, pizza date night happens at least two times a week and we basically stuff an entire pizza pie each into our systems and drink too much wine... Which is tradition now, and I don't break tradition.... We decided to give UPW a try, and upon arrival we both fell in love. The decor is simple yet quirky, and the wood burning oven in the back really warmed up the place. We decided to sit at the bar, and was instantly greeted by a charming man, Leonardo! Leonardo is one of the owners of this gem, he's extremely funny and welcoming which made the experience even better.UPW, has an simple menu - a few pizzas for the vegetarians (us), a few pizzas for the meat eaters..a couple of appetizers, and a couple of desserts. Also, rotating specials every night. We went for the fennel to start -  it was baked with a bechamel sauce or to be politically correct besciamella! It was wood fired in the oven in the back and came out piping hot and topped off with even more cheese! Amazing flavors, interesting texture, and just over all a winner in our book. Be sure to get some bread to sop up the excess besciamella. I went for the margherita. Which features house made mozzarella  *record scratch* ...have you had fresh house made mozzarella? It was truly something special, almost comparable to that feeling you get when you've just found a 100 dollar bill on the floor. The mozzarella paired with the amazingly robust flavors of the marinara on that perfectly cooked pizza dough was enough for me to jump up and do a whole rendition of The Pointer Sisters- I'M SO EXCITED for everyone at the restaurant. It was that good.. Just that good.J went for the Funghi, equally amazing. I'm not a huge mushroom fan, but the mushrooms were cooked and seasoned to perfection. This pizza was basically the margherita with mushrooms. And was definitely a winner in my book as well.About 1 1/2 bottles of wine in, we decided to ask for dessert. Which was simple, a chocolate mousse, tiramisu, and a berry compote panna cotta. Being that we are such huge gluttons we asked for all three. And they were all amazing.Leonardo and the staff were amazing the entire way, and we were instantly hooked at this point. So hooked actually - that we do pizza date night there almost every Saturday since our discovery of this gem! I'd highly recommend sitting at the bar with Leonardo. Leonardo, is truly a modern day Hero - for bringing authentic Italy to the neighborhood! A few helpful notes,1. It used to be BYOB, but Leo told us upon our last visit they have their wine/beer license. 2. Cash only3. Kid friendly4. Bring an empty stomach.5. Be prepared for instant love upon first bite.Saturday - in my book is a great day. Sleeping in after a long work week, sleeping in after a long work week some more, then pizza date night at Union Pizza Works!",5.0
"4.5 stars.This was our after new years (more like a couple nights after new years)  dinner place, and the thing that stood out for me here was the ambiance, which honestly is a bit strange: it's basically like a warehouse, or a former warehouse, where they now slang very delicious pizzas. that's not that strange really; the strange part, is the fact that they've managed to make said warehouse a relatively intimate, good date spot. The pizza is prepared with a wood burning stove so the food comes out piping hot and rather quickly, and also, yes the pizza is really yummy. They don't do slices, it's all personal pizzas so I got the sausage pie, and my date got the margherita, and we split it and shared. She even got the chocolate mousse, which really, is A LOT of mousse, and a lot of chocolate. I've been told that it was really good, though I'm not an expert seeing as how I'm not the biggest sweets fan. This place however is in a relatively convenient location in the neighborhood, and since it's so good and rather inexpensive, you have NO reason to not go to this place and try it out. enjoy.",4.0

"The word ""works"" conjures up massive industrial structures from the early 20th century, the kind you'd see in black and white news reels where workers are assembling steamboats, receiving raw material via train and mass producing widgets. Think Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" or for the computer gaming enthusiast, the ironworks city improvement in Civilization. Union Pizza Works resides in what is surely a former warehouse or factory in an area rich in 20th century manufacturing. Travel back in time 100 years and Williamsburg, Bushwick and other now desirable neighborhoods were polluted, overcrowded and humming with industry. Fortunately, Union Pizza works hums with the production of pizza perfection and nothing noisier.On a cold Sunday we were early and the metal fence was just being slid aside to indicate that the UPW was open for business. Yes, a sliding metal fence, one of the many industrial touches, including the heavy door lead into a dimly candlelit interior that is a total makeover and repurposing of the original structure.It's like the Highline of pizza joints!The 1950's bebop jazz soundtrack, combined with the free and  casual speaking of the beautiful Italian language, gave the place the feel of an underground pizza speakeasy, where Sophia Loren would suddenly show up to avoid the hordes of paparazzi while filming a new Fellini flick. I recommend that every diner order their own whole pizza, especially if you aren't ordering a salad or appetizer. There's nothing intimidating about the size either as I was able to complete the margherita with minimal effort. The balance of cheese to sauce was just right, hitting a golden ratio while resting atop a malleable crust that was easy to fold and easier to eat. Different than the Angelo's, Patsy's and Grimaldi's, the pizza here is more intimate and personal, based on the serving size but also the execution. The crumbled sausage sprinkled on my wife's pizza had a chance to breathe without being suffocated with layer upon layer of mozzarella that sometimes runs the risk of becoming far too thick and impenetrable. Here each ingredient had a fighting chance to be noticed and evaluated on its own merits as opposed to being assimilated into the mozzarella collective.Two pizzas and a pellegrino came out to $32. Service was friendly, with multiple staff members stopping by to ask how we were. There are a few tables for two mixed in with the larger tables for groups and I suspect that in the warmer months outside seating will be an option too.May the pizza eating proletariat of the world unite at Union Pizza Works.",4.0
Food was delicious. Wine was delicious. Great atmosphere. Okay service. Very authentic to my time in Rome.,4.0
"Great pizza, lazy service. Both times I've been here, it's taken forever to order anything or get the attention of the wait staff. There are usually a few waiters roaming around, but no one has assigned tables and no one ever checks up on you to ensure your drinks/food are OK.",3.0
"I haven't written a review for a long time... I was trying to hold off to write one until I found a place that was worthy to write about because I mean -  I am the modern day J.K Rowlings and people just are dying to see what I'm writing about right? Incorrect.What is in fact 100% correct, is how amazing Union Pizza Works is. I've recently moved back to Bushwick  and came back to a plethora of brand new bars, restaurants, shopping, etc. Being that Roberta's is the only pizza place around I was extremely excited to check out UPW. So - one snowy Saturday night the Mister and I decided on one thing.. PIZZA DATE NIGHT needs to happen. Well, pizza date night happens at least two times a week and we basically stuff an entire pizza pie each into our systems and drink too much wine... Which is tradition now, and I don't break tradition.... We decided to give UPW a try, and upon arrival we both fell in love. The decor is simple yet quirky, and the wood burning oven in the back really warmed up the place. We decided to sit at the bar, and was instantly greeted by a charming man, Leonardo! Leonardo is one of the owners of this gem, he's extremely funny and welcoming which made the experience even better.UPW, has an simple menu - a few pizzas for the vegetarians (us), a few pizzas for the meat eaters..a couple of appetizers, and a couple of desserts. Also, rotating specials every night. We went for the fennel to start -  it was baked with a bechamel sauce or to be politically correct besciamella! It was wood fired in the oven in the back and came out piping hot and topped off with even more cheese! Amazing flavors, interesting texture, and just over all a winner in our book. Be sure to get some bread to sop up the excess besciamella. I went for the margherita. Which features house made mozzarella  *record scratch* ...have you had fresh house made mozzarella? It was truly something special, almost comparable to that feeling you get when you've just found a 100 dollar bill on the floor. The mozzarella paired with the amazingly robust flavors of the marinara on that perfectly cooked pizza dough was enough for me to jump up and do a whole rendition of The Pointer Sisters- I'M SO EXCITED for everyone at the restaurant. It was that good.. Just that good.J went for the Funghi, equally amazing. I'm not a huge mushroom fan, but the mushrooms were cooked and seasoned to perfection. This pizza was basically the margherita with mushrooms. And was definitely a winner in my book as well.About 1 1/2 bottles of wine in, we decided to ask for dessert. Which was simple, a chocolate mousse, tiramisu, and a berry compote panna cotta. Being that we are such huge gluttons we asked for all three. And they were all amazing.Leonardo and the staff were amazing the entire way, and we were instantly hooked at this point. So hooked actually - that we do pizza date night there almost every Saturday since our discovery of this gem! I'd highly recommend sitting at the bar with Leonardo. Leonardo, is truly a modern day Hero - for bringing authentic Italy to the neighborhood! A few helpful notes,1. It used to be BYOB, but Leo told us upon our last visit they have their wine/beer license. 2. Cash only3. Kid friendly4. Bring an empty stomach.5. Be prepared for instant love upon first bite.Saturday - in my book is a great day. Sleeping in after a long work week, sleeping in after a long work week some more, then pizza date night at Union Pizza Works!",5.0
"4.5 stars.This was our after new years (more like a couple nights after new years)  dinner place, and the thing that stood out for me here was the ambiance, which honestly is a bit strange: it's basically like a warehouse, or a former warehouse, where they now slang very delicious pizzas. that's not that strange really; the strange part, is the fact that they've managed to make said warehouse a relatively intimate, good date spot. The pizza is prepared with a wood burning stove so the food comes out piping hot and rather quickly, and also, yes the pizza is really yummy. They don't do slices, it's all personal pizzas so I got the sausage pie, and my date got the margherita, and we split it and shared. She even got the chocolate mousse, which really, is A LOT of mousse, and a lot of chocolate. I've been told that it was really good, though I'm not an expert seeing as how I'm not the biggest sweets fan. This place however is in a relatively convenient location in the neighborhood, and since it's so good and rather inexpensive, you have NO reason to not go to this place and try it out. enjoy.",4.0

"OK, so judging from the other reviews, my experience at Union might be an outlier.

Well, fine, it's a casual place. But my wife and I felt lost and abandoned by our server once the food arrived. It's always embarrassing reminding people to take your money. He also didn't seem to notice when he brought the carafe of the house Chianti that it was noticeably warm. I can see how this might have gone unnoticed by him; but, my lord, where are they storing this wine? Beside the oven?The greatest injustice, however, was our soggy pizza. The outside edge of the cruse was nice and toasty, but the bottom was a sloppy mess. This raises a serious red flag for me.

"Roberta's-level pizza, minus 150 minutes of waiting.  This new entry to the ""Jefftown"" restaurant/bar explosion stands out not only for being the first top-notch artisanal pizza place in the area, but also for its outdoor space in front, which will come in most handy in the summer.  First noticed the place via the simple, borderline tacky but attention-getting neon ""Eat Pizza"" sign out front.  Had the Margherita and Pizza con Capicola, and both were great and comparable to what you'd get at Houdini's and the aforementioned Roberta's.  Wine offerings were both good and inexpensive.  Staff was friendly and seemed to actually be from Italy.  Looking forward to coming back, especially when it's warm enough to eat outdoors.  Go now while the wait time is nil, because that will probably change in the not-too-distant future.",5.0
OMG fantastic. This place has the nicest people working there who remember us every time we visit. The pizza is stellar as well. Definitely try the pizza topped with a fried egg if you ever see it on special. The outdoor area in front is lovely too. I'll be back a lot this summer for sure. :),5.0
"We reserved for a large group here with a bunch of italian friends in the group. No problem they were great about this. We ordered some apps, that is the sides  came as apps and all of them were great: I shared a baked fennel dish, the insalata mista was perfect! the kale salad looked amazing....person sitting next me and myself order red wine by the glass but something funny was going on here...both of us ordered 2 different types of wine, but each of us came to the same conclusion, there was something wrong with our wine: others tasted it and concluded it was diluted: I have never had wine diluted with anything even in Italy itself so we found this shocking.  Yes pretty sure that was the case. Yes I know that sounds like crazy, but none of us are young wine drinkers: we know what we tasted. We sent it back and ordered a bottle of red instead which was great at a good price also. All our pizzas were top notch although a few a little bit too burned but really really good with a great ""corona"" (edge).  Here also, there was one funny thing: someone got a pizza that lacked mozzarella, it went back and came back with some funny strange kinda cheese on it, which the person of course recognized right away.  The service was good. They sent us free desserts !!! which I have to say were all excellent, particularly the panna cotta one of my favs.  We were just perplexed: why would you go to the trouble of making GREAT PIZZA but serve bad wine and put bad cheese on it like that???  That is the ONLY reason I am giving only 3 stars here.  Beware the wine by the glass. All told, no question I am going back here, it will for sure be a regular haunt.",3.0
"The pizza was tasty, but cold. The service was ok. The folks there... eurotrash. So. Much. Eurotrash. If Roberta's wait is too long, come here early before the trash arrives.",2.0

"Delicious pizzas and nice staff. The place is really cool too, and it is not too loud. Pizzas are amongst the best I had in NYC (with robertas') I haven't tried the lasagna but it will be next. Place was full of italian families, it's always a good sign!",4.0
Great pizza and awesome addition to the neighborhood! I brought my son here and will be coming back regularly for these delicious pies. The burrata on the daily special was also really good. The pizza came out quickly and the staff was super nice. Only things I would personally like to see would be delivery and more diverse cured meats possibly even on the pizza I will keep my fingers crossed.,5.0
"Great pizza, like the industrial look, especially concrete counters on cinder block. Service is very professional and nice.",4.0
"This is a new spot in town and I've already been twice. The pizza is excellent, better than Roberta's IMO, especially for less/no wait. The desserts and entrees are solid too, but nothing to write home about. The staff is great- something I really appreciate; and the space is gorgeous. The espresso machine is a beauty, but both times I've had them, they've been so-so- a tad burnt- that could be improved. Keep it up UPW, I'll keep spreading the word.",4.0
"This is a great place! I love the interior and the way the menu is written on the wall. I highly recommend all their pizzas, they are delicious! I will definitely be back!",5.0

"There are a lot of options now when it comes to where to have brunch in this neighborhood, but I am always so glad when I choose this place. Today was no exception - great service, delicious food, awesome cocktail and a latte much stronger than I could have gotten anywhere else in the neighborhood, it woke me up so I could go home and get some work done. Thanks guys!!!!!!",5.0
"Enjoyed a delicious white pizza, an amazing octopus salad, and a delightful dessert. The restaurant also has a perfectly ambient atmosphere. Will definitely return.",5.0
"UPW is an adorable little pizza shop that does it right.  Fresh ingredients and perfect crust, how can you beat that? The price point is fair as compared to other establishments in the neighborhood.  You can expect to pay $12-16 per pizza and about $5-10 for antipasto.  We were able to bring our own beer, but I believe they have a liquor license pending.  I can't wait to enjoy the outside patio when the weather warms up.  Welcome to the neighborhood and I will be back soon.",4.0

"Although this place probably deserves 5 stars based on appearance I am giving it 3 just because it seems to blend in with the rest of the bougie crap they are polluting troutman with.  Why does Bushwick have to transform into SoHo? All in all the food is fine but it's mostly an insulting song and dance to the customers and the neighborhood. As if someone said ""Bushwick, where all the suckers are!"" And then placed this hyper hip concrete floored and counter topped minimalist pizza shop in between some lofts and started selling pizzas for $20. It's worth visiting once, I suppose. When I was there it smelled like fish.",3.0
"WOW just WOW I live in Bushwick and have hated waiting for 2 hours to get a slice of pizza at Roberta's and finally they have some serious competition. Not only do I not have to wait for a heavenly pizza, but this place seriously serves the best pizza I have ever had. I went 3 times in 1 week gaining about 5 lbs but all worth it. LOL. Service and atmosphere were excellent. Def a place to check out!",5.0
"Great pizza. True Neopolitan style. The mozzarella was incredibly milky and fresh and the cold-pressed olive oil was just right. Excellent ambience and atmosphere. The menu describes a marinara sauce served with the meatballs, but it was actually an onion-based ragout, not a marinara. Wish the meatballs were much less dense, dry and beefy, but everything else was good. Really knowledgeable, attentive service.",4.0

Went there last week with my husband had a salad didn't really enjoy it. We had mussels they were good nothing to brag about and we had pizza with mushrooms that was good and one with what was supposed to be prosciutto but turned out to be boars head ham on pizza I didn't understand that.  Overall it's okay but will never ever be Roberta's,5.0
"Yummy personal pizzas. Good salads. A delicious side of fennel with béchamel and cheese. Good wine recommendations. We loved sitting outside, but also think it'll be a good spot for the winter too.",5.0

"This place just opened and already I am thrilled with the addition to the neighborhood.  This is a nice restaurant--not a slice-joint--just so you know going in.  (I love slice-joints too, but good to know what you're in for).   The ambiance is clean and calming--cinder-block walls, simple wood-topped tables. I was there the first week that they opened yet my 5-star rating isn't because I went easy on the newcomer.  The pizza was just perfect: crispy and with the right balance of sauce and cheese (I went with the basic, just so I could compare fairly to other plain pizzas).  The ambiance is very nice (obviously new) and the staff could not have been nicer and more professional. The pizza is individual size, about 9"" cut into 4 slices.  The crust is crispy, but has a thicker edge, which was crisp and chewy.  Ingredients were obviously very fresh.  For dessert I had the tirimisu, which was exceptional, and I grade hard on desserts.  There was also a Chocolate Mousse  that I didn't have but my neighbor at the next table enjoyed very much.  Overall a great meal and a great addition to the neighborhood.  Highly recommend it.",5.0
"I was just saying that this neighborhood needed a pizza place, and the next day I saw the illuminated 'Eat Pizza' sign. The pizza is really quite good, but the people here are what earn the five stars. They clearly care a lot about what they're doing, are incredibly nice, and continue the tradition of new neighborhood joints that feel like actual neighborhood joints.",5.0
"Great coal oven roasted pizza!  The stylish and modern design pizzeria was outstanding.  We tried the margherita, pizza con cippole, and prosciutto.  We also had the calamari salad.  For dessert, the chocolate mousse and tiramisu were delicious.  The owner Giorgio is very friendly and his staff were very attentive!  Great addition to Bushwick!",5.0
