Kim Chi Fried Rice. Awesome. it is making me hungry just thinking about the meal I had here. I loved it and would definitely go back :),5.0
Don't quite understand what the hype is about. Came in for a late lunch on a Saturday. We waited 30 minutes for our food. The bibimbap and the burger with kimchi were mediocre and totally overpriced for the portion and taste.,2.0
We stumbled into here when I yelped 'best food' around the area on our way back from ikea. The place is so cute and cozy and had a very warm feel to it. We got a nice booth table. We weren't that hungry but got the dumplings which were excellent. Then split the steak with a fried egg and kimchi fried rice. Finished off with a key lime pie. Everything was delicious along with the drinks. Staff was friendly and very chill as well. We left very impressed and pleased. Would definitely come back.,5.0
This place was simply amazing. The best drinks. Burger was cooked just perfect to medium rare. Tyrone the bartender was always whipping up something tasty for us to try. Key lime was the bomb!,5.0
"Simple homey restaurant with simply delicious food. We went for brunch, the cappuccino was eh but the food came out quickly and we promptly forgot about coffee. The menu is an interesting mix of classic American and Korean inspired dishes. Our fried chicken sandwich was juicy and delicious, and the French fries were heavenly. But the bibimbap stole the show- amazing steak. Will absolutely be back.",5.0
"Charming, creative interior, friendly staff, delicious food.  Went on Saturday afternoon for a late brunch including a blood orange mimosa and vegetarian bibimbap with tofu.  Great flavor; looking forward to trying more.",5.0
"There arent that many restaurants near ikea, and The Good Fork appears to be one of the more popular one.  The first time I was in the area, we arrived at 2:45pm and their lunch kitchen was closing.  They always seem so busy on weekends.When I read the menu, I knew immediately that I wanted to try the bibimbop with nice fresh veggies and marinated skirt steak.  It was super delicious. Also had a bite of the salmon and latkes ... also very delicious.I would recommend this place, but just be prepared to wait on weekends.",4.0

Came here for brunch and was pleasantly surprised with a very cute and intimate back garden. I ordered the Korean fried chicken which was good and the biscuit that came with it was warm and flaky. I also had a bite of the bibimbap which was a nice take on the traditional Korean bibimbap.,4.0
"On a beautiful day, take the IKEA ferry from Manhattan - heck it's free! And skip the shop/check out local restos.Was in the neighborhood for the Red Hook Crit and decided to do just that.

Overall i feel like it's average. It's a interesting fusion kind of place of Korean cuisine with western meals. Had no wait so was able to get a table but they were a bit non helpful with our group and felt rushed. I've heard good things about the meals but i feel that their time has passed and have since didn't focus on the details of their food. The bimbibop rice was undercooked but the steak and greens were fresh and was flavorful. The omlette with goat cheese was standard fare. Dumplings interiors were delicious but the skins were overcooked and charred with a burnt taste. Hopefully they'll get back to the details.,3.0
"Stumpled upon this place randomly when i was in the area and was extremely impressed! Between two, we had house made kimchee and scallion pancakes as sides, stuff squid as an appetizer and entrees we had the oxtail tail pasta and Korean steak  & eggs. Everything was delicious!  Our scallion pancake was a little doughy, but still good. For the price of the pancakes, i expected better. The stuff squid portion is tiny... but the puree that came with it was absolutely amazing. I almost licked my plate. Our entrees were perfect in portion. The oxtail pasta had the perfect bite and just right on sauce. Korean steak and eggs came with kimchee rice and argula salad. We ended the night with olive oil cake.",4.0

The General Tso's pork belly, which sounds fantastic, ended up being the worst dish of the entire night. The two small slices of pork belly, which consisted of just skin and fat and no meat, was completely gelatinous. I thought the appeal of pork belly was the crispy skin? Also, there were zero traces of pickled chilis, as described on the menu, which would've provided a nice balance to the syrupy General Tso's sauce.The Korean style steak and eggs was brought to me at room temperature, indicating it had been left out for a while.

We had the Beet Salad, Tofu and Eggs (instead of Steak) and Green Beans with Parsley Pesto. The Beet Salad was phenomenal, I loved the crunchy texture of whatever it was they garnished with on top, in contrast with texture of the soft beets. It was perfect, probably the best rendition of beets I've ever had. The tofu was fine but it wasn't memorable. I wasn't a fan of the tofu/egg combo. The textures of both were a little too similar, creating a monotonous dish that lacked any kind of keen distinction between either ingredient. The Green Beans, meh.. I thought it lacked flavor and was a little under seasoned.",4.0

"I wish I had read the latest reviews on this restaurant; unfortunately, I was scrambling to find a Brooklyn brunch spot that did not have a 2hr wait time... ... well, maybe those places have long wait time for a reason! I ordered Korean fried chicken, and I must second Thomas C. (6/14/2015) on this.  NEVER ORDER THIS OVERPRICED piece of meat. A piece of fried chicken from Fresh Grocer would look and taste better than this. It was literally TWO pieces of deep fried chicken, and next to it was a sad biscuit loaded with ""gochujang honey butter"" which did NOT go well with the biscuit. I ended up asking if they can just give me a plain biscuit and when they did.. except that this time, they just loaded it with butter.. So... I basically paid $16 for two pieces of fried chicken and over-buttered biscuit. For Brunch. On Saturday. Wow. Thanks.My friend told me her french toast was alright, but it was actually pretty soggy.My other friend ordered a burger, and it looked decent, but it was just a plain burger you can find in any lunch places.I noticed that other customers (by the way, the place was half empty at 1PM Saturday.. we had a bad feeling about this when we walked in, and boy were we right) were eating bibimbap, so I am guessing it tastes alright.But seriously, people, if you want decent Korean food, please just go to K-town, and not force yourself to eat overpriced and sub-par food claiming to be Korean-American fusion. Or something along that line.The only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they did try hard to give us a nice service.",2.0

"Great spot, attentive service! The menu is simple with Korean style influence that turns traditional brunch dishes into something unique and delicious. The decor is also cool with antique art work complemented with a brick wall and little trinkets like vintage lamps and glass figurines.

"pros: food is great! we went for brunch and had a bloody mary, spicy chicken tinga over crispy tortilla and eggs, and the key lime pie. their chive sausage is a little sweet but good as a breakfast side and their bibimbop was alright. nothing great about their burger, but fries were solid. i would go back for the chicken brunch item and KEY LIME PIE. YUMMMcon: red hook is far. service is pretty slow. they have a small kitchen!",4.0
"We had dinner here on the night they were filming an episode of Mob Wives so we couldn't see what the back patio area looked like but I loved the interior, it was charming in a rustic chic kind of way. We scored a seat at the front by the window and it was perfect because I got to sit next to my date in a cute nook.While perusing through the menu, it became evident that this is a Korean-American fusion restaurant, which was cool to see (I'm always happy to see kimchi on any menu). We had the Beet Salad, Tofu and Eggs (instead of Steak) and Green Beans with Parsley Pesto. The Beet Salad was phenomenal, I loved the crunchy texture of whatever it was they garnished with on top, in contrast with texture of the soft beets. It was perfect, probably the best rendition of beets I've ever had. The tofu was fine but it wasn't memorable. I wasn't a fan of the tofu/egg combo. The textures of both were a little too similar, creating a monotonous dish that lacked any kind of keen distinction between either ingredient. The Green Beans, meh.. I thought it lacked flavor and was a little under seasoned.",4.0
"The best meal I've had in months.  A solid Nebbiolo with perfectly roasted chicken, sides of asparagus (with pistachios!) and snap peas, and a killer chocolate tart.  And to top it off, Ben was lovely.  None of that crazy ""we'll seat you in two hours, and if you aren't here when I call your name you lose your spot in line"" that plagues the city's best eateries.",4.0
"After checking out my brothers shop ""Wooden Sleepers"" I noticed a little foodie spot right across the street. My father and I had the pleasure of eating here this past weekend & boy oh boy was it DELICIOUS. We sat during their brunch menu which had awesome options. I ordered the Lox Plate & a bangin bloody mary which was the bomb dot com & my dad had their breakfast sandwich which he described as an explosion of all sorts of flavors. I can confidently say next time we are in Red Hook this place will be one of our go to's. =)",5.0
"I wish I had read the latest reviews on this restaurant; unfortunately, I was scrambling to find a Brooklyn brunch spot that did not have a 2hr wait time... ... well, maybe those places have long wait time for a reason! I ordered Korean fried chicken, and I must second Thomas C. (6/14/2015) on this.  NEVER ORDER THIS OVERPRICED piece of meat. A piece of fried chicken from Fresh Grocer would look and taste better than this. It was literally TWO pieces of deep fried chicken, and next to it was a sad biscuit loaded with ""gochujang honey butter"" which did NOT go well with the biscuit. I ended up asking if they can just give me a plain biscuit and when they did.. except that this time, they just loaded it with butter.. So... I basically paid $16 for two pieces of fried chicken and over-buttered biscuit. For Brunch. On Saturday. Wow. Thanks.My friend told me her french toast was alright, but it was actually pretty soggy.My other friend ordered a burger, and it looked decent, but it was just a plain burger you can find in any lunch places.I noticed that other customers (by the way, the place was half empty at 1PM Saturday.. we had a bad feeling about this when we walked in, and boy were we right) were eating bibimbap, so I am guessing it tastes alright.But seriously, people, if you want decent Korean food, please just go to K-town, and not force yourself to eat overpriced and sub-par food claiming to be Korean-American fusion. Or something along that line.The only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they did try hard to give us a nice service.",2.0

"Great little spot - top notch service - above average food.  Simply put, if we lived in the neighborhood this would be a regular go to, but being that we're a 15min bike ride away up the hill in Brooklyn Heights, I'm not sure if this place is worth making it a regular dinner/drinks destination.We loved the decor and service, and the fact that nearly everything on their menu is from local Red Hook sources!Drinks - I had the pretty standard Schneider-Weiss with lemon while my husband tried a Fiscal Cliff and was a little disappointed - it was very sweet, which he wasn't expecting... but oh well, he later moved on to the Manhattan which we both agreed was wonderful.  Later we had the dessert sake which we both thought kind of just tasted like a slightly sweeter but very watered down version of sake - but maybe it just wasn't our thing - I normally am not a big fan of sake anyway.Appetizers - the fried green tomatoes special was out of this world, and the roasted squash with fig was quite nice, but the squid was entirely overcooked and my husband thought it tasted a bit fishy.  I mean, I seriously could not even chew through it and ended up swallowing a huge rubbery piece which just sat in my stomach for what seemed like hours.  Needless to say, after the first bite, the dish was left untouched.  They comped it and were very eager to make it up to us which was really nice.  I mean, it happens - it's not a big deal and I'm sure it isn't a regular occurrence here.  Mains - we shared the steak and eggs ""Korean style"" main with the fried tofu instead of the steak.  I was a little shocked at how limited the mains were to meat eaters - if you're vegetarian (we're not entirely), this is the only dish that's possible for you (the tofu is awesome by the way).  The menu in general is a little short on choices actually.  I'm sure it's all delicious, but there was one fish dish, one pasta dish, some lamb chops, etc.  The sides on the menu, I noticed, included a side of kimchi rice from the ""steak and eggs Korean style"" dish that we got (substituted the steak with tofu) - I don't know, I feel that's a little cheap in a way.  How bout some grilled veggies, some rosemary potatoes, hell, even sweet potato fries?  I don't know... I think it's a bit of a cop out to offer the kimchi rice as a side when it's a main component of one of your 5 main dishes already.  Call me crazy.  Who knows, maybe their kitchen is just tiny.Now, what bumped this review from 3 to 4 stars is their desserts!  Steve's key lime pie?  absolutely!!  If you've been to Red Hook, you've seen the signs everywhere - it is amazing.  Probably the best key lime pie I've ever had.  Oh, and their olive oil poppy seed cake with lemon curd is incredible!  It was similar to a pound cake, really moist, with little pieces of lemon rind in there as well - loved it!So for 2 cocktails, 1 beer, 2 appetizers, 1 main and 2 desserts (they comped the squid and the sake which was so nice), the bill ended up coming to $100 or $120 total with tip.  I think it's worth a visit for the service and overall theme and decor of the restaurant, but whether or not you make it a regular go to?  That's up to you.",4.0

We had addressed this to our waitress (who was very pleasant)  she took it back to the kitchen and exchanged it.

The burgers were average but because it took about an hour for them to come out with the food i can't give this place more than 2 stars. Dessert was below average.

Korean fried chicken and the dumplings were subpar. While the batter on the chicken was thin and crispy, it was exceedingly salty (and I usually don't mind salt). Something was off with the dumplings, too. My wife pegged it right: beware of Asian food made by white people. Also, I was a bit surprised that the two pieces of chicken were a thigh and a drumstick. Sure, dark meat stays moist, but I would have preferred one of each. I like thigh meat, but not theirs. I ordered a fantastic biscuit, but was a bit annoyed that this doesn't come with the fried chicken, which had mediocre sides.

It sounded good on paper but the actual product just tasted like a wet, muted chocolate cake.The service was good and the host was friendly, and since the restaurant is small, there is no real waiting area.

How's this for overdue-I came here last year when some friends were moving and another friend was pregnant-well the friends moved in July and my friend had her baby. I have no recollection of what I ate but it was delicious and I have been meaning to get back here.,4.0
"Great place. Incredible steak and eggs. Also had the boar shank, which was equally good. Extremely tender, and the baby pots served with it were perfect. Ambience is perfect for a date. Their back garden is great. Only minor suggestion I'd have is regarding their draft beers. They have two on tap. One is quite hoppy, and the other is super hoppy. I'd prefer a not-so-hoppy alternative. Maybe have one great hoppy beer on tap, and another flavorful ale or lager.",5.0
"Finally came here for brunch this past weekend, and everything from the service to the food to the overall atmosphere was A+.   Their burger and arugula salad were perfect.  I can't wait to come back and sit in their cute garden once the weather starts to cool down.",5.0
"This is the type of restaurant that makes Brooklyn great. You can wander down an empty, unassuming block and step into a packed place where the staff makes you feel like you just got home, and the food and drink will be as interesting, as savory, as absolutely delicious as anywhere in the world. There is often a short wait for a table, but the host will gladly take down your number and give you a call when yours is ready. If you walked 45 minutes to get here like I did, a short stroll around the block shouldn't bother you anyway. The food is well worth the wait (and the walk).Once you're finally seated, take your time. Enjoy the little lights twinkling around the entire space, order an adult beverage and pick a few things to eat off the short, sweet menu.As a former NOLA resident, I couldn't pass up the fried oyster po' boys topped with pickled red onions, tequila-cured tomatillos and a remoulade sauce. The flavors were spot on, but I think an extra oyster in each and they wouldn't have been overwhelmed by the bread. The avocado puree accompaniment was more than welcome, however.I couldn't pass up what the waitress called their signature dish, and it's a house favorite with good reason. The Steak and Eggs ""Korean Style"" consists of skirt steak marinated and seasoned almost exactly as my mother used to do it, but masterfully cooked to a medium rare she never quite hit. It's accompanied by kimchee rice and an egg fried to an amazing crispiness, especially considering the beautifully runny yolk that tied it all together. If I had one, miniscule complaint about the dish, it would be that I'd appreciate another egg as I didn't have enough to incorporate into every bite.* On a fish mission, my date chose the skate over the arctic char. The crispy coriander-crusted wing went wonderfully with the fennel and fiddlehead. A lemon butter sauce pulled it all together, and although on its own the fish was not remarkable, a bite with each component bordered on brilliance. I would never have thought to add the almonds, and I suppose that's why no one would come out to Red Hook to eat my food. I was predisposed to love my steak, but this fish has me absolutely sure that they have some very talented people in the Good Fork kitchen. I can't wait to come back for Vietnamese-style ribs, oxtail ravioli, or whatever else they dream up.__________*And because I have a mild OCD that makes me thing the dish should be called 'Steak and Egg...' otherwise.",5.0
"Eating korean fusion outside of Seattle is always a let-down for me.  I had the highly touted korean steak and eggs and found it to be a little bit ho-hum.  It tasted vaguely of steak teriyaki here in Seattle.  Now - a friend of mine had the tofu version of the same and it was amazing (I would probably be giving a 5 star review right now if I had ordered that).  The tofu was crispy on the outside and silky in the middle.  I am totally in awe of how they did that.They ably accommodated our group of 7 with great service - we had a number of good appetizers to start including amazing Korean pancakes, perfect salt cod croquettes, and a really good watermelon salad - the addition of blue cheese here really made it stand out.  My wife had the crab agnolotti for dinner which was also well cooked - al dente just the way it should be.I had key lime pie for dessert which was fine but I probably could have just stuck with an espresso.  Drinks and wine were well done too.",4.0

"I was absolutely blown away by the food and service at Good Fork in Red Hook. We were a bit nervous that it wouldn't live up to the prices which seemed a bit high, especially for Red Hook, but everything was amazing. We arrived without a reservation and were told we could have the cool little table in the corner as long as we could be done by the time the reservation arrived. The quaint, lovely, garden area was completely full already though I'd go back just to sit out there.   Service was very good throughout, very friendly and helpful with recommendations. It wasn't particularly fast, but the atmosphere lent to a laid back feeling and we enjoyed relaxing and taking it all in.   The wine, sourced locally from the nearby winery, was exquisite, not expensive, and complimented the food very well. The mussels we ordered as an appetizer were delicious. It was a huge plate of about 30 mussels in an incredible spice that hinted of old bay. The garlic bread was also delicious, I wish they gave more than one slice. The mussels were obviously high quality as they had none of the hint of fishiness you often get with them.  The duck breast was superbly tasty and was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The veggies and sauce were also wonderful. I really liked the spicy sauce but wish there was more. The bass special was also very good and came in a delicious stew.   We even ordered dessert because the dulce de leche and pepper ice cream sounded too good to resist. It was everything I hoped for and more. I could have dealt with it being spicier with more pepper, but realize not everyone wants to cry with their ice cream. The spice was well balanced with a delicious savory taste.   Red Hook may be a bit far out of the way, but with he free Ikea ferry and how good this meal was, I think we will be back.",5.0

"I expected at least a decent brunch based on the high reviews here.  But what I got was something entirely different.  It makes me wonder if we all ate at the same restaurant or if I ate somewhere else.  I came here for brunch on a Saturday, around 1:30 in the afternoon.  It was not very busy but had a decent brunch crowd.  I ordered the chicken tostadas and my husband ordered the buttermilk fried chicken.  The food took half an hour to come.  Mind you, it was not very crowded and most of the diners were already eating.  I thought they might have been butchering a fresh chicken in the back just for this meal.Anyway, the tostada came with a pile of black beans that had a really strong and distinct flavor.  I'd say it was very close to licorice or star anise.  It was incredibly overwhelming and the only reason why I managed to finish it was because the serving was incredibly precious.  One of my bites also had a well concealed long thin chicken bone.  I'm glad I didn't choke on it because it definitely went in horizontal.  Blech.My husband's buttermilk fried chicken was a rip off.  The servings were one piece of chicken thigh filet (about the size of credit card) and a small drumstick.  I get it, the chicken probably came from a special farm (the backyard maybe?) where it got to play jump rope and eat whoopie pies and what not.  But I'd appreciate if they can serve an additional piece or two or maybe with a fried egg.  Something that feels more like a meal and not an appetizer for an average weight individual.  I suppose we should've expected it.  A relatively rotund diner sitting in another table over ordered the same dish and when hers came, I saw her lick the entire bone clean.  Or maybe she ate the bone, to get as much out of the meal as she can, who knows.  If you are a small child, this is definitely a good dish to order.  Otherwise, according to my husband, the flavors were good but nothing to write home about.It seems like everyone ordered the Korean steak and eggs and raved about it.  But I just could not justify paying $17 for a brunch dish.  Meh.Long story short, I only weigh a 100 pounds and I needed to go to Fairway afterwards to buy myself an actual meal.  I'd never come back.  The next table over ordered the dumplings.  They looked like something I can get in a good dimsum restaurant for half the price.   I suppose anyone bothering to venture outside of Redhook, Greenpoint, Williamsburg would know this.  Just sayin.",1.0
"This is a review for the food stall at the Brooklyn Flea market and not the sit-down restaurant in Red Hook.  Don't get me wrong.  When I was in Red Hook, I definitely wanted to visit the restaurant and try their pork and chives dumplings so famously depicted on Bobby Flay's Throwdown show.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is only open for dinner, and a multi-hour wait for some dumplings just wasn't in the cards, no matter how good they are.  Fortunately fate intervened, and I had a second go at trying these.  At a savings I should add since the restaurant charges $9 for their appetizer portion of dumplings!  The stall actually has both the pork dumplings as well as a vegetarian dumpling, so I split my order as half and half.  I was impressed.  The pork dumplings are really quite good.  They are browned on the bottom, and there is a lot of caramelization which is enhanced by the soy sauce.  The dumplings are packed tight with plenty of pork which was nicely seasoned.  It all made for a very nice package and was delicious to eat.  The vegetarian dumplings were less good, but still pleasing.  Perfect food for a food stall -- definitely recommend.",4.0
"The two times I've been to this restaurant, I ordered the same thing: steak and eggs over kimchi rice.  I love the tenderness of the meat that's cooked perfectly.  I have heard from friends that many of their other items are pretty good too but do not try the dumplings.  I know that's their claim to fame, but I was very disappointed when I tried it.A great date spot!",4.0
"Good Fork is the perfect neighborhood restaurant, and I wish I lived around the corner.  Great comfort foods, excellent bar, welcoming staff, and cozy ambience.  Been here many times in the last few yrs, and taken lots of people to try it out, to mostly great acclaim (including my very finicky folks).Their menu changes seasonally, and there are usually specials.  A constant is my favorite entree, the Korean steak and eggs, where the skirt steak has an incredible marinade and is immensely tender and flavorful.  Other highlights include the steamed mussels, burger, shrimp-scallion pancakes, potato-parsnip mash, dumplings, and onion rings.  The latter are the best I've ever had, big onion rings married to a tempura batter shell that's crisp, light, and adheres to the rings.  Most other entrees and appetizers I've tried were good, and can't remember ever having anything I didn't at least like.The dumplings gained notoriety after a Food Network feature and I would note that they're well-made, with delicate skin and lightly pan-fried for a slight crisp.  I've grown up eating all sorts of Asian dumplings so to put them in perspective, they're pretty good, but not absolutely amazing.The cozy bar turns out some excellent cocktails; never syrupy sweet or overly strong, they're a perfect blend of the components.  Desserts menu also changes seasonally, are usually quite good, and they introduced me to the lovely key lime pie from Steve's in Red Hook..",5.0
"I was around the neighborhood with my friends and was looking for a good brunch restaurant/cafe. When we passed by this restaurant, the outside looks very nice and cozy, so we wanted to give it a try! Once we walked in, the waiter seated us right away, extremely friendly. It was four of us and we all ordered the same dish lol (Duck Confit w. potatoes&2 sunny side eggs) which was new on the menu. DELICIOUS! Really regret not ordering different dishes so we can taste it. Definitely will come back for more of their food. The restaurant inside: very cozy, romantic in a way. In my opinion, this is a great place for a date. The wait for the food to come out wasn't long. I would give this place 5 stars but i feel there's only one little thing... there's not enough options on the menu! Maybe add 2 more dishes in there for us to pick, that'll be great. My experience here was awesome, i would highly recommend this place to everyone. MUST TRY.",4.0
Went to The Good Fork last night after they reopened after Hurricane Sandy.  Such great food!  the Brussels Sprouts starter was like a warm salad with the best bacon ever and bits of the tastiest egg.  Happiness making!  Duck and Chicken entrees  were excellent as always!So glad The Good Fork is back!,4.0
"Simply put, I was disappointed.Throwdown may have been their claim to fame, but I think they've still got a long way to go.My boyfriend and I decided to come for a much needed date night. We were excited to taste the dumplings that had gotten so much attention. I already knew what I was going to order before I even set foot inside the restaurant or looked at the menu. The Kimchi Steak and Eggs was calling my name. As my boyfriend looked over the menu, I checked out the space. Intimate. Dark. Cramped, Nothing to write home about, but for a date night, it fit the bill just fine. I noted the owners and clientele and found them both odd, but you can chuck that up to coming from a different borough. People from Queens are different from those from Brooklyn. In fact, each borough breeds a very specific and different type of New Yorker. Nothing wrong with that.My kimchi steak and eggs was just not good. My food was served to me below lukewarm. The steak was cold, tough and a bit overcooked. The kimchi fried rice was alright, but the emphasis was more on the fried than the kimchi. My eggs were cooked well, although if they hadn't been, I probably would've treated my white napkin as a white flag and thrown it down onto the table in defeat.Their Throwdown winning dumplings were yet another disappointment. They tasted gamey. The sauce provided was overpowering and off putting. They had a thin skinned outer shell, which was nice. But the filling was off. The more I thought about it, I realized that the owners beating an Irish guy at making dumplings wasn't really much of an accomplishment.My boyfriend ordered the seared duck breast confit. It was forgettable. In fact, I've already forgotten about what accompanied it. I do remember that it was the oiliest thing I'd eaten in a while. Duck is a fatty meat, I understand this. But, I've enjoyed it on many occasions when prepared well. This wasn't one of those times.But, it wasn't all bad. We also ordered the jumbo lump crab cake appetizer and THAT was a revelation. Holy mother of lump crab! There was practically no breading in there to speak of! We used our forks to pull off an endless amount of some of the sweetest crab I've ever had. Accompanied by a dollop of aioli and a refreshing salad, it was easily the highlight of our meal and one of the best crab cakes I've ever had. Had I known what the rest of the meal had in store for me, I would've ordered two and made a meal of them.Perhaps they were having an off night. Every restaurant is entitled to one. But it was unfortunate that it had to be on the night I finally got to partake in their offerings. It wasn't cheap, and nothing irritates me like paying for a meal I didn't enjoy. Despite the delicious crab cake, I probably won't be returning.",2.0
"I love Good Fork - and have been dining there a few times a year for at least 3 years running. We find it very welcoming and laid back. The food is excellent, featuring seasonal ingredients. They make great homemade pasta, French-influenced entrees and interesting appetizers, despite being more well known for Asian fusion dishes such as dumplings or steak and eggs. If you're into cocktails, their bartender is creative and they also have a very good wine list (try something from Red Hook Winery if you're stuck).",4.0

"What a wonderful find! This cozy local eaterie serves a small but superb menu of flavorful dishes -- my wife had the braised lamb special and I had the tagliatelle with beef cheeks, accompanied by a terrific selection of wines by the glass. But the real reason for this 5 star review is the friendly efficient tone set by the staff. Rarely have I seen a team so in sync with each other and with the needs of their patrons. Even Gordon Ramsey could learn a thing or two from this place!",5.0
"I expected at least a decent brunch based on the high reviews here.  But what I got was something entirely different.  It makes me wonder if we all ate at the same restaurant or if I ate somewhere else.  I came here for brunch on a Saturday, around 1:30 in the afternoon.  It was not very busy but had a decent brunch crowd.  I ordered the chicken tostadas and my husband ordered the buttermilk fried chicken.  The food took half an hour to come.  Mind you, it was not very crowded and most of the diners were already eating.  I thought they might have been butchering a fresh chicken in the back just for this meal.Anyway, the tostada came with a pile of black beans that had a really strong and distinct flavor.  I'd say it was very close to licorice or star anise.  It was incredibly overwhelming and the only reason why I managed to finish it was because the serving was incredibly precious.  One of my bites also had a well concealed long thin chicken bone.  I'm glad I didn't choke on it because it definitely went in horizontal.  Blech.My husband's buttermilk fried chicken was a rip off.  The servings were one piece of chicken thigh filet (about the size of credit card) and a small drumstick.  I get it, the chicken probably came from a special farm (the backyard maybe?) where it got to play jump rope and eat whoopie pies and what not.  But I'd appreciate if they can serve an additional piece or two or maybe with a fried egg.  Something that feels more like a meal and not an appetizer for an average weight individual.  I suppose we should've expected it.  A relatively rotund diner sitting in another table over ordered the same dish and when hers came, I saw her lick the entire bone clean.  Or maybe she ate the bone, to get as much out of the meal as she can, who knows.  If you are a small child, this is definitely a good dish to order.  Otherwise, according to my husband, the flavors were good but nothing to write home about.It seems like everyone ordered the Korean steak and eggs and raved about it.  But I just could not justify paying $17 for a brunch dish.  Meh.Long story short, I only weigh a 100 pounds and I needed to go to Fairway afterwards to buy myself an actual meal.  I'd never come back.  The next table over ordered the dumplings.  They looked like something I can get in a good dimsum restaurant for half the price.   I suppose anyone bothering to venture outside of Redhook, Greenpoint, Williamsburg would know this.  Just sayin.",1.0

"Reason #36 to love Brooklyn- The Good ForkIf there is one thing I would change about The Good Fork, it would be to have smaller forks. If we used smaller utensils it would be more difficult to shove food in our mouths. We'd take smaller bites, nibble, and maybe savor the flavors more. By eating with a smaller fork, I'd hope my meal would last twice as long. A small fork would be a good fork.I forgive The Good Fork for having standard sized utensils. That's normal. I'll even forgive them for their ""award winning dumplings"". I'm sorry but beating out Bobby does not make you the best. I liked the wrapper and the perfect crescent shape but I wasn't convinced with the pork and chive filling or the sauce. I enjoy frozen gyoza better and nothing can beat my California potstickers. Mandoo? Just mandon't at The Good Fork. One of the salad items fresh off the farm may be a better choice for an appetizer. As for entrees, The Good Fork really excelled. I chose the special of the day to compare to Bar Modern (totally fair!) and while The Good Fork did not have the magical wow factor of beet soup, the diver scallops screamed out *tada!* and tasted far better. The scallops were of good size, perfectly pan seared (let's say caramelization together), swimming in mushroom truffle oil and resting on a bed of pureed peas. It was dotted with a fava bean and decorated with a thin fresh potato chip. How's that for gourmet factor?It was hard to say which dish was the best. It's safe to say whether you get seafood, pork, poultry or any other type of meat/veg you will not be disappointed. They're all good in their own special way. The bacon wrapped pork tenderloin was accompanied with rich buttery grits. The greens were nicely reduced and for kicks it came with stewed apples which were so spicy and pungent it gave us sour faces. Definitely innovative. The tender cod was also on a puree with sugar snap peas. It was an ample serving with an outer layer that rivaled the scallops. The key to eating the cod was to layer it with the candied meyer lemon  pieces. I'll just go ahead and say it. O-M-G.The Good Fork is such a good find. Every day sissypoo passes by The Good Fork on the bus ride home. It was a nice treat to be able to actually stop and enjoy what Red Hook has to offer. The restaurant is small and quaint with intimate seating and a nice garden out back. We sat in the middle room in what felt like grandma's house. The decor is old fashioned and we even sat next to an antique record player. The dessert menu looked promising but with an ice cream parlor across the street I was adamant on moseying on over. But if you ever feel compelled to finish off your meal at The Good Fork... the caramel tea flan sure looks scrumptious.",4.0
"Oh how we wanted to adore this place!  Yesterday, on the prowl for a foodie spot after an early evening of gallery hopping in Red Hook, we happened upon the Good Fork's excellent Yelp reviews and quickly determined it a must-eat.  We even forewent cocktails elsewhere and fresh seafood with a waterside view to check out what GF had to deliver.The food was adequate, which just doesn't cut it at GF's prices.  The $14 burger was cooked properly (medium rare, per order) but not left to rest, so it soaked the bottom bun.  Shortcuts abounded: white instead of red onion; little round, cheap, mass-produced plaintain chips rather than housemade -- housemade anything, for that matter (great housemade fries would have been fabulous); and cheap pickles rather than, say, Rick's Picks, which would've been a brilliant show of support for a great local establishment.Unseduced by the mishmash of other offerings (the waitress described the kitchen's ""traditional caprese salad"" as ""anchovies, roasted red peppers, and ricotta salata"" -- um, caprese = tomato, basil, mozzarella ?!), I went for the day's special of grilled skirt steak with pureed fingerlings and ""a pea shoot salad.""  The serving of steak was small, perhaps 2 to 3 ounces?  The kitchen's loosely arranging it pre-sliced atop the puree seemed an effort to disguise the stinginess.  While cooked to a nice medium rare, the meat had little flavor.  The shavings of summer truffle were dry and completely tasteless, sadly.  The pea shoots were large, tough, and undressed.  They had been scattered around the plate and were still wet from rinsing.  For $32, at another well-rated restaurant in the city, you'd get either three times as much of the same quality or higher quality meat and technique and style.The kimchee rice contained the tiniest, scarcest bits of kimchee.  The waiter who took our order had told us that it ""really tasted like kimchee,"" so we were disappointed.  Btw, what is particularly wonderful about the ""Korean savory pancakes,"" according to this waiter, is that you can't taste the kimchee in them at all.  ""The owner's mother makes kimchee,"" he added.  He seemed to feel the need to make an excuse for the Korean notes on the menu.  Odd and, uh, out of place?In short, our plates were sad and not very flavorful.The waitstaff never asked us how we were enjoying the meal.  When I gently mentioned to the busser that the kimchee rice lacked kimchee, he replied, with indifference, ""Okay.""  Later, the waitress dropped the dessert menu in front of us without a word.  She wasn't visibly miffed, just, again, indifferent.The kitchen is clearly skimping in terms of the quality of its ingredients and, perhaps, the caliber of its staff.  It needs an actual chef.  The service is devoid of the warmth you'd expect from such a cute, cozy spot.The 4-star rating GF currently enjoys just doesn't make sense.  Perhaps locals don't realize what riches Manhattan has to offer at the same price point?  Michelin-starred Aldea, for instance, is a world apart.Please don't go here.  Enjoy a picnic on the Fairway patio or crab legs three stories up at Brooklyn Crab.  Then spring for a bottle of Cacao Prieto's cacao rum or seven-year bourbon, and make a real night of it.As for Steve's excellent Key lime pie, why not just get it from the source?  stevesauthentic.com",2.0
"Good Fork refuses to joke around when it comes to dumplings, apparently. Made a destination-length bike ride to get here. Hunkered down, FAMISHED and ready to scarf plates of Korean food. The dumplings, while a bit pricey at $9, were perhaps the finest I have ever tasted. The wrapping was so thin, the filling so fresh, and the sauce so choice. I followed it up with some sliced steak over Kimchi rice and a fried egg on top. This was not a night devoted to my heart health, but what it was was deliciously medium rare steak on top of lightly spicy kimchi rice, a salad, and a perfectly cooked fried egg. The whole meal was really excellent, and the back porch/room was very cozy for late night diners like ourselves. I will go back and back and back.",5.0

Went to dinner last night and was one of the best times!  I had the Dumplings for appetizer and they were great!  Then had the Lamb Chop special also very good my friends had the short ribs and the steak and eggs everything was so good!!! I will defiantly be back!!!,5.0

"Reason #36 to love Brooklyn- The Good ForkIf there is one thing I would change about The Good Fork, it would be to have smaller forks. If we used smaller utensils it would be more difficult to shove food in our mouths. We'd take smaller bites, nibble, and maybe savor the flavors more. By eating with a smaller fork, I'd hope my meal would last twice as long. A small fork would be a good fork.I forgive The Good Fork for having standard sized utensils. That's normal. I'll even forgive them for their ""award winning dumplings"". I'm sorry but beating out Bobby does not make you the best. I liked the wrapper and the perfect crescent shape but I wasn't convinced with the pork and chive filling or the sauce. I enjoy frozen gyoza better and nothing can beat my California potstickers. Mandoo? Just mandon't at The Good Fork. One of the salad items fresh off the farm may be a better choice for an appetizer. As for entrees, The Good Fork really excelled. I chose the special of the day to compare to Bar Modern (totally fair!) and while The Good Fork did not have the magical wow factor of beet soup, the diver scallops screamed out *tada!* and tasted far better. The scallops were of good size, perfectly pan seared (let's say caramelization together), swimming in mushroom truffle oil and resting on a bed of pureed peas. It was dotted with a fava bean and decorated with a thin fresh potato chip. How's that for gourmet factor?It was hard to say which dish was the best. It's safe to say whether you get seafood, pork, poultry or any other type of meat/veg you will not be disappointed. They're all good in their own special way. The bacon wrapped pork tenderloin was accompanied with rich buttery grits. The greens were nicely reduced and for kicks it came with stewed apples which were so spicy and pungent it gave us sour faces. Definitely innovative. The tender cod was also on a puree with sugar snap peas. It was an ample serving with an outer layer that rivaled the scallops. The key to eating the cod was to layer it with the candied meyer lemon  pieces. I'll just go ahead and say it. O-M-G.The Good Fork is such a good find. Every day sissypoo passes by The Good Fork on the bus ride home. It was a nice treat to be able to actually stop and enjoy what Red Hook has to offer. The restaurant is small and quaint with intimate seating and a nice garden out back. We sat in the middle room in what felt like grandma's house. The decor is old fashioned and we even sat next to an antique record player. The dessert menu looked promising but with an ice cream parlor across the street I was adamant on moseying on over. But if you ever feel compelled to finish off your meal at The Good Fork... the caramel tea flan sure looks scrumptious.",4.0
"Oh how we wanted to adore this place!  Yesterday, on the prowl for a foodie spot after an early evening of gallery hopping in Red Hook, we happened upon the Good Fork's excellent Yelp reviews and quickly determined it a must-eat.  We even forewent cocktails elsewhere and fresh seafood with a waterside view to check out what GF had to deliver.The food was adequate, which just doesn't cut it at GF's prices.  The $14 burger was cooked properly (medium rare, per order) but not left to rest, so it soaked the bottom bun.  Shortcuts abounded: white instead of red onion; little round, cheap, mass-produced plaintain chips rather than housemade -- housemade anything, for that matter (great housemade fries would have been fabulous); and cheap pickles rather than, say, Rick's Picks, which would've been a brilliant show of support for a great local establishment.Unseduced by the mishmash of other offerings (the waitress described the kitchen's ""traditional caprese salad"" as ""anchovies, roasted red peppers, and ricotta salata"" -- um, caprese = tomato, basil, mozzarella ?!), I went for the day's special of grilled skirt steak with pureed fingerlings and ""a pea shoot salad.""  The serving of steak was small, perhaps 2 to 3 ounces?  The kitchen's loosely arranging it pre-sliced atop the puree seemed an effort to disguise the stinginess.  While cooked to a nice medium rare, the meat had little flavor.  The shavings of summer truffle were dry and completely tasteless, sadly.  The pea shoots were large, tough, and undressed.  They had been scattered around the plate and were still wet from rinsing.  For $32, at another well-rated restaurant in the city, you'd get either three times as much of the same quality or higher quality meat and technique and style.The kimchee rice contained the tiniest, scarcest bits of kimchee.  The waiter who took our order had told us that it ""really tasted like kimchee,"" so we were disappointed.  Btw, what is particularly wonderful about the ""Korean savory pancakes,"" according to this waiter, is that you can't taste the kimchee in them at all.  ""The owner's mother makes kimchee,"" he added.  He seemed to feel the need to make an excuse for the Korean notes on the menu.  Odd and, uh, out of place?In short, our plates were sad and not very flavorful.The waitstaff never asked us how we were enjoying the meal.  When I gently mentioned to the busser that the kimchee rice lacked kimchee, he replied, with indifference, ""Okay.""  Later, the waitress dropped the dessert menu in front of us without a word.  She wasn't visibly miffed, just, again, indifferent.The kitchen is clearly skimping in terms of the quality of its ingredients and, perhaps, the caliber of its staff.  It needs an actual chef.  The service is devoid of the warmth you'd expect from such a cute, cozy spot.The 4-star rating GF currently enjoys just doesn't make sense.  Perhaps locals don't realize what riches Manhattan has to offer at the same price point?  Michelin-starred Aldea, for instance, is a world apart.Please don't go here.  Enjoy a picnic on the Fairway patio or crab legs three stories up at Brooklyn Crab.  Then spring for a bottle of Cacao Prieto's cacao rum or seven-year bourbon, and make a real night of it.As for Steve's excellent Key lime pie, why not just get it from the source?  stevesauthentic.com",2.0
"Good Fork refuses to joke around when it comes to dumplings, apparently. Made a destination-length bike ride to get here. Hunkered down, FAMISHED and ready to scarf plates of Korean food. The dumplings, while a bit pricey at $9, were perhaps the finest I have ever tasted. The wrapping was so thin, the filling so fresh, and the sauce so choice. I followed it up with some sliced steak over Kimchi rice and a fried egg on top. This was not a night devoted to my heart health, but what it was was deliciously medium rare steak on top of lightly spicy kimchi rice, a salad, and a perfectly cooked fried egg. The whole meal was really excellent, and the back porch/room was very cozy for late night diners like ourselves. I will go back and back and back.",5.0
"Really yummy food! I went with a large group for dinner and we got the nice table in the garden area under the tent-thing.

This may have been the best duck I have ever had.  And oh my god, the steak & eggs korean style was incredible.  The kimchi rice served with it was perfect.  I would eat this entree every day.  Seriously, I would.We ordered sorbet for dessert and the restaurant sent out the dulce de leche and pasilla pepper ice cream on the house since it was my boyfriend's birthday.  We were so appreciative of the restaurant's kindness.  The sorbet and ice cream were both delicious.",5.0

"The Good Fork is a special staple in the ever-evolving neighborhood of Red Hook. Every time I've been here the food has been spot-on without a single complaint to be heard. I've never been for brunch (I prefer the less-crowded Kevin's a little further up Van Brunt) but this is one of my favorite dinner spots. The menu offers a really creative mix of American and Korean foods-- the Korean steak and eggs (which can be substituted for tofu), mussels and kimchee rice are really to die for. I am actually in awe of how good the rice is and I've never been able to replicate it. The interior of the restaurant is a little ""cozy"" (its modeled after a dining train car) and dark, but the backyard is a real jewel. They also have an awesome bathroom, which these days is a standout.

They informed me that they don't take reservations but they were really cool and wrote down my name and number and said they would try to accommodate me because I had called in advance. A few days later they actually called me up and told me that they decided to take reservations for mothers day and remembered that I had wanted a table for 12:30 and that I had that reservation if I still wanted it.

"We went as a Birthday surprise for my husband. The host staff was wonderful in helping me completely blind-side him - as he had no idea we were going here. We live in Red Hook, it was dead of Winter (post-really-big-storm) and he thought we were just out for a walk. **Hee Hee**Needless to say, even while this is a ""nice"" place, we came in way underdressed and they were welcoming regardless of our wearing snow-boots and down jackets (and of course, my goofy all-the-rage lioness hat, complete with ears, huge nose and whiskers. AND, oh yeah . . . jiggly eye-balls too.)The place was packed - and it's pretty tiny and narrow. I was a little disappointed, as even though I'd made a (secret) reservation, we had a bit of a second rate table . . . a little too much in the path of Serving Staff, and at the intersection near the tiny back end bar. Lots of foot traffic . . .Still - we were glowing in the fact that I'd successfully surprised him for his birthday and were excited to celebrate together. We ordered wine and starters - followed by main dishes. Honestly - both were fairly good. BUT - honestly again a combination of things somehow didn't quite ""Wow"" us, or even ""almost Wow"" us. The food was good (not wow), our Waiter was rushed and overly busy with other tables (we felt the energy), the food servings are the ""tiny"" type you get at more ""expensive"" place and we had a crappy seat even while we had a reservation.We live 5 blocks away, and we've never been back in 4 years - not because it was a horrible experience (it was not horrible, it was actually ""just okay."") - BUT, because it was ""just okay"" and for the price, we'd rather have great.Quite possibly the menu, staff, environment, etc would all be better if we returned - after all it was only one a one shot experience . . .  so, to be fair I'd have given it 3.5 stars if yelp allowed.",3.0

There is a list of house specialty drinks and fairly short menu. a decent wine list Is offered in addition. There were three of us for an appetizer I ordered roast brussels sprouts. Brussel sprouts are a test vegetable if nothing else. These sprouts came out sweet and tasty and then to your recommended list. I ordered the chicken which was better than Costco's.  One friend ordered the codfish. Perfect!   His squeeze ordered steak and eggs a strange dish for dinner, but it is one of the most popular dishes on the menu. While we were there we saw three orders come out. The key lime pie was excellent,Harry a moody",5.0
Great food but pricey for the small portions given. Pancake is totally an Americanized version but still really good. The home made ravioli was good too but you only get 5 for $20. Be prepared to spend about $100 for two ppl if you want to walk out feeling full.,3.0
"The Good Fork is a special staple in the ever-evolving neighborhood of Red Hook. Every time I've been here the food has been spot-on without a single complaint to be heard. I've never been for brunch (I prefer the less-crowded Kevin's a little further up Van Brunt) but this is one of my favorite dinner spots. The menu offers a really creative mix of American and Korean foods-- the Korean steak and eggs (which can be substituted for tofu), mussels and kimchee rice are really to die for. I am actually in awe of how good the rice is and I've never been able to replicate it. The interior of the restaurant is a little ""cozy"" (its modeled after a dining train car) and dark, but the backyard is a real jewel. They also have an awesome bathroom, which these days is a standout. As a vegetarian I sometimes get the shaft at small, local establishments with super talented chefs, but The Good Fork always delivers. I just wish it accommodated larger crowds so I could bring all of my friends!",5.0
"Built by the husband, chefed by he wife, this place is really one of a kind. Chef Sohui Kim's seasonal flare combines classic techniques with global ingredients to create comforting and inventive food. The steak and eggs with kimchi rice is pleasing to the palate. The duck breast with port wine reduction is my all time FAV. The oyster PO boy dumplings are sinful. Try the new American wave with a Korean undertoe.",4.0
"An outlier in this neighborhood and a gem - friendly, welcoming and relaxed.  Went for brunch with the parents, and it was a nice slow, friendly meal!  We didn't know about the outdoor patio, and would have elected to sit outside since it was a nice spring day with lots of sun.My parents each had the salad and anchovy toast (an acquired taste, from their background growing up in a british colony) and said it was great.  I had the huevos rancheros, which was a good meal - the beans seemed a little different somehow, and I would have it again (but would switch to the bibim bap for diversity!).Coffee was nice and always in supply.Other patrons were friendly too - something we all remarked on, having driven in from the big mean city:)",5.0
"Came here for dinner with a small group. Pleasantly seated within 10 minutes of our reservation.  I had the summer squash appetizer and the Korean steak & eggs.  Both were knockouts. The blood orange margarita was excellent. Highly recommend.

"Took the family (of five) here for mothers day brunch and we literally ordered 12 items to share. The dumplings were so good we had to get five more orders!The vibe of this place is also really cool (it is very brooklyn). If you make a reservation make sure to request the back patio area it really takes the experience to a whole new level. The thing I really wanted to give props to the good fork about is the amazing service.You see they don't usually do reservations for brunch, but I had called in and asked regarding mothers day due to the madness that mothers day brunch is. They informed me that they don't take reservations but they were really cool and wrote down my name and number and said they would try to accommodate me because I had called in advance. A few days later they actually called me up and told me that they decided to take reservations for mothers day and remembered that I had wanted a table for 12:30 and that I had that reservation if I still wanted it. So cool.Anyways here we go:Food 5Atmosphere 4.5Service 5(out of fives)",5.0
"We went as a Birthday surprise for my husband. The host staff was wonderful in helping me completely blind-side him - as he had no idea we were going here. We live in Red Hook, it was dead of Winter (post-really-big-storm) and he thought we were just out for a walk. **Hee Hee**Needless to say, even while this is a ""nice"" place, we came in way underdressed and they were welcoming regardless of our wearing snow-boots and down jackets (and of course, my goofy all-the-rage lioness hat, complete with ears, huge nose and whiskers. AND, oh yeah . . . jiggly eye-balls too.)The place was packed - and it's pretty tiny and narrow. I was a little disappointed, as even though I'd made a (secret) reservation, we had a bit of a second rate table . . . a little too much in the path of Serving Staff, and at the intersection near the tiny back end bar. Lots of foot traffic . . .Still - we were glowing in the fact that I'd successfully surprised him for his birthday and were excited to celebrate together. We ordered wine and starters - followed by main dishes. Honestly - both were fairly good. BUT - honestly again a combination of things somehow didn't quite ""Wow"" us, or even ""almost Wow"" us. The food was good (not wow), our Waiter was rushed and overly busy with other tables (we felt the energy), the food servings are the ""tiny"" type you get at more ""expensive"" place and we had a crappy seat even while we had a reservation.We live 5 blocks away, and we've never been back in 4 years - not because it was a horrible experience (it was not horrible, it was actually ""just okay."") - BUT, because it was ""just okay"" and for the price, we'd rather have great.Quite possibly the menu, staff, environment, etc would all be better if we returned - after all it was only one a one shot experience . . .  so, to be fair I'd have given it 3.5 stars if yelp allowed.",3.0
"Mad props to Irene Y. for recommending this place =D  It's totally out in the middle of nowhere (ie. Red Hook), but absolutely worth the journey out there.  The dumplings were FANTASTIC and not at all what you'd expect upon first glance - tender meat and flavor that really stood out.  I've had literally hundreds of Chinese dumplings from several places in Manhattan Chinatown, SF Chinatown, etc. and though tasty, they just don't quite compare.  The Korean Steak and Eggs was also crazy delicious, namely the steak =D  Grilled to perfection and so rare and goooooooood!  Service was exceptional, ambiance is indeed romantic, and I'd also recommend Good Fork for a great date venue.Ahh dumplings + steak = mad win!",5.0

I actually really don't like ordering this dish in any restaurant because it is really the best when made at home and eaten straight out of the frying pan. But this version was really good! The skirt steak was really tender and there was enough kimchi in there to make it really a kimchi ""boggeumbap"" or kimchi fried rice.Dumplings - The chef said that she originally wanted to put this item on rotation but people kept asking for it so she could never take it off. It's the version I make at home too - really meaty and yet light. They pan fry it until just the right amount of browning. Definitely recommend trying it.Mains:Apple-braised Wild Boar Shank - something that looks like it came out of the Flintstones, this GIANT piece of meat was so tender it just fell right off the bone. The pickled apples cut through the meatiness of the boar and the bacon, and the creamy grits and mustard green gave a nice sort of sauce to the whole dish.Gnocchi - perfectly fluffy and light! It looked like such a simple dish but I guess that's really the mark of a great chef. Seared Duck Breast - I think I prefer mine a little rarer but it was still really good.

"""The Good Fork"" is an understatement.  How about ""The best forkful of food I've ever brought to my mouth?""It's sad, but I only usually go to Red Hook to stock up before a party at Fairway or to get a piece of cheap, unassembled Swedish furniture.  But last night, the hubs and I made the trip just to eat at The Good Fork.  It's a tiny space, but we were able to sit at the bar for about 15 minutes and peruse the menu while we waited for a seat.  I had a very good glass of rose, which led to another.  The bartender was cheerful and the assortment of oddments at the bar kept us entertained while we decided what to eat.  We started with the spring pea croquettes, which looked like falafel, but were made out of peas and flavored with a variety of Indian spices.  With creamy labne to dip them in, they were amazingly delicious.  The hubs ordered a special, a harissa-marinaded buffalo steak, while I opted for the gnocchi with mushrooms.  It was amazing how every bite of our food was so wonderful.  Best of all, the international flavor infusions were so subtle that it kept us guessing.  There was a faint hint of lemongrass in the asparagus cream sauce that lightly coated my gnocchi, and it took me at least ten minutes to figure that out.  It was really refreshing to have a little global fusion in my haute cuisine again. We wrapped up with a delicious slice of Steve's key lime pie that totally exploded my taste buds. And yet, The Good Fork is totally unpretentious and not too pricey.  I can't wait to go back on a less-rainy night so we can eat on the back patio.  If you're stressed out after a day of looking for all those parts to your new SNORDGREN dresser, I would highly recommend repairing to The Good Fork for what might just be the best meal of your life.",5.0
A visit to Brooklyn for the weekend. A friend took myself and my husband here for dinner. From the moment we walked in the door the atmosphere was alive with a cool vibe. We sat at the four seat bar and had a drink. The bartender had personality . Within 15 minutes we were taken outside to the garden patio. PERFECT !   The service ...food...wine...ambience. It has it all. A few details were missing but everything else made up for it.  I give it a five star for the attitude of the work staff.,5.0
"My friend and I came here for brunch on a Saturday around 11:00 and there was no wait to be seated. We sat outside in their very cute garden area. As the hostess was seating us she pointed out that there were cans of Off all around in case we started getting bit by mosquitos! My first thought was ""I hope people don't start spraying that stuff while I'm eating!"".  Luckily no one did, however, my friend was wearing a short skirt and had bites all over her legs by the time we left, so we probably should have used it!I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with Chilaqulies with poached eggs and no pork . It was really delicious, except my poached eggs were cooked solid all the way through. I would definitely eat that dish again, but would make sure my eggs were properly cooked. My friend ordered the bibimbap which she enjoyed.I was in the mood for dessert after seeing chocolate bread pudding on their menu, so I ordered that. However, I was very disappointed because it had raisins in it! The menu did not say that it contained raisins which I think is a very important piece of information to leave out, as I would not have ordered this if I had known; and I think there are many people who feel the same way about raisins!The service was very nice and friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive considering there weren't very many other tables. When our food came out we ordered drinks and my friend asked for extra sauce for her dish; we didn't get the drinks until we were just about done with our meals and my friend told the waitress to not bother with the extra sauce at that point.Their brunch menu has a wide variety of food--basic brunch, Mexican, Korean, Southern, Asian, burgers!  Overall, it was a nice and delicious brunch experience and I would definitely return here.",4.0

"My only experience with the food here is through their outpost at the Brooklyn Flea. I knew not of their history on the Food Network, and if did I might have gone with the dumplings. But instead, I was excited to see New Orleans food at a stall and ordered an oyster po'boy. Now, this sandwich was not a po'boy. Po'boys are made on a particular type of French bread that you either have to make yourself or import from the two companies that make it in NOLA. This was on some sort of teensy, brioche-like roll. And while it was topped with pickled onions and remoulade, it was also not an oyster sandwich--it was catfish. By the time I figured it out, it was too late to return it and get the right order. Also, I saw this place making sandwiches with slices of packaged white bread. That is not okay. Seriously. For any reason.So, whatever you want to call that sandwich, it was good. The fish was juicy, the pickled onions nice, and the remoulade tasty. But it was not what I ordered, and it was smaller than my fist.",3.0
"Let me begin by saying that I've had many great dinners at The Good Fork. I love the atmosphere and I find the staff to be a good group. But the 3-star rating (instead of 5) comes from the brunch I just had. I know they just started brunch service, but it was way off the mark. The huevos rancheros were really bad. And they were 11 dollars. Why were the chips covered in sauce and soggy? Why were the black beans pureed (aka pre-chewed)? It didn't work. I might suggest replacing this item on the menu with something that's up to your usual, high standards. To top it off, the brunch portions were too small. I had to get a bagel on the way home, because I was hungry. I'll stick with dinner for now.",3.0
"The Good Fork is a small neighborhood resto in Brooklyn's Red Hook district serving modern American cuisine with a distinct Korean flare. On the whole, this is a perfect local spot: Very small, very intimate, and features good service at pretty reasonable prices.For my appetizer I had the much-discussed dumplings. In addition to a very healthy portion size (5 dumplings/plate), this dish largely delivered from a flavor perspective: The pork-and-chive filling, combined with the scented soy dipping sauce, made for a classic flavor combination that didn't go too far outside of the box in terms of adventurousness,  but nonetheless delivered on execution. My one issue with the dish though was textural: The dumplings could have used a more thorough pan-fry before being served to add a bit of textural contrast (very one-noted in this regard, it was evident that they had only been steamed, which made the dough a little mushy).For my main I had the duck breast with lentil salad. The duck itself was cooked perfectly medium rare, and featured extra crispy skin that added a nice bit of textural contrast - full marks. The lentil salad (primary side dish) was slightly acidic for my taste, and frankly just wasn't substantial enough for my liking. The grilled scallions tasted as grilled scallions should, but again were sufficiently lacking in substance such that I still had room for desert... not a huge tragedy I suppose.For desert I had the chocolate bread pudding, which was absolutely fantastic. It had a lightness to it that was very welcome (and somewhat surprising, given some of the other bread puddings I've had), yet it still managed to be rich and decadent enough to qualify as a true desert. 5/5 on the desert front.I often say that when rating restaurants, looking at food quality alone can be misleading: Instead, the ratio of food quality to price must be considered. In this context, the Good Fork delivers and is a great bet for dinner any day of the week.",4.0
"Although the food was great here, the service was absolutely terrible. When we arrived, the restaurant was not busy at all. We made awkward eye contact with the waitress a number of times hoping to get seated, but no such luck. It took us a while to get someone's attention (a nice man who may or may not have been the manager). When we ordered, we asked for the bacon jam for the burger to be served separately, as I don't eat bacon but my dining partner does. The food came maybe 40 minutes later and the burger had....bacon jam. I asked the waitress about this and she was incredibly rude about it, and asked if I wanted them to scrape the jam off or to make a new burger. When she brought the new burger a while later, she kind of tossed the plate on the table without making eye contact with us and left.

"My friends that live out on Brooklyn took me to this place about a year ago.  Very small, quaint place that probably seats around 30 people at most.  Since it is located in Brooklyn, taking a cab ride out from Manhattan probably isn't the best of ideas.  It could cost you anywhere from $20 - $30, so hopefully you're renting, taking locale transpo or you have friends that drive.  And of course if you live there, nevermind, he he he.  (I am merely the occasional NY traveller).  Pretty easily overlooked, I missed it twice when I drove there in my rental.  Everything on the menu from the kimchee rice to the steak and eggs is very good, but most people come out to try a certain item; the dumplings, which are awesome.  My friends told me they were featured on a Food Network show, but I never saw it...but after trying them, they are really good.Prices...when I go to NYC, I'm already expecting to spend $$$, and the Good Fork is no different.  Dinner for my two friends and I ended up being about $145, but that included drinks, our entrees, dessert, and of course, the dumplings.  The waitstaff is great there.  They went through the entire menu for me and described what their favorites to me because I was pretty indecisive about what I wanted to get.   I would definitely go back, and I would definitely recommend to a friend....",4.0
"""The Good Fork"" is an understatement.  How about ""The best forkful of food I've ever brought to my mouth?""It's sad, but I only usually go to Red Hook to stock up before a party at Fairway or to get a piece of cheap, unassembled Swedish furniture.  But last night, the hubs and I made the trip just to eat at The Good Fork.  It's a tiny space, but we were able to sit at the bar for about 15 minutes and peruse the menu while we waited for a seat.  I had a very good glass of rose, which led to another.  The bartender was cheerful and the assortment of oddments at the bar kept us entertained while we decided what to eat.  We started with the spring pea croquettes, which looked like falafel, but were made out of peas and flavored with a variety of Indian spices.  With creamy labne to dip them in, they were amazingly delicious.  The hubs ordered a special, a harissa-marinaded buffalo steak, while I opted for the gnocchi with mushrooms.  It was amazing how every bite of our food was so wonderful.  Best of all, the international flavor infusions were so subtle that it kept us guessing.  There was a faint hint of lemongrass in the asparagus cream sauce that lightly coated my gnocchi, and it took me at least ten minutes to figure that out.  It was really refreshing to have a little global fusion in my haute cuisine again. We wrapped up with a delicious slice of Steve's key lime pie that totally exploded my taste buds. And yet, The Good Fork is totally unpretentious and not too pricey.  I can't wait to go back on a less-rainy night so we can eat on the back patio.  If you're stressed out after a day of looking for all those parts to your new SNORDGREN dresser, I would highly recommend repairing to The Good Fork for what might just be the best meal of your life.",5.0
A visit to Brooklyn for the weekend. A friend took myself and my husband here for dinner. From the moment we walked in the door the atmosphere was alive with a cool vibe. We sat at the four seat bar and had a drink. The bartender had personality . Within 15 minutes we were taken outside to the garden patio. PERFECT !   The service ...food...wine...ambience. It has it all. A few details were missing but everything else made up for it.  I give it a five star for the attitude of the work staff.,5.0
"My friend and I came here for brunch on a Saturday around 11:00 and there was no wait to be seated. We sat outside in their very cute garden area. As the hostess was seating us she pointed out that there were cans of Off all around in case we started getting bit by mosquitos! My first thought was ""I hope people don't start spraying that stuff while I'm eating!"".  Luckily no one did, however, my friend was wearing a short skirt and had bites all over her legs by the time we left, so we probably should have used it!I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with Chilaqulies with poached eggs and no pork . It was really delicious, except my poached eggs were cooked solid all the way through. I would definitely eat that dish again, but would make sure my eggs were properly cooked. My friend ordered the bibimbap which she enjoyed.I was in the mood for dessert after seeing chocolate bread pudding on their menu, so I ordered that. However, I was very disappointed because it had raisins in it! The menu did not say that it contained raisins which I think is a very important piece of information to leave out, as I would not have ordered this if I had known; and I think there are many people who feel the same way about raisins!The service was very nice and friendly, but could have been a bit more attentive considering there weren't very many other tables. When our food came out we ordered drinks and my friend asked for extra sauce for her dish; we didn't get the drinks until we were just about done with our meals and my friend told the waitress to not bother with the extra sauce at that point.Their brunch menu has a wide variety of food--basic brunch, Mexican, Korean, Southern, Asian, burgers!  Overall, it was a nice and delicious brunch experience and I would definitely return here.",4.0

This place is great! I love the crispy tofu and egg which is placed over Kimchee rice. All the flavors work nicely together. Also had a roasted beet salad with tasty goat cheese fritters-not greasy.Can be noisy in the front room.,5.0
"My only experience with the food here is through their outpost at the Brooklyn Flea. I knew not of their history on the Food Network, and if did I might have gone with the dumplings. But instead, I was excited to see New Orleans food at a stall and ordered an oyster po'boy. Now, this sandwich was not a po'boy. Po'boys are made on a particular type of French bread that you either have to make yourself or import from the two companies that make it in NOLA. This was on some sort of teensy, brioche-like roll. And while it was topped with pickled onions and remoulade, it was also not an oyster sandwich--it was catfish. By the time I figured it out, it was too late to return it and get the right order. Also, I saw this place making sandwiches with slices of packaged white bread. That is not okay. Seriously. For any reason.So, whatever you want to call that sandwich, it was good. The fish was juicy, the pickled onions nice, and the remoulade tasty. But it was not what I ordered, and it was smaller than my fist.",3.0
"Let me begin by saying that I've had many great dinners at The Good Fork. I love the atmosphere and I find the staff to be a good group. But the 3-star rating (instead of 5) comes from the brunch I just had. I know they just started brunch service, but it was way off the mark. The huevos rancheros were really bad. And they were 11 dollars. Why were the chips covered in sauce and soggy? Why were the black beans pureed (aka pre-chewed)? It didn't work. I might suggest replacing this item on the menu with something that's up to your usual, high standards. To top it off, the brunch portions were too small. I had to get a bagel on the way home, because I was hungry. I'll stick with dinner for now.",3.0
"The Good Fork is a small neighborhood resto in Brooklyn's Red Hook district serving modern American cuisine with a distinct Korean flare. On the whole, this is a perfect local spot: Very small, very intimate, and features good service at pretty reasonable prices.For my appetizer I had the much-discussed dumplings. In addition to a very healthy portion size (5 dumplings/plate), this dish largely delivered from a flavor perspective: The pork-and-chive filling, combined with the scented soy dipping sauce, made for a classic flavor combination that didn't go too far outside of the box in terms of adventurousness,  but nonetheless delivered on execution. My one issue with the dish though was textural: The dumplings could have used a more thorough pan-fry before being served to add a bit of textural contrast (very one-noted in this regard, it was evident that they had only been steamed, which made the dough a little mushy).For my main I had the duck breast with lentil salad. The duck itself was cooked perfectly medium rare, and featured extra crispy skin that added a nice bit of textural contrast - full marks. The lentil salad (primary side dish) was slightly acidic for my taste, and frankly just wasn't substantial enough for my liking. The grilled scallions tasted as grilled scallions should, but again were sufficiently lacking in substance such that I still had room for desert... not a huge tragedy I suppose.For desert I had the chocolate bread pudding, which was absolutely fantastic. It had a lightness to it that was very welcome (and somewhat surprising, given some of the other bread puddings I've had), yet it still managed to be rich and decadent enough to qualify as a true desert. 5/5 on the desert front.I often say that when rating restaurants, looking at food quality alone can be misleading: Instead, the ratio of food quality to price must be considered. In this context, the Good Fork delivers and is a great bet for dinner any day of the week.",4.0
"Although the food was great here, the service was absolutely terrible. When we arrived, the restaurant was not busy at all. We made awkward eye contact with the waitress a number of times hoping to get seated, but no such luck. It took us a while to get someone's attention (a nice man who may or may not have been the manager). When we ordered, we asked for the bacon jam for the burger to be served separately, as I don't eat bacon but my dining partner does. The food came maybe 40 minutes later and the burger had....bacon jam. I asked the waitress about this and she was incredibly rude about it, and asked if I wanted them to scrape the jam off or to make a new burger. When she brought the new burger a while later, she kind of tossed the plate on the table without making eye contact with us and left. It was a disappointing experience and made the food less enjoyable. I'm sure not all the wait staff here is like this, but we just happened to experience two of their worst.",2.0

I just started eating meat again after a 7 year break and the lamb bolognese at The Good Fork is the second meal I've had since crossing back over. it did not disappoint one bit... sooo delicious and didn't make me feel sick at all! all the ingredients used are consciously selected (i.e. all vegetables come from Red Hook's own Added Value Farm just around the corner) and fresh!finished the meal off with a slice of Steve's Key Lime Pie... and that was so good that our table ordered another slice to share! definitely worth the trek out to Red Hook for this place!,5.0
"I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. I recently went here for a friend's birthday party and we had the dining area in the back. Loved the decor--it's very quaint and cozy.The food is also delicious. We had most of the appetizers. The ""dumplings"" are very good, although they resemble potstickers more than their bulbous counterpart dumplings. I'd say the dumpling meat was on the sweet side--definitely a contrast to the salty and savory dumplings you'd find at, say, Eton in Carroll Garden. Still very good. I thought the crab cake appetizer was prepared very well with a delicately crispy coasting and fresh, sweet crab meat inside. Their sauteed sweetbread was good (yummy, thymus glands!!), but not mind blowing. And their panko-crusted prawns (like breaded shrimp) was not overwhelmingly heavy; surprisingly light.For my entree, I had the red snapper which was superb! I ate the entire thing and the portion was on the big side (it was oddly bigger than the chicken entree my boyfriend ordered). The snapper, which was juicy and not overcooked at all, came with grilled cauliflower and mizuna (which is ""similar to/like baby arugula"") in a hazelnut-truffle sauce. Doesn't that sound delicious? It was! I loved the sweetness of the caramelized cauliflower against the fish and the bitter, herby mizuna.The roast chicken entree was alright--it's difficult to fancy up roast chicken but I thought The Good Fork make a valiant effort. The braised leeks, mash and ""black bean sauce"" (if you could call it that) failed to all come together for a memorable dish however. The portion was also surprisingly small.I also tried some of the risotto which is VERY good. And I also ate someone's leftover linguine carbonara (what a glutton, right?). While I thought the pasta itself was good (which seemed more like a ribbony egg noodle than linguine), the carbonara sauce w/ bacon, arugula, sage and parmigiano failed to impress me. And I LOVE spaghetti carbonara.Out of all the dishes I tried that night, I failed to see how the food could be considered French-Korean fusion. The place did have a very good variety of foods and flavors however. My boyfriend promised me he'd bring me back so I can try the ""steak & eggs"" Korean style (aka the grilled skirt steak, fried eggs and kimchi fried rice entree), but it might be a while before I can get my taste buds on that. Red Hook is a little off the beaten path for us, but I'll be sure to visit The Good Fork again next time I'm in the 'hood.Also, their service is wonderful! It's a great place to have a small birthday dinner/gathering if you're in the area.",4.0
"I went here recently for my sister's  birthday and since then I have not been able to stop thinking about the dumplings and the crabcakes!!! The dumplings were amazing... perfect skin and delicious filling. The texture was different than what I am used to when it comes to dumplings. The crabcakes were ridiculous... full of plump crabmeat with just the right amount of breadcrumb to stay together. These two items were the highlights of the meal and for that alone it gets 4 stars.So why not 5 stars?My entree was meh. I ordered the Korean steak and eggs and it might be because I have Korean food from Korean restaurants on a regular basis but it was absolutely nothing that I couldn't either make at home or get for way cheaper in Manhattan Koreatown. The steak was seasoned with kalbi flavoring and that was served over somewhat bland kimchi fried rice. A sunnyside egg (or was it poached? i can't remember) sat on top with a little arugula salad on the side. I mean, i finished it, but I wouldn't order it again.I also tried my sister's skate dish and that was a lot more unique and delicious. All of my other friends seemed to enjoy their dishes and our dessert of apple tart with vanilla ice cream and key lime pie was a good way to end the meal.Service was good, not great. Our waiter seemed a little hoity. Decor was cute. The place is really small and dark and had a very mismatched-homey-kind of feel, especially the back garden area. There was an old record player on which we could play their random (and often deformed) records.I would come back here often if it weren't for the crazy trek to get over here.

"We went on a cold Sunday night in early February for the prix fixe dinner. We had a two-fer Groupon, and not only were the staff totally cool about that, but didn't mind at all when I called back to change the reso from a week earlier. The coupon got us an $80 meal for $50 plus drinks, tax and tip.The place is on Van Brunt, which I'd never been to before. It has a very cool, understated feel, the kind of hood you want to come back and explore when it's not freezing and dark. The restaurant itself feels like a railway car, with wood panelling and needlepoint art and about 25 seats total. There are two super cozy booths right at the front on either side of the door, in one of which a couple sat feeding each other and making out for most of the evening. The waitstaff the night we were there were all dudes, reminding me of old-school fancy places from the 80s but these guys had beards and/or cute little leather hats. Friendly enough. I was a bit surprised that they couldn't accommodate my request for a Bloody Mary, which, granted, wasn't on the menu. So we started with some cocktails, a gin mojito-type thing and a blood orange margarita, both around $10-$12. Yum. Then we dove into the menu for our three courses, opting out of the specials that the server told us we could get for a couple bucks extra. The menu has a slightly Korean feel which we loved. I considered the kimchee pastry and the fried oyster cauliflower soup but ultimately went for the crabcake for my appetizer; it came with a fennel slaw and a yummy spicy sauce. My date had the roasted brussel sprout salad which was also amazing, with some kind of sexed-up bacon garnish. The wine list was interesting and long enough; I noticed some NY State wines on there but we weren't getting a bottle so I went for a basic pinot noir, which was just fine, about $10. For the mains I had the steak with kimchee rice and fried egg, and my man had the duck. I am not a duck fan (too fatty), but he loved it. The steak was actually medium (not rare like New Yorkers mean when they say ""medium"") and the rice was very good, I've been making a variation at home since. Dessert was flourless chocolate cake for me and pecan pie for him, with the richest, thickest dollop of whipped cream (think British High Tea with clotted cream) on the side.

"I've been waiting to try this place for years ever since i read about it in New York magazine. Generally I love anything with some kind of Korean influence, it's usually subtle and very well done.The host had told us that we had to wait about 30 minutes and it almost deterred my husband from going. I finally managed to convince him and I am SO glad that we waited. The place was small so we had to wait outside, inconveniences aside, the host was very gracious and conscious of us and checked in with us all the time until we got seated.The meal that ensued was just as delectable as the service.  I ordered an squid salad which was light, well balanced with the right amount of acidity.

"Pretty good place. Saw that the owner make dumplings that kicked Bobby Flay's butt on Throwdown on The Food Network so I decided to come down and give it a try. The dumplings are very good, the chicken dish with mashed potatoes are also amazing.

"Really good slow food with hints of Asian/European influence without going far enough to warrant the ad nauseum title of ""fusion.""  The Asian influence dishes maintain their influence exclusively from the European ones.  For instance, the skirt steak with kim chee fried rice is not mixed with their gnocchi dish. The dumplings with pork and chive isn't instead filled with grouper.  I got their prix-fixe meal which came with a starter, entree, and dessert.  I had their special starter which was a grouper with sauteed onion, jicama, and pear served on top of a crepe--definitely the best part of my meal and could have been the entree.  The flavors were good and complemented each other.  I went with the braised pork belly on top of beans as my second dish--very flavorful, but nothing to write home about.  And for dessert I had the tea flan on top of a raspberry reduction.  Definitely a nice quaint find in Red Hook.  Too bad it's so hard to get into Red Hook otherwise I'd probably visit this place more often.  The atmosphere and food is very similar to a lot of the newer start-up slow food restaurants like The Farm out in Ditmas Park and Cheryl's Global Soul in Prospect Heights.",4.0

"After watching The Good Fork featured on the Food Network couple years back, it has always been on my Yelp ""to-try"" list. So, couple of weeks ago, the BF and I finally headed over to see what it's made of. We were pretty hungry, so decided to try out a few starters (korean pancake and dumplings), but to our disappointment, they were both just mediocre, at best. However, the saving grace of the night was the steak and eggs. Well marinated short rib over kimchi rice topped with a sunny-side up egg. Hearty, delicious, and really hit the spot.",3.0
"I love this place but the maitre d can get a little snippy if its crowded--which it often is. Killer wine list, reasonably priced. When I was there, we had squash blossoms, fried and stuffed with crab meat. Beautiful. So tasty. Also, house made dumplings were the shit. I had short ribs, some people I were with had roast chicken (awesome, French train station style). We didn't have dessert so technically the meal hasn't yet ended--I have to go back!",4.0

"I've been waiting to try this place for years ever since i read about it in New York magazine. Generally I love anything with some kind of Korean influence, it's usually subtle and very well done.The host had told us that we had to wait about 30 minutes and it almost deterred my husband from going. I finally managed to convince him and I am SO glad that we waited. The place was small so we had to wait outside, inconveniences aside, the host was very gracious and conscious of us and checked in with us all the time until we got seated.The meal that ensued was just as delectable as the service.  I ordered an squid salad which was light, well balanced with the right amount of acidity. My husband had a short rib dish which he LOVED. It was tender and tasty. The ambiance of this place is really great.It's warm, inviting,whimsical and very romantic.

"One of the best pork chops I've ever had in my life was at Good Fork several months back during dinner. Last week I stopped in for brunch and ordered the chicken and waffles. It was good as well, but not great. The chicken was not crispy and the skin wasn't flavorful. It must have been fried ahead of time and left to sit and get a bit limp. It wasn't awful by any stretch, but I was expecting to be taken to the realm of crazy delicious after my first meal there. The waffle was ok as well. I make great waffles at home, so I'm often disappointed by restaurant waffles, pancakes and such.  It was a step above meh, but not by much overall. I think they should fry the chicken to order or use a better recipe that oozes flavor and crispness even if left out or stuck in the oven for a refresh before plating. Props to the staff, who were on point and very accommodating of our needs to sit by the lone window seat so that we could keep an eye on our mutt. Added props to the tall, handsome beardy server, who did not serve us directly, but gave us visual entertainment from afar.",3.0
"We could have not possibly picked a better day to go to The Good Fork. After getting off the train, walked for more than half hour in a possibly 95 degree pre-storm humid weather. Just when we thought we might never get there, there it was, in the middle of a quiet block. If it wasn't for the well known reputation, this could truly be qualified as a hidden gem. After the food came, all the complaining about the journey getting here magically turned into raving about the deliciousness of the dishes. Since there were five of us, we had the luxury of trying multiple items on the menu. I wasn't so crazy about the mussel. There was not enough garlic or butter to cover up the sea flavor for me. However, the po'boy was fantastic! For entrees, I highly recommend the chicken. It's the next best chicken, second to Jean-George. Buttery crispy skin, succulent tender meat, with shitaki on the side soaking in all the sauce. The salmon was cooked with perfection. I was not a big fan of the bean puree as bedding, but the picked tomato added a kick in the flavor department. The pork belly had a very remarkable taste. Not the healthiest choice, but what's the use of health when you can't taste good food, right? The steak and egg with kimchee rice was too Americanized according to my Korean friends, but it's a good choice if you want a hint of kimchee without the overwhelming garlic aftertaste in your mouth. All in all, I was impressed with the restaurant. Cozy decor, friendly service, yummy food, and good company. I will go back again, but I will probably drive there next time.",4.0
"I can't really rate this place seeing that I never got to eat there. As you can see by the description it's not kid friendly. I've worked in the restaurant business for a long time.

"It pains me to give the Good Fork anything less than five stars. I have seen this place grow up -- I was there the first day it opened, I used to go a few times a week, but I moved out of the neighbourhood in 2008 and had not been back until April 2010.The place has changed. The owner and his wife used to double team: Ben was the host up front, while his wife Sohui was the chef in the back. Sohui tinged the menu with her Korean heritage -- a lot of traditional American dishes were slightly permuted, giving the menu a lot of interest and zest. Everything was comfortable yet innovative: a perfect match between comfort food and fine dining.Flash-forward to 2010. Ben and Sohui were nowhere to be found, as they recently had child number two. Fantastic for them, less than great for the Good Fork. The front of house staff manage very well. They are attentive, kind, warm, and more than willing to go out of their way to help you. As soon as you sit down, that is. The fame/infamy of this place has made it all but impossible to get a table in any decent time scale, even for those who live in the neighbourhood. It is also impossible to get a reservation for a table for two on the weekend, because they no longer accept them. On the back end, the menu has changed. A couple of the favourites are still there, like the dumplings and the steak and eggs (or my favourite, the tofu and eggs). But many other staples are gone, like the chicken with mashed potatoes and endives. The other dishes on the menu were good, but lacking in cohesion. The new duck dish was delicious, but was hardly a replacement for the chicken dish.The wine and drink menu has also changed significantly since the departure of the bartender, St John, who opened a restaurant and bare up the block called Fort Defiance. The delicious Dark and Stormy is off the menu, much to my chagrin. But it has shown up at Fort Defiance in an even more delicious iteration with spicy ginger beer.The Good Fork is still an amazing restaurant. It's just lost a bit of its lustre with age. Fortunately, the damage is not fatal. But be forewarned before making the trek out.",4.0

"I can't even deal with how delicious this place was. My BF and I had access to a car for the weekend and decided to check out the little spots on Van Brundt st.  It was one of these ridiculously hot days where even standing outside was unbearable.

"As a reward for dogsitting my friends' two incredibly easy-to-care-for little dogs, my friends decided to treat me to a dinner at Good Fork.  For about a month we tried to schedule a time when all three of us would be available, and finally we made it to the restaurant this past Sunday.We drove from Queens to Red Hook.  This was the first time I've been to Red Hook, and what a random neighbourhood for a restaurant like this to be located.  Walking in, we immediately transitioned from a quiet and empty-looking Brooklyn neighbourhood to a lively yet dimly lit and very cozy dining atmosphere.  Our party of three was quickly ushered to a table in the back and handed menus.  My friend had bought a Groupon for Good Fork, with which each of us would pick a starter, and main entree, a side, and a dessert.  I love bitter greens, so for me, the roasted brussels sprouts was a no-brainer as a starter.  On the main entree section of the menu, the apple-braised wild boar shank quickly caught my attention, but at first, I was unsure about the grits that would be a part of this dish.  I do not like grits, but in the end I decided I needed to try this wild boar shank.  I originally wanted to have the mashed potatoes for the side, but they had ran out already, and so I picked the onion rings.The roasted brussels sprouts came with a poached egg, serrano ham, arugula, and caesar dressing.  Thinking about this dish as I write this review is actually making me hungry.  The combination of ingredients in this dish made it absolutely amazing, and especially so because of the bitterness of the brussels sprouts and the saltiness of the serrano ham.  The brussels sprouts were cooked to a nice and tender texture, and the serrano ham was cut into tiny slices and made almost crispy.  The contrast between these two ingredients had me thinking that Chef Sohui Kim was a genius.  Up next was the main entree of apple-braised wild boar shank.  It came with smoked bacon, creamy grits, mustard green, and pickled apple, with the shank itself sitting in a bed of grits.  I was naturally hesitant about the grits, but since I did order it, of course I was going to try it.  And I had to admit that I actually liked it.  It was very creamy and just a bit buttery, with a hint of pepper which really rounded out the flavour.  The shank itself was incredible.  The meat literally slid off the bone as I applied the slightest pressure to it.  It was flavourful, satisfying, and meaty.  I could not stop dipping the meat in the grits in order to eat both in the same bite.  The side of onion rings was made with tempura flour, which made it a lot softer and milder than how it is usually made in most other restaurants.  It was an interesting way of making onion rings which I had never tried before, and they were also very tasty.  I topped off the dinner with a dessert of spiced pecan pie.  While it wasn't the most amazing pecan pie I ever had, it was still very good and was just what I needed to further stuff myself after the extremely delicious dinner.  I'm not sure when I'll be going back to Good Fork, since it's not subway accessible, but oh, you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be back.",5.0

"Cool spot in Red Hook.  It seems like a nice cozy little restaurant in the front area, but if you make your way to the back there's a very nice outdoor seating area with a very chill atmosphere.The food was pretty good and they have an interesting Asian fusion because the place doesn't seem very Asian/Korean from the name and most of the menu.  It's mostly American style food so I wouldn't come here looking for a true fusion-type meal.  I like the down home local atmosphere and one of the best experiences from the wait staff I've had in awhile.  We ordered our food, but apparently the kitchen got backed up and it was taking very long (+40 minutes) for 4 dishes.  We were getting a little annoyed, but aren't the type to complain so we were going to just relax and get another round of drinks to kill time.  The waiter and manager apologized for the delay even though we didn't say anything and comped us a round of drinks which I think speaks volumes for the type of customer service they have.  I've been to plenty of other places that just blame problems on the kitchen (because it's easy) and that's it.  I know it's a very cheap and easy way to keep customers happy, but so many places miss that kind of simple stuff so I appreciate it more and will recommend it if you're ever out in that area.",3.0
"One of the best pork chops I've ever had in my life was at Good Fork several months back during dinner. Last week I stopped in for brunch and ordered the chicken and waffles. It was good as well, but not great. The chicken was not crispy and the skin wasn't flavorful. It must have been fried ahead of time and left to sit and get a bit limp. It wasn't awful by any stretch, but I was expecting to be taken to the realm of crazy delicious after my first meal there. The waffle was ok as well. I make great waffles at home, so I'm often disappointed by restaurant waffles, pancakes and such.  It was a step above meh, but not by much overall. I think they should fry the chicken to order or use a better recipe that oozes flavor and crispness even if left out or stuck in the oven for a refresh before plating. Props to the staff, who were on point and very accommodating of our needs to sit by the lone window seat so that we could keep an eye on our mutt. Added props to the tall, handsome beardy server, who did not serve us directly, but gave us visual entertainment from afar.",3.0
"We could have not possibly picked a better day to go to The Good Fork. After getting off the train, walked for more than half hour in a possibly 95 degree pre-storm humid weather. Just when we thought we might never get there, there it was, in the middle of a quiet block. If it wasn't for the well known reputation, this could truly be qualified as a hidden gem. After the food came, all the complaining about the journey getting here magically turned into raving about the deliciousness of the dishes. Since there were five of us, we had the luxury of trying multiple items on the menu. I wasn't so crazy about the mussel. There was not enough garlic or butter to cover up the sea flavor for me. However, the po'boy was fantastic! For entrees, I highly recommend the chicken. It's the next best chicken, second to Jean-George. Buttery crispy skin, succulent tender meat, with shitaki on the side soaking in all the sauce. The salmon was cooked with perfection. I was not a big fan of the bean puree as bedding, but the picked tomato added a kick in the flavor department. The pork belly had a very remarkable taste. Not the healthiest choice, but what's the use of health when you can't taste good food, right? The steak and egg with kimchee rice was too Americanized according to my Korean friends, but it's a good choice if you want a hint of kimchee without the overwhelming garlic aftertaste in your mouth. All in all, I was impressed with the restaurant. Cozy decor, friendly service, yummy food, and good company. I will go back again, but I will probably drive there next time.",4.0
"I can't really rate this place seeing that I never got to eat there. As you can see by the description it's not kid friendly. I've worked in the restaurant business for a long time. I get that not every place is good for kids but you call and ask about it, do you really have to be so rude? I get that kids can be annoying but it's just disappointing to have to be a jerk about it. A polite ""No, I'm sorry"" goes a long way. People forget, Amazing food without good service is just mediocre. Luckily, there are a million other places to eat in the city.",3.0
"It pains me to give the Good Fork anything less than five stars. I have seen this place grow up -- I was there the first day it opened, I used to go a few times a week, but I moved out of the neighbourhood in 2008 and had not been back until April 2010.The place has changed. The owner and his wife used to double team: Ben was the host up front, while his wife Sohui was the chef in the back. Sohui tinged the menu with her Korean heritage -- a lot of traditional American dishes were slightly permuted, giving the menu a lot of interest and zest. Everything was comfortable yet innovative: a perfect match between comfort food and fine dining.Flash-forward to 2010. Ben and Sohui were nowhere to be found, as they recently had child number two. Fantastic for them, less than great for the Good Fork. The front of house staff manage very well. They are attentive, kind, warm, and more than willing to go out of their way to help you. As soon as you sit down, that is. The fame/infamy of this place has made it all but impossible to get a table in any decent time scale, even for those who live in the neighbourhood. It is also impossible to get a reservation for a table for two on the weekend, because they no longer accept them. On the back end, the menu has changed. A couple of the favourites are still there, like the dumplings and the steak and eggs (or my favourite, the tofu and eggs). But many other staples are gone, like the chicken with mashed potatoes and endives. The other dishes on the menu were good, but lacking in cohesion. The new duck dish was delicious, but was hardly a replacement for the chicken dish.The wine and drink menu has also changed significantly since the departure of the bartender, St John, who opened a restaurant and bare up the block called Fort Defiance. The delicious Dark and Stormy is off the menu, much to my chagrin. But it has shown up at Fort Defiance in an even more delicious iteration with spicy ginger beer.The Good Fork is still an amazing restaurant. It's just lost a bit of its lustre with age. Fortunately, the damage is not fatal. But be forewarned before making the trek out.",4.0

"I love Korean food and I love Brooklyn so I was pretty excited at the prospect of Korean Fusion in Brooklyn.  The spot itself is pretty sweet; a cozy, train-like space that complemented the cool, rainy August evening.But, the food was a disappointment.  First off, there is nothing fusion about the menu.  There are Korean dishes and there are American dishes; the two cuisines are not interacting with each other.  The dumplings were pedestrian and the kimchi fried rice less so.  There was virtually no kimchi in my rice.  I almost sent it back, but can you really do that?The non-Korean dishes fare significantly better.  My corn soup was excellent and the duck was tasty, but the portion was ridiculously huge.  I would have been happy with half the dish at a lower price point.  My boyfriend had the pork tenderloin and his experience was the same: too much food, good but not particularly excellent.For dessert we shared a flourless chocolate cake because nothing else really excited us.  It was fine.I don't think I'll make a trip back to the Good Fork, but my curiousity was satiated and there's something to be said for that.",3.0

"Good company will not be complete without a romantic, intimate, warm restaurant with an amazing Korean fused menu. The Good Fork has all of the above. Located in a quiet town of Red Hook, this small restaurant dishes out some very tasty foods. Known for their pork and chives dumplings we order a couple of other starters just to satisfy our curiosity and taste buds. The steak and eggs was shared among the 4 of us, oh how I wish we could have each our own. The beef was well marinated and went very well with the kimchi fried rice. As for the main dishes: Freshly handmade gnocchi sauteed in a creamy sauce with some greens was by far the best gnocchi ever! The braised shank's meat just feel right off the bone and what a bone it was! The duck and the fluke were both very tasty as well. The Good Fork is a bit of a trek, not nearby any public transpo, but if you're ever around the area or Ikea, give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"My friend Pam lives in Park Slope.  She was impressed, that I, a concrete jungle jockey made my way to Brooklyn's Red Hook neighborhood.  To be more accurate, this SF resident took the train from his plush hotel in midtown to Brooklyn.  And only after disembarking at the Borough Hall exit and walking several blocks to Atlantic Avenue did I jump on the B61 bus to Red Hook.How's that for dedication?  So here's the deal.  I was supposed to meet another friend at this location but she wasn't able to make it so instead of wasting the reservation I said, ""F*ck it.  I'll come out to Brooklyn.""  The location is a little hard to find.  As I wandered around the neighborhood I could hear the Coke bottles clinking as an ominous voice repeated over and over,"" Warrrrriooooorrrrs, come out and plaaaayyyy....Warrrrriooooorrrrs, come out and plaaaaayyyyyy...""  Yes, that evil line from the 1980's ""gang movie"" replayed in my head over and over as I walked down Van Brunt St. cautiously peering over my shoulder every couple of minutes.  Mind you.  I'm not afraid of walking, I'm just cautious when I venture to some foreign place.  Found the location and was greeted by a friendly man with glasses and a beard.  I was promptly seated by another and patiently waited for my friend to arrive.  Now, here's where things start to go awry.  My server was this hipster looking gentleman with a scruffy beard with what looked like a ""rat's tail"" peeking out from under his cap.  Now he wasn't really rude.  He was just indifferent and distant.  Smile at me you fricking moron!  Do you realize that I just spent an hour on public transportation to find your establishment?  You my dear ""waiter"" and I use that term loosely since in my mind you were just a warm body.  Perhaps you and your lover had a spat earlier?  Maybe your puppy died?  Well, I'm sorry but when I have a bad day I NEVER let it affect my customers/clients let alone my co-workers.  You suck.  Period.  And I hope your hipster clothes shrink way too tight so they don't fit.  You left a foul taste in my mouth.  Like OJ and toothpaste, you just don't belong.My wine was o.k. and you really didn't give a rat's ass if I ordered anything.  Your apathetic attitude told me enough.The meatloaf thank god was good.  Great comfort food on a cold night.  The man that brought out my food and suggested the special, bless your heart, was kind and thoughtful.  A pleasant individual.  My chocolate dessert.  Heaven.  My bill.  $105 + 15 tip wasn't bad for two people but I have to wonder about the prices.- Mussels were good.  Steamed, flavorful, and plenty for two people although I personally ate 99% of them.- Meatloaf = contentment- Chocolate cake w/raspberry sauce, soothing and rich.- Server with the rat tail and hipster hat with bad attitude = crappy experience for me.  Thankfully my friend was a great conversationalist and a sweetheart.  She more than made up for our server's lack of a personality.  I don't know if I'll make it out to The Good Fork again.  I normally stay within the confines of Manhattan but with friends living in both Williamsburg, Park Slope, and Clinton Hill, your establishment may pop up on my list of places to re-visit when I'm back in town.Improve your service, focus on your customers and this review may be revisited again in the future.",3.0
"I really loved this place. The service was really friendly and helpful, to start with. I'll be back here for sure, because I enjoyed my overall dining experience, which was due in no small part to the great service.It's very cute and small, would be a nice place to take a date. The food was excellent. I had a pretty simple comfort food meal, pappardelle with lamb ragu and ricotta. I loved the texture of the pasta and the lamb ragu wasn't gamey at all and in a very good sauce. The side of roasted brussels sprouts was also simply prepared, but had great flavor.  Everything tasted very fresh. And side note: it's really not very hard to get to, considering everyone comes to Fairway or Ikea these days, most taxi drivers should know where that is. The B61 drops you off right in front of the place, too.",5.0

"I love Korean food and I love Brooklyn so I was pretty excited at the prospect of Korean Fusion in Brooklyn.  The spot itself is pretty sweet; a cozy, train-like space that complemented the cool, rainy August evening.But, the food was a disappointment.  First off, there is nothing fusion about the menu.  There are Korean dishes and there are American dishes; the two cuisines are not interacting with each other.  The dumplings were pedestrian and the kimchi fried rice less so.  There was virtually no kimchi in my rice.  I almost sent it back, but can you really do that?The non-Korean dishes fare significantly better.  My corn soup was excellent and the duck was tasty, but the portion was ridiculously huge.  I would have been happy with half the dish at a lower price point.  My boyfriend had the pork tenderloin and his experience was the same: too much food, good but not particularly excellent.For dessert we shared a flourless chocolate cake because nothing else really excited us.  It was fine.I don't think I'll make a trip back to the Good Fork, but my curiousity was satiated and there's something to be said for that.",3.0
"More like the bad fork.  The dumplings were good but that's about it.  I. Orderedthe duck and itwasterribly undercooked.  My friends orderedthe steak and eggs.  It was mediocre.  Chewing for days.......rubbery textures on both meals.Our server couldve done better.  She did tintroduce herself or thespecials.  She asked me to pass these pieces of papers around the table not even tellig me what they were.  They were desert menus.Oh yeah, the place is hard to get to.  I hadtonavigate our taxi driver with my iPhone.  It was a 24 dollar taxi ride from manhattan.  I wanted it to be a good fork but it was so not ergonomically friendly.",2.0
"Took a couple from manhattan and we really had no idea what to expect.We found the food great. Especially the dumplings and steak. The ambiance was also very nice. Small, but super cozy and we did not feel cramped. The service may seem slow, but we love long dinners, and why be in a rush. think France and the service is rapid. We had a reservation, and we arrived on time and were seated on time. Cost was reasonable.",4.0
"Good company will not be complete without a romantic, intimate, warm restaurant with an amazing Korean fused menu. The Good Fork has all of the above. Located in a quiet town of Red Hook, this small restaurant dishes out some very tasty foods. Known for their pork and chives dumplings we order a couple of other starters just to satisfy our curiosity and taste buds. The steak and eggs was shared among the 4 of us, oh how I wish we could have each our own. The beef was well marinated and went very well with the kimchi fried rice. As for the main dishes: Freshly handmade gnocchi sauteed in a creamy sauce with some greens was by far the best gnocchi ever! The braised shank's meat just feel right off the bone and what a bone it was! The duck and the fluke were both very tasty as well. The Good Fork is a bit of a trek, not nearby any public transpo, but if you're ever around the area or Ikea, give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"My friend Pam lives in Park Slope.  She was impressed, that I, a concrete jungle jockey made my way to Brooklyn's Red Hook neighborhood.  To be more accurate, this SF resident took the train from his plush hotel in midtown to Brooklyn.  And only after disembarking at the Borough Hall exit and walking several blocks to Atlantic Avenue did I jump on the B61 bus to Red Hook.How's that for dedication?  So here's the deal.  I was supposed to meet another friend at this location but she wasn't able to make it so instead of wasting the reservation I said, ""F*ck it.  I'll come out to Brooklyn.""  The location is a little hard to find.  As I wandered around the neighborhood I could hear the Coke bottles clinking as an ominous voice repeated over and over,"" Warrrrriooooorrrrs, come out and plaaaayyyy....Warrrrriooooorrrrs, come out and plaaaaayyyyyy...""  Yes, that evil line from the 1980's ""gang movie"" replayed in my head over and over as I walked down Van Brunt St. cautiously peering over my shoulder every couple of minutes.  Mind you.  I'm not afraid of walking, I'm just cautious when I venture to some foreign place.  Found the location and was greeted by a friendly man with glasses and a beard.  I was promptly seated by another and patiently waited for my friend to arrive.  Now, here's where things start to go awry.  My server was this hipster looking gentleman with a scruffy beard with what looked like a ""rat's tail"" peeking out from under his cap.  Now he wasn't really rude.  He was just indifferent and distant.  Smile at me you fricking moron!  Do you realize that I just spent an hour on public transportation to find your establishment?  You my dear ""waiter"" and I use that term loosely since in my mind you were just a warm body.  Perhaps you and your lover had a spat earlier?  Maybe your puppy died?  Well, I'm sorry but when I have a bad day I NEVER let it affect my customers/clients let alone my co-workers.  You suck.  Period.  And I hope your hipster clothes shrink way too tight so they don't fit.  You left a foul taste in my mouth.  Like OJ and toothpaste, you just don't belong.My wine was o.k. and you really didn't give a rat's ass if I ordered anything.  Your apathetic attitude told me enough.The meatloaf thank god was good.  Great comfort food on a cold night.  The man that brought out my food and suggested the special, bless your heart, was kind and thoughtful.  A pleasant individual.  My chocolate dessert.  Heaven.  My bill.  $105 + 15 tip wasn't bad for two people but I have to wonder about the prices.- Mussels were good.  Steamed, flavorful, and plenty for two people although I personally ate 99% of them.- Meatloaf = contentment- Chocolate cake w/raspberry sauce, soothing and rich.- Server with the rat tail and hipster hat with bad attitude = crappy experience for me.  Thankfully my friend was a great conversationalist and a sweetheart.  She more than made up for our server's lack of a personality.  I don't know if I'll make it out to The Good Fork again.  I normally stay within the confines of Manhattan but with friends living in both Williamsburg, Park Slope, and Clinton Hill, your establishment may pop up on my list of places to re-visit when I'm back in town.Improve your service, focus on your customers and this review may be revisited again in the future.",3.0
"I really loved this place. The service was really friendly and helpful, to start with. I'll be back here for sure, because I enjoyed my overall dining experience, which was due in no small part to the great service.It's very cute and small, would be a nice place to take a date. The food was excellent. I had a pretty simple comfort food meal, pappardelle with lamb ragu and ricotta. I loved the texture of the pasta and the lamb ragu wasn't gamey at all and in a very good sauce. The side of roasted brussels sprouts was also simply prepared, but had great flavor.  Everything tasted very fresh. And side note: it's really not very hard to get to, considering everyone comes to Fairway or Ikea these days, most taxi drivers should know where that is. The B61 drops you off right in front of the place, too.",5.0
"After watching this place featured on Throwdown with Bobby Flay I was sold. Korean lady making dumplings, what what?! Good ambiance, not so fab location (because it's not in the main part of Brooklyn and mass transit buses can be prime targets for ghetto experiences) but worth the distance. I came here in 2008 and it was very nice and cozy. My friend and I got drinks, food and bellies full of dumplings. Actually I don't recall what food we had except the dumplings but it was all very lovely. I don't know if I would necessarily say that you HAVE TO come here because NY has soooo much to offer but it was on my list of must trys.",4.0
"If I could give Good Fork 6 stars, I would. This place was delicious and amazing. What really put it over the top was the excellent customer/table service.My friends and I started out with the pork and chive dumplings and an order of the fried green tomatoes which were the special appetizer of the evening. They were great. The dumplings were really some of the best that I've had in the city and the tomatoes were fantastic with the pickled jalapenos and roasted garlic aoli.For the entrees we had the evening special of ribeye with swiss chard, chimichurri sauce, and some kind of biscuit with truffles, my friends order the grouper and the korean style skirt steak with an egg on top. Both of their dishes were absolutely delicious. My steak was overcooked. I ordered it Medium and it came out well done but when our waiter brought it out he pointed out that they believed it was overcooked and offered me any other entree on the menu. It turned out to be very crispy and chewy so I ended up ordering the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon. By the time my replacement entree came out my friends had already finished their meals. When they brought it out the waiter apologized again and said that since it took so long, they would give me my entree for free. I thought it was extremely generous and wasn't expecting it. I've never experienced a restaurant admitting their mistakes and then taking such efforts to remedy the mistake. Good Fork impressed me with their delicious food but they really amazed me with their customer service and attentiveness. This is not the kind of service that I have normally seen in NYC. I will definitely be back for more of The Good Fork!",5.0
Oyster Po Boys...the reason everyone should go here. They were crispy on supple brioche rolls with a tangy mayo-like sauce. 5 days have gone by and I still crave them.

"We absolutely love Good Fork.   We've been here at least 8 times, sometimes with friends in tow.    I get the Vegetarian Steak & Egg a lot, which is great (no need for quite that much tofu, but I am not complaining).  The Brussel Sprouts are fabulous.  My boyfriend usually gets the fish special and has never been disappointed.  Save room for the Bread Pudding.    The only real negative is the lack of wait space at the bar which makes things a little tight.",4.0
"I really wanted to like this place, especially after my friends raving review of it. According to her the dumplings absolutely rocked that she couldn't even find the words to describe it. I knew it was something I had to try. 5 little morsels of pork packed into a thin sheet of dumpling wrapper, lightly pan fried and dipped in a pitch dark soy sauce blend. it was good, easily the best part of the meal we had but I can still only say that it was only okay for me. It was like a little step above the average gyoza. But trust me I've had gyoza that was better than these dumplings. So I don't know what the fuss is about. Ordered up the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, cause bacon wrapped anything is hard to go wrong, eh? Well it did. Sooo salty! We also go the steak and eggs. It was okay. The steak had an obvious korean flavor to it. Tasted like Kalbi. It sat over a bed of kimchi rice which was too soggy and had a sour flavor that I didn't appreciate. Aren't they suppose to be Korean fusion? I barely recognized anything fusion about it. I mean, are Koreans even famous for their dumplings? It was easy getting a table, even for a Thursday night during prime dinner time. The staff is soo warm and friendly. But the place is a bit tacky. I was looking for something warm and cozy and all it was a tacky diner looking space with the dreaded christmas lights to give it some more lighting. like I said, I really wanted to like it, but the more I thought about it, the more I realize I didn't.",3.0

"Ok, so my girlfriend and I decided to try this place after watching the dumpling throwdown on the Food Network.We ordered a prix fixe dinner special for $40, which included a flight of beer, and an appetizer and entree.So, since we saw the throwdown, we had to try the dumpling appetizer. They turned out to be a big disappointment. They were burnt and rather bland on their own. The sauce was some sort of reduction that I didn't think added anything positive in terms of flavor to the experience. As part of the prix fixe, we also got to try a fried fish appetizer which was plain as plain could be. We had to ask for some lemon to give the fish some bite. Otherwise, it would have come from a fish and chip stand and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.For entrees, we had the seared duck breast and bacon wrapped tenderloin. Now, this is what we came to experience. I'm not usually a fan of pork entrees but the tenderloin was amazingly moist. The bacon added just the right amount of crunch and saltiness. The duck breast was also very good.For dessert, we shared some kind of ice cream sandwich (vanilla sandwiched between two vanilla or ginger flavored cookies). The cookies were rock hard, ok but unspectacular.We really wanted to like this place but we came away with mixed feelings. The entrees were excellent but were sandwiched between extraordinarily unexceptional appetizers and dessert. If either was a little better, I might stretch and give it four stars but since only the entrees were memorable, I have to stick with three stars.",3.0

"What an absolutely fantastic restaurant - one of the best I've gone to. The Good Fork is in a wonderfully charming space, with room for around 25 diners, with a decor that compliments the intimacy, feeling almost like the inside of a classic sailboat. Service was friendly and welcoming.The menu at The Good Fork seems to specialize in perfectly executed food with clean flavors and seasonal ingredients. I chose the roast chicken entree and was incredibly satisfied. The skin of the chicken was perfectly crispy and incredibly flavorful, while the meat maintained a delicate moistness. The chicken was served over a parsnip-potato puree which could not have been creamier - mixed with the chicken jus, they tasted fantastic. Complimenting the dish was a full shallot, which was beautifully caramelized. My wife's entree was equally delicious. Her risotto not only included butternut squash and pumpkin seeds (a wonderful Autumn combination), but also featured tantalizingly-crunch tempura-battered Hen of the Woods. The chef executed the risotto perfectly, with its wonderfully creamy consistency that was neither too liquidy nor too thick. As my wife put it, the dish was ""edible comfort"".I hope to return to The Good Fork soon and experiment with a larger sampling of their menu!",5.0
"Once you're sitting inside Good Fork and look around, it feels a bit like being inside of a dining car of yore back when they had tablecloth service on long glamorous train rides to exotic places.  The wood paneling curves above head, and mirrors line the restaurant slightly above eye line.  The crowd feels convivial and young-ish -- half native Red Hookers and half folks on dates trying to impress who can afford a nice night out.Good Fork falls squarely on the nice side of locally sourced cooking.  The homemade pasta had a nice bounce in the tagliatelle a la carbonara and the arugula was the most intensely bitter nutty thing I had since eating in Rome.  Fried green tomatoes, the night's special, was panko encrusted and deep fried, the batter light and crunchy around a tart tomato base.  It feels redundant to say something deep fried was delicious, but it was.  The crabcake.  Yikes.  Get it.  Decidedly crabby and the best crabcake I've had in a long while yet.So I loved everything else, but I was pretty disappointed by my side of kimchi fried rice which I had fantasized as being a melding of onions and whatever other goodies with kimchi gently mellowed by the frying.  I'm Korean and I like my kimchi full strength, but the kimchi in the rice smelled aggressively fishy and untamed by the cooking process in its tartness.  Perhaps with a fried egg over it to temper the acidity it might have been better, but the plate didn't take advantage of cooked kimchi which acquires many layers of competing flavors with the mellowing of its edges.Oh, the dessert menu?  Pass.  We only ordered the flourless chocolate cake, but if it's mushy underwhelmingness is any indication of the other dessert menu items, I'd give it a pass and take a nice stroll to another place to indulge.Still, a lovely night out in all, and I would most definitely return to try out the dumplings I didn't have a chance to order.",4.0

"The Good Fork is FANTASTIC. I probably ordered way more than was good for me. I was utterly famished by the time I made it over there, after I got off work around 9:45pm. The place was still full, so props to them. I hate walking into good restaurants that are empty just because it's late, and the obscurity of the Good Fork shows it doesn't have to be the case. I love the atmosphere, full of locals I recognize, très Brooklyn. I love that they try to incorporate Added Value (Red Hook Community Farm) produce into their menu when they can. For starters, I had the pork and chive dumplings. They were good - thin, chewy skins, well-seasoned filling and rich dark dipping sauce, but I think reading the other Yelp reviewers hyped them up a little too much to me. Nonetheless, good. I tasted my companion's fish and chips, and I loved the spicy jicama salad on the side. The spicy dressing mixed with the tartar sauce on the plate and it was VERY YUMMY. For mains, I got the Steak and Eggs, Korean-Style. I really liked it! The kimchee rice was good, and the steak was cooked as ordered. I LOVE runny egg on things, so that probably put it over the edge for me. The linguine I tasted was good as well. I liked the full-starchy crispness of the shrimp-scallion pancakes, as well. Dessert was chocolate bread pudding - surprisingly light and not too rich and good for summer. Warning: There are golden raisins in it, so if you don't like raisins in stuff, I'd choose another option. There was also some yummy chamomile grappa to be had. My only small complaint would be that some of the food took a little waiting to come out. It was delicious, and I wasn't in a rush, so it was no matter for me. The servers were polite and attentive. All this food cost me $90, including tip. C'est bon!",5.0
"The Good Fork is the kind of place you feel right at home in as soon as you walk in..It is small and cozy and full of warm colors, it feels like your in an old train car.

For my entree I had the Korean steak and eggs and topped it off with chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce for dessert...yum, yum and yum. All things I don't normally order and all satisfying. The staff seem so down to earth and genuine and there was always hot food right in front of me before I could blink.",4.0
"Hooray for Brunch at The Good Fork!  Been to the here a couple times before for dinner, but when i went looking on Eater.com for a new brunch place, I found out they have recently added brunch there so I decided to check it out.  Very glad I did.  Every table was filled but apparently  a lot of people were paying their checks so I table was only about a 5 minute wait.  Wait staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. Bloody Mary's are great here!  Huevos Rancheros was very tatsy with chicurros and black beans and tortilas smothered in a delicious sauce. Also had the Croque Madam which was perfect. I asked for another poached egg on top and I'm very glad I did. Will definitely be back!",5.0
"Alright, so I'm really, really behind in writing reviews and sharing my daily happenings of the week.I had seen the 'Dumplings"" episode of ""Throwdown with Booby Flay"" and it featured Sohui Kim of The Good Fork. As a Korean-American, the dumplings were superb. The skin was really thin (which is a sign of a good skin). The filling was mouthwatering and delish. The only drawback that I can really say about them is that there were so few on a plate. I'm just used to having a huge plate full.Six and a half of us went for an early (meaning we walked into the door as soon as they opened at 5:30pm) dinner on a lazy Saturday afternoon. *Note: the half is our friend's 8-month old baby boy.Having grown up eating and enjoying the authentic Korean dishes, I've always been skeptical about ""fusion"" dishes using Korean dishes or Korean dishes that have been altered for the American palate. However, I've got to admit, I didn't mind the food here at all. The Steak and Eggs ""Korean Style"" was awesome. The Roasted Chicken (my entree) while simple was a better version of the rotisserie chicken you will find in Flushing along Northern Blvd. My girlfriend had the spare ribs which wasn't vietnamese enough.Check this place out, then go again and again.",4.0
"Well, I'd read about this place a bunch. Mostly from the reviews they list on their website. So I had some expectations going into the meal, which is unusual for me. I also knew what I wanted to order before I got there (thanks menu on the internet!). Ordered the dumplings for a starter, which were delicious. There was a tasty sauce as well. Then I had the ""steak and egg"" and my home companion ordered the shrimp risotto. Both meals were top notch. Really freakin' good. They had a very long wine list ( I must reserve judgment because I did not partake), but they did have Six Point beer which is delicious. We also had a delicious little flourless chocolate cake.The service was also excellent. Our waiter was friendly and sincere and seemed to time his table side visit quite well.I am going back here again. Bar none.

"Just so lovely.   Run by a husband/wife team.Let's start at the beginning...walking though the door.  The husband has the front of house gig and he does it soooooo well.  He is welcoming, accomodating as he can be cause the place is cozy and you can just feel he wants everyone that enters the door to have the best experience possible.  Not always in NYC do you feel that nice welcoming vibe, but here you just get it in spades.  You can tell there are many regulars because there is a lot of hugging and kissing amongst staff and diners upon entrance and exit.  I've only gone here twice so no kisses or hugs for me but that is ok....maybe next time.I sat close to the kitchen/bar area which was fine by me because I was able to spy the big, beautiful St. Germain bottle on the shelf of the bar and also got to eye the meals being served.  It all looked so excellent.  What to select I wondered?  Well let me tell you.  I ordered a lovely St. Germain cocktail....some SG, some presecco and some club soda.   Quite possibly the most refreshing, yummy cocktail every invented.  The bartender came over and delivered it to us.  He wanted to know how we like it.  Who gives you this type of attention these days?  Let's get to the food.  My friend, Mary, and I ordered the dumplings, the yummy delicous dumplings as an appetizer which by the way kicked Bobby Flay's dumplings' ass when he challenged the chef (the wife) to a throwdown.  For mains, I ordered the Korean style steak and eggs and Mary ordered the seared duck.  We both enjoyed every bite and really wished Mary's husband, Stephen, would have been with us because he would have love this place, but poor Stephen is back in Scotland working.  We did not have desert even though there were some tasty sounding choices.  I will definitely come back here.  The quality is top notch!PS - If you try the St Germain and you love it as much as me, travel across the street to LaNelle's and get a bottle for yourself to bring home.",5.0
"I've been to Good Fork multiple times and, generally, it's been a nice experience and an enjoyable menu.  However, they're off their game when it's busy:  that delicious dish you had on a Wednesday will take twice as long and taste half as good on a Saturday.  The appetizers come out quickly, but you may blow through your bottle of wine before the entrees come.  Go during the week for the best service and quality.UPDATE 4/2010I stand by my mid-week assessment.  I had the deliciously thin pappardelle with some reasonably-priced, barnyard-smelling gamay and it was heaven.UPDATE 8/25/10I live in Red Hook now and go to Good Fork at least once per month.  Each time has been a pleasure.  I can't get enough of the dumplings and the asparagus starters.  We always end up seeking out the wine we have at local wine stores because GF's recommendations are so spot on to our taste.",4.0
"What an absolutely fantastic restaurant - one of the best I've gone to. The Good Fork is in a wonderfully charming space, with room for around 25 diners, with a decor that compliments the intimacy, feeling almost like the inside of a classic sailboat. Service was friendly and welcoming.The menu at The Good Fork seems to specialize in perfectly executed food with clean flavors and seasonal ingredients. I chose the roast chicken entree and was incredibly satisfied. The skin of the chicken was perfectly crispy and incredibly flavorful, while the meat maintained a delicate moistness. The chicken was served over a parsnip-potato puree which could not have been creamier - mixed with the chicken jus, they tasted fantastic. Complimenting the dish was a full shallot, which was beautifully caramelized. My wife's entree was equally delicious. Her risotto not only included butternut squash and pumpkin seeds (a wonderful Autumn combination), but also featured tantalizingly-crunch tempura-battered Hen of the Woods. The chef executed the risotto perfectly, with its wonderfully creamy consistency that was neither too liquidy nor too thick. As my wife put it, the dish was ""edible comfort"".I hope to return to The Good Fork soon and experiment with a larger sampling of their menu!",5.0
"Once you're sitting inside Good Fork and look around, it feels a bit like being inside of a dining car of yore back when they had tablecloth service on long glamorous train rides to exotic places.  The wood paneling curves above head, and mirrors line the restaurant slightly above eye line.  The crowd feels convivial and young-ish -- half native Red Hookers and half folks on dates trying to impress who can afford a nice night out.Good Fork falls squarely on the nice side of locally sourced cooking.  The homemade pasta had a nice bounce in the tagliatelle a la carbonara and the arugula was the most intensely bitter nutty thing I had since eating in Rome.  Fried green tomatoes, the night's special, was panko encrusted and deep fried, the batter light and crunchy around a tart tomato base.  It feels redundant to say something deep fried was delicious, but it was.  The crabcake.  Yikes.  Get it.  Decidedly crabby and the best crabcake I've had in a long while yet.So I loved everything else, but I was pretty disappointed by my side of kimchi fried rice which I had fantasized as being a melding of onions and whatever other goodies with kimchi gently mellowed by the frying.  I'm Korean and I like my kimchi full strength, but the kimchi in the rice smelled aggressively fishy and untamed by the cooking process in its tartness.  Perhaps with a fried egg over it to temper the acidity it might have been better, but the plate didn't take advantage of cooked kimchi which acquires many layers of competing flavors with the mellowing of its edges.Oh, the dessert menu?  Pass.  We only ordered the flourless chocolate cake, but if it's mushy underwhelmingness is any indication of the other dessert menu items, I'd give it a pass and take a nice stroll to another place to indulge.Still, a lovely night out in all, and I would most definitely return to try out the dumplings I didn't have a chance to order.",4.0

"The Good Fork is FANTASTIC. I probably ordered way more than was good for me. I was utterly famished by the time I made it over there, after I got off work around 9:45pm. The place was still full, so props to them. I hate walking into good restaurants that are empty just because it's late, and the obscurity of the Good Fork shows it doesn't have to be the case. I love the atmosphere, full of locals I recognize, très Brooklyn. I love that they try to incorporate Added Value (Red Hook Community Farm) produce into their menu when they can. For starters, I had the pork and chive dumplings. They were good - thin, chewy skins, well-seasoned filling and rich dark dipping sauce, but I think reading the other Yelp reviewers hyped them up a little too much to me. Nonetheless, good. I tasted my companion's fish and chips, and I loved the spicy jicama salad on the side. The spicy dressing mixed with the tartar sauce on the plate and it was VERY YUMMY. For mains, I got the Steak and Eggs, Korean-Style. I really liked it! The kimchee rice was good, and the steak was cooked as ordered. I LOVE runny egg on things, so that probably put it over the edge for me. The linguine I tasted was good as well. I liked the full-starchy crispness of the shrimp-scallion pancakes, as well. Dessert was chocolate bread pudding - surprisingly light and not too rich and good for summer. Warning: There are golden raisins in it, so if you don't like raisins in stuff, I'd choose another option. There was also some yummy chamomile grappa to be had. My only small complaint would be that some of the food took a little waiting to come out. It was delicious, and I wasn't in a rush, so it was no matter for me. The servers were polite and attentive. All this food cost me $90, including tip. C'est bon!",5.0
"The Good Fork is the kind of place you feel right at home in as soon as you walk in..It is small and cozy and full of warm colors, it feels like your in an old train car. I cam here ready to throw down... so I went all out. To start I had the dumplings, which was the reason I came in the first place. For my entree I had the Korean steak and eggs and topped it off with chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce for dessert...yum, yum and yum. All things I don't normally order and all satisfying. The staff seem so down to earth and genuine and there was always hot food right in front of me before I could blink.",4.0
"Hooray for Brunch at The Good Fork!  Been to the here a couple times before for dinner, but when i went looking on Eater.com for a new brunch place, I found out they have recently added brunch there so I decided to check it out.  Very glad I did.  Every table was filled but apparently  a lot of people were paying their checks so I table was only about a 5 minute wait.  Wait staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. Bloody Mary's are great here!  Huevos Rancheros was very tatsy with chicurros and black beans and tortilas smothered in a delicious sauce. Also had the Croque Madam which was perfect. I asked for another poached egg on top and I'm very glad I did. Will definitely be back!",5.0
"Alright, so I'm really, really behind in writing reviews and sharing my daily happenings of the week.I had seen the 'Dumplings"" episode of ""Throwdown with Booby Flay"" and it featured Sohui Kim of The Good Fork. As a Korean-American, the dumplings were superb. The skin was really thin (which is a sign of a good skin). The filling was mouthwatering and delish. The only drawback that I can really say about them is that there were so few on a plate. I'm just used to having a huge plate full.Six and a half of us went for an early (meaning we walked into the door as soon as they opened at 5:30pm) dinner on a lazy Saturday afternoon. *Note: the half is our friend's 8-month old baby boy.Having grown up eating and enjoying the authentic Korean dishes, I've always been skeptical about ""fusion"" dishes using Korean dishes or Korean dishes that have been altered for the American palate. However, I've got to admit, I didn't mind the food here at all. The Steak and Eggs ""Korean Style"" was awesome. The Roasted Chicken (my entree) while simple was a better version of the rotisserie chicken you will find in Flushing along Northern Blvd. My girlfriend had the spare ribs which wasn't vietnamese enough.Check this place out, then go again and again.",4.0
"Well, I'd read about this place a bunch. Mostly from the reviews they list on their website. So I had some expectations going into the meal, which is unusual for me. I also knew what I wanted to order before I got there (thanks menu on the internet!). Ordered the dumplings for a starter, which were delicious. There was a tasty sauce as well. Then I had the ""steak and egg"" and my home companion ordered the shrimp risotto. Both meals were top notch. Really freakin' good. They had a very long wine list ( I must reserve judgment because I did not partake), but they did have Six Point beer which is delicious. We also had a delicious little flourless chocolate cake.The service was also excellent. Our waiter was friendly and sincere and seemed to time his table side visit quite well.I am going back here again. Bar none. The food alone would bring me back, but it's also a really neat restaurant. The interior design is quite beautiful.

"There we were, me and my man lounging on the couch last Saturday when Bobby Flay's Throwdown featured Good Fork's owner, Sohui Kim, as the Dumpling Maven.I turned to Mark.  ""Want to try the Good Fork?""He shrugged, ""Sure.  How far is Red Hook?""Yeah, um, we don't get off the island much.  Turns out it's about a 90-minute walk from the Manhattan side of Brooklyn Bridge.  Despite the trek, we arrived early enough to get our names on a short waiting list.Ben Schneider, Sohui's husband, is evidently a man of many talents, as he designed and built most of the restaurant's tiny interior.  He somehow managed to squeeze two-tops, four-tops and even a four-seater bar into a 500 square foot space.  Thanks to high ceilings and simple prints against the exposed brick wall, the place seems less cramped than it does cozy.  Seating is comfortable and low, and overhead lights are diffused cleverly under glass brick.After a quick fifteen minute wait, we settled in to enjoy ourselves.  They have fantastic beer on tap.  Mark tried the Allagash Cream Ale and raved about it, deservedly so.  I opted for a glass of cabernet.  The wine's strong berry flavors ended up pairing quite well with my dinner choices, though, so I was happy stealing a sip or two from Mark's exceptional brew.For his appetizer, Mark chose the steamed mussels in a coconut milk and white wine reduction.  The mussels were perfectly prepared -- meaty without a hint of overcooked chewiness.  Of course, after FoodNetwork's show, I had no choice but to request the pork & chive dumplings for myself.  The dumplings' filling provided great balance with the translucent dough that maintained its shape, even after dipping.  The sauce was incredible -- warm flavor washed with a deep tang of soy sauce & sesame.  I now know why FoodNetwork featured these tasty bites!I was barely finished savoring my dumplings when the entrees claimed our attention.  My seared duck arrived sliced and fanned out over a bed of french lentils and red wine drizzle.  Mark's korean-style steak and eggs looked just as fresh and inviting; his egg was overeasy and still steaming, the short ribs literally dripped with flavor.After a small mixup with our dessert order, Mark and I shared some blueberry panna cotta.  The slight tang of whole milk complemented the blueberry compote well.  It managed both to cleanse the palate and satisfy that sweet craving I get after a generously savory meal.We finally called it a night and headed home happy.  Thanks, Good Fork!  We'll be back.",5.0

"Five stars because surly mother, picky sister and I left here very pleased (and full) a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, in recent times, BK's culinary scene has gotten almost TOO popular. That night, we went to Buttermilk (2 hour wait!), Blue Ribbon (PACKED), and having gone to Good Fork and having their Steak & Eggs, we called and the person on the other line was very cordial, saying we might have to wait 15 mins. We got there, and table was ready. Perfect. Thank you car.Love my animal proteins, but tempura hen of woods mushrooms risotto was fantastic - savory and perfect for winter. I'm not sure if there's anything more satisfying than good tempura batter. Picky sister (gnocchi) and Surly mother (forgot what she had - selective hearing - but clearly enjoyed) were happy. There's no pretense to this place, food/service was excellent, well-priced wine list. Dessert is tough to compare with some behemoths around the borough (doughnuts at Buttermilk, crisp/tart at Adderley) but solid nonetheless (we had the flan. I've had the key lime pie before, which is good).When it's wintery mixing outside and its cold and dark and you're hungry, it's nice to walk into somewhere warm and cozy like someone's inviting you to their home, with great food to match.

"I have been to this restaurant a few times in the past year and every thing has been really delicious interesting seasonal food. I have been very happy with everything I have eaten  and the service is decent as well.Here is my picky comment... Redecorate!!!!Food this sophisticated deserves a better setting. While I love that it is a cozy spot in red hook and there have  been some interesting architectural details added there are way too many cheesey chotzkas. Lose the Christmas lights , this is not a dorm room, and the bad art reproductions have got to go. Last time I was there I was seated in the little back room . It's tar paper like walls made it dark and I found the ugly Christmas decorations distracting. The space is small and a little cramped, but worth sitting in for the wonderful food. A careful editing of the  decor and some investment in good lighting could make you feel like you are in the excellent restaurant that you are instead of feeling like you are seated in grandmas basement.",4.0
"It's a great place to go in the neighborhood but everything was pretty average (food, atmosphere). Didn't think the Korean fusion part was executed very well.

"I had really high hopes for this place and after making the trip from Manhattan to Brooklyn I was a bit disappointed in our service and parts of my meal. To start we tried the dumplings and crab cake - both were delicious. We both ordered the korean style steak and eggs for dinner. When it arrived it looked delicious - steak was really well cooked and the eggs were perfect.. but the rice... oh the rice... The rice had definitely been undercooked in my opinion and the more I are the more i couldn't get over how awful the rice was. I decided to ask the waitress thinking that perhaps they wanted the rice to be something different than I had imagined (Sticky, mushy, and maybe a little crisp from a stone pot edge). The waitress confirmed that the rice was suppose to be more mushy and sticky like traditional bimbimbap... and I informed her that the rice was definitely not mushy but more so hard like undercooked rice. She did ask me if I wanted them to recook but at that point i was nearly done with my meal and wasn't looking for more. She never apologized and or said anything about letting the kitchen know - so I was a little disappointed in my service overall. Perhaps I am just accustomed to a manager checking up and apologizing for the mistake and that they would let the kitchen know... but maybe in their minds a I can remake that for you is sufficient.",3.0
"THE BEST restaurant i've been to in brooklyn, maybe even new york. the food there is just PERFECT. the atmosphere is cozy and bright, and the service is warm and friendly. i got the risotto for the main course and the beets as an appetizer. my friend got the crabcake apps and everything just melted in our mouths. i'm pretty critical when in it comes to food - i'll think something's too salty, too bland, etc etc. but i couldn't find a single thing wrong with the food at Good Fork. I want to go back and try the korean fusion dish. actually, i want to try all of their dishes.  the space is pretty small. there's a main dining area visible from outside and there's another seating area towards the back (behind the bar).  the main dining area is much brighter and has a better feel to it - i'd recommend requesting a seat there. and for the quality of food, the price is very good.",5.0
"Hate to be cheesy, but this should be called The Great Fork.  My husband and I ate a pre-party dinner here last weekend, and I'm really sorry we didn't discover it sooner!  We split the kimchee strudel as an appetizer and it was amazing.  I got the duck breast for my main, and he had the boar shank.  Both were absolutely incredible.  My duck was nice and crispy on then outside and tender on the inside.  His boar shank was fork tender and flavorful.  We sat at the bar and were totally comfortable there and really loved the bartender.  As a matter of fact, all the staff were incredibly friendly and totally unpretentious.  The decor is really cozy and unique, and it feels like a quirky, sexy.  In short, run, don't walk, to try The Good Fork.  We can't wait to go back.",5.0

"SO GOOD.  The food and service was excellent.  Aaron waited on us and he was the nicest man.  The dumplings are a must have, and my husband and I both loved the seared duck I got (it comes with this plum jam  and confit which were exquisite).  Afterwards Matt had Steve's Key Lime Pie (I'm ruined for Key Lime Pies now) and I had the strawberry rhubarb crisp with vanilla ice cream.  All was topped off with a delicious chamomile aperitif.  SUPERB!!!",4.0

"I have been to this restaurant a few times in the past year and every thing has been really delicious interesting seasonal food. I have been very happy with everything I have eaten  and the service is decent as well.Here is my picky comment... Redecorate!!!!Food this sophisticated deserves a better setting. While I love that it is a cozy spot in red hook and there have  been some interesting architectural details added there are way too many cheesey chotzkas. Lose the Christmas lights , this is not a dorm room, and the bad art reproductions have got to go. Last time I was there I was seated in the little back room . It's tar paper like walls made it dark and I found the ugly Christmas decorations distracting. The space is small and a little cramped, but worth sitting in for the wonderful food. A careful editing of the  decor and some investment in good lighting could make you feel like you are in the excellent restaurant that you are instead of feeling like you are seated in grandmas basement.",4.0
"It's a great place to go in the neighborhood but everything was pretty average (food, atmosphere). Didn't think the Korean fusion part was executed very well. The kimchi rice I had was pretty disastrous. The kimchi had not pickled yet and all I could taste was the red pepper paste and limp raw cabbage - not a great combo. The dumplings were good but rather forgettable. I really wanted to love this place, but the food fell short of expectations for sure.",2.0
"Steak & eggs, Korean style....now why didn't *I* think of that???  this alone is worth the trek for me.  but then again, i have a jeep!  :PP.S.  Went back again this week...they didn't have the pork stew with creamy polenta so I settled with the papardelle.  Pretty good.  The duck was delicious though!!",4.0
"Loved this place. Everything was fantastic. The veggie dumpling special was a great appetizer and the side of scallion pancakes is definitely a must try. My pork tenderloin with hominy was delicious. Husbands oxtail gnocchi was succulent and awesome. Great service and beer /wine list as well. It does get cramped in there, so make a reservation if possible. Highly recommend this place. We will return often.",5.0
"I had really high hopes for this place and after making the trip from Manhattan to Brooklyn I was a bit disappointed in our service and parts of my meal. To start we tried the dumplings and crab cake - both were delicious. We both ordered the korean style steak and eggs for dinner. When it arrived it looked delicious - steak was really well cooked and the eggs were perfect.. but the rice... oh the rice... The rice had definitely been undercooked in my opinion and the more I are the more i couldn't get over how awful the rice was. I decided to ask the waitress thinking that perhaps they wanted the rice to be something different than I had imagined (Sticky, mushy, and maybe a little crisp from a stone pot edge). The waitress confirmed that the rice was suppose to be more mushy and sticky like traditional bimbimbap... and I informed her that the rice was definitely not mushy but more so hard like undercooked rice. She did ask me if I wanted them to recook but at that point i was nearly done with my meal and wasn't looking for more. She never apologized and or said anything about letting the kitchen know - so I was a little disappointed in my service overall. Perhaps I am just accustomed to a manager checking up and apologizing for the mistake and that they would let the kitchen know... but maybe in their minds a I can remake that for you is sufficient.",3.0

It's a veggie!-1/2 star because I had a total of 5 slices of steak, and the equivalent of 1 whole slice of fat/gristle/bone. So really, it was only 4 slices for $25.

And the greens on his plate were WAY over-salted. -1/2 star because the sauces on our respective steaks were over-salted. I like salty foods, and it was almost too much for me to take.-1/2 star because I am still hungry (came home and ate 6 of my own potstickers).(so really, i guess this is 1 1/2 stars, but I rounded up.)Our server was very nice. The bread (from Balthazar) was chewy and the butter soft. And the wine was very reasonably priced. The tuna tartare and dumpling appetizers were delish. We will be going back - it's a nice local place. But it may only be once or twice a year now, since Red Hook is way out in BFE and the food/service wasn't exceptional.

"Spent a lovely evening in the backroom of the Fork with friends. Nicest service I have had in a long time. I called ahead to make a reservation for the four of us, and when we arrived, our table wasn't ready, so the host (owner, maybe?) showed us to the bar and bought us a round of drinks. Just fifteen minutes later, we were seated and had a delicious charming time. Kimchi rice, what a treat! Dumplings, delightful! Definitely coming back.",4.0
"I love the Good Fork for many reasons. First, their food. It is damn good, without fail. I haven't eaten anything there that I've thought was just okay. It's all really freaking good. Second, it is a beautiful setting. The guy-owner is apparently a carpenter too (some real estate article in the Sunday NYT discussed this) and he made the interior! You can tell. It's funky without shoving it in your face, which is really nice in Brooklyn.Third, it's in Red Hook...which is good and bad: Good because it will never ever become as mobbed as it would if it were located in say, Manhattan, or even on Smith St in nearby Carroll Gardens; bad because unless you live in Red Hook (which I don't) it is kind of a gamble to get a seat, and they really don't have a good place to wait, which is a drag in cold weather. Luckily, there are a few bars located within a few minutes' walk, and they are willing to call you when the table is ready.We celebrated with 6 of our friends here recently - a table for 8 - and they were friendly, flexible, we brought 2 bottles of wine and payed for corkage, as well as purchasing some cocktails and a bottle of wine too. Everyone was totally blissed out - so delicious! so pretty! so fun! The waitress was even fun too. I forget her name, but she was great.Go there! Now! You'll love it.",5.0
"Could be better with a lot more effort by the staff. Food is just ok and over salted. Nothing to write home about. Get rid ofthe X-mas light for gods sake. Expensive, so for value it scores quite low too.",2.0
"Super cool space, very eager and friendly staff, and best of all -- everything was delicious!! We had salad, dumplings, sea bass, steak and eggs, and beer.

"I think this place is good for its signature dishes: the dumplings and the steak and eggs.  Those two dishes are much better than other offerings on the menu. I would give those two dishes 5 stars.  The dumplings are non-doughy and tasty, the steak was cooked perfectly and I liked the kimchee rice.  However the duck was a wee bit chewy (but tasty) with a weird bitter greens side dish, and the kimchee appetizer was rather bland (if that's possible with kimchee). I think this place has a bit of a narrow range. I went here a few years ago and recall being more impressed.  Still, its a sweet little spot and what they do well, they do well.",4.0
"Our server was having an off day -- he got one of our appetizers and one of our entrees wrong -- but they made it right in the end.The food, however, was fantastic. We had the oysters appetizer, which is quite nicely done. (To the other reviewer who felt they weren't cooked ... respectfully, you probably shouldn't order oysters in a fine restaurant.) One of us had an organic king salmon which was somewhat bland and straightforward, but very well prepared. The other had the steak and eggs, which was truly fantastic. Steve's Lime Pie is a great dessert, prepared on the piers of Red Hook.Decor is great. The people are really friendly. Red Hook can be quite charming.

"Service was excellent. Appetizers took a little long to get to the table, unprompted a staffer apologized and told us we'd have them on the house. The server very apologetic. It wasn't a big deal to begin with, but everyone here was very attentive and interested in us having a positive experience. The food was excellent. Crab cake a little small but satisfying. Steak in the steak in eggs was incredibly tender. It was suggested to cook medium rare- go with that. Fried Green Tomatoes great. Good Fork is small, intimate, and they treat you with care.",4.0
"This place is not easy to find, but we were on a walking tour of Red Hook after BAM and got there a bit late but there were plenty of seats. Terrific food and service - we  had the AV salad, which comes from a local farm! the braised pork belly and one other dish. Only had room for one dessert so we split the chocolate bread pudding, which was spectacular. This place is hardly pricey, given the quality, but good food will run a minimum of $90-$100 for two anywhere. Very small.",4.0
"Situated in Red Hook this place is definitely worth the trek. A small intimate space with excellent hosts and food that makes you want to come back you can take a first date, take your spouse, take your parents, anyone will feel welcome and special here.

"After a couple month hiatus from yelp, the kid is bizack.  I was on tour playing with Riverdance in Mexico, California, and Arizona for October and November.  Great time.  I ate out every meal for two months and I am way too lazy to post up that many reviews.  It's all a blur in my mind at this point, so I figure I'll start fresh back where I belong in NYC.  Went to the relatively new Good Fork restaurant in Red Hook last night for my brother's 18th birthday.  The food and architectural decor are very hip and contemporary yet comforting and cozy at the same time.  I hate to copy-cat the New York Magazine review, but I thought the exact same thing when I walked into the place:  ""the Good Fork feels homespun, with mini-booths and a vaguely nautical curved-wood ceiling.""  I would describe the food as eclectic American with an occasional Korean flare.  I ordered the tuna tar-tare special appetizer of the evening ($8) followed by Korean style steak and eggs served on a bed of kimchee rice ($18).  The sauce was deliciously unique, the portions were just the right size, and the prices were reasonable.  The cocktail and wine lists are also pretty impressive.  Had to start the night off right with a champagne, gin, and lemon juice concoction, followed by a bottle of red wine.  (No, not to myself, although I am known to raise eyebrows by ordering the personal bottle from time to time.)Anyway, I will definitely be going back to this place.  They seemed to be doing a very good business on a Sunday night so get there on the early side and check out The Good Fork.",5.0
"I came here on a trip to NYC and I heard about this place on Food Network.  The appetizer dumplings were the BEST dumplings I've ever had.  They were so good that we got 2 orders of the dumplings.. YUM..  The kimchee rice with steak and eggs were great.  The only thing I would change is to add an extra egg.  Even though the host told us to order both the appetizer and entree at once since it might take a while..it didn't take a while, in my opinion.  Definitely would go here again.",5.0
"We were late for our reservations...twice! We called to let them know and they were so nice about saving our spot. We were seated immediately. The building itself is small, but it didn't feel overcrowded. Instead, it felt like our table was the only one there. We got two orders of pork dumplings, crabcakes, and fish and chips as our appetizers.  The pork dumplings were good, they were beautiful and tasty without being oily. The surprise was how good the fish and chips were...and the lotus chips themselves.We all had different entrees. We had Steaks and Eggs, Tofu and Eggs, Spare Ribs, and a hamburger. The steak and eggs were truly excellent. Spare Ribs and hamburger said they would eat the steak on the next visit. Although hamburger was really impressed with his food. He said that it was close to Dumont Burger goodness.The bread pudding was slightly disappointing. I thought it would be richer I guess. That might be a flaw on my sweet tooth though.

"I had a great experience last night at the Good Fork. The food, staff, and setting were all wonderful.

What's probably best is the incredible hospitality shown by the host, who designed and built the restaurant (his wife does the menu and cooking).
