I enjoyed here the other day especially I was treated by my cousin!I ordered their fresh-mixed salad and Pepperoni pizza by which the size of ones head! Freshly cooked pizza made perfectly. It was filled with lots of toppings and sticky melted cheese!I was even thankful for a very organized place (table and chairs are well arranged)The Customers great! service is fast and staffs was very responsive!I wouldn't hesitate to suggest this place!,4.0
"Amazing pizza!Came here with a group of friends while sightseeing. Waited around 20-30 minutes for pizza, but was totally worth it. Pizza was phenomenal- coal oven thin crust pizza at its finest. Crust was thin yet chewy. Ingredients were all fresh, and pizza came straight from the oven. What more could you ask for? For authentic New York pizza, this is the place to go.",5.0
"Best pizza around! This is your classic New York experience! Don't whine about the line being long or the customer service not being up to tee! It's New York people! Last week we walked up with 9 people in our party, and the line was going around the store, and we got seated in like 15 minutes. No complains here! We were soooo happy! And yes the pizza is a little on the pricey side, however it totally worth it!!! You will never have a pizza pie like this anywhere else!",5.0
"Good thing i know a guy who knows a guy who dated a girl who knew a guy because we got seated as soon as we walked in !! ..... ok i actually dont know anyone but we got lucky lmao .It doesn't get any better than Grimaldi's pizza , the fresh pizza , fresh toppings my oh my i can't get enough of it !! When in brooklyn you have to come and experience pizza heaven here , just make sure you come hungry because the small was more tham enough for 3 of us.Only problem is after eating pizza here you'll never enjoy pizza anywhere else so be prepared to say good bye to all the other pizzerias. The location- beautiful with an amzing view of the city (Manhattan) and the Hudson river and Brooklyn Bridge. The staff- Aces , the waiter took the time to tell us what his favorite topping combo amd the crowd favorites were and checked on us often to see if we were pleased and or wanted anything else.The price - very inexpensive when you consider the quality,  quantity and location of where you're eating. Hands down the best pizza !!",5.0
"Yes, I was one of those tourist that came all the way to Brooklyn for potential hipster sightings and Grimaldi's. Arriving around 2:30pm, we missed the lunch crowds and just walked right in to order our medium sausage and pepperoni. Within minutes the piping hot pie came out and like a real New Yorker I folded my pizza in half and devoured my first slice of Grimaldi's. The crust was light and chewy, but my favorite was the quality cheese.I highly recommend going for ""lunner"" to avoid crowds. Don't forget it's cash only and if you need change, tell them! My date was expecting around $0.70 in change, but they never brought it back. I'm guessing they thought it was tip?",4.0
"Brick oven pizza. I don't really see the difference in taste. It just sounds cool to have your pizza baked in a BRICK oven... instead of a stainless steel oven? I don't get it. It's a bit expensive too. A small cheese pizza is ~16 and you have to pay extra for each additional topping. My mama and I shares a small cheese pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. Ended up being around 25. You get like 3 pieces each. It is filling but that's because there was only two of us ha. They give you plates and utensils...but like who eats pizza with a fork and a knife?! This ain't some fancy shmancy restaurant. Yet.. the tables around us were cutting up their pizza into small bite pieces. I didn't care. I just went grabbed that pizza with my bare hands and nom nom-ed into it like a starving lion. I totally see this as a touristy place. Ironically, we were part of the tourist group too. My mind was not totally blown so I probably would not go out of my way to come here the next time I'm in NYC. Sorry, folks! OH and also, CASH ONLY!!! So dumb.",3.0
"Pizza is brick oven style and extremely tasty.    Tasted especially good after walking over the Brooklyn Bridge... With that aside, no beer or wine is available, plates / silverware is plastic (disposable style), service is brusque (I was bumped into by various waiters several times), pizza only (no salad or other dishes) and they only accept cash.Good for what it is - brick oven pizza only... especially good if you're hungry.",3.0
"When the moon hits your eye , like a big pizza pie...that's Amore. No wonder Grimaldi's is a world renowned pizzeria & in business for over 100 years- the pizza is AMAZING!! Thin crust dough topped with fresh mozzarella and plum tomatoes cooked in an old brick oven pizza...one delicious pizza.  It's so light & airy...it's dangerous because you lose count of how many slices you've had. Goes down so easily!!! Incredible crispy crust with  those beautiful tomatoes ...FAGETABOTIT.   When they say ""there's a line"", that's no joke! I pulled up at 11:20...(they open at 11:30) and there was already a line down the block. I didn't mind because I knew I wanted this delicious delight.  Even though I took my pizza pie to go, I saw plenty of tables to dine-in & even a bar. Yes , it's very old skool & they mean business here. It's all about what kind of pizza you want & get out. It's not you fancy schmancy spot to sit an hand out for a few hours. Located right underneath the Brooklyn Bridge & Parking the car can be a little tough , but you'll manage.  Circle the block a few times because I it's well worth it.",5.0
"I was told by a very trusted friend that this is THE place for pizza in New York and a must visit for my first time in the Big Apple. It seems I was very fortunate to have missed the long lines others have reviewed about as the place was only about half full when I arrived so grabbing a seat at the bar was super easy. They did fill up during the time I was there which was mid afternoon and it seemed like mostly people from out of town so yeah, definitely glad I stopped in when I did.This place is about as close to what I was expecting a New York pizza place to be with ambiance, history, and character for days. The staff was mostly on top of things although not 100% attentive at all times. I could have used one more water refill but no big deal.For my late lunch, I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and sausage and I am glad to have come in very hungry because the pie was very big. Even the couple next to me, who also ordered a small, struggled to finish theirs. I did my best but unfortunately had to leave it unfinished for fear of gorging myself into oblivion although I suppose that would have been a nice way to go because the pizza was just that good. Seriously, this must be what people are talking about when they say you can't get the same New York pizza anywhere else. The other places I visited during my trip were pretty standard slices that you might find anywhere but Grimaldi's is definitely in a class all its own.",5.0
The pizza is just amazing!!!Thin and crisp that you won't find anywhere else.Highly recommend for place to hang out. Cash only,4.0

"My traveling buddy from Australia was eager to try this upon reading rave reviews about this place. As we went during winter time, the wait wasn' t too bad compared to summer.Secondly, if you're grabbing takeaway, it's much quicker. Overall, I've had better pizza. But the secret is the ingredients and cheese that they used, were fresh with good quality ingredients. Also how they cook it in a charcoal oven. That's what makes it a pizza that can't be missed! Service is efficient and quick, except for the long line to get to your table. Also, this place only accepts cash. Not unusual for a place that's been around for such a long time.",4.0
"I went there once for dinner with two friends. The location is really nice, the waiters are friendly as well as the owner. The problem is the pizza, the pizza here is just terrible, it is a big NO. We ordered one big pizza with different condiment, and we left half of that. I paid and we left the restaurant so hungry that we went to the Shake Shake on the corner. I just hate do that. I'm sorry but i won't go there again or recommend this place to anybody.",2.0
"Located just at the end of the Brooklyn Bridge, this was perfect after a stroll across the bridge.  We came here at about 7pm (dinner time) and the wait was over an hour.  We decided to order a pizza to-go while we waited in line for Juliana's.  The pizza was ready in less than 20 minutes and we scarfed this down in less than 10. This was the most memorable pizza I had while visiting New York.  I tried both Grimaldi's and Juliana's (next door) but what here's what stood out to me for GRIMALDI's:+  Thin, but chewy/soft pizza dough+  Fresh tasting tomato sauce, and the perfect ratio to cheese and crust+  Fresh and delicious pieces of chopped garlicThe ratio of all the ingredients were perfect!  We ordered a tomato sauce, sausage, and garlic pizza and I could immediately say that this is one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  So yeah... the HYPE is REAL!",5.0
"Thin crust pizza at its best.  We ordered one margherita and one white cheese pizza.  You could def taste how fresh everything was.  Aside from the obvious fact that you can see them making pizzas and piling on (fresh) ingredients, you can taste it in the way the cheese pulled with every bite.  The white cheese was a tad bland, would recommend adding some toppings.There was no wait when we came here 20 min before closing on a Friday night.Here's the Grimaldi Etiquette 101:*Cash only*They don't sell by the slice*Extra charge for each additional toppings*No beer/alcohol (yet)*A Small & Large are literally like the same thing - HUGE*Fairly large (and old) establishment*(Mildly) clean restrooms availableTotal NY experience - Check.",4.0
"Great location! I've been to Grimaldi's a long time ago when they used to be in the smaller space located next door with long lines. Now that the lines are gone there's a lot of space, the pizza remains excellent, and the service is really fast. The manager was particularly nice. He ushered me in to wait indoors for the rest of my party. As for the pizza, I enjoyed it. We had two large pizzas, with 4 toppings of cheese, mushroom, sausage and ham. What I love is the basil and delicious mozzarella cheese. I'll return and recommend for sure.",4.0
"I visited this place because one of our friends was very eager to visit this place. There is an incredibly long wait outside and an even longer wait inside. For a place where you wait so long for food, our expectations were so high, but I felt the food was just about okay. I think I have had better pizza in Austin in all honesty. The wait inside was the longest after we had ordered. There were seven of us, and we ordered 2 large pizzas (Cheese & sausage/ mushroom). This place has no pre-picked menu, meaning you have to choose from a variety of toppings and create your own pizza. After a long wait, we got the pizza and it was good, but definitely not the best I have had. I read some previous reviews, and I hear the place next door is owned by the previous owner of Grimaldi's, so I kind of wish I had visited that one instead (which also had an incredibly long wait). Overall, pizza was good, not too salty or oily, and the crust was chewy, but really was missing that oven pizza after-taste and flavor I was looking for.This place is a top tourist attraction, so if you are into that, it is worth trying once, but if you want to try truly good pizza, I think there are some other places to try.",3.0

"Not worth the hype. Came here expecting rave worthy pizza but was disappointed with probably the worst pizza I've ever tasted in my life. When coming here you have to know a couple of things: no cash, no concept of taking food home, and the pizzas are pretty large - even for a small that is good enough for two people, as it says on the menu. So I ate a small pizza with mushroom topping, $14 pizza and the mushrooms cost $2 extra. The wait time wasn't bad at all but the actual pizza itself was extremely disappointing.More sauce than cheese and the crust was burnt. I knew the crust was going to be thin, something that I don't really like in pizza but having it burnt AND soggy from the amount of sauce was just unappetizing. I feel like a pizza with out a decent amount of cheese shouldn't be called a pizza itself either, but I guess that's just me. Had to eat all of it though because of their no take home policy, but all I know is that I will not be back again. I don't know what's the hype about.",1.0

"After a long stroll around the city, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in here and end the day the right way with some good old fashioned NYC pizza.Since it was just the two of us, we were seated relatively quickly despite the long line.

We had a nice chat with the other patrons though, so it ended up being only semi-awkward by the end.You can't order by the slice here, so we opted for the classic white pie. It was definitely phenomenal pizza--gooey and authentic mozzarella cheese just cannot be beat. It was too easy to polish the whole thing off in one sitting.All in all, I'm not sure if I'd come back here. The pizza was to die for, but I'd prefer to go without the gruff service and bizarre seating. With so many great options in Brooklyn, I think I'll take my business elsewhere next time!",3.0

We just came to see what the hype was about. He laughed and was totally understanding. He even rearrange our seats so that we were comfortable.

CASH ONLYFirst time at the Original Grimaldi's Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night. Was assuming there would be a long line after readings reviews but for some reason there was none. We were seated quickly and it was moderately busy.Pizza:Ordered a LARGE : about 8 slices (shared between 3 people)toppings: pepperoni and mushroomsPizza came out within 10mins (pretty quick). Presentation was very scrumptious. Lots of pepperoni and mushrooms on the pizza. Notice there was a couple basil leaves on the pizza. Crust was perfect.  Quality was very good. The melted mozzarella(high quality) cheese was perfect. Each bite had pepperoni and mushroom. My pet-peeve was I had to fold the pizza up since the toppings and cheese would slide off and the dough was kind soggy under the sauce/ cheese/ toppings. I think if left in a few more minutes it would have been perfect. Large pizza was perfect for 3 people got about 2 big slices each and had to take the other 2 home.Service:Friendly. Quick. Good.Overall:Would like to give 5 stars but cash only and kinda soggy under the sauce/ cheese/ topping hard to eat with hands. Other than that still a good pie.,4.0

And a long queue did form. After a 15 mins wait we went in and were served really quickly. Which was good and bad. Good we were fed really quickly. Bad, the staff hovering over our table to get us out quick so they could seat the next lot of people. Pizza was good. But the whole attitude of the business took away from my experience.

We tried coming here before on this trip but just figured we'd give it one more try before leaving NYC and if it wasn't meant to be then so be it. Looks like the pizza Gods wanted is to try it so we got in with ease! Couple things to note:-no slices -no resos -no delivery-cash only-if you THINK you'll be hungry and craving for pizza, GO WAIT IN LINE IN ADVANCE. You'll get hungry by the time they seat you. - pizza comes out FAST! prob in 10 mins (give or take).",5.0
Sorry BURNT crust isn't my idea of good pizza.Tried the Margareta style on a Bus Tour..I don't even think I tasted any Basil. This is one Pizza joint I won't return to.,1.0

"Got in right on time before it got packed. THE AMBIANCE:Grimaldi's is one of those pizzerias where you feel like you just walked into your grandparent's house.

It's also great because it's not oily on your hands or on the plate unlike the other usual pizzas that you can get from other restaurants.

I was disappointed with the other ingredients though. The meatballs are definitely not homemade. They are slices of something very highly processed. Did not have the look of meat at all just a sad gray circle. Pepperonis were fine but I wish there were more mushrooms, there were not too many to be found.

"Gotta say that Grimaldi's makes a very good pizza.The pie is thin with natural tomato sauce. And they have a few toppings options to customize your pizza. I always choose sausage with something.The place is an old house, with lots of seats on both floors. Still, there's a 99% chance of lines outside. The place became a touristic attraction as well; you don't see many residents here. Probably because it's near the pier, with a breathtaking view of Manhattan.It's a great place to visit though.Even if there's a line, you'll eat in 30 minutes or less. The service is very fast. Just an advice: bring cash!!!",4.0

"The first time I came here was over 6 years ago at the old location. My most recent visit happened on an early Sunday afternoon with friends during our self-created pizza tour. Because it was early and the new location is way more spacious, there was no waiting time to get a table.Ambience: New location is three floor and quite spacious. Crowd ranges from young to old including many tourists. If you sit near the glass on the second floor you are able to watch them make the pizza which is pretty cool.Pizza: We had the margherita and just like the first time I had it, I was not impressed.  Maybe I should had gotten some toppings, but in the past I also had their white pizza and it was just ok.  It was good, but to me just not worth the hype.Service: Nothing out of this world but not bad.",2.0

"Great quality and fast. Went in on a weekday and has no wait. Ordered a small which easily fed two people and still had left overs. Our pizza came out pipping hot within 10 minutes of ordering. Cute checked table clothes. Great toppings and is the type of pizza you can fold to eat. I will say that latter I did try pizza at Artichoke and it was a different style, but something a bit more flavoreful. Overall check it out, but also check out Artichoke for a slice.",4.0

"The first time I went to Grimaldis was last Sunday, and I must say it was worth the wait. Yes, you must wait on line to be seated. I was lucky enough to arrive at Grimalids when the line was very short and only had to wait 15 minutes. As I was told, the line gets too long and the wait ridiculous. Trust me the wait is worth it. You can choose a small (16"") or large (18"") pizza with any topic you desire. It's brick oven made, making the pizza's crust very soft and making thin slices of pizza. I advice anyone to go but try to keep a small party so you can be seated faster. Enjoy!!",4.0
"I came here last night with my husband and two toddlers. We had such a great experience. Manager saw that we had two little ones and told us not to wait on line outside that it was too cold. We waited about 15min inside and then we were seated. We ordered a large pie with cheese, sauce & basil. Its was amazing we had to order another pie because we finished it so fast. A large pie is $16!! Which is excellent!! I had four slices and my husband had six! Lol. And after my husband had a cappuccino that was delish and they gave the kids a dessert on the house. It was the best pizza i honestly ever had. I cant wait to go back for some pizza!! If you are a pizza lover this is for sure the place to go!! Two thumbs up!!",5.0

"Gotta say that Grimaldi's makes a very good pizza.The pie is thin with natural tomato sauce. And they have a few toppings options to customize your pizza. I always choose sausage with something.The place is an old house, with lots of seats on both floors. Still, there's a 99% chance of lines outside. The place became a touristic attraction as well; you don't see many residents here. Probably because it's near the pier, with a breathtaking view of Manhattan.It's a great place to visit though.Even if there's a line, you'll eat in 30 minutes or less. The service is very fast. Just an advice: bring cash!!!",4.0
"This place is delicious. The small calzone was HUGE and overflowing with cheese!We ordered two large pizzas. One with cheese and pepperoni, the other with meatball and mushrooms. Thin pizzas cooked to perfection!It was really cold today, so there was no line. On a normal day, plan on waiting. It's worth it!!",5.0
"The first time I came here was over 6 years ago at the old location. My most recent visit happened on an early Sunday afternoon with friends during our self-created pizza tour. Because it was early and the new location is way more spacious, there was no waiting time to get a table.Ambience: New location is three floor and quite spacious. Crowd ranges from young to old including many tourists. If you sit near the glass on the second floor you are able to watch them make the pizza which is pretty cool.Pizza: We had the margherita and just like the first time I had it, I was not impressed.  Maybe I should had gotten some toppings, but in the past I also had their white pizza and it was just ok.  It was good, but to me just not worth the hype.Service: Nothing out of this world but not bad.",2.0
"I've had a lot of pizza in my life and Grimaldi's ranks up there with the best.  On my visit I got a pepperoni, sausage and basil pizza.  The tables were small, but the pizza was damn good. If you make your way to NYC head over to Brooklyn for a legit pizza.  A few tips:- Go early- Bring cash- Buy more than you need and always add basil.",5.0
"Great quality and fast. Went in on a weekday and has no wait. Ordered a small which easily fed two people and still had left overs. Our pizza came out pipping hot within 10 minutes of ordering. Cute checked table clothes. Great toppings and is the type of pizza you can fold to eat. I will say that latter I did try pizza at Artichoke and it was a different style, but something a bit more flavoreful. Overall check it out, but also check out Artichoke for a slice.",4.0

"The first time I went to Grimaldis was last Sunday, and I must say it was worth the wait. Yes, you must wait on line to be seated. I was lucky enough to arrive at Grimalids when the line was very short and only had to wait 15 minutes. As I was told, the line gets too long and the wait ridiculous. Trust me the wait is worth it. You can choose a small (16"") or large (18"") pizza with any topic you desire. It's brick oven made, making the pizza's crust very soft and making thin slices of pizza. I advice anyone to go but try to keep a small party so you can be seated faster. Enjoy!!",4.0
"I came here last night with my husband and two toddlers. We had such a great experience. Manager saw that we had two little ones and told us not to wait on line outside that it was too cold. We waited about 15min inside and then we were seated. We ordered a large pie with cheese, sauce & basil. Its was amazing we had to order another pie because we finished it so fast. A large pie is $16!! Which is excellent!! I had four slices and my husband had six! Lol. And after my husband had a cappuccino that was delish and they gave the kids a dessert on the house. It was the best pizza i honestly ever had. I cant wait to go back for some pizza!! If you are a pizza lover this is for sure the place to go!! Two thumbs up!!",5.0
"We came here on a rainy day on the last leg of our trip.  The wait wasn't terrible because of the poor weather- score!  However, there was a large group waiting outside of the restaurant when we arrived .  We didn't know it was just one big group and stood behind them for about 15-20 minutes.  I finally went in and asked the host if we had to sign in.  They seated us immediately!  After I went in to ask, other people that were waiting went to sign in and was seated shortly after us.  Shame on me for not asking sooner.  Shame on them for not having the courtesy to tell everyone waiting in the rain to sign in!  At least put out a sign or something.  Sheesh. For three people, we got a large pizza ($16) with italian sausage ($2).  Lots of toppings to choose from and they range between $2-$5.  It took awhile for the pizza to come out but it was so delicious when it did!  Thinly sliced pizza with lots of ooey gooey mozzarella, delicious ""famous pizza sauce"" and basil!  I wish there was more basil... some pieces were crispy!  I liked how it's not super salty and the crust wasn't too thick/thin.  Amazing prices for the quality!  You can watch them make the pizza at the front of the restaurant.  They use really simple and fresh ingredients.  My favorite pizza joint in NYC at the moment.",4.0
"okay so first time I've ever been this past January. Damn i wish they had one of these in Toronto. Super old- school and laid back. I think the red and white picnic cloths are super cute touch. What i loved: - the pizza was made in the front, where everyone could see - they had a lot of natural lighting coming in (i was there during the day) - the staff were super nice and had a couple recommendations what i wish was different (not gonna say what i didn't love because i loved everything)- they didn't sell the pizza by the slice :( all in all: the pizza was ONE OF THE BEST i've had in my life.

It was big enough for the both of us to eat our fill. You have to wait a while (at least 15 minutes even if you're next in line) to get in. CASH ONLY... so don't be bringing in no fancy shmancy credit cards.

"Okay, so finally made my way under the Brooklyn Bridge to try this place. Two friends and I arrived and the line was backed up around the corner.

He directs us inside to be greeted by the waitress who couldn't more obviously show a hatred of her job. We ordered the original large pie. Waited around inside for a good five minutes or so, enjoying the old celebrity photographs on the walls, Sinatra, etc. The same man from the door came over and told us we need to stand outside to wait for the pizza to be ready - um... okay? After about 20 minutes it was ready. Carrying it out on a piece of cardboard wrapped in a giant size brown bag (pizza + 3 sodas, $26 later, by the way) we chowed down.Considering the hype, the pizza was mediocre at best. Sauce was incredible, I'll give them that. However, the pizza was undercooked, greasy, and didn't fill us up at all. I'm a small guy and could've eaten all 8 slices by myself. As a native New Yorker, I'd call it ""a solid pie."" I understand NYC tourists who consider Dominos ""good pizza"" probably compare trying this place to discovering fire. The staff was incredibly rude, but they can be and they know it, because no matter what tourists are always going to try it. Overall, was the pizza good? Yes. Something to go crazy over? No. Will I go back? Probably not.",3.0

"Every good New yorker,and tourist is always dieing to try this place out, definitely lot of hype. I dont know it was great pizza, but not the best I ever had. Came here last night for dinner. Got soo lucky no infamous long lines like other yelpers mentioned. We got seated in the very back facing the wall. No biggie we were just happy we got a seat. Not two mins in, a waiter comes along asking if there were three of us. To which we replied just us two. He makes really stupid skeptical face saying well if they get more pple in they will have to take our other half of the table. Its not like we wont let them, but was it really necessary to run up to us, and say that just as we sat down. First thing that threw me off for the night. A few mins later another waiter came to take our order. Menu is very straight forward with few selections, and cash only! We decided on the a large pizza with olives and mushroom. I didnt like that waiter really didnt have any emotion. Its like he didnt want to be there. I will say pizza came out in record time. Less than ten minutes. This time this waiter was smiling. I will refer to him as tall guy with the hair bun.  Pizza tasted great! That think crust of theirs' is unbeatable. My only complaint are the olives way too salty. Yes, menu did say salted cured olives. It was just too overbearing. I had to pick them off when I had my second slice. We finished our meal and wanted the check. None of the waiters were even looking in our direction. Service is really bad. Not once did anyone check on us after we got our pizza or even refilled our water. Tall waiter with hair bun came to rescuse. My husband was able to make eye contact him. He quickly wrapped our leftovers, and brought the check. He was very attentive and friendly. Rest of the staff was awful. Espically that young punk. Noone even took that table next to us. Overall, nice decor of the restuarant. Very rustic and old school Italian feel to it. Pizza was great but not the best ever. For all the hype bout this place expected something more. Service needs some improvement.

"With my most recent visit Id figured it was time for a quick update. New location the place now looks better , bigger & certainly more space for seating this does not make the wait times any easier but certainly helps since the new location is two floors. Of all the times I have been here I gotta say never really had to experience those crazy long lines maybe it's the time's I've come or days but no matter what day & time u stop by u are likely to have to wait even if it's for a short time since this place seems to always be packed. As for the pizza what can I say , it's delicious extra cheese is always a must along with , ham , pepperoni or Italian sausage a combo of these or on their own has always proven to be delicious. Gotta love the freshness & taste of the fresh mozzarella on that nice thin Brick oven crust yumm  so good really hard to come here & not eat a whole pie at least that's always the case w me & my company.  Aside from the wait time which we know can be crazy , service has always been good quick & easy.Prices can't go wrong very affordable.I decide to up the stars in my review because I have been coming here for years & have yet to be disappointed always a plus in my book when the food is delicious & keeps u coming back.",5.0
I was really excited to go back to Grimaldi's and was really surprised when there was no line when we arrived a little after 5 pm on a Friday. It seems like this place is not what it used to be. The pizza was average although you could tell the cheese they use was very good quality.  I would have liked the crust a little more well done. It just didn't live up to my memory of when I came a few years ago. The service was even more disappointing than the pizza. At times it was hard to find anyone to fill up our water glasses. And the check took forever. I am sad to say the next time I walk the Brooklyn Bridge I will skip this place.,2.0
"This place could easily be a 4, if not a 5 star establishment if the review was based on their pizza's alone. But all things considered, they are a perfect 3.I have tried to go to Grimaldi's before (on weekends) and both times was put off by the long lines to get in. This time I went midweek and they've moved, presumably to a larger premises, so there was no line. As we walked in the ""host"" pointed to the stairs and said ""up there"".""Up there"" were a couple of waiters stood chatting who, after they had finished their conversation looked at us as if we had walked in uninvited to their house. When we were seated, or more accurately; when they pointed and told us where to sit, we were surprised by how hot it was in there - it was a 90 degree day and they AC was fighting a losing battle, if fighting at all. The menu is simple but exactly what you want; pizza; large or small. The pizza's are reasonably priced and additional toppings are too. We went with a small pepperoni to share and I had a soda too. A few minutes later they came and dumped a plastic bottle of soda and 2 waters on the table and walked off, nice. At that point I also noticed by plate wasn't completely clean but I just decided to deal with it.The pizza came and it was fantastic. The crust was light and crispy, the tomato sauce rich and delicious, the pepperoni was crunchy and the cheese light (not greasy) and flavorful. Up there with the best pizza in the city.No one came to ask how our meal was, no one came to refill our waters, in fact, the waiters (there were plenty of them) were either slouching on a chair looking bored or busy chatting amongst themselves.I guess they don't need to care as Grimaldi's is an institution in NYC and tourists flock here day and night. The restaurant really filled up as we were there and reluctantly the waiters had to up their game to turn around tables quickly. They would loudly drop plates and cutlery into a box by the bar ready to go and be washed.The atmosphere was surprisingly subdued for such a busy restaurant. There was music on sporadically but otherwise the only really buzz came from the wait staff with their inside jokes. The rest of the restaurant was quiet - probably as we were all slowly dying from the lack of air conditioning. Or devouring the great pizza to be fair.We asked for our check and again the guy dumped it in front of my fiancee and walked off. I was pleased with the price, however.Having lived in NYC for 5 years I can finally say I have been to Grimaldi's and ticked it off of my list. But there are many other great pizza joints in NYC so I won't be back.",3.0
"I wasn't sure if having a coal fired pizza oven made a difference or not. One of my friends insisted I try Grimaldi's pizza because they use this type of oven. The pizza is very good. Thin crispy crust, the cheese was delicious too. Still not sure if the coal oven makes a huge difference or not, but their pizza is good. Eating here at the location under the Brooklyn Bridge adds an aura to the experience too. A short distance from the waterfront so you can eat and then walk it off whilst enjoying the skyline. CASH ONLY and they don't do slices here.",4.0
"My friend and I came here yesterday afternoon. Our experience was wonderful! Although there was a line, we waited no more than 20 minutes than the usual hour.I believe the head manager it owner was very nice. He ensured we were comfortable and even placed my friend's jacket on her chair :) he was very sweet. We were seated at the second floor. They had outlets which was convenient as my phone had died. We ordered the small basic pie, which took about 20 minutes as well. I would say the wait time was a little long for us. When we asked our waiter,""will it take ten more minutes?"" He had replied, ""probably"". He could've answered more professionally, but none-the-less, our pizza arrived a few moments later.The first bite was like a party in my mouth! The crust was just the right amount if crispyness and the pizza itself smelled divine! You can truly taste the fresh ingredients and coal fired crust. Absolutely delicious! I'd say the biggest plus was the amount we spent! Under $20! Our small pie was $12 ($2 a slice) and we decided to get drinks as well. Not too bad! The only downside would be that 1. You can only order by the pie, NOT slice.2. It is cash only (unfortunately) BUT...If you are looking for a great pizzeria with polite yet efficient service and at an affordable price ( bargain!), I highly recommend Grimaldi's in Brooklyn! :)",4.0
I don't really like pizza but I like this place. Got the white pizza with chicken and extra mozzarella. There is a bit of a wait and it is pricier but it is relatively good pizza. Not too heavy.,3.0
"The lines outside were daunting and long, but there was surprisingly a good amount of space inside so the line moved fairly quickly.  The 5 of us got seated on the second floor and ordered a large regular pizza with chicken, sweet peppers, and olives... and the pizza was just ok for me - I was looking forward to some New York Pizza, and I guess I was expecting more of a thin / crunchy crust vs thicker one, I didn't taste much of the sauce or cheese, and nothing really stood out.   It could have been the combination of ingredients we got which overpowered the basics, but I still think basics should stand out on their own and the other things compliment it vs overpower it.Servers were nice, but water refills were rare, they never checked on whether we liked our pizza and they seemed to go out of their way to scold the kids we were with quite a bit, which I found quite odd.The menu also said you could get toppings for a half a pizza or a whole pizza, but I didn't realize that if you ordered half one combo, and half another combo, that you'd be charged full price for it as if you got a whole pizza of all the ingredients... so it came to about $26 for a mediocre pizza.. and they don't take Credit card.  I wish I had known that in advance - I only had $40 on me, so I used it to pay for the bill and then was surprised that the server never came back to give me my change and just pocketed the rest?  Not cool.  Hope I have a better NYC pizza experience before I leave!",3.0

"I'm torn on what rating to give...The food a solid 4 stars. It was good, not THE best i've ever had. but it's pretty high up there. Def only get the small for 2 people, it's plenty! We had the pepperoni which was actually the best part of the pizza.The service is easily a 1 star. They seemed bothered that we were even in the joint. Plopped down the soda on the table took the order, never refilled our water (89 degree day after walking the BK bridge and there's barely a hint of AC in the restaurant). Grabbed our check again no words just plopped it on the table. I guess they don't need to care with all the tourists they get coming in. The ambiance is again a 1 star. No real AC and just table fans filling the place on again a hot and humid day. No music. No tv's on (though there were tv's on the wall). All you could hear was the table next to you.Going with a 3 because i'd much rather go to any other NY pizza joint that is just as good at a better price without the 'tude and the schlep to Brooklyn from Manhattan.ps CASH ONLY",3.0
The pizza is ok. The service is nonexistent and the restaurant experience was nothing special. We waited in line outside for an hour (if you wanna get inside quick then you should go in large groups since they seat the big groups first no matter how long you've waited in line) and got seated finally only to wait another 30 mins for our food. We got our pizza and to my surprise it felt like I was eating pizza from any of the pizza places in New York. It was ok. Had I known I would've just ran into a small shop and grabbed a slice and went on my way. Sadly it's one of those restaurants that you only try once. Too bad Grimaldis.,2.0

Gotta love the freshness & taste of the fresh mozzarella on that nice thin Brick oven crust yumm  so good really hard to come here & not eat a whole pie at least that's always the case w me & my company.  Aside from the wait time which we know can be crazy , service has always been good quick & easy.Prices can't go wrong very affordable.I decide to up the stars in my review because I have been coming here for years & have yet to be disappointed always a plus in my book when the food is delicious & keeps u coming back.",5.0
I was really excited to go back to Grimaldi's and was really surprised when there was no line when we arrived a little after 5 pm on a Friday. It seems like this place is not what it used to be. The pizza was average although you could tell the cheese they use was very good quality.  I would have liked the crust a little more well done. It just didn't live up to my memory of when I came a few years ago. The service was even more disappointing than the pizza. At times it was hard to find anyone to fill up our water glasses. And the check took forever. I am sad to say the next time I walk the Brooklyn Bridge I will skip this place.,2.0
"This place could easily be a 4, if not a 5 star establishment if the review was based on their pizza's alone. But all things considered, they are a perfect 3.I have tried to go to Grimaldi's before (on weekends) and both times was put off by the long lines to get in. This time I went midweek and they've moved, presumably to a larger premises, so there was no line. As we walked in the ""host"" pointed to the stairs and said ""up there"".""Up there"" were a couple of waiters stood chatting who, after they had finished their conversation looked at us as if we had walked in uninvited to their house. When we were seated, or more accurately; when they pointed and told us where to sit, we were surprised by how hot it was in there - it was a 90 degree day and they AC was fighting a losing battle, if fighting at all. The menu is simple but exactly what you want; pizza; large or small. The pizza's are reasonably priced and additional toppings are too. We went with a small pepperoni to share and I had a soda too. A few minutes later they came and dumped a plastic bottle of soda and 2 waters on the table and walked off, nice. At that point I also noticed by plate wasn't completely clean but I just decided to deal with it.The pizza came and it was fantastic. The crust was light and crispy, the tomato sauce rich and delicious, the pepperoni was crunchy and the cheese light (not greasy) and flavorful. Up there with the best pizza in the city.No one came to ask how our meal was, no one came to refill our waters, in fact, the waiters (there were plenty of them) were either slouching on a chair looking bored or busy chatting amongst themselves.I guess they don't need to care as Grimaldi's is an institution in NYC and tourists flock here day and night. The restaurant really filled up as we were there and reluctantly the waiters had to up their game to turn around tables quickly. They would loudly drop plates and cutlery into a box by the bar ready to go and be washed.The atmosphere was surprisingly subdued for such a busy restaurant. There was music on sporadically but otherwise the only really buzz came from the wait staff with their inside jokes. The rest of the restaurant was quiet - probably as we were all slowly dying from the lack of air conditioning. Or devouring the great pizza to be fair.We asked for our check and again the guy dumped it in front of my fiancee and walked off. I was pleased with the price, however.Having lived in NYC for 5 years I can finally say I have been to Grimaldi's and ticked it off of my list. But there are many other great pizza joints in NYC so I won't be back.",3.0
"I wasn't sure if having a coal fired pizza oven made a difference or not. One of my friends insisted I try Grimaldi's pizza because they use this type of oven. The pizza is very good. Thin crispy crust, the cheese was delicious too. Still not sure if the coal oven makes a huge difference or not, but their pizza is good. Eating here at the location under the Brooklyn Bridge adds an aura to the experience too. A short distance from the waterfront so you can eat and then walk it off whilst enjoying the skyline. CASH ONLY and they don't do slices here.",4.0
"My friend and I came here yesterday afternoon. Our experience was wonderful! Although there was a line, we waited no more than 20 minutes than the usual hour.I believe the head manager it owner was very nice. He ensured we were comfortable and even placed my friend's jacket on her chair :) he was very sweet. We were seated at the second floor. They had outlets which was convenient as my phone had died. We ordered the small basic pie, which took about 20 minutes as well. I would say the wait time was a little long for us. When we asked our waiter,""will it take ten more minutes?"" He had replied, ""probably"". He could've answered more professionally, but none-the-less, our pizza arrived a few moments later.The first bite was like a party in my mouth! The crust was just the right amount if crispyness and the pizza itself smelled divine! You can truly taste the fresh ingredients and coal fired crust. Absolutely delicious! I'd say the biggest plus was the amount we spent! Under $20! Our small pie was $12 ($2 a slice) and we decided to get drinks as well. Not too bad! The only downside would be that 1. You can only order by the pie, NOT slice.2. It is cash only (unfortunately) BUT...If you are looking for a great pizzeria with polite yet efficient service and at an affordable price ( bargain!), I highly recommend Grimaldi's in Brooklyn! :)",4.0
I don't really like pizza but I like this place. Got the white pizza with chicken and extra mozzarella. There is a bit of a wait and it is pricier but it is relatively good pizza. Not too heavy.,3.0
"The lines outside were daunting and long, but there was surprisingly a good amount of space inside so the line moved fairly quickly.  The 5 of us got seated on the second floor and ordered a large regular pizza with chicken, sweet peppers, and olives... and the pizza was just ok for me - I was looking forward to some New York Pizza, and I guess I was expecting more of a thin / crunchy crust vs thicker one, I didn't taste much of the sauce or cheese, and nothing really stood out.   It could have been the combination of ingredients we got which overpowered the basics, but I still think basics should stand out on their own and the other things compliment it vs overpower it.Servers were nice, but water refills were rare, they never checked on whether we liked our pizza and they seemed to go out of their way to scold the kids we were with quite a bit, which I found quite odd.The menu also said you could get toppings for a half a pizza or a whole pizza, but I didn't realize that if you ordered half one combo, and half another combo, that you'd be charged full price for it as if you got a whole pizza of all the ingredients... so it came to about $26 for a mediocre pizza.. and they don't take Credit card.  I wish I had known that in advance - I only had $40 on me, so I used it to pay for the bill and then was surprised that the server never came back to give me my change and just pocketed the rest?  Not cool.  Hope I have a better NYC pizza experience before I leave!",3.0
"It was alright, pizza was not life changing. Slightly on the soggy side around the center though. Not sure why. 3 dollar sodas and cash only too, bummer",3.0
"I'm torn on what rating to give...The food a solid 4 stars. It was good, not THE best i've ever had. but it's pretty high up there. Def only get the small for 2 people, it's plenty! We had the pepperoni which was actually the best part of the pizza.The service is easily a 1 star. They seemed bothered that we were even in the joint. Plopped down the soda on the table took the order, never refilled our water (89 degree day after walking the BK bridge and there's barely a hint of AC in the restaurant). Grabbed our check again no words just plopped it on the table. I guess they don't need to care with all the tourists they get coming in. The ambiance is again a 1 star. No real AC and just table fans filling the place on again a hot and humid day. No music. No tv's on (though there were tv's on the wall). All you could hear was the table next to you.Going with a 3 because i'd much rather go to any other NY pizza joint that is just as good at a better price without the 'tude and the schlep to Brooklyn from Manhattan.ps CASH ONLY",3.0
The pizza is ok. The service is nonexistent and the restaurant experience was nothing special. We waited in line outside for an hour (if you wanna get inside quick then you should go in large groups since they seat the big groups first no matter how long you've waited in line) and got seated finally only to wait another 30 mins for our food. We got our pizza and to my surprise it felt like I was eating pizza from any of the pizza places in New York. It was ok. Had I known I would've just ran into a small shop and grabbed a slice and went on my way. Sadly it's one of those restaurants that you only try once. Too bad Grimaldis.,2.0
"The service was awful, the wannabe owner/bouncer was ridiculous.  I was repulsed by the lack of respect when it came to the horrid redesign of what is a gorgeous building, the inside made me want to throw up in my mouth.   The pizza was soggy and oily, I should have ordered well done.

"So it's one of those obligatory, bucket list-y types of things to do. You go to Grimaldi's for some pizza, then you walk back across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan. After about 50 trips to New York, I finally got around to making this pizza pilgrimage. And I wasn't disappointed, but it wasn't really revelatory either. The restaurant is right on a corner just a couple of minute's walk from the bridge. We got there about ten minutes before noon on an Friday, which was a stroke of luck, because 15 minutes later there was a line outside waiting for a table, whereas we had walked right in. You can pick your own seat in this case. We got the small (which, trust me, isn't small--more than enough for two people) and added grilled chicken, onion, and sweet peppers. It came out a little lightish on the chicken and heavyish on the peppers, I thought. It was pretty tasty, with some nice char on the bottom of the crust, but the peppers were chopped too big and tended to overwhelm it. I pulled a few off and that helped. As for the service, it's what you'd expect--they take your order, they bring you your food, they collect the money (cash only). And don't even think about ordering a slice--full pies only, which I can't blame them for. Keeps the stock fresher. One major plus is the proximity to the pedestrian entrance to the bridge. That's a really spectacular walk and it only took us about 25 minutes. It's just minimal exertion and well worth the effort.",3.0
"This was the first Grimaldi in NYC. My husband's co workers recommended us to this place to try out their pizza and so we did. We arrived 20 minutes after they  opened on a Friday..and there was a line. We didn't have to wait too long since it was just the two of us and we were okay sitting at the bar. The downside of us sitting at the bar was it took forever for the waiters to come get our order. We sat for about 10 minutes before we even got our menu. No one came by to check up on us..it was only until another waiter walked by and asked if we got a menu  yet and we told him no then another waiter gave us a menu that was taken from another table. It took several more minutes for them to take our order. The pizza came out pretty quickly though. It's a simple menu..you order the type of pizza and the toppings you want. Cash only and no slices. We had the single regular pizza with 3 toppings.. The toppings are what drove the price up. We had it with italian sausage, onions, and mushrooms. Both my husband and I thought the pizza was okay. It wasn't spectacular. They also have no A/C so we were sweating inside. It took awhile for them to give us our check...in the end we just left our money on the bar and left. Service was a bit lacking, pizza was okay... will try Lombardi's the next time we're in town.",3.0
"Throughout my entire New York trip I was looking forward to coming to Grimaldi's to try their famous pizzas. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to sit down and enjoy their famous pizza. My mom, sister, brother and I went inside and waited patiently for our table. But some worker there rudely ushered us out saying that we need to make a line, so we decided to lean against the wall to form a line. Then this idiot came out again and told a different group that they can come in now. WAIT A SECOND, we were first so was this some sort of discrimination? I was like, no I'm not going to let this rude man destroy my wanting to try Grimaldi's so we waited and then we got our table. Inside it is extremely stuffy and not very ventilated. We sat down and ordered a plain mozarella, basil, and sauce pizza. I wanted to try this particular pizza to see how great Grimaldi's truly was. Our pizza came and I was so excited to take my first bite.................only to be severely disappointed and sad. Their sauce is bland and mediocre, tastes like it came out straight from the tomato can. Their cheese was extremely rubbery and unflavorful. Not enough basil to balance out the pizza. Also their pizza dough had a slight taste of garlic which was delightful only to be masked by the intensity of the salt used in their dough. It was a miracle for me to actually taste the garlic in their dough because the pizza crust/dough was extremely salty. The pizza in general was the worst I've ever had and I was greatly saddened because I came all the way to Brooklyn JUST to try Grimaldi's. Customer service was shit and so was the pizza. #TeamLombardi for the win. Lombardi's is WAY BETTER. The atmosphere is better, the customer service is extremely welcoming, and the pizza is out of this world. Grimaldi's isn't worth it. Extremely disappointed but I guess I at least tried it right?",1.0

The center of the pizza was still doughy, so that wasn't great... the outer half crust was how I liked it, crisp but not burnt or hard.

However, one of the other busboys/waiters packaged my leftovers and was better. Also the toilet seat in the women's bathroom was broken and one of the lights was out. A bit surprising given the notoriety of this establishment. Nevertheless, we found the pizza to be tasty and there is no line on one of the coldest days of the year to date!",4.0

"Grimaldi'sNY: Brooklyn: DUMBO1pm Saturday 2nd May 2015Five StarsIts not like I have anything special to add but for posterity's sake. Here goes:I had some San Diego Friends  in town and NY Pizza was on the todo list. So we started with bagels and ice cream and then meandered through Brooklyn Bridge Park to DUMBO.  The line was short. It only took 25 minutes to get a seat. We sat upstairs and watched them make pie after pie like a mechanized assembly line.  We ordered a Large with Pepperoni, Sausage, and fresh Jalapenos. In another 20 minutes, we got a fresh coal fired pizza.  The crust was thin and crispy with a hint of char.  The sauce was simple and very understated (I prefer way more sauce).  The fresh basil added a nice aroma.  It had plenty of pepperoni which were dime size in circumference but nickel size in thickness.  The Sausage was fatty and very moist.  The Jalapenos were still crispy and add plenty of spice. Overall, it was great pizza for a normal price at one of the most famous places in New York.  If you cannot cope with a wait then go somewhere else.

"If you expect the original style of Grimaldi's, you'd better forget that real quick. This place is nowhere near how it used to be, the way that made it famous. I went here on Saturday, November 14. The only positive thing about it was we were given a table (for 2) as soon as we walked in, no waiting time. Problem is the tables are tiny & extremely close together. Having to get up & go to the bathroom, I had to walk sideways & drag my ass on the table next to me. I'm sure they were thrilled. I knew it was gonna be a horrible start to the night when I asked what beers they had, which they have NONE. What kind of ""upscale"" pizzeria has no beer or wine? I had to order a root beer. Closest I'd get.We ordered the antipasto. Came on a white plastic plate (just like what was given for the pizza). It was anything but fresh. The mozz was previously frozen, hard, & dry. The salami was the Citterio kind you get from one of those presliced packages in a supermarket. Oh, & 3 olives were thrown on, with a bland slice or two of tomato. Gross. Now to the pizza. I've had pizza from all over NYC AND Italy (where my family is). It's near impossible to get pizza here like I've had in Italy. I've had pretty good pizza here though. Let's get back to the Grimaldi's pizza. This pizza was horrible. HORRIBLE. I asked if they had prosciutto as a topping, they didn't, as expected. Only American ham. So I got that with some ricotta that tasted old, frozen, just like the mozzarella was. The bottom of the dough was burnt. I mean black - burnt. The sauce tasted like it was store bought, Ragu-ish with a hint of tin can. Maybe Tutto Rosso, or some cheap brand. At least Red Pack would've been a step up. Only had 2 slices (my date too) & we couldn't bear to go on. To top it all off, the wait-staff wasn't even Italian.  They were all Albanian, with nasty ""I don't even want to be here"" attitudes & rudely and loudly speaking Albanian that it made everyone cringe. Definitely will not be revisiting this place. Stick to other spots that make really good pizza, like Lucali. Even though the hostess last time was snobby as hell, the pizza is worth it because the super friendly wait staff makes you feel at home.",1.0
"Went with a group for dinner and it was the best pizza I have had! The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because our group waited for about an hour in line just to be seated, but it is worth the wait! Our group split the large Margarita pizza and we each got a cannoli for dessert. It ended up being about $10 per person. The staff was great and the manager was very nice and hilarious. He went to every customer in the place and even chatted with us while we were waiting in line.

We had the single regular pizza with 3 toppings.. The toppings are what drove the price up. We had it with italian sausage, onions, and mushrooms. Both my husband and I thought the pizza was okay. It wasn't spectacular. They also have no A/C so we were sweating inside. It took awhile for them to give us our check...in the end we just left our money on the bar and left. Service was a bit lacking, pizza was okay... will try Lombardi's the next time we're in town.",3.0
"Throughout my entire New York trip I was looking forward to coming to Grimaldi's to try their famous pizzas. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to sit down and enjoy their famous pizza. My mom, sister, brother and I went inside and waited patiently for our table. But some worker there rudely ushered us out saying that we need to make a line, so we decided to lean against the wall to form a line. Then this idiot came out again and told a different group that they can come in now. WAIT A SECOND, we were first so was this some sort of discrimination? I was like, no I'm not going to let this rude man destroy my wanting to try Grimaldi's so we waited and then we got our table. Inside it is extremely stuffy and not very ventilated. We sat down and ordered a plain mozarella, basil, and sauce pizza. I wanted to try this particular pizza to see how great Grimaldi's truly was. Our pizza came and I was so excited to take my first bite.................only to be severely disappointed and sad. Their sauce is bland and mediocre, tastes like it came out straight from the tomato can. Their cheese was extremely rubbery and unflavorful. Not enough basil to balance out the pizza. Also their pizza dough had a slight taste of garlic which was delightful only to be masked by the intensity of the salt used in their dough. It was a miracle for me to actually taste the garlic in their dough because the pizza crust/dough was extremely salty. The pizza in general was the worst I've ever had and I was greatly saddened because I came all the way to Brooklyn JUST to try Grimaldi's. Customer service was shit and so was the pizza. #TeamLombardi for the win. Lombardi's is WAY BETTER. The atmosphere is better, the customer service is extremely welcoming, and the pizza is out of this world. Grimaldi's isn't worth it. Extremely disappointed but I guess I at least tried it right?",1.0
"I would have given this place only 3 stars, except we had no wait! Their was a lime, but we came only with 4 and they had a seat, vs the two groups that had 5/6. This place was recommended by EVERYONE, but i was disappointed.... it was good pizza but that was just it. It wasn't spectacular or amazing,  like everyone had said. The center of the pizza was still doughy, so that wasn't great... the outer half crust was how I liked it, crisp but not burnt or hard. We got a large with sausage and mushrooms and for the prices of $19, it was more expensive than most pizza joints in nyc. It is definitely worth a visit, but i would never make the trip again...",4.0
"Had a small jalapeño and sausage pizza between the two of us in our party. The mozzarella was not too gooey but still delicious. We were satisfied with the large size of the pizza (despite ordering a small) and it certainly tasted great. Our waiter never made eye contact and seemed standoffish. However, one of the other busboys/waiters packaged my leftovers and was better. Also the toilet seat in the women's bathroom was broken and one of the lights was out. A bit surprising given the notoriety of this establishment. Nevertheless, we found the pizza to be tasty and there is no line on one of the coldest days of the year to date!",4.0
Although this is the hipster dumbo area this is a pizza place you don't want to skip out on. The pizza is super cheesy and toppings are full of flavor and not dried like some other pizza places.  Can't wait to go back to get my fix. Authentic and fresh,5.0
"Grimaldi'sNY: Brooklyn: DUMBO1pm Saturday 2nd May 2015Five StarsIts not like I have anything special to add but for posterity's sake. Here goes:I had some San Diego Friends  in town and NY Pizza was on the todo list. So we started with bagels and ice cream and then meandered through Brooklyn Bridge Park to DUMBO.  The line was short. It only took 25 minutes to get a seat. We sat upstairs and watched them make pie after pie like a mechanized assembly line.  We ordered a Large with Pepperoni, Sausage, and fresh Jalapenos. In another 20 minutes, we got a fresh coal fired pizza.  The crust was thin and crispy with a hint of char.  The sauce was simple and very understated (I prefer way more sauce).  The fresh basil added a nice aroma.  It had plenty of pepperoni which were dime size in circumference but nickel size in thickness.  The Sausage was fatty and very moist.  The Jalapenos were still crispy and add plenty of spice. Overall, it was great pizza for a normal price at one of the most famous places in New York.  If you cannot cope with a wait then go somewhere else. Tips: To Stay and To Go = Same Line Cash Only No Single Slices Get a Large its worth the $2 Extra",5.0
"this was my second time here, and I absolutely enjoyed it as much as the first time. we walked across the Brooklyn bridge and then walked over here, very simple to find.there was a line outside as I had expected but it didn't take long to seat us as everyone in front of us was a group of two, and we had 3. I'd say we waiting maybe 10 minutes at the most. we ordered a vegetarian pizza with extra cheese, mushrooms and onions and had no problem finishing the large among the 3 of us. the fresh cheese definitely added extra flavour to the pizza. the pizza is worth the wait!",4.0
"If you expect the original style of Grimaldi's, you'd better forget that real quick. This place is nowhere near how it used to be, the way that made it famous. I went here on Saturday, November 14. The only positive thing about it was we were given a table (for 2) as soon as we walked in, no waiting time. Problem is the tables are tiny & extremely close together. Having to get up & go to the bathroom, I had to walk sideways & drag my ass on the table next to me. I'm sure they were thrilled. I knew it was gonna be a horrible start to the night when I asked what beers they had, which they have NONE. What kind of ""upscale"" pizzeria has no beer or wine? I had to order a root beer. Closest I'd get.We ordered the antipasto. Came on a white plastic plate (just like what was given for the pizza). It was anything but fresh. The mozz was previously frozen, hard, & dry. The salami was the Citterio kind you get from one of those presliced packages in a supermarket. Oh, & 3 olives were thrown on, with a bland slice or two of tomato. Gross. Now to the pizza. I've had pizza from all over NYC AND Italy (where my family is). It's near impossible to get pizza here like I've had in Italy. I've had pretty good pizza here though. Let's get back to the Grimaldi's pizza. This pizza was horrible. HORRIBLE. I asked if they had prosciutto as a topping, they didn't, as expected. Only American ham. So I got that with some ricotta that tasted old, frozen, just like the mozzarella was. The bottom of the dough was burnt. I mean black - burnt. The sauce tasted like it was store bought, Ragu-ish with a hint of tin can. Maybe Tutto Rosso, or some cheap brand. At least Red Pack would've been a step up. Only had 2 slices (my date too) & we couldn't bear to go on. To top it all off, the wait-staff wasn't even Italian.  They were all Albanian, with nasty ""I don't even want to be here"" attitudes & rudely and loudly speaking Albanian that it made everyone cringe. Definitely will not be revisiting this place. Stick to other spots that make really good pizza, like Lucali. Even though the hostess last time was snobby as hell, the pizza is worth it because the super friendly wait staff makes you feel at home.",1.0
"Went with a group for dinner and it was the best pizza I have had! The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because our group waited for about an hour in line just to be seated, but it is worth the wait! Our group split the large Margarita pizza and we each got a cannoli for dessert. It ended up being about $10 per person. The staff was great and the manager was very nice and hilarious. He went to every customer in the place and even chatted with us while we were waiting in line. I would recommend this to anyone who visits NYC to make the trip over to Brooklyn for the experience!",4.0
"This place is well worth waiting in the extremely long line to get in.  Just don't even try if you're being spontaneous and pushed for time...seriously, you're going to be standing outside for a long time.  I've always been greeted by a rather friendly Italian-American and promptly shown to our table -- which is often with other people.  I actually like that -- I really do like sitting at a long table with other guests, it feels more social -- like you're at a big family gathering, but I can understand why other people would find that rather uncomfortable.  What I say to that is -- go with it and say ""hi"" to the folk next to you when you're sitting down and hope that they're social (more often than not they are, in my experience).As for the pizza itself...it is certainly the best I've ever had.",5.0

I'm giving this place three stars because I live in New York and I've tried many pizza places. It was good but not worth standing on a long line for. There's always a line halfway down the block here. Tonight we were lucky there was no wait so we figured we would try it. My boyfriend and I just got the large fresh mozzarella pie. It was nothing to do backflips about. It was very good and affordable. 14 dollars for a large pie is reasonable. I would come back if there is ever a time when there isn't a line.

Grimaldi's is one of the longest standing pizzerias in NYC. There is so much history to this place. It's kinda funny how the current location was actually the original location, then moved to 19 Fulton street only to move back to the current location. Weird. The place is not fancy, it's super casual, there are no slices, there are no reservations and the service is kinda ho hum. But you go for the food.The food:Antipasto- Genoa Salami, oven-roasted sweet red peppers, fresh Mozzarella, Sicilian olives, oven toasted crostini. I thought this app was really nice. The fresh mozz was great, it had really nice texture, the sweetness of the peppers was a nice complement, the olives offered a nice salty punch and the Salami was good but I enjoyed everything else a tad more.Regular pie- The pies are great, the sauce has a nice sweetness and the mozz is great. Pepperoni they use is fantastic, the sausage crumbles were good, the mushrooms are a nice addition. The pies are great but on one or two occasions I had a soggy middle and that bothers me.

Classic location in DUMBO area of Brooklyn. Not much for atmosphere/ decor. Service was pleasant. Pizza was fanfrickentastic!! I'm typically not a thin crust pizza fan but theFlavor and texture of this crust was amazing. Pizza sauce great- rich and slightly sweet. Toppings were generous. Small size pizza was more than enough for two people. Grimaldi's is a classic for good reason. Tip from the doctor ( Notorious MD): Walk the Brooklyn bridge for scenery and excercise. Then indulge in a pizza at Grimaldi's. PS Cash only. No pizza by the slice.,4.0

Not only did they not greet myself nor the others who entered with me at the door but they proceeded to yell that we ""did not read the sign in the front"" and ""should be waiting behind the sign"" and gestured until we followed their instructions. When I returned inside to explain that I could no longer wait for my pizza and had to leave, their first reaction was to roll their eyes and say to each other, in front of my face, ""oh look, she's come back inside, now what?!???"" As if they believed I couldn't understand English. I am disappointed by how unbelievably rude and racist this establishment was, particularly for a venue that is such a local tourist attraction.Only positive was that they gave me my refund when I explained that I had an emergency.",1.0
"Wth? I never wrote a review for this place? Yes, it's a NYC institution and the summer lines are freakin insane! Lucky for me I live in Queens and there is a location in Douglaston. Giddy up! Grimaldi's is one of the longest standing pizzerias in NYC. There is so much history to this place. It's kinda funny how the current location was actually the original location, then moved to 19 Fulton street only to move back to the current location. Weird. The place is not fancy, it's super casual, there are no slices, there are no reservations and the service is kinda ho hum. But you go for the food.The food:Antipasto- Genoa Salami, oven-roasted sweet red peppers, fresh Mozzarella, Sicilian olives, oven toasted crostini. I thought this app was really nice. The fresh mozz was great, it had really nice texture, the sweetness of the peppers was a nice complement, the olives offered a nice salty punch and the Salami was good but I enjoyed everything else a tad more.Regular pie- The pies are great, the sauce has a nice sweetness and the mozz is great. Pepperoni they use is fantastic, the sausage crumbles were good, the mushrooms are a nice addition. The pies are great but on one or two occasions I had a soggy middle and that bothers me. Overall I say it's one of the top pies in New York.",4.0
Classic location in DUMBO area of Brooklyn. Not much for atmosphere/ decor. Service was pleasant. Pizza was fanfrickentastic!! I'm typically not a thin crust pizza fan but theFlavor and texture of this crust was amazing. Pizza sauce great- rich and slightly sweet. Toppings were generous. Small size pizza was more than enough for two people. Grimaldi's is a classic for good reason. Tip from the doctor ( Notorious MD): Walk the Brooklyn bridge for scenery and excercise. Then indulge in a pizza at Grimaldi's. PS Cash only. No pizza by the slice.,4.0
"The freshest tasting pizza I've ever had, the toppings in our pizza weren't overbaked and really flavorful. The thin crust  and the sauce complimented each other very well, long lines but soooo worth it!",4.0
You can't go wrong with a fresh mozzarella pie! Grimaldi's has its unique touch when it comes to pizza. It's so good that it's always busy. Give yourself a lot of time and bring cash.,4.0
"Having only eaten at a handful of NYC pizza joints, I'm not sure if this is the best but it is pretty flipping good.  Delicious crust with a bit of salt, tasty sauce and just enough, a little ""wet"" neo style, and a great variety of toppings.A medium is PLENTY for 2 - six oversized slices.  They are pretty quick but I heard that at peak hours there can be a line and wait (we were there at 2).Stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge and then a little backtrack or take the blue train from downtown Manhattan.They do not serve alcohol, and they are cash only.",4.0

"I am already craving the goodness that is Grimaldi's. We arrived around 3pm on a Tuesday afternoon- St. Patrick's Day actually, and there was no line. We were immediately seated. We ordered the small pizza (6 large slices) with the toppings that it automatically comes with- mozzarella, basil, tomato sauce, plus pepperoni. The pizza was sooo delicious. Savory and thin, just perfect. The two of us devoured the whole thing. The sodas come in bottles, so no free refills. And it's cash only! (I believe there was an ATM inside...) No pizza by the slice, but one won't be enough anyway! Can't wait to return!",5.0
"Risking public backlash, I'm going on record and saying grimaldis is all hype. I've gone quite a few times and I'm just about always unsatisfied. First impressions with the line will probably boost your anticipation, however the service is less than admirable and the pizza the same. Yea it's crispy but not consistent. It's a dry pie, thin crust as they want it but, not fresh tasting at all. While I say these harsh things I feel there are some redeeming qualities but I simply cannot think of any; you'll find multiple locations, all serving their pies in a bag, all with the grimaldis name, and all with the same flavor profiles. To me, it's an overwhelming ""eh."" Too much hype not enough love. I came fro Di Faras as well which is by far the best pizza I've had so the comparison is a bit unbalanced. As well, I went to Ignazio's around the corner from grimaldis after (took the gf on a pizza tour) and despite their biased reviews due to grimaldis loyalists, they had a good pie as well and a lot less of a line...

"To start off, I really hate giving bad reviews but this place was astonishingly bad and has an undeserved reputation that I am also guilty of propagating since I visited 7 years ago.Maybe because I visited the original location 7 years ago, that I had such high expectations from that memory of the best pizza I've ever had. Or maybe because their name recognition is so high. Or maybe because Grimaldi's is generally regarded as having some of the best pizza in NYC, that they would want to maintain that reputation. Whatever it is, my visit last week was incredibly disappointing. The pizza was burnt, the toppings were scant, the cheese was dry, the pizza was legitimately not delicious, and the people taking names at the door were incredibly rude. I was in line for nearly an hour, waiting to order a few pies to go. Even though I was at the front of the line, I was continually ignored so that they could seat people who were in line behind me, this went on for a perplexing 10 minutes. I had to keep repeating that I was ordering to go whenever the guy taking names came to ask me how many people were in my party, he asked me at least 5 times while I was in the same position in line. I have no idea why I couldn't just give my order, I had it all written down ready to go. But he made me stand there for 10 minutes so he could seat the tourists behind me in line. But besides all that, the most embarassing thing would be that I have been recommending Grimaldi's for the last 7 years since my last visit because it truly was the best pizza I've ever had at the time. But now that I know they are going for quantity over quality, I am ashamed to have misdirected visitors to NYC that have asked me for recommendations for good pizza. Good thing I tried the pizza at the new location (on the corner of Fulton & Front st.) last week, or else I would have continued to recommend it based on old information. Seriously, don't go here if you are looking for good pizza. If you want to say you've been to Grimaldi's, then sure. But you've missed the golden era of when it used to be good.  (Or try the Manhattan location.) I used to argue with people who would say Di Fara, Lombardi's, or Joe's had the best pizza in NYC, and I would defend Grimaldi's to the death, but now that I know what the new Grimaldi's pizza tastes like, I would probably get a 99cent 2 Brothers slice before I would go back to Grimaldi's. I am really sad that my experience was so bad, I really wanted it to be like how I remembered. *sigh*UPDATE: I have been PM'd by a few people on here letting me know that the original Grimaldi's was sold off to one of their customers a few years ago so the reputation no longer means anything.  Turns out if you want the Grimaldi's quality pizza, you need to go next door to Juliana's.

"About a 1-1.5: I was really excited to try out Grimaldi's, one of the famous coal brick-oven pizzerias in NY.  I loved reading how their coal-oven is hand-built and that they have fresh mozzarella delivered daily.  Since the hubs and I were in the DUMBO area, we decided to check them out!  Their menu offers pizzas (white or regular), calzones, and desserts (homemade cannoli, tortini, tartufo, and spumoni) - I liked how their menu is pizza-centered!  They do not offer pizza-by-the-slice (which was totally fine), so we ordered a Small Regular Pizza with pepperoni and 'fresh garlic.'  The pizza was ready in 10 minutes, which was nice!  When we received the pizza, I noticed that it didn't really look appetizing - it seemed unevenly cooked, as the edges were a bit burnt, and the interior of the pie was not really cooked through.  The pizza itself was also not tasty - the pepperoni had that nice curling action, but there was no 'fresh garlic' taste at all, not even a subtle hint.  In addition, the mozzarella was not melted all the way through, due to the uneven baking, and it just tasted as if you were biting into the cheese slices, set on top of tomato sauce.  We were both pretty disappointed, as we heard rave reviews of this place; however, our experience was pretty underwhelming T___T  Our server was really nice, though, but we'll not be back!+located in the historic white DUMBO bank building+disappointing pizza T___T+no pizza-by-the-slice option",2.0

"As a non-pizza lover, Grimaldi's ROCKS!We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to enjoy NY style pizza and I was very excited to try a must-stop restaurant all my friends have raved about. Lo and behold, there was an hour wait as soon as we got there (I'm starting to think that it's a common theme in NYC), but got in line to try this. Waited an hour and a half and as soon as we got a table, it was a time to break the oven. Like....W.T.F. After a total of a little two hours wait, we finally ordered and I can say that the pizza is definitely worth the wait. Between the four of us, we had the white pizza, pepperoni, and sausage and mushroom. Why yes, that's quite a lot for three people, but do remember that they are thin-crust so it doesn't quite pack a punch as normal pizza.The crust was amazing - not too doughy with a slight crunch to it. Additionally, the thing I enjoyed the most was the wood scent that came from being cooked in an over brick. Amazing sauce, both red and white, with plenty of toppings on our pizzas. I am so happy we stopped by and recommend Grimaldi's to all - it definitely lives up to the hype!Our server was very nice and patient with us newbies (he most likely gets new people every other table) and gave recommendations. He was the one who suggested we go for another pizza and am sure glad we listened to him! The next time I'm in NY, I will be back! :)",5.0

Lo and behold, there was an hour wait as soon as we got there (I'm starting to think that it's a common theme in NYC), but got in line to try this. Waited an hour and a half and as soon as we got a table, it was a time to break the oven. Like....W.T.F. After a total of a little two hours wait, we finally ordered and I can say that the pizza is definitely worth the wait. Between the four of us, we had the white pizza, pepperoni, and sausage and mushroom. Why yes, that's quite a lot for three people, but do remember that they are thin-crust so it doesn't quite pack a punch as normal pizza.The crust was amazing - not too doughy with a slight crunch to it. Additionally, the thing I enjoyed the most was the wood scent that came from being cooked in an over brick. Amazing sauce, both red and white, with plenty of toppings on our pizzas. I am so happy we stopped by and recommend Grimaldi's to all - it definitely lives up to the hype!Our server was very nice and patient with us newbies (he most likely gets new people every other table) and gave recommendations. He was the one who suggested we go for another pizza and am sure glad we listened to him! The next time I'm in NY, I will be back! :)",5.0
"Why did I get sucked into going here. My instinct told me not to fall for the trap but a friend convinced me otherwise. The pizza was bland, soggy and left a lot to desire. In a city where the options are limitless, do yourself a favor and skip the long line and go Joes Pizza on Bleecker for delicious authentic slice of pizza",1.0
"Grimaldi's = so freakin delicious! After being a New Yorker and being too bougie about going to a super hyped pizza place, I've finally tried Grimaldi's and recognized it deserves all of its recognition. The pizza tastes like genuine brick oven and in each bite you can tell how fresh the ingredients are.My friend and I split a pie. She's a vegetarian so we got a pizza with mozzarella cheese & tomatoes (on my half I had to add peoperoni!) They don't do pizza by the slices, its all pies and you pay about $2-5 for your toppings, depending on which ones you get. It isn't cheap pizza, but its authentic and pretty much worth the price.Also located in the best neighborhood in Brooklyn, Dumbo which basically asks for a nice picnic by Brooklyn Bridge park!",5.0
"I was a great place, but now it has plastic plates and cups. Nit is not gonna be for famous place like this.",3.0
"Came here during odd hours (2:30pm) and glad I went late. There was NOOO line. FYI, if you come in a group, make sure your whole group is there, or else they will not seat you. I came here because everyone claims this pizzeria is great! But my experience definitely did not reach my hype.",3.0
"Good pizza. This place is crowded. Kids & groups are welcome. Parking is limited. But a good time. Do not forget to order the desserts: cappuccino gelato truffle and the coconut gelato truffle with mango sorbet center!!! Omg!!!Now all that said, food is good BUT the waiter service leaves much to be desired. They need to gave someone at or near the door to seat people. We wound up being sat by our server because we were there for so long, he was like grab that table over there. And as we enjoyed the truffles a pie was put at the wrong table and sat there for some time before they realized it was the wrong table...even though the customer was like this isn't ours. Seriously.",4.0
"Rude service, we asked how long the wait was and we were walking out and a young lady ran out and told us to come inside and she seated us.  A man behind the bar came over and asked if we seated ourselves with a nasty tone because there were people waiting before us,  we told him no that the lady seated us and he walks away with the same attitude.  I was hoping the pizza made up for it, the crust was burnt and hard. Going to try the pizza next to this restaurant, the line is around the block but it's owned by the original owners of this place I read.",1.0
"We came in after our trek across the Brooklyn bridge. We were so hungry and had read so many reviews about how we must try a pie at either Juliana's or Grimaldi's. Well, Grimaldi's won our business simply because they came up first on our path. It was crowded inside. We were greeted by a very friendly older gentleman who sat us promptly. Please keep in mind that this place is CASH ONLY and offers NO SLICES, so bring your money and your appetite. We ordered a small (huge) pizza that comes with 6 slices. The base of all their pizza has cheese, basil and tomato. We added mushroom, garlic and black olives for an upcharge. Honestly, if we ever go back, I'll just get the pizza as it comes without any extras. I ended up taking off the olives. Less is more here. The pizza was amazing. It must be the sauce. We asked for the grated Parmesan shaker because I douse all my pizza in cheese. Perfection.",4.0
"Environmental: nice, clean, you can see how they make your pizza, high ceiling , old fashion style which is my style. And outside~ good building and crazy long line about 45mins wait at least.Only one thing you will see the back of bar counter ,there has so many thing not relay to food and store stuffs. Something like hoodie ,motorcycle helmet and male. Mannequin body and lots of t shirt .......etc.Food: delicious, yummy, you can only get a pie ,not slice.Thin cross and choose your own topping.First  we thought we can't finish even small size, then we finish whole large pizza . It's good but not hot at all. Warm pizza and long waiting, it kill ppl's appetite ^^Services: PPl are nice~ but It doesn't like table service....it likes you order and do lots of things by yourself. They won't come for asking"" anything good?!"" They just give you what you order. And..........food need wait pretty long~ so if you are really hungry you better get a snacks with you so you can calm lol.Overall I like it. Once After I try top 1-5 pizza store . I may come back again^^",4.0

"I came here with family that were visiting from overseas & after walking over the Brooklyn bridge we needed something to eat. I set the expectation that the line would probably be huge, but to our surprise there was no line so we practically ran to the front door! (It was a weekday in December). We ordered a large pizza & shared it between 4 of us. As it was lunch time this was just the right amount, 2 large slices each. We opted to add 2 toppings, ham & mushroom. The pizza was delicious! It had a thin base but wasn't too crispy and it was full of flavor. My relatives said it was the best pizza they had ever had! The decor is casual, it was cool to see the photos of stars that had visited in the past. The tables are a bit close together so it is a bit of a squeeze, but I would definitely return here if in the area & if there was no line..",4.0
"Yes I am a fan!! The line was wrapped around the building. Luckliy I was staying at a friends who lived in the building above the place so we were able to call it in and walk down a grab it. I see why people are always in line waiting for what is said to be the best pizza in town. The flavors were so good, the sauce was amazing and they were not greedy with the toppings. If I lived in town I would frequent this place often, even if that means waiting in line!",5.0
Very good pizza with very nice price. You have to stand on line for at least 30min which i didnt like. Pizza was amazing price was amazing but the waiting time sucks,4.0
"This is some freaking good pizza. The hype is on point.We got half olives and half ham--both halves were amazing. I think what made the pizza really good were1) The crust - melts in your mouth, and really wholesome without being overwhelming.2) The mozzarella cheese - really really fresh! Perfectly melted on the pizza.The olives were really tasty--very flavorful! If I ate pizza more often, I would hit this place up every week.",4.0
"I have been coming to Grimaldi's since I was a little girl and it has been stellar every time. This past year I have been there countless times and I'm about to debunk the bad reviews written about them. I've made friends with the staff (their service is impeccable btw) and asked many questions pertaining to the bad reviews. So here it goes...Lack of liquor license: expect that to be back by this summer and drink as you pleasePlastic utensils and plates: there was a fire in the kitchen so now they're remodeling and doing the best they can doThe mysterious 3rd floor: yes there's a third floor but it's not being used because it would be too much. There's already a lot of seating with just the two floors and the stair cases are narrow. If they extended to the 3rd floor, there would be a lot of congestion and service would be slower.Lastly, Juliana's next door: I was hesitant to ask but here's the real story. The place next door is not owned by Mr. Grimadli himself, it is only endorsed by him. Grimaldi's and Juliana's actually entered a law suit in which Grimaldi's won $10 million. As for the quality of the pizza, it is quite literally the same stuff. I asked why the pizza's look the same and it's because the people who make it at Julianna's used to work at Grimaldi's and the cooks at both locations are cousins.If you ask me, I will always choose Grimaldi's. Why go next door and pay $20/$23 when I can get the same thing for $16 at Grimaldi's?(Shoutout to the cute guy with the tattoos and nice hair for answering all my questions and being the best waiter ever.)",5.0

"This place is as great as they say. First off, the look; it is amazing. It is strategically placed not too far from Dumbo park and under the Brooklyn Bridge. I love the brick layout on the walls,  which gives me a sense that the pizza is, indeed, brick oven made. The customer service team is so welcoming and accommodating. I was extremely late and their rule is they only sit complete parties.While I was on my way,  they sat my friends down and took their orders. When I came they got a chair from elsewhere and quickly attended to me. This is important because inside was crowded and there was a line outside. We got the large pie and some sodas. The sauce on the pizza wasn't to heavy and the crust was thinking  (I'm a thick crust girl lol). All in all, the pizza was good and it tasted freshly made. You don't get this everywhere you go. I enjoyed myself.Location - 5Service - 5Food - 4.5 (the pizza was a bit burnt on one section)Ambience - 5",5.0
"Was so disappointed with this location!   Found out about Grimaldi's in Las Vegas and loved the pizza.  Visit the location at the Palazzo every time we're in Las Vegas.  Nice thin crust, good toppings, delicious!   So I was expecting the same great food.  This location didn't meet up to my expectations.  We were seated quickly but the upstairs was super hot.  They had a fan running in the corner but that was it.  No liquor license. We were served our drinks at room temperature with a couple of glasses of ice, but because it was warm in the room, the ice melted quickly.  We had to constantly ask for our water glasses to be refilled and get more ice.  Not sure I would come back to this location.  I will continue to frequent the LV location unless that place fails to deliver its good service.",3.0

"This is our first stop at New York. Cant go wrong with a brooklyn slice pizza. everything about the pizza is awesome! The toppings was on point, got the regular pepperoni and sausage. The sauce and cheese is what separates this from any other pizza place. The mozzarella is fresh, and stringy. The sauce is simply imported marzilla sauce tomatoes simmered down to a saucy-like consistency. It was a slice of heaven. One of my favorite pizza's in NYC! Jus plain perfect.",5.0

The sauce simple. Cheese is super great.",4.0
Pizza is really good..ingredient wise it taste really fresh but I have to agree it's not what it used to be. The crust was burnt and left a gross aftertaste.

We ordered the pizza as depicted below it took about a half an hour to come out but it was definitely worth waiting for. It was one of the most authentic and perfected pizzas I have ever had.

Me, personally, I didn't regret of my waiting and I might go back there again (but when there is no line.)",4.0
Long lines and impatient hungry growling stomach equal out to pizza being average. Seems like they rely on their reputation to get you in the door then the food falls short because they have lots of patrons.  Thanks Gramaldis I don't think I will be back.,3.0
"Top notch pizza. My husband and I have a debate over who has the best pizza in New York. He chooses Grimaldis. I have to admit, the pizza here is delicious. The special pizza ovens they have are hard at work making pizzas for the many patrons that frequent here. We came to eat here after a long walk across the Brooklyn bridge. A warm meal was much needed when we came in from the cold. We were welcomed by a young man who seemed like he grew up in the restaurant. He knew everything pizza. You can't go wrong with topping choice. Just remember, they're CASH ONLY. If you don't have cash on you, they'll point you to a place with an ATM right next door. And don't go there expecting to just buy a slice! The good places in New York won't sell by the slice, only a whole pie.",5.0
"Lives up to the hype! All my friends who live in Brooklyn/New York swear by this place. Although I may have enjoyed it more since there was no wait at all (rainy night on a Sunday at around 7:30). Good service and they let us get a table before the rest of our party arrived.We got two large pies, one sausage/mushroom and one sundried tomato/onion. The latter was okay, the former was probably some of the best pizza I've had. I love the blistered crust (though it can get kind of scratchy in your mouth) and the sausage was so juicy and was a perfect combo with the mushrooms. The cheese is thick and very fresh tasting, and the sauce was perfect. It can be soggy but I actually liked it that way as well. Very reasonably priced too considering the size and quantity (2 large pizzas for 4 people was perfect). I'll be back the next time I'm in Brooklyn.",5.0

"Cons - this is not the original Grimaldi's, Juliana' next door is.   Long line to get in to a small dining area.  No alcohol.  Crust was chewy, sauce was bland.  After reading their history, we were expecting better taste for all the hype. Next time,  it's Juliana' for us. Pros - cool historic building, cool location, prices reasonable",2.0
"I've had the pizza.  It was good,, not great. There are far more excellent pizza joints in Brooklyn.The lines are ridiculous; I have no proof, but I think money changed hands between the tour bus companies and Grimaldi's. Juliana's (in Grimaldi's previous space) is far better without lines that are as long. Lucali's on Henry Street was great. I haven't been there in a long time. The House of Pizza and Calzone on Union between Hicks and Columbia is my favorite.",1.0
"Mediocre, overpriced pizza. Would've been nice to have more notices of the whole ""cash only"" thing before the check arrived. It's really inconvenient and embarrassing to have to leave the restaurant to hit an ATM, tends to spoil the meal.",1.0
"This place is all that.. Located right across the Brooklyn Bridge, most people arrive here hungry after having crossed the bridge. Everything about this place is great, from the Italian American guy standing outside taking you to your seats, with an Italian attitude, to the authenticity of this place. I really like that the oven and the chefs are placed right at the entry so you see everything upon coming in. We were seated upstairs, and the crew is all guys the tables are in the smaller side and seating snug. We ordered the pizza as depicted below it took about a half an hour to come out but it was definitely worth waiting for. It was one of the most authentic and perfected pizzas I have ever had. Everything about it was great; toppings fresh, cheese stringy and the bread freshly made. A medium as plenty for two. Great pizza in a place with much history and authenticity! Must go!",4.0
"had dinner just bcz i was curios since there is always line-up out there.delicious dough, perfect burnt smell, tasty fresh topping, amusing busy atmosphere, smiley nice service even its full packed.(and the receptionist did great job to comfort people waiting outside)This is very nice restaurant, so it's your choice to stand outside for 30-40min or not. Me, personally, I didn't regret of my waiting and I might go back there again (but when there is no line.)",4.0
Long lines and impatient hungry growling stomach equal out to pizza being average. Seems like they rely on their reputation to get you in the door then the food falls short because they have lots of patrons.  Thanks Gramaldis I don't think I will be back.,3.0
"Top notch pizza. My husband and I have a debate over who has the best pizza in New York. He chooses Grimaldis. I have to admit, the pizza here is delicious. The special pizza ovens they have are hard at work making pizzas for the many patrons that frequent here. We came to eat here after a long walk across the Brooklyn bridge. A warm meal was much needed when we came in from the cold. We were welcomed by a young man who seemed like he grew up in the restaurant. He knew everything pizza. You can't go wrong with topping choice. Just remember, they're CASH ONLY. If you don't have cash on you, they'll point you to a place with an ATM right next door. And don't go there expecting to just buy a slice! The good places in New York won't sell by the slice, only a whole pie.",5.0
"Lives up to the hype! All my friends who live in Brooklyn/New York swear by this place. Although I may have enjoyed it more since there was no wait at all (rainy night on a Sunday at around 7:30). Good service and they let us get a table before the rest of our party arrived.We got two large pies, one sausage/mushroom and one sundried tomato/onion. The latter was okay, the former was probably some of the best pizza I've had. I love the blistered crust (though it can get kind of scratchy in your mouth) and the sausage was so juicy and was a perfect combo with the mushrooms. The cheese is thick and very fresh tasting, and the sauce was perfect. It can be soggy but I actually liked it that way as well. Very reasonably priced too considering the size and quantity (2 large pizzas for 4 people was perfect). I'll be back the next time I'm in Brooklyn.",5.0
"Brooklyn reinforces that NY has the best pizza in America. This is the first place in Brooklyn I've had pizza, but it is easily one of the best slices I've had. Nice fresh melty stringy mozzarella, chewy pillowy crust with a crisp exterior, just the right amount of sauce, just a wonderfully composed pie. Not to mention if you order the anti pasta it comes with nice flat bread made from the same dough as the crust. Love that they have plenty of seating and great timing of food coming out of the kitchen.",4.0
"Worst antipasto ever -- a few measly slices of salami and cheese with some very sad olives.  Nothing green on the menu.  Would it kill them to offer salads?  Our pizza was all right, if a bit wet.  Negligent service.  No wine or beer, and they only take cash.  There would be fewer people on line if there were more food offerings in the neighborhood.  For the price I do not expect to eat with plastic utensils and plates.",2.0
Money! Best crust hands down the meatballs (topping) were fantastic will always stop here,5.0
Amazing - super tasty and surprisingly light. My husband and I managed to polish off 99% of a large between the two of us. I'm holding off on 5 stars because I want to try Juliana's next door. My one criticism would be that the tomato sauce was a little sparse and could have come through more. But I'll definitely be back!,4.0
"Don't know how good the pizza here truly is because the service was so bad that we didn't get our order until it was almost cold. We placed a pizza order to go & planned to walk down to the Brooklyn Bridge park,  but they apparently forgot about us & by the time we went to check on our pizza it was barely ""still hot"" (as the lady put it). In just the 5 minutes it took to walk to the park, the pizza was cold.  I will try it again one day maybe, but for now, they get a 3 for terrible service.",3.0
"My first time dining in this place. We had to wait almost an hour before getting in, but the wait is totally worth it!! Great white cheese pizza! Topped with garlic, basil and cheese (added ham and mushroom as our additional toppings.) Pizza cooked just right. It's not too soggy, (a lil bit dry considering there's no sauce added to it) taste of garlic is not overpowering, and a few basil leaves for additional flavor. Mushroom and ham gives off texture to it's taste and more color to it's appearance. The pizza wasn't too oily as well. Fresh!! The place was a lil jam-packed and loud, but it's all good.",4.0
"I liked the place. I thought the pizza was really good and the prices were good, too. Two friends and I walked in on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch and we did not have to wait at all.We were staying in Manhattan and thought it would be fun to take the ferry over, which drops you off 100 yards from the restaurant.

"I just ate here for the first time a few weeks ago around 4:30pm. There was a line but we only waited about 20-30 minutes. Not bad. They had paper plates and plastic silverware which I thought was kinda funny. The pizza was fantastic, actually the best I had while visiting New York. The service was terrible and they don't serve beer and wine - another bummer. I could have used a nice cold beer. They do add gratuity to your order even when it's only a party of two. Probably why the service was so bad, they don't have to be nice for a tip. I will go back again but just for the pizza.",4.0
"Ordered a large traditional pie ($14) and added fresh garlic ($2). Three of us split the pizza and we certainly could have ordered more! The crust was light, crisp, and super tasty. The sauce was simple San Marzano tomatoes topped with salty and fresh mozzarella and basil. It was heaven.We each ordered a bottle of Pellegrino for $3. I was expecting a normal sized bottle for that price, but it was probably half a pint. Disappointed on that one. Also, the liquor license is pending so you can't order beer or wine.We were going to a Nets game and wanted to eat dinner beforehand. We showed up at Grimaldi's around 4:30/4:45 pm on a Monday and didn't have to wait at all. Everyone who works there is friendly and was laughing around with us the whole time. I can't wait to go back.",4.0
"Waited outside over an hour on a Sunday after around 7pm. It was a good thing I ordered my half with pepperoni and ham because the side without tasted bland. I was actually happy with the pizza, not the best I had, but what ruined the entire experience was the lack of service. The waiter who took our order completely disappeared after. It was a table of two and all we were given was two napkins. I looked everywhere for him because my left hand was drenched in oil and I also needed a little more water to finish my pizza, but as I said..nowhere to be found. There was this one guy who after ignoring my wave several times, I asked if we could have some napkins and a little more water. He brought the water and no napkins. As he poured I asked if we could please have some napkins and he never brought them. We were sitting right in front of the counter the waiters come in and out of and he avoided eye contact in every way possible. It was disgusting. We finally asked a passing kitchen worker and he gave it to us. Upon leaving, our waiter happened to reappear. This wasn't one of the top pizzas for sure, but for all the waiting time outside they should be a little more friendly and not depend on pure popularity.",3.0

When thinking about the titans of New York City pizza one of the first places you hear about is Grimaldis. I have to say this pizza was really good but only if you know what toppings to put on it. So the pizza is very hit or miss but if you get that perfect blend of toppings then the pizza goes to an insane level of deliciousness. I got pepperoni and roasted peppers and those two just were so good with the already fresh and made to order pizza with super flavorful mozzarella cheese in the pizza.

"Grimaldis is good, but maybe the people standing on the Julianas line made the better choice...  The pizza is good, but is it really worth standing in a line for 30 minutes when the Julianas line is shorter...",3.0
"I love this place! The best pizza in NY! The restaurant is too busy and noisy but the pizza is so good I don't  mind at all! Friendly waiters and staff. I would definitely recommend this particular location, it's  the original and the best!",5.0
Okay for New York pizza but John on Bleeker Street is so much better.,1.0
"3.5 starsSimple menu, pizza was ok w pepperoni. U have to get a whole pizza, no individual slices. U have to pay $3 extra/topping which can get expensive if u like toppings. Plenty seating.",3.0

"Pizza is light, crispy, and tasty. Try to come at odd hours such as 2:30 or 4:30 when nobody is there. We did this and didn't have to wait for a table. As we were leaving, we saw at least 15 people waiting outside (it was close to 6pm). Service is so-so. The tables were relatively dirty, our waiter kept forgetting to refill our water glasses, and the A/C didn't seem to be working because it was scorching hot in there. Not pleasant when it's already muggy and humid outside.I would definitely return if I was in the neighborhood, but this pizza isn't good enough that I would wait in line for any more than 10 minutes. Skip and go to Juliana's next door if the lines here are long - the pizza at Juliana's is just as good if not better.",4.0
"Not sure why this place is touted as the best pizza in NY and why tourists stay in line for hours. It's not bad but it's not the best. It's regular pizza. The crust is regular, the sauce is regular and the cheese is regular. Regular, I say.Yes this place is not known for the service, you order, get your food and then the check. Don't expect to get your water refilled on its own. Don't expect a smile. Cash only the nearest bank is Chase a good 10 minute walk by Jay Street and Front Street.",2.0

"Gotta say the pizza here is awesome! We had a large pie with half pepperoni and full sweet peppers and it was delicious. The crust was baked to perfection, just the right crunch to it, and not super doughy.

"Don't get all the fuss. I would never stand on line for this place. We've gone twice - once it was raining at probably 1 hour before closing. No line and my boyfriend was new to the city at that point so he wanted to sample the 'best pizza in new york'. The pizza that night was slightly undercooked and nothing to write home about.Another time we went for pizza but ordered ahead for take out. This enables you to skip the line because you're not eating in.  Again, undercooked (as though they are so busy trying to kick out pizzas that they don't allow the food to cook properly) and just meh.

We arrived around 11 am and a line had already formed to eat this famous pizza, but the line moved pretty quickly and our party of nine didn't have to wait longer than 20 minutes. The cool thing is that this restaurant has two floors for seating. The pizzas were a good size, we ordered three large pies. 1) The classic Margherita 2) White pizza (no tomato sauce) with garlic and mushrooms 3) Tomato sauce based pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and olivesAll pizzas were good, with a thin crust and not too soggy. My personal favorite was the white pizza. So simple yet very flavorful! I wouldn't say this is the best pizza I have ever had but it's definitely something you should try because it's part of NYC history.Expect your experience to be quick, we ordered the pizzas and were in and out in less than an hour. You'd have to expect a quick dining experience especially if a line is waiting outside.I would definitely plan to do the same thing when coming back to NYC.

"Came on an early Saturday afternoon and didn't have to wait but was a first seat option at a table with two people we didn't know so we opted for the bar seating.

I don't think I'd ever wait in line and hype this up and I'm glad I didn't because I probably might have knocked it to a two star review. The service is ok, on the slower side and the ""host"" guy at the front isn't the happiest of people. Yeah i get your dealing with a bunch of clueless tourists most of the time but its expected. The small pizza is perfect two, you may even have a leftover slice, although we did see one guy take down a whole small pizza so i guess it varies....Overall, glad I got a taste, but there are days a good ol' $1 slice could win out here.",3.0

"Grimaldi's has the name but Juliana's has the Pizza!... I decided to do a taste test with Grimaldi's and Juliana's (which is next door) with having my family tell me what they thought. Overall, these are two excellent pizza places, and If I was just rating Grimaldi's on its own and not against Juliana's I would give it a four but since this place and Juliana's are synonymous with great pizza especially since their histories are intertwined making them direct competitors, it seemed only fitting. So one recent evening I bought two pies, one from Juliana's and the other from Grimaldi's and brought them home( I live only 10 minutes away). Our family of eight all bit into both and unanimously we all said pretty much the same thing. They both essentially tasted the same but Juliana's just seemed to have everything cooked and mixed just right, it literally melted deliciously in our mouths. What was really noticeable was the bread, Juliana's was soft and chewy and tasted just right. Grimaldi's bread was harder and just tasted like plain old bread, it almost felt that it just got in the way of the taste of the pizza. All I can say is that Juliana's really tasted like the original( As Patsy himself would tell you) and it just seemed like more effort was put into making it just right, while Grimaldi's tasted like a pretty good Knock off. So basically Grimaldi's has the name, since they paid for it after buying it from Patsy a while back, but without a doubt Juliana's has the pizza! I guess it's up to you what is more important.",3.0

Fortunately, we got there around 6:30 and the line was only up to the entrance of Julianna's. Which isn't that bad--i've heard of worse. Once we got seated we order just the basic margarita pizza since we wanted to try the basic flavors of the pie. The ingredients were fresh, the dough was FANTASTIC (i think that is what I kept raving about when I took every single bite). The tomato sauce wasn't out of this world and just tasted like any other tomato sauce; so I was very disappointed with that. Price wise, the pizza was great!

The line went pretty fast.We ordered a large pepperoni, mushroom, and garlic pizza and a small sausage, meatball, and ricotta (there is no medium). Um, it was amazing and we killed it. It was a worthy NY experience and definitelyworth the wait!",4.0
"3.5 Stars.I think because of the history and yelp reviews of this place my expectations were a bit too high for it. But I didn't want that to spoil my visit so I tried to brainwash myself into thinking that its just pizza prior to heading in. We waited in line for about a hour? we figured since it was raining there wouldn't be SUCH a huge line but. boy was I wrong. Fortunately, we got there around 6:30 and the line was only up to the entrance of Julianna's. Which isn't that bad--i've heard of worse. Once we got seated we order just the basic margarita pizza since we wanted to try the basic flavors of the pie. The ingredients were fresh, the dough was FANTASTIC (i think that is what I kept raving about when I took every single bite). The tomato sauce wasn't out of this world and just tasted like any other tomato sauce; so I was very disappointed with that. Price wise, the pizza was great! But for the actual wait time and all the hype... I would go else where.Being a native New Yorker I can finallly say I've been to Grimaldi's. woohoo!",3.0
Pizza is good but not worth the wait. I think pizza in general is hit or miss depending on your taste.,4.0
"I should have known better when I received an initial snobby attitude from the guy up front... We called in an order for a pizza and swung by to pick it up. They have a large sign that says take out = wait on line so to double check, I went up & mentioned that I called in a pizza and asked if I still had to wait on line. I received a grumpy yes.Okay.. on the line for 15 minutes. The same guy comes down the lines asking ""how many"". When he got to me, I said, I ordered for pick up. ""Go up to see if your order is ready"". WELLLLL I said - you just told me to wait on the line. ""No i didnt. Go up to see if your order is ready"". The man was rude and un-apologetic. I said NO, i JUST talked to you.. and proceeded to run up to the front. As I went up, the man threw some words my direction commenting on my ""unnecessary attitude"". I'm sorry - I'm in the wrong because you mis-directed me (and implied that I was lying) and now I paid $20 for a cold pizza???When I did get to try the pizza, it left me unimpressed. Very average for a ""high-end pizzeria"". Sorry but to deal with rude service, a long line, and $$$... ? I will pass on coming back here.",2.0
"Pizza was good, not sure what all the hype is about. If you're walking the Brooklyn Bridge then stop in, but it's not worth a special trip, neither is the service which is why I gave it 2 stars.

"After a walk around Brooklyn, this is the perfect place to stop for lunch. As it's slogan suggests, it is just under the bridge and it's location makes it a rather popular place.

The line is not needed since there are plenty of empty tables upstairs. I learned that the location use to be a club back in the day. I can't lie I like the location next door better. Bouncer was hilarious and let us all know all the dirt of the waitstaff. Plus it was super refreshing to hear him mention the most sexist things.

"It was very good pizza! But I think based on the hype, we were hoping for something a bit more wow-ing, especially because it was our first food stop in NY. It's definitely worth checking out though but I would never wait in line for it and luckily we definitely didn't have to (but I think we also went around 4 pm on a Saturday). The service was fine but it's pretty much a pizza place so nothing more expected. We were on the 2nd floor and unfortunately seated near a VERY obnoxious group of teenagers celebrating some sort of group valentines day thing and we were tired and freezing from walking the Brooklyn Bridge there so overall, I just can't give it more than 3 stars.",3.0

"Like an inbred duke reining over an Italian fiefdom of Brooklyn pizza, Grimaldi's has lost its way.

"Grimaldi's has excellent pizza but does not get a four or five star rating because of the run-down ambiance, service, and most importantly the lack of a liquor license. The fact that the place is cash-only which is kind of a pain.I must say that the pizzas we had were on point. Three of us shared two small pies: one red pie with oven roasted peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms and one white pie with Italian sausage and ricotta cheese. Both pies were good but the red pie was head and shoulders better than the white. The white pie has no sauce - only mozzarella and garlic. It was a bit on the dry side, but it had a nice cheesy garlic bread taste. On the other hand, we were very pleased with the red pie. The red pie had just enough sauce - not too much but enough to give the pie a great tomato flavor without making it soggy. The roasted red peppers were an excellent topping choice, and the pepperoni tasted better and seemed to be of higher quality than the dog-food pupperoni you find on Domino's/Pizza Hut pizzas.The crust/dough at Grimaldi's is good, elastic with a bit of crisp. The mozzarella was creamy and you could tell it was fresh. The other ingredients tasted fresh, too.The bill was around $45, which I thought was a tad-bit on the expensive side but not unreasonable. The service was not great and the place was a bit gross inside. Glass bottles were strewn around the place and the waiter kept coming over to us and knocking on a window that was behind us to get the attention of someone downstairs. We had to ask twice to get our waters. There is also no liquor license, which was a bummer because the pizza would have been that much better washed down by an ice-cold beer. I will definitely come back here because I think it is probably one of the better pizza options in Brooklyn. However, the lackluster service, cost, sub-par white pie and lack of liquor/beer options eliminate the possibility of an elite Yelp rating.",3.0

"Been there twice (just to see if my findings the first time was accurate) and I can honestly say it is not as good a pizza as the hype surrounding it leads it to be.

One of them saw me not eating the disgusting/burnt/indigestible crust and said he was disappointed for me not eating something so ""special"" while kissing his clasped fingers. Whereas he should be paid to kiss my ass instead if he wants the tip. The snob tries to cover it up by quickly getting olive oil, tabasco and vinegar.Unfortunately it's really hard  to fix food that is already dead.

Toppings are around $2-$4 extra, regardless of you get them on half the pie or the whole pie. An additional important fact is that they take cash only.I was with a friend so we ordered a small regular pizza with meatballs, mushrooms, and salt cured olives.

I have never had pizza that good before and I am drooling at the memory.The whole bill came out to $20 and you just can't beat that for amazing pizza.

"Came here on a Saturday night. Line were long which was expected since almost all the yelpers said the same. Best part was while waiting half way till the entrance they needed a party of 3-4 and that's exactly how many people we got. So we jumped waaaayyy ahead. Yes the other people ahead had a party of more than 4 so they weren't too happy when they saw me and my friends jumped to the front. So my actual wait was cut short of about another 20mins. Anyway the place was small and the seats were old. They were worn out and our table weren't as clean. I understand they were busy so I let the cleanliness slide. We ordered two small pizzas; one had a whole pie of Italian sausage, and the second one had half meatballs and half mushrooms. Their sodas were bottle sodas so no fountain drinks. Also no Alcohol yet, on the menu it says they alcohol license is pending. Its 3 dollars  for just one bottle of soda. CASH ONLY! No take-out, No delivery, and no reservation. Pizza were GREAT! The crust weren't burned and doughy. It was soft and thin. The sauce, cheese, and topping ratio was perfect. Service was terrible. Took over 20 mins to get our waiter to take our order then another 20 mins or more just to get our pizza. Here now we knew, the people there were waiting in front of us caught up to us so they sat down at the table behind us and ordered. They got their pizza a few mins before ours did. See how we knew we waited for that long to order and get our pizzas. Luckily the pizza was worth it. It also took what seem like forever to get our check too.Overall we left the place with happy tummy but with disappointed faces from the waiter service.",3.0
This was our second time here.  We are from California and have yet to find a pizza as good as Grimaldis.

You won't be disappointed.,5.0
"We got here at 3 and there was a short line outside. We ended up waiting quite a while. It was probably about 20-30 min we had been waiting outside in 90 degree weather with 4 starving people thinking 3PM on a Thursday we would get in right away.  However, what was aggravating was we kept getting skipped over (we were a party of 4 and they took 2 parties of 2 and a party of 7 behind us... Apparently there wasn't a 4 top available... Wtf)   Then once we got inside, we had to wait another 5-10 min on the middle floor where we could clearly see open tables. Also, no beer at this location. Seems pretty disorganized still in the new location, will most likely not come back. With an Italian husband who makes delicious homemade sauce, we can make better pizza at home.",2.0
"The legendary Grimaldi's!  Although it has finally found its way over to LA and Vegas, I never got the chance to try it, so as part of our fun filled day in Brooklyn, it was a must.  Plus, you can burn off some calories by walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. There was no wait time so we got seated right away... awesome!  It was unclear who our waiter was because I think anyone available handled our section, but it didn't matter because everyone was nice.  We sat upstairs and it was nice and quiet.  Very cool, fun, family feeling atmosphere.We ordered half tomato based with mushroom, sausage, jalapeno and half white sauce with chicken.  The tomato side was a lot better, and we ended the meal with a delicious cannoli.  Between Grimaldi's and Lombardi's, I liked Lombardi's better...but honestly at both these pizza joints, you can't go wrong and shouldn't turn down any opportunity to go here.  Enjoy and remember, CASH ONLY!",4.0
"I was not a pizza fan until I met my man. We moved here from California therefore we didn't get much exposure of the ""New York Pizza."" I brought him to Grimaldi's as our first pizza date. We enjoyed it despite the long lines. Upon our turn, we were seated upstairs and greeted with smile. We feel like home. We ordered a sausage-pepperoni pie and we call it a day. Everything was perfect! We would definitely come back for more. I'm looking forward to try their new Manhattan location too!",4.0
"I'm not sure if my family got here early or what, but the line wasn't very long, which was good. We waited about 30 minutes and we were seated. You have to order pizzas by the pie. I think their prices changed from a small (16$ to 14$) and a large (18$ to 16$) so that's pretty cool. They told us we had to wait 30 minutes for our pizza, so we did. It was hot when we got it and it was pretty good - but it's totally overrated. I feel like, if I was a tourist, sure that's some good pizza. Honestly, I think I've tasted better. The location is so pretty though. Right next to the bridge and yeah! Just walk around the pier if you don't want to be in a crowded area because the place is pretty small.",3.0
"The problem with any restaurant that becomes an establishment is that it is bound to decline in quality in some aspects relative to other restaurants.  For example: the service was okay.  Our waiter was polite, but inattentive.  He took our order, brought our drinks and food, and the check (no check-ins).  The pizza is good.  Better than most pizzas in the city.  However, the cost in my opinion isn't equivalent to what I felt I should receive.  For example: our pie was $22 for a large pie for 3 people (it recommends that it can feed 3-4 people).  Maybe I eat too much, but in my opinion it isn't enough food which means for 3 people you should be prepared to spend about $35 - $40 on pizza (about $11 - $14 per person plus tip) .  To provide some contrast, I go to my guy down the block  and get two specialty slice for $8 and I'm full.  So in short, I feel the pricing could be better. I recommend this place only if you tie it to an experience.  For example: walking across the Brooklyn Bridge with some friends or going on a date, and then stopping off at this place for a bite.  However, if you come here and you do not live in the area just to get the pizza, I recommend you save your time.",3.0

The two of us came after the lunch hour rush around 3pm and still waited around 20 minutes for a table inside. We ordered a small pizza with pepperoni (6 slices) and we weren't even able to finish that. Took the remaining 2 slices to go. They wrap each slice in foil, so you don't have to worry about it laying flat in the bag. The pizza was delicious, but I loved the pepperoni the most. It was crisp and thick. The disc is a bit smaller than what you normally see, but the thickness makes up for it.Service was a bit slow, but we didn't mind since we were enjoying the A/C and outta the heat.They only sell whole pies. Cash Only.",4.0
Great atmosphere! Feels like a movie set. We did carryout and they had it in 20 minutes. Five toppings was a really rich way to add to the saucy cheese thin crust pizza. Loved the addition of the large jalapeño slices!Very good pizza with good service....would have to try the other dishes for better rating.Highly recommended for pizza.,4.0
"Such a long wait and the pizza was not worth the wait. It was good but definitely not over the top amazing. Kind of over-hyped. But it is a good pizza. I liked the globs of cheese they put on it and the bits of basil. The sauce was flavorless though, so I had to put garlic salt on it which I never usually do. Crust was really thin, which is how I like it but for some reason not that crispy. Best part of the pizza was the fact that it wasn't oily at all. Overall, good pizza but still wait is a huge turnoff. The 30 min. wait outside was fine, but the 40 min. wait to get the pizza, 20 min. wait to get the check, and 15 min. wait just to pay the bill was just too annoying. I would like to come again, but just need to find out when the off hours are.",3.0
"Came here on a Saturday night. Line were long which was expected since almost all the yelpers said the same. Best part was while waiting half way till the entrance they needed a party of 3-4 and that's exactly how many people we got. So we jumped waaaayyy ahead. Yes the other people ahead had a party of more than 4 so they weren't too happy when they saw me and my friends jumped to the front. So my actual wait was cut short of about another 20mins. Anyway the place was small and the seats were old. They were worn out and our table weren't as clean. I understand they were busy so I let the cleanliness slide. We ordered two small pizzas; one had a whole pie of Italian sausage, and the second one had half meatballs and half mushrooms. Their sodas were bottle sodas so no fountain drinks. Also no Alcohol yet, on the menu it says they alcohol license is pending. Its 3 dollars  for just one bottle of soda. CASH ONLY! No take-out, No delivery, and no reservation. Pizza were GREAT! The crust weren't burned and doughy. It was soft and thin. The sauce, cheese, and topping ratio was perfect. Service was terrible. Took over 20 mins to get our waiter to take our order then another 20 mins or more just to get our pizza. Here now we knew, the people there were waiting in front of us caught up to us so they sat down at the table behind us and ordered. They got their pizza a few mins before ours did. See how we knew we waited for that long to order and get our pizzas. Luckily the pizza was worth it. It also took what seem like forever to get our check too.Overall we left the place with happy tummy but with disappointed faces from the waiter service.",3.0
This was our second time here.  We are from California and have yet to find a pizza as good as Grimaldis. If you looking for thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients...this is the place.  Don't let the line outside the door scare you away.. They seat you quickly and well worth the wait. You won't be disappointed.,5.0
"We got here at 3 and there was a short line outside. We ended up waiting quite a while. It was probably about 20-30 min we had been waiting outside in 90 degree weather with 4 starving people thinking 3PM on a Thursday we would get in right away.  However, what was aggravating was we kept getting skipped over (we were a party of 4 and they took 2 parties of 2 and a party of 7 behind us... Apparently there wasn't a 4 top available... Wtf)   Then once we got inside, we had to wait another 5-10 min on the middle floor where we could clearly see open tables. Also, no beer at this location. Seems pretty disorganized still in the new location, will most likely not come back. With an Italian husband who makes delicious homemade sauce, we can make better pizza at home.",2.0
"The legendary Grimaldi's!  Although it has finally found its way over to LA and Vegas, I never got the chance to try it, so as part of our fun filled day in Brooklyn, it was a must.  Plus, you can burn off some calories by walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. There was no wait time so we got seated right away... awesome!  It was unclear who our waiter was because I think anyone available handled our section, but it didn't matter because everyone was nice.  We sat upstairs and it was nice and quiet.  Very cool, fun, family feeling atmosphere.We ordered half tomato based with mushroom, sausage, jalapeno and half white sauce with chicken.  The tomato side was a lot better, and we ended the meal with a delicious cannoli.  Between Grimaldi's and Lombardi's, I liked Lombardi's better...but honestly at both these pizza joints, you can't go wrong and shouldn't turn down any opportunity to go here.  Enjoy and remember, CASH ONLY!",4.0
"I was not a pizza fan until I met my man. We moved here from California therefore we didn't get much exposure of the ""New York Pizza."" I brought him to Grimaldi's as our first pizza date. We enjoyed it despite the long lines. Upon our turn, we were seated upstairs and greeted with smile. We feel like home. We ordered a sausage-pepperoni pie and we call it a day. Everything was perfect! We would definitely come back for more. I'm looking forward to try their new Manhattan location too!",4.0
"I'm not sure if my family got here early or what, but the line wasn't very long, which was good. We waited about 30 minutes and we were seated. You have to order pizzas by the pie. I think their prices changed from a small (16$ to 14$) and a large (18$ to 16$) so that's pretty cool. They told us we had to wait 30 minutes for our pizza, so we did. It was hot when we got it and it was pretty good - but it's totally overrated. I feel like, if I was a tourist, sure that's some good pizza. Honestly, I think I've tasted better. The location is so pretty though. Right next to the bridge and yeah! Just walk around the pier if you don't want to be in a crowded area because the place is pretty small.",3.0
"The problem with any restaurant that becomes an establishment is that it is bound to decline in quality in some aspects relative to other restaurants.  For example: the service was okay.  Our waiter was polite, but inattentive.  He took our order, brought our drinks and food, and the check (no check-ins).  The pizza is good.  Better than most pizzas in the city.  However, the cost in my opinion isn't equivalent to what I felt I should receive.  For example: our pie was $22 for a large pie for 3 people (it recommends that it can feed 3-4 people).  Maybe I eat too much, but in my opinion it isn't enough food which means for 3 people you should be prepared to spend about $35 - $40 on pizza (about $11 - $14 per person plus tip) .  To provide some contrast, I go to my guy down the block  and get two specialty slice for $8 and I'm full.  So in short, I feel the pricing could be better. I recommend this place only if you tie it to an experience.  For example: walking across the Brooklyn Bridge with some friends or going on a date, and then stopping off at this place for a bite.  However, if you come here and you do not live in the area just to get the pizza, I recommend you save your time.",3.0

"Grimaldi's in DUMBO always have long lines in the summer. I have watched them move from the tiny brick place they used to be and moved two doors down to the corner of the street into a bigger place. The pizzas are made fresh in their coal fire ovens even in the 98*F temperatures on a hot New York summer day. They don't have slices for sale, only a whole entire pie! Their mozzarella cheese is fresh and delicious on their pizza with like a basil/bay leaf on every slice! It hits just the right spot!I came here again on a cold and rainy march day and there were no lines! The pizza is just as good and melts in your mouth cheesiness! Amazing!

Since then, I've been let down each time. It's way too long of a wait for average pizza. What I really don't understand is, why is the Grimaldi's chain in Tampa so much better than the original location? I still stand by the fact that they have gotten lazy, considering their reputation allows them a line out the door for all of eternity. There is much better pizza in New York, with no wait. The taste doesn't come close to matching the legend.",3.0

"I've always heard a lot of positive comments about Grimaldi's and how it's a must try while in NYC.  My friend said his friend recommended Grimaldi's if we planned to be in Brooklyn.  So we kept flip flopping whether to eat here but it was somehow dropped off our itinerary.  While we were in the Brooklyn Bridge Park, we decided to go to the Nets game so we wanted something nearby to eat.  We decided to give Grimaldi's a try since we was right there.  Though we've heard that there can be a long wait, we lucked out and sat right down just before 6pm.Grimaldi's menu is simple.  There's an antipasto, calzone, two types of pizza (regular or white), and choice of non-alcoholic drinks.  We decided to go with a small regular pizza and add on Italian sausage and mushrooms.  The small was enough to feed the two of us.  I love thin crust pizzas, however we both thought that there seemed like there was something ""missing"" in the tomato sauce.  It tasted watered down and under seasoned.  I wish they were a bit more heavy handed with our toppings.  WHAT TO KNOW:*Cash only*Service was good, though the workers didn't look happy most of the time*Pizzas come in either small ($12, 6 slices) or large ($14, 8 slices)*Standard pizzas come margherita style with cheese, tomato sauce, and basil*Additional toppings cost $2",3.0

"Ok, so I'm big on pizza...like REALLY BIG on quality pizza. Bottom of the barrel for me when it comes to pizza are places such as papa johns, and dominos. Thats not ""REAL"" pizza to me. ""REAL"" pizza is the brick oven thin crust, non overload of cheese, with hearty toppings; just like what I had at Grimaldi's. This is by far THEE BEST pizza I have every had! It's absolutely amazing compared to that oil bath you'll take from your neighborhood pizza joint. Nothing compares to the freshly made mushroom pizza with white sauce that I had. The pizza that will have me traveling to DUMBO, and quite possibly walking along that God forsaken bouncy bridge (though I don't have to). The people are pleasant, and the smiles are welcoming. Even conversation from the manager seating us was very nice, though he's been working all day. Yes, there are long lines, but your best bet is to wait to be seated, then order. Folks who come to order out tend to wait longer for their pie. It isn't sold by the slice. The price you pay is just fine for quality pizza.

The people working here are very curt, and it took a very long time for the check to come, or for the servers at this all-cash establishment to make change.Additionally, there was a dead bug on my menu when they handed it to me (I think it was a carpet beetle, but a bedbug is not out of the question).If you're looking for good pizza, go next door.",2.0
"I really don't know how this place got only 3.5 stars. Grimaldi's has some amazing pizza. If you love fresh ingredients on a thin crust cooked to perfection, this is the spot. Seriously. Definitely coming back.",5.0
"The one star is for the service and not the pizza. We ordered a large pie with meatball and sausage. The pizza is one of the best I've had, just didn't have time to enjoy it because the jerk off waiter just didn't give a shit about service. How many times can you ignore the customers? He even acknowledged that he was ignoring us. All he cared about was taking pictures with customers like he was a star, breaking news for you bro. We came for the pizza and not you. Damn shame this guy ruined our dinner.",1.0
"After 6 years in NYC I finally made it to Grimaldi's in Dumbo, Brooklyn.  We went with a small group of 5 visiting from CA so we had to show them what NY pizza was all about.  They were down to wait no matter the how long so that was a huge factor.  It was 30's out and windy but our wait wasn't too bad at 3pm got in within 30 mins.We ordered two pizzas: 1) Margherita with Garlic and 2) Pepperoni, Sausage, and GarlicBoth were a hit and extremely delicious.  We loved the crust and the sauce flavored very good.  No one complained and usually my girl from CA loves to complain so this was very impressive!!!!!",5.0
Took 25 minutes to get seated and then had to wait 40 minutes for pizza to come out. Waiter was not nice at all and literally said nothing to us. Got no refills the entire time at the restaurant. Plain cheese pizza tasted good at first but got cold very fast and then did not taste good at all. A waiter ate in front of us while we waited for food. We were looking forward to eating at this location but ended up having an awful experience.,1.0
"Ok, so I'm big on pizza...like REALLY BIG on quality pizza. Bottom of the barrel for me when it comes to pizza are places such as papa johns, and dominos. Thats not ""REAL"" pizza to me. ""REAL"" pizza is the brick oven thin crust, non overload of cheese, with hearty toppings; just like what I had at Grimaldi's. This is by far THEE BEST pizza I have every had! It's absolutely amazing compared to that oil bath you'll take from your neighborhood pizza joint. Nothing compares to the freshly made mushroom pizza with white sauce that I had. The pizza that will have me traveling to DUMBO, and quite possibly walking along that God forsaken bouncy bridge (though I don't have to). The people are pleasant, and the smiles are welcoming. Even conversation from the manager seating us was very nice, though he's been working all day. Yes, there are long lines, but your best bet is to wait to be seated, then order. Folks who come to order out tend to wait longer for their pie. It isn't sold by the slice. The price you pay is just fine for quality pizza. I strongly recommend, and it is most certainly somewhere I will visit again!",5.0

"I'm so sad I wasn't starving when I came here. The pizza is delicious. Got the white pizza with sausage. Mozzarella is my weakness. The pizzas are larger than I expected. Its definitely not a personal pizza size! And it is cheap!Service was meh. Although there are a lot of waiters around, my friend and several people around us kept having to ask for more water. Can't give this place the 4 star I want to due to the service.",3.0
I got this regular pie with sausage and mushrooms. The pizza is okay but it should be more spectacular.   My main problem with this place is the service. It's slow and honestly not nice at all. I've been here twice with no proper accommodation.  That would be my last visit here.,3.0
"Judging by the other posts, if you don't get there at the right time you'll have a long wait. Fortunately for us we walked in & were seated right away. Pizza was great, cannoli & espresso were awesome. My only complaint is they only have bottles sodas. Didn't really matter to us though because we had water. Highly recommend. Take the subway to Brooklyn, eat at Grimaldi's & walk back across the Brooklyn Bridge.",5.0
"Yes its touristy as heck and yes its busy always, but its THAT DAMN GOOD! Honestly, the best Pizza I have ever had. Service is great, they must have to try hard since its packed all the time but they do a great job. No slices and cash only, there is an ATM upstairs so don't stress it. Great quality, fair pricing and amazing flavors!!",5.0

After we left there was a huge line outside, so if anyone wants to get seated right away come early, right before their opening time. The only complains I have would be the crust could have been cooked a little more more, and the service could be more better, there were a lot of of waiters but they weren't very effective.",3.0
Julianna's is better!!!We live in DUMBO and I suppose had to try Grimaldi's just because of the hype. We picked a night when there wasn't a line and went in.1. I don't get it.

"Grimaldi's coal brick oven pizzeria is nestled under the Brooklyn Bridge and isn't far from the water and Brooklyn Bridge Park. Be warned, though, if you're walking the bridge, because you end up having to trek pretty far inland before you're able to double back. Authentic, gourmet pizza is becoming easier to find, even outside New York, but Grimaldi's seems representative of a venerable New York tradition. Their barebones pizza-oriented menu complements their efficient, no-nonsense approach to service. It's cash-only, and they don't sell slices. The baseline pizza comes with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, fresh basil, and fresh mozzarella, which is excellent on its own. There are all kinds of toppings, but the prices won't allow for an affordable ""supreme."" I feared a wait, but we sat down immediately at 5:30pm on a Monday.",5.0
I loved this place! It was highly recommended by friends. They still have the brick oven here so the pizza is amazing. We ordered the antipasto which was mozzarella cheese with tomatoes and olives and also ordered a jalapeño and pepperoni pizza. The crust was thin and the jalapeños were fresh! They added basil on top and the cheese was delicious.,5.0

"4-star pizza.Minus 3 star service.Thus, a one-star review. The pizza's good, but I would never return after my experience.I won't blame Grimaldi's for the lengthy line--good for them for being so popular--but I will blame them for the crabby guy who treats everyone like they're lucky to be standing in his line. He walks up and down the line asking how many are in each party, then as people decide to leave because the wait's too long, he gets frustrated. As we neared the front, he asked how many were in our party (for the third time) and when we said ""four,"" be snapped, ""Everybody keeps changing and now I have to start over.""  (Our party had been four all three times he asked--he just gets annoyed that people leave the line and it screws up his list.)After 50 minutes in line, we get inside and are directed upstairs by a younger host. When we get up there, the same old guy asks what we're doing up there and we tell him the host sent us up. He barks something about there being no room and storms downstairs, presumably to have words with the host. After standing around uncomfortable for a while, we get a table upstairs, which has all the charm of someone's mistreated basement rec room. There's pealing paint on the window next to our booth, a bunch of cables (coaxial and Cat5) dangle and nothing's very clean.  To put the icing on the cake, the temp on the second floor is hovering around 83 degrees.After ten minutes no one has waited on us, so I approach a server and let him know we've been waiting ten minutes.  His response is ""He'll get to you.""  That's it.  ""He'll get to you."" Having now invested an hour of waiting to sit in uncomfortable heat and be ignored, we finally get service. Finally, things are looking up!  Twenty minutes, no pizza. Thirty minutes, no pizza. Forty minutes, no pizza. Fifty minutes, no pizza. Finally, 55 minutes later, our pizzas arrive! In that entire time, the server never checked back with us. I don't care how good your pizza is (and it is good at Grimaldi's), I am still going to give a one-star review for that kind of terrible experience.",1.0

"We stopped in around noon on a weekday, before the big lunch rush, and were seated upstairs right away. In typical NY pizzeria fashion, this isn't a service oriented place. You order, they bring your food and drinks, and then the check. You will have to flag someone down for a drink refill, and don't expect anyone to ask how your food is.That being said, the pizza was some of the best we've had and the prices were more reasonable than other popular pizzerias. For $25 including the tip, we ordered a ""small"" (more than enough for two people) with pepperoni. I love the coal fired, slightly burnt crust taste, while it was a little too dark for my wife. We both agreed that the sauce was some of the best we've had, and they didn't skimp on cheese or other toppings.Make sure you bring cash or you'll have to pay their hefty ATM fees. Overall I'd say to come early, and come hungry.",4.0
"Yeah the pizza is good. But when the guy outside running the line says it'll be ""15-30 minutes"" and it takes well over an hour just to get a seat it can be beyond frustrating. Not to mention the pizza taking nearly 40 minutes once ordered. Next time I come here I'll make sure my entire day's schedule is clear because who really knows how long it will take. Kind of ridiculous. I don't care how good your pizza is if you can't handle the crowd in an honest and quick manner. Try it once then go somewhere else. The margin of quality is debatable compared to the time it takes to make it all happen. You would think for a business that has been around for so long would be a little more dialed in.

"Over the weekend, out of boredom and the desire to get out and enjoy the beautiful Fall weather, I decided to act like a tourist and enjoy a day trying out this popular place with a willing friend. After reading the yelp reviews, I was prepped for a long wait. And sure enough on arrival, there was a sufficient line of about 20-25 people. The sign out front was prominent, stating, ""Please wait to be seated. And dining and take out is the same line, ok thanks""Well much to our surprise, the line moved quickly. And being only two people, we got shuffled in within 15 minutes! So that's a nifty thing to keep in mind. ;)Grimaldis is your typical fast paced pizza place with a simple menu of only a few pizza topping choices and two sizes. But then again, you come for the pizza. And not much else. Why complicate a solid formula that has worked for years?!We were seated in the second level which had a view down below of the pizzas being made. And like a factory, your order is taken, pizza is created and boom, you eat. The pizza was good. The crust was just ok in my opinion and parts were a bit blackened and burned but that added some flavor. The toppings were good, we has sausage and cheese but the pie itself was a bit soft and required a fork and knife till you'd eaten the triangle tip. So initially folding it the classic NY way isn't happening. But flavor wise? Sauce was good. We still devoured our 6 slice small pie between the two of us. Was the perfect size for hearty eaters!Service was fast, attentive and prices are good. Overall, Grimaldis is a great NY experience and one I'd share with anyone not from the area. This iconic NY pizza joint does not disappoint",4.0
"I wish they had one of these in Denver, this pizza is amazing!!!  The crust was as thin and crispy as I think is humanly possible.  I love that they put a shaker of garlic powder out on the table - I will have to start doing that at my house now, too.  So good, you won't be disappointed!",5.0

"Great pizza. Top of the line. Absolutely one of the best in NYC. I feel that Lombardi's has great sauce, John's has great crust, but Grimaldi's has the best mixture of all. I've been here a couple of time and only once I have to wait in line for about an hour, but, since I was waiting for a friend, it was OK.The restaurant is pretty decent looking. One of the few bad things to say about this place is that they know that they are top of the line, so they don't really appreciate their clientele as they should. Basically, you have to feel thankful that they let you in. But, as they are SO great, they can get away with it. The prices are good. $16 for a large pizza is more that great. Regarding the ingredients, the cheese is great but what took me away was the pepperoni. really thick and kind of crunchy. It's right next to the Fulton Ferry landing, so it makes a great stroll after eating to get great views of the Manhattan skyline.",5.0
"Unfortunately I think the quality of Grimaldi's is slowly going down as the customer base continues to increase, lines remain long and the pressure to turn out pizzas quickly becomes an issue. Our pizza hadn't been baked well, the vegetables were still raw and it was lukewarm. We waited so long in line and were starving by then so ended up eating it. Ordered the cheese with mushrooms and onions. The topping combination was good but it could have been baked more thoroughly. Also lacked salt. Once we added enough oregano and spicy red flakes, it was easier to eat.",2.0
"This is supposed to be one of the best pizza places in New York, but I didn't think so. The pizza was bland and boring. The host was rude. I was waiting in line with my dog while my fiance went to the atm. The host said ""I can't seat you. You have dog"". I said i understand and was just here to pick up. He rudely asked ""whose gonna put in ur order?"" Which btw i had already told him my fiance would, once he gets back. He said ""you don't need to be here, he can come in, put the order and we can bring it out."" It may just have been a language gap, but I thought he was a rude old man, and I am never eating there again, even if they do indeed live up to their reputation.

We arrived right when they opened, around 11:30 a.m., and was able to beat the lunch crowd. We were seated right away. We ordered a small pizza ($12) with red sauce, sun-dried tomatoes ($4), mushrooms ($2), and sausages ($2). The pizza had 6 slices and is recommended for 2-3 people. This was my first real experience of real New York pizza. I was initially undecided about whether to try Grimaldi's or Lombardi's but after going through many yelp reviews, I decided to put Grimaldi's on my food itinerary. I loved the think crust and fresh flavors of the ingredients. I will definitely be back during my next visit. Note: Cash only. Can't buy by the slice and need to order a whole pizza.",4.0

So that's a nifty thing to keep in mind. ;)Grimaldis is your typical fast paced pizza place with a simple menu of only a few pizza topping choices and two sizes. But then again, you come for the pizza. And not much else. Why complicate a solid formula that has worked for years?!We were seated in the second level which had a view down below of the pizzas being made. And like a factory, your order is taken, pizza is created and boom, you eat. The pizza was good. The crust was just ok in my opinion and parts were a bit blackened and burned but that added some flavor. The toppings were good, we has sausage and cheese but the pie itself was a bit soft and required a fork and knife till you'd eaten the triangle tip. So initially folding it the classic NY way isn't happening. But flavor wise? Sauce was good. We still devoured our 6 slice small pie between the two of us. Was the perfect size for hearty eaters!Service was fast, attentive and prices are good. Overall, Grimaldis is a great NY experience and one I'd share with anyone not from the area. This iconic NY pizza joint does not disappoint",4.0
"I wish they had one of these in Denver, this pizza is amazing!!!  The crust was as thin and crispy as I think is humanly possible.  I love that they put a shaker of garlic powder out on the table - I will have to start doing that at my house now, too.  So good, you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"Here's your best bet on getting a table at Grimaldi's: Come on a rainy Monday for lunch.That's exactly what my friends and I did and we waited no more than 2 minutes for the host to seat us. We sat at a tiny table that had barely been cleared off, but that's part of the charm, right? Right.This is definitely a no-nonsense kind of place, you got your pies, sodas and a few desserts. Waiters are nice and quick. Cash only for you credit card lovers!",4.0
"Great pizza. Top of the line. Absolutely one of the best in NYC. I feel that Lombardi's has great sauce, John's has great crust, but Grimaldi's has the best mixture of all. I've been here a couple of time and only once I have to wait in line for about an hour, but, since I was waiting for a friend, it was OK.The restaurant is pretty decent looking. One of the few bad things to say about this place is that they know that they are top of the line, so they don't really appreciate their clientele as they should. Basically, you have to feel thankful that they let you in. But, as they are SO great, they can get away with it. The prices are good. $16 for a large pizza is more that great. Regarding the ingredients, the cheese is great but what took me away was the pepperoni. really thick and kind of crunchy. It's right next to the Fulton Ferry landing, so it makes a great stroll after eating to get great views of the Manhattan skyline.",5.0
"Unfortunately I think the quality of Grimaldi's is slowly going down as the customer base continues to increase, lines remain long and the pressure to turn out pizzas quickly becomes an issue. Our pizza hadn't been baked well, the vegetables were still raw and it was lukewarm. We waited so long in line and were starving by then so ended up eating it. Ordered the cheese with mushrooms and onions. The topping combination was good but it could have been baked more thoroughly. Also lacked salt. Once we added enough oregano and spicy red flakes, it was easier to eat.",2.0
"This is supposed to be one of the best pizza places in New York, but I didn't think so. The pizza was bland and boring. The host was rude. I was waiting in line with my dog while my fiance went to the atm. The host said ""I can't seat you. You have dog"". I said i understand and was just here to pick up. He rudely asked ""whose gonna put in ur order?"" Which btw i had already told him my fiance would, once he gets back. He said ""you don't need to be here, he can come in, put the order and we can bring it out."" It may just have been a language gap, but I thought he was a rude old man, and I am never eating there again, even if they do indeed live up to their reputation. There are hundreds of good pizza places with half pleasant hosts I can go to in this city.",1.0
"4th time in NYC and finally made it to Grimaldi's. Located under the Brooklyn Bridge, it's not hard to find. I came with Ken L. during the week for lunch. We arrived right when they opened, around 11:30 a.m., and was able to beat the lunch crowd. We were seated right away. We ordered a small pizza ($12) with red sauce, sun-dried tomatoes ($4), mushrooms ($2), and sausages ($2). The pizza had 6 slices and is recommended for 2-3 people. This was my first real experience of real New York pizza. I was initially undecided about whether to try Grimaldi's or Lombardi's but after going through many yelp reviews, I decided to put Grimaldi's on my food itinerary. I loved the think crust and fresh flavors of the ingredients. I will definitely be back during my next visit. Note: Cash only. Can't buy by the slice and need to order a whole pizza.",4.0
"I knew I had to try New York Pizza and from the amount of reviews and ratings this place has, I figured I'd give it a try at least as a base.WAIT: You have to wait in line and then they call you up when your table becomes available.  For a weeknight at 8pm we only waited like 15 minutes.ATMOSPHERE: A basic pizza parlor place, nothing fancy.  I could tell it's probably been around for a while the way it looked and there's an upstairs.FOOD: We got the red sauce pizza and the white pizza.  On the red sauce we put sausage and mushroom.  The crust wasn't soggy and it held it's own, crusty, crispy and thin.  It was pretty dang good.  The white pizza had pepperoni and onion.  Also very good, lots of garlic so I was a fan.  Some people might not like the fact that it doesn't have tomato sauce, but I liked that.This is definitely a traditional pizza place.  They don't have those ""premium"" toppings such as prosciutto or asparagus, goat cheese or pear etc.  So you have to make do with what they give you.To be honest though, the thin crust pizza we have here is pretty comparable.  Again, maybe I didn't try the ""best pizza in NY"" but Bottega Louie and Pizza Mozza were pretty good too.Overall, good for a chain.",4.0
Had this place in my bucket list as a must go during my NYC trip. Went there with 5 friends there for lunch today. Nothing special. The pizza's were as skinny as a paris model :( I would rather eat little caesar's 3 meat treat for a small fraction of the price! I wouldn't go there again!,1.0

"Loved the neighborhood.  Went on a Wednesday evening and had no wait at all.  We were seated upstairs and it was a little warm up there.  Their pops are served in bottles and I think were three bucks.  We had five people (two teen boys in this group) and we devoured two large pizzas.  We got one large pepperoni and one large white pizza.  We used the garlic salt to give the white pizza a little more flavor.  It could have used a little more garlic in my opinion.  Loved the place...would go again.  Nice area to go down and check out the bridge and the water with a view of the statue of liberty.  Had some interesting desserts, but we didn't try them.  They don't have extras such as salads and breadsticks that I seen.",4.0
"Pretty good pizza spot. Line outside that took us about 45 minutes to get in, so expect a line when you do go. Friendly and welcoming staff.

"Went with two friends late at night to have a taste of this pizza. Contrary to popular belief, this pizza is not amazing. Hell, its barely mediocre.

"So good! We have one in Southlake, TX, but this location is amazing!  I am not sure if it tastes better because we were in Brooklyn or what but the white pizza is amazing.

"Yes! it is true what they say about this place. I tried this place with a friend on a saturday evening and waited on line for about 30 minutes.

After dining here my friend and I noted that while many seats were empty on the inside they still kept people waiting on line outside for an extended amount of time. It appeared to us that they want to maintain the ""busy"" look.As far as the food itself, in my opinion, some of the pizzas that I saw come out were very burnt and I was greatful that mine wasnt one of them but the cheesiness was always just right.

"My friend and I came here on a Saturday after failing to find the ever famous Smorgasborg. Since it was extremely humid, we definitely felt our energy draining as we gave up on our Smorgasborg food adventure. Luckily, Grimaldi's was right around the corner from where we were walking, so we decided to grab lunch and replenish our energy here.Apparently, Grimaldi's boasts as New York City's first pizza restaurant that cooks their pizza in a brick oven as opposed to the stainless steel ovens we all know and love. While I don't know how true that is, I was honestly just glad to put something in my stomach. Since my friend and I arrived there before the lunch rush, we missed the line and were seated fairly quickly on the second floor. It's evident that Grimaldi's tries to maintain an atmosphere that encourages patrons to talk to each other - our server told my friend and I, as well as the table next to us, that ""We're all one big family!"". I thought that was cute - how often do you see restaurants encouraging people to talk to each other??My friend and I decided to order a small pizza with half pepperoni and half Italian sausage. When our pizza came, it was extremely hot - fresh out of the brick oven. I couldn't help but be internally disappointed at the size of the Italian sausage. While half of our pizza was covered in this delicious meat, the size of the sausage itself was pretty mediocre. However, I am comparing the sausage chunks to commercialized pizza chains, so maybe this might be the actual size of legitimate sausage, and not some hormone injected mystery sausage.After struggling to cut off a slice for each of us, my friend and I finally dug in. The pizza was steaming hot, with gooey melty cheese and a crunchy crust - just how pizza should be! Grimaldi's gives you a fork and a knife to use for your pizza, and I was almost tempted to do so because the slice was that hot. But then I thought, ""I'm a New Yorker, what am I doing?"" and ate it with my hands. Everything tasted pretty fresh, when compared to all the free pizza I get during the school year, so I was definitely a fan.What prevents me from giving Grimaldi's five stars is the fact that while the pizza comes out piping hot, it quickly gets cold in the center. By the time I had finished my first slice, my second slice was kind of hot bordering on warm. So when I ate my second slice, my third slice was just a little over room temperature. I mean, the amazing thing about pizza is that it tastes good no matter what, but its just a little disappointing not to have experienced the stretchy cheese with every slice. Another reason I won't give Grimaldi's five stars is the fact that its cash only.

Well let me start off with saying that the pizza was decent pretty fresh mozzarella n toppings I got a large pie half pepperoni n ham and half ham and meatballs well after we ordered our pizza it took them 1 full hour to bring it to us the waiter didn't even come to tell us that it was on our way or anything 1 hour later got the food some of the crust was burnt. Like I said pizza was alright the service sucked def not worth the wait,3.0
Pizza had fresh ingredients and was not greasy at all.  Love the thin crust.  Only issue was the Frank Sinatra burnout who was taking down the number of your party outside.  We told him we were ordering take out outside but he ignored that and set up a table anyway and gave us a dirty look when we told him we were ordering take out.  Then we were asked to wait outside in the cold because he told us (with attitude) the waiters were all complaining we were in the way yet the waiters were moving past us without issue.. Even served me a water while I was waiting inside.  Oldblueeyespizzahost was completely rude and this is not the way to treat people who wait outside over an hour for pizza. This Frank Sinatra-stein makes me want to fly to the moon for pizza instead of Brooklyn for my pizza.,4.0
Walked the Brooklyn Bridge and waited outside in line for 30 minutes on a chilly December afternoon but it was well worth it. Quiet restaurant with amazing pizza surrounded by great neighborhoods for walking it off!,5.0

"Just after the Brooklyn bridge, when it comes into view it looks more like a nightclub.There's a husky guy in a leather jacket letting a restricted number of people in, few at a time. The line stretches to the end of the block. But it's not a nightclub, it's Grimaldi's. It's New York. It's a big deal.  Even if the seating is super close to each other, the shoddy tv barely broadcasts the futbol game, the AC doesn't seem to work, and the wait is long (the oven shuts down for 2 hours in the afternoon) it's still worth it. It's all about the NYC experience.The basic pizza is topped with basil and mozza. That's it. It's simple and it's delicious. The dough is unparalleled anywhere else, it's chewy but just enough that it's also soft. What kind of sorcery is this?! It's Grimaldi magic. The pie looks huge but when you're actually down into it, it goes really quick, the pie is super thin. One pizza was enough for the two of us, but I'm sure the men could polish off one to themselves comfortably.Because their oven shuts down everyday from 3-5pm (I think) the line builds up incredibly fast. No point in coming for early dinner because you end up sitting and looking stupid.",4.0
Best pizza in new York. Small restaurant the seating is really tight but it's NYC. Waiting time can get long. Worth the great food. Staff was quick at waiting tables.,5.0
"While in New York everyone advised that Grimaldi's was a must, specifically this location. So, my brother and I set out on a little adventure to Brooklyn. We arrived a little before six and we were able to be seated right away. Lucky us! We really wanted a beer with our pizza, but they hadn't yet got their license back. No biggie. We ordered a small with mushrooms and sausage. It took a little while for the pizza to come, but we stayed occupied watching the waitstaff hustle and I was completely entertained by their accents. I wanted to strike up conversation just to hear them speak. Our pizza finally arrived and it looked delicious. Nice thin crust that you can easily fold and devour. The ingredients all tasted extremely fresh and you don't get that super acidic overpowering taste you get from canned tomato sauce. We polished the entire pizza off within minutes. I was expecting a little more flavor from the sausage, though. Our experience at Grimaldi's was great, however, I can't say it's the best pizza I have ever had. I feel the jury is still out on that one.",4.0
"We went to this place based on recommendations from many friends.  We were told to expect a line out the door and an hour wait but when we arrived at 7:30PM on a Friday, the place was empty.  It was nice to get seated quickly but we were the only two people sitting upstairs.  The pizza was excellent, tasted great, nothing bad to say.  I got the cannoli for dessert and it was delicious, but when we left the restaurant there was this cute ice cream parlor under the bridge which I would do next time. I would go back definitely.",4.0
So after eating at Juliana's and Grimaldis on consecutive days the verdict is in. The pizza is just about identical in both restaurants. I ordered a pepperoni pizza from each place and they were pretty much the same thing. They were both very good. They are both not as delicious as Difaras pizza. I would recommend both places but I wouldnt wait in line for an hour at Grimaldis. That's for tourists. It's not the greatest thing ever. Don't get me wrong it's very good. I would go to either place if I was in the area. Grimaldis gets swarmed by tourists. Juliana's doesn't as much. I think the pizzas are both delicious. They aren't the best but very good. The guy next to me from London (obviously) and I both finished a small pie.  Mine had pepperoni. I was very stuffed. I swear in Grimaldis I was like one of the five or six people from America in the place. Nothing wrong with that but just makes you feel like your at Disney world or something. It's a major tourist attraction. Great places for pizza in Ny!,4.0
"Got in fairly fast because we were only a party of two. Pizza was amazing and atmosphere was nice. You can see them making the pizza which is very cool, would definitely go again.",5.0

"The pizza was very good, although it tasted more like what I had in Italy than the greasy, cheesy pizza I associate with NY.   We split a large regular ($14) (yelp.com/biz_photos/grim…) and it was more than enough for the two of us.  The fresh mozzarella on the pizza was amazing and the tomato sauce was light and sweet.   Definitely a good pie, but I think I would have been a little annoyed if we had waited on a super long line for it, since we have similar places in CA.  Fortunately when we went on a Saturday around 8 pm, the wait for 2 people was less than 10 minutes.Service is really non-existent.  I was not expecting anything fancy since it's a pizza place, but we had a really hard time finding someone to take our order and refill our water glasses.",4.0

That's what it seemed like as no real New Yorker would eat here.

BEWARE: Don't let a name fool you. The original Grimaldi's is located next door and named Juliana's.

The sauce and the cheese were also on point. The pepperoni, however, tasted a bit freezer-burnt or over-processed or something. Also, the cash only deal is a bit weird.All in all, it's a place I'd enthusiastically suggest for guests, and maybe I'd grab a pie to go if I'm spending a day at Brooklyn Bridge Park, but it probably won't become one of my go-to's.",4.0

The sauce was yum...not too sweet or tangy. The crust was golden brown and mostly crispy. Also, the pizza was not overly cheesy and heavy with oil. They use fresh mozzarella which is not oily at all so the pizza seems less heavy. We were seated upstairs by the window that overlooks the making of the pizzas.

"How I heard of this place: In February of 2008, on my way to NYC for Fashion Week, someone on the flight from Los Angeles, California mentioned Grimaldi's. He said it's the place to go for pizza in the northeast. It came up again, while looking through a friends pictures (mobile uploads) on Facebook and coming across a steamy, bubbling, thin-crust pizza and learning that it, too, was from Grimaldi's.Type of cuisine: One antipasto, four pizzas (either small or large, regular or white), two calzones (small or large), a limited list of toppings and beverages, including sodas, juice, Snapple, still or sparkling water, beer or wine. And four desserts from which to choose, washing it all down with one of four hot beverages. Simple. Easy. But not mainstream.Ambiance: Their list of don'ts says it all: ""No credit cards. No reservations. No slices. No delivery."" Apparently less is more at Grimaldi's. Walk through the glass door at the front,only after being invited in by your host, an elderly gentleman wearing a pin-striped, dark grey button-up shirt with charcoal slacks, white suspenders and an almost-black fedora. The doors lead into a small lobby, which immediately opens onto the cramped quarters of what is Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn Bridge. Red- and white-checked tableclothes cover each table, but can hardly be seen among the dozens of patrons, loudly conversing and making ordering decisions. Metallic lamp-shades make their way down, over the tables, from the ceiling, resembling lights you might see in a dark room where mobsters gather to play poker. The white walls are covered in framed photographs of celebrities, politicians and other famous types who have dined at Grimaldi's over the years. Wait staff hustle and bustle through the mini-aisles created between tables and chairs to bring 18-inch pizzas to drooling, hungry patrons. Windows facing street-side at the front of the establishment give way to natural lighting, though the back still feels dimly lit. The wall to your far right and towards the back of the establishment, from where you enter, is full of boxes and supplies on garage-style shelving units. The kitchen, open to the restaurant, is blocked only by a marble-slab counter top and plexiglass, through which one can see the large containers of fresh vegetables, pepperoni and cheese. The coal-fire oven just behind, exude heat and flames, which light up the kitchen, as workers smile and toss pizza dough into the air until it is cardboard-thin. Pizza and calzones are placed on cubed stands  to allow for a bit of dining space, on plates, underneath. Two trays covering the entire table for four.  What I ordered: My husband, good friend from Queens and I decided to meet at Grimaldi's after a weekend in Brooklyn - me, for a conference, my husband, to hang out and take in the street festivals and sites - we could not leave without having finally sampled Grimaldi's pizza. I skipped the afternoon session of my conference to get lost on the subway and wait in a 33-minute line, underneath some construction scaffolding, along Old Fulton, before being called in by the old man wearing a fedora, and pin-striped suit with grey slacks, held together by white suspenders. The simplicity of the menu made it easy to decide: one, large, regular pizza ($14), which comes with fresh mozzarella, crushed tomatoes and basil, and the addition of pepperoni, Italian sausage, sliced onions, mushrooms and fresh garlic (additional $2 each).We also had to sample the large (18-inch) calzone ($16) with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, ricotta cheese, pepperoni and onions (additional $2 per topping applied here, too). To sip on, we had one Coke ($2) and two Olde Brooklyn Sodas ($2 each) in the Cream variety. When in Brooklyn...Right?What I loved: I loved the thin crust, the huge size of the calzone, the very fresh ingredients - from the soft and stringy mozzarella to the mushrooms and the basil, from the sausage that looked to have been rolled in house, to the crunchy, transparent onion slices...and, of course, the crunch of fresh chopped garlic, heaped to generous proportions on our pizza. Why I loved it: I love the simplicity of the menu and the bustling feeling of the space. I love the smallness of the interior and the greatness of the food. I love that there are nearly as many employees - from kitchen-staff to wait-staff as there are customers in the establishment. I love that we were squeezed in, between two other tables, and no one seemed to think anything of it.Cost: Average to high ($12-$16 per pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil or crushed garlic; additional toppings $2 each)",3.0

Forget NYers, we were the only Americans in there.  The table is set with plastic plates and cutlery. I don't mean to be a snob, but look who's giving this place 4+ stars and who isn't and the correlation with their locations; I should have known better. But I'm not letting that impact this review. Menu is really simple: red or white, small or large. Want prosciutto, arugula, broccoli rabe or any topping not from a can? Fuhgeddaboudit! We ordered a small red, and the waiter repeated back white. I corrected him red and again he said white. Ok, Brookyn Italian restaurant, they like to mess with you, I get it, been there before. We laugh it off and order a red once more,  30-40 mins later a white pie comes, you gotta be kidding me! The original waiter disappeared so I explained to the other waiter what happened and his response was to tell me that my waiter has been there for 20+ years and is burnt out. No apology. I feel for him, but come on, I said red, you put in a ticket for red, not that hard. So they took the white pizza back and put sauce on top. That's not a red pie, but we ate it and it was pretty good. I'd take a piping hot slice from Joe's on Carmine over it without a doubt. Then comes the worst part...The 2nd waiter comes by and tells me I need to explain to the original waiter what happened so he understands his mistake. I then hear waiter #2 tell waiter #1 ""do your f*cking job!"" on his way to me.  I recalled the situation calmly and respectfully to waiter #1, with sympathy (""I thought we were having a laugh but maybe you misunderstood me"") and he proceeds to give me the most unholy guilt trip of my life (I'm a BK Jew so I consider myself an authority on the matter). He tells me I'm making him feel like he has a mental handicap. I try to say ""hey it's Christmas, let's just move on, no hard feelings"" but this guy isn't letting go and I'm now in the most awkward experience of my life. My girlfriend was legit worried that they were gonna take us to the back and beat the crap out of us. Between getting the leftovers boxed and paying the check, we have 3 more interactions w the guy and he apologizes probably 30 times in a guilt inducing manner.  It was a master manipulation.

"We headed there mid-week at around 12.30pm and got seated straight away. We were lucky!The pizza was just delicious. Fresh ingredients and expertly prepared - you can see the chefs making the pizzas. The base was crisp, the crust was delicious and not greasy, and the toppings were just perfect. We got a small cheese and tomato, which was just enough for both of us. We still had room for dessert afterwards so shared a cannoli - really crunchy and fresh, with a lovely cream filling. One star off because our waiter just wasn't attentive enough. We kept having to ask another waiter or waitress to get him for us.",4.0
"I do NOT recommend going to Grimaldis. The pizza is good, but not worth the wait or the awful service. If you want to wait an hour for decent pizza and lousy service, suit  yourself. Within 1 week I had pizza at 3 different pizza places in 3 different cities: Grimaldis in NYC, Pitch in Omaha, and Settebellos in SLC. While good, Grimaldis was the worst of the three with the absolute worst service. Settebellos was best and Pitch was a close second, only beat because the crust at Settebellos is amazing. When you can get better pizza in both Omaha and Salt Lake City, you know Grimaldis ain't anything special. ... BTW: Settebellos is part of Vera Pizza Napoletana, an international organization that promotes authentic Naples-style pizza (americas.pizzanapoletana…), so yes you can have great pizza in Utah.",2.0
"I was a frequent patron of Grimaldi's Pizza. returned recently with 4 friends and was extremely disappointed. The pizza and quality ingredients have gone way down hill. There was barely any tomato sauce on the pizza , like maybe half a teaspoon on a large pie. The cheese was not fresh mozzarella but cheap packaged mozzarella cheese and way too much of it on the pie, as well as way too much low,grade parmesan cheese which made the pizza too salty.The crust was mediocre. i get better crust and pizza at my local slice stand.

"Shocked and disappointed, maybe I built it up too far, but I had big expectations for the pizza here.

"The pizza was good...now the bad news: the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. The host was rude and gruff with everyone in line.  I tried to ask him for a menu 4 times and he ignored and shrugged me off every time.  Every employee is a man...no women, and their faces look like they've been to a funeral. No one smiled at all. Restaurant was hot. Their were flies landing on me and the pizza. As I walked out, no employee said a word to me.

Good pizza. Cash only. Lunch for 3 under $30-fast service and good pepperoni. Decor is not their concern and restrooms only seat one at a time (why bother labeling them men and women when the men's room has far less traffic)?,4.0
"Yum! The line was so long we ordered to go and ate outside near the water. So lovely!Simply go in and order and save yourself some time.Thin crust is never as good as deep dish :) but it was very light and crispy. It didn't disappoint.Very fresh marinara sauce, basil and mozzarella as it's basics. I would definitely love more sauce but that's just me. We added Italian sausage and it was yummy. Not a bad price and a generous quantity. It's a little trek out, but worth at least a try.Grimmaldi's, you are cheeraldi's.",4.0
"The pizza really is one of the best.  Really special. Definitely worth the line. Service was meh and the restaurant operation seemed disorganized and chaotic.  As we waited in line, some locals pointed out that the place next door with the shorter line was opened by a family member when the owning family split, and that the neighboring place was at least as good--and had a liquor license.  Next time we will try there.",4.0
Rude old man in the front. Pizza was good and  waiting on line was no problem. But next one in line and he took the people behind us because my sister needed to use the ladies room so he would not sit me down. Makes no sense. Customer service sucks!!!,2.0
"We headed there mid-week at around 12.30pm and got seated straight away. We were lucky!The pizza was just delicious. Fresh ingredients and expertly prepared - you can see the chefs making the pizzas. The base was crisp, the crust was delicious and not greasy, and the toppings were just perfect. We got a small cheese and tomato, which was just enough for both of us. We still had room for dessert afterwards so shared a cannoli - really crunchy and fresh, with a lovely cream filling. One star off because our waiter just wasn't attentive enough. We kept having to ask another waiter or waitress to get him for us.",4.0
"I do NOT recommend going to Grimaldis. The pizza is good, but not worth the wait or the awful service. If you want to wait an hour for decent pizza and lousy service, suit  yourself. Within 1 week I had pizza at 3 different pizza places in 3 different cities: Grimaldis in NYC, Pitch in Omaha, and Settebellos in SLC. While good, Grimaldis was the worst of the three with the absolute worst service. Settebellos was best and Pitch was a close second, only beat because the crust at Settebellos is amazing. When you can get better pizza in both Omaha and Salt Lake City, you know Grimaldis ain't anything special. ... BTW: Settebellos is part of Vera Pizza Napoletana, an international organization that promotes authentic Naples-style pizza (americas.pizzanapoletana…), so yes you can have great pizza in Utah.",2.0
"I was a frequent patron of Grimaldi's Pizza. returned recently with 4 friends and was extremely disappointed. The pizza and quality ingredients have gone way down hill. There was barely any tomato sauce on the pizza , like maybe half a teaspoon on a large pie. The cheese was not fresh mozzarella but cheap packaged mozzarella cheese and way too much of it on the pie, as well as way too much low,grade parmesan cheese which made the pizza too salty.The crust was mediocre. i get better crust and pizza at my local slice stand.

"Its hard to miss this place at the corner with lots of people gathered around. I went here on a Wednesday night around 7pm by myself and there was barely any wait.

Then you choose additional toppings. I chose a small mozzarella pizza with basil, pepperoni, and sun dried tomatoes. I should've chosen a basil pizza instead.

"There's only one appropriate word to accurately describe Grimaldi's. AMAZING. I came in with my brother to grab some pizza. He had already been here once before, and he sung it's praises so I decided to take the plunge and hop on the subway over to Brooklyn. We grabbed a seat and ordered a small pizza which came to be three slices for each of us. It was a margherita pizza that had tomato sauce that tasted like a fine wine. The mozzarella was fresh, and the crust was heavenly. It was a thin crust pizza cooked in a coal brick oven. At first I was in awe of how good this pizza was, then I started mowing it down and we decided to order another small. In total we had 6 slices each. When I got to the final slice, I almost wanted to quit, but it tasted so good I just couldn't stop. So since we felt like a bunch of fatties, we figured it would be wise to walk back over the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan and walk it off. If you want a legitimate slice of pizza in New York City, you NEED to go to Gramadli's. It's the best.",5.0
"Pizza was a lot bigger than expected and wasn't greasy at all but I found it to be not as tasty as some of the other slices I've  tried in the city.

The place was packed but I still didn't understand why it would take so long given how fast those pizzas cook.

"After trekking over the Brooklyn bridge, we were rewarded by another awesome pizza place! I've dubbed this place ""pizza under the bridge"" as that's what we were referring it as throughout our trip. A small pizza is $12 w/ 6 slices and a large is $14 w/ 8 slices. Each additional topping is another $2. Pros:- Big restaurant with two floors of seating (we were seated almost immediately at noon)- Pizza is big; giving you thin, fat slices that are easily folded- Coal-burning oven gives it that extra depth of flavor- Fast, friendly service- Large variety of toppings- Great price. A large w/ 2 toppings was more than enough for 2 peopleCons:- Cash only!- Our pizza crust was a bit burnt- No pizza by the sliceWas this worth the adventure over the bridge? For us first-time visitors, it was absolutely worth it as we got to sight-see, explore, and take our time. For locals?

"Just came back from trying ""The #1 pizza in NY"" just to be really disappointed. We got a table after 15 minutes or so , so not much of a wait. So after around 5 mins this guy took our order, blah blah blah, waited another 15 mins until our order finally came. My boyfriend and I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and a small white pizza, to our surprise it came out a lot bigger than  we had anticipated. Anyway we excitedly grabbed a fresh hot slice and took a bite JUST TO BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. SO THIS IS WHAT THE BEST PIZZA TASTES LIKE?? Omg, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good which was why I was disappointed. The small pizza w pepperoni was ok while the white pizza was the worst of all. It was so so so bland and it was just gross. I brought the rest of the 4 slices home only to have no one eat it. Anyway, as we finish the small pizza, we wanted more water and napkins. One of the waiters refilled our water looking pissed as hell and another waiter took a STACK of napkins, like 7-8 and just threw it on the table. So much for customer service! Now that we're done with our mediocre pizza, we asked for the check. It came out to be $36.... I was confused BC the pizza total should be $29. Confused, I decided to ask one of the workers, this old guy that seated us walked by so I conveniently asked, before I even got to ask him if tip is included he swatted me away and told me to ask one of the waiters. Ok so we did and turns out tip was added on to my paycheck. I honestly don't mind paying tip BUT THEY DID A TERRRIBLE ATROCIOUS, and DISGRACEFUL JOB SO WHY ASK FOR MY TIP. Anyway, I'm just really disappointed I wasted $36. Just know that they have really EHHHH pizza and if you want good pizza in Brooklyn, you can always try L&B's. And they have really shitty service so be prepare.",1.0

"My friend was visiting me in New York and we arrived early to this fine establishment (ha!) at 11:30am on Saturday- got seated right away. Wow, I thought to myself, lucky us! Haha oh boy, on the contrary...anyways let's keep going.Ordered, food came out pretty quick. Food: Pizza was pizza. I mean, what's so special? It's tomato sauce with cheese and basil, extra $2 for mushrooms lol. It was ok.THE WAITER (identified as: tall man with a short ponytail) WHO WAS SO RUDE, WASN'T. Here we go: (fasten your seatbelts for this- it might get turbulent, or maybe you'll be laughing so hard at this waiter, that you'll fall off your chair)My friend and I paid for our meal using a $20 bill and we were waiting for change...after awhile nothing was coming back to us, so we went to go talk to the waiter. We explained to our waiter nicely that we had paid with a $20 bill and we wanted to know where our change was or if it was coming. He disagreed, saying ""why would I give you change if you left exact change?"" Now ok- you're thinking maybe we might've mistaken ourselves and maybe we got confused. But hello!!! Freaking counting exact change is a lot more tedious than putting a $20 bill down. Who the heck is going to confuse putting a $20 bill down versus putting down exact change???? (This just shows you how stupid our waiter was)We replied that we had not used exact change, we had used a $20 bill. He went on to say ""no, you're wrong."" Huh? Excuse me??? In what era did it become ok for waiters to say such comments to customers? And at such a highly rated place? Please, someone enlighten me.He wouldn't give us our change back, even after we insisted that we were 100% sure of our actions. He adamantly refused. Then, (ok- listen up kids) he. told. us. to. leave. angrily. Really. You're asking a customer to leave, and you're at fault? ABSURD. It's almost comical at this point. I asked for his name (ponytail man) so I could go to the manager and he said ""my name is irrelevant"". What? Excuse me? I was half expecting the ""What Would You Do?"" camera and crew to jump out. I mean, I would've loved to meet John Quinones. Anyways, how is your name irrelevant? Your name is what I need so the manager can fire you!!! (THE WAITER HAS A PONYTAIL IF ANYONE IS READING- or maybe he chopped it off out of embarrassment)He left silently and we had to follow him downstairs to get our change because he FINALLY realized he was wrong. This scumbag. Did not apologize. Not one ounce of ""oops I was a douche-bag"". We even tipped him what we would've before the incident. Still no apology or thanks. Ungrateful. I might've forgiven him if he was apologetic, but he was a rude rude rude man.Seriously?You should be ashamed of yourself- waiter with a (short) ponytail. Rude rude rude. I guess restaurants aren't going by the phrase ""customer first"" anymore. More like ""customer's wrong"".Please. Edit- I'm home in West Chester now after a day in NYC. What a horrible experience to have. Worst restaurant experience EVER in my entire life. And I hope, for the rest of my life.If people running this place don't think their customers are important, I don't think you should support them. The pizza wasn't even that good. Never EVER going back and never recommending this place to anyone. Steer clear, tourists- I'm doing you a favor. You're welcome. :)Take your money elsewhere...not worth the rude treatment. And people get in line and WAIT for this??? Hahaha that's so extremely sad for those poor folks. I just remember passing by a lady with a yoga mat on the way there and she recommended that we go to the place next door. I wish I had heeded her advice. I still can't believe a waiter would tell a customer ""you're wrong"" and ""leave"". What a complete disaster. Good thing he didn't tell me his name or else it would be right smack in this review about 100 times. Maybe he's not so dumb...But you can still identify him by his short ponytail! Enjoy!",1.0

Luckily, my friend and I didn't have to wait as long as others as a 2 person seat opened up, but while waiting for our food and eating, we saw the line extend even longer. The pizza was good, but I don't think I'd want to deal with the line again.",4.0
"After trekking over the Brooklyn bridge, we were rewarded by another awesome pizza place! I've dubbed this place ""pizza under the bridge"" as that's what we were referring it as throughout our trip. A small pizza is $12 w/ 6 slices and a large is $14 w/ 8 slices. Each additional topping is another $2. Pros:- Big restaurant with two floors of seating (we were seated almost immediately at noon)- Pizza is big; giving you thin, fat slices that are easily folded- Coal-burning oven gives it that extra depth of flavor- Fast, friendly service- Large variety of toppings- Great price. A large w/ 2 toppings was more than enough for 2 peopleCons:- Cash only!- Our pizza crust was a bit burnt- No pizza by the sliceWas this worth the adventure over the bridge? For us first-time visitors, it was absolutely worth it as we got to sight-see, explore, and take our time. For locals? Not sure since there are a ton of great pizza places everywhere as alternatives.",4.0

"Just came back from trying ""The #1 pizza in NY"" just to be really disappointed. We got a table after 15 minutes or so , so not much of a wait. So after around 5 mins this guy took our order, blah blah blah, waited another 15 mins until our order finally came. My boyfriend and I ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and a small white pizza, to our surprise it came out a lot bigger than  we had anticipated. Anyway we excitedly grabbed a fresh hot slice and took a bite JUST TO BE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. SO THIS IS WHAT THE BEST PIZZA TASTES LIKE?? Omg, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good which was why I was disappointed. The small pizza w pepperoni was ok while the white pizza was the worst of all. It was so so so bland and it was just gross. I brought the rest of the 4 slices home only to have no one eat it. Anyway, as we finish the small pizza, we wanted more water and napkins. One of the waiters refilled our water looking pissed as hell and another waiter took a STACK of napkins, like 7-8 and just threw it on the table. So much for customer service! Now that we're done with our mediocre pizza, we asked for the check. It came out to be $36.... I was confused BC the pizza total should be $29. Confused, I decided to ask one of the workers, this old guy that seated us walked by so I conveniently asked, before I even got to ask him if tip is included he swatted me away and told me to ask one of the waiters. Ok so we did and turns out tip was added on to my paycheck. I honestly don't mind paying tip BUT THEY DID A TERRRIBLE ATROCIOUS, and DISGRACEFUL JOB SO WHY ASK FOR MY TIP. Anyway, I'm just really disappointed I wasted $36. Just know that they have really EHHHH pizza and if you want good pizza in Brooklyn, you can always try L&B's. And they have really shitty service so be prepare.",1.0
"Wait time is atrocious. I went here by myself and never got called after an hour of waiting in line. The owner, Ernie, just kept asking for parties of 3+. I ended up just ordering a small pizza to go. I don't care how good the pizza is if you can never get to it.",1.0
"My friend was visiting me in New York and we arrived early to this fine establishment (ha!) at 11:30am on Saturday- got seated right away. Wow, I thought to myself, lucky us! Haha oh boy, on the contrary...anyways let's keep going.Ordered, food came out pretty quick. Food: Pizza was pizza. I mean, what's so special? It's tomato sauce with cheese and basil, extra $2 for mushrooms lol. It was ok.THE WAITER (identified as: tall man with a short ponytail) WHO WAS SO RUDE, WASN'T. Here we go: (fasten your seatbelts for this- it might get turbulent, or maybe you'll be laughing so hard at this waiter, that you'll fall off your chair)My friend and I paid for our meal using a $20 bill and we were waiting for change...after awhile nothing was coming back to us, so we went to go talk to the waiter. We explained to our waiter nicely that we had paid with a $20 bill and we wanted to know where our change was or if it was coming. He disagreed, saying ""why would I give you change if you left exact change?"" Now ok- you're thinking maybe we might've mistaken ourselves and maybe we got confused. But hello!!! Freaking counting exact change is a lot more tedious than putting a $20 bill down. Who the heck is going to confuse putting a $20 bill down versus putting down exact change???? (This just shows you how stupid our waiter was)We replied that we had not used exact change, we had used a $20 bill. He went on to say ""no, you're wrong."" Huh? Excuse me??? In what era did it become ok for waiters to say such comments to customers? And at such a highly rated place? Please, someone enlighten me.He wouldn't give us our change back, even after we insisted that we were 100% sure of our actions. He adamantly refused. Then, (ok- listen up kids) he. told. us. to. leave. angrily. Really. You're asking a customer to leave, and you're at fault? ABSURD. It's almost comical at this point. I asked for his name (ponytail man) so I could go to the manager and he said ""my name is irrelevant"". What? Excuse me? I was half expecting the ""What Would You Do?"" camera and crew to jump out. I mean, I would've loved to meet John Quinones. Anyways, how is your name irrelevant? Your name is what I need so the manager can fire you!!! (THE WAITER HAS A PONYTAIL IF ANYONE IS READING- or maybe he chopped it off out of embarrassment)He left silently and we had to follow him downstairs to get our change because he FINALLY realized he was wrong. This scumbag. Did not apologize. Not one ounce of ""oops I was a douche-bag"". We even tipped him what we would've before the incident. Still no apology or thanks. Ungrateful. I might've forgiven him if he was apologetic, but he was a rude rude rude man.Seriously?You should be ashamed of yourself- waiter with a (short) ponytail. Rude rude rude. I guess restaurants aren't going by the phrase ""customer first"" anymore. More like ""customer's wrong"".Please. Edit- I'm home in West Chester now after a day in NYC. What a horrible experience to have. Worst restaurant experience EVER in my entire life. And I hope, for the rest of my life.If people running this place don't think their customers are important, I don't think you should support them. The pizza wasn't even that good. Never EVER going back and never recommending this place to anyone. Steer clear, tourists- I'm doing you a favor. You're welcome. :)Take your money elsewhere...not worth the rude treatment. And people get in line and WAIT for this??? Hahaha that's so extremely sad for those poor folks. I just remember passing by a lady with a yoga mat on the way there and she recommended that we go to the place next door. I wish I had heeded her advice. I still can't believe a waiter would tell a customer ""you're wrong"" and ""leave"". What a complete disaster. Good thing he didn't tell me his name or else it would be right smack in this review about 100 times. Maybe he's not so dumb...But you can still identify him by his short ponytail! Enjoy!",1.0

"In our past visit to New York last week, my wife suggested we go to the famous Grimaldi's Pizza. She had been there on a previous visit and wanted me to experience it. I'm in my 40's and have had a lot of pizza in my life. This wasn't a bad pie but it certainly doesn't win any awards with me. There was a small line and it was just my wife and I (party of 2). The door man/comedian asked us no less than 5 times how many in our party. He even wrote it down on a clipboard but insisted on continuing to ask us how many. After a hot and uncomfortable 45min wait we were finally seated. Then another waiting game for someone to serve us. Oh, and no AC! Awesome! This is also when we found out they don't serve beer or wine! We ordered a pepperoni, sausage and ricotta pizza and a couple of sodas. So after another 20mins or so, we get our pizza. I'm a sucker for semi-crispy thin crust you can fold over and eat. I'm glad they gave us a fork and knife because the middle of the pie was doughy and soggy. The bottom was also slightly burned which was palatable but annoying. I had assumed that in an italian pizza joint, the sausage would be italian sausage with a little zest... Nope. regular pork sausage with lots of chewy grizzle!This is the last time I'll be heading to Grimaldi's. If you want to experience great pizza head on up to Manhattan to Uncle Mario's Pizza. Now that is pizza!! No line, accepts credit card, draught beer or wine, small wait time for freshly prepped pizza. Oh and it is leaps and bounds better tasting!",1.0

"Grimaldi's... one of the few on my short list of places to go for pizza.  However, before you read too much into it, it is not the best pizza.  That acclaim can only be given to Di Fara.  People rave and rave about it as the best... i can not disagree more.  My reasoning isnt superficial... nor does it all come down to the pizza itself.  It's everything.When I brought my play date here for some good eats, we noticed the seating was tight and packed together in arms with our neighbors.  So much for atmosphere.  That went out the door, especially with the crazy line waits... is it really worth the wait?  The answer is a resounding no.  Our pizza came out somewhat doughy and crispy at the same time... an odd combination of undercooked-ness.  We also felt like we were being rushed- in and out.  Is the food good, that much I might agree to if I was hungry, which I was.  We'll see if I return... I shall have an update for you.",4.0
"Had a great time walking over Brooklyn bridge. That all stopped when my family & I entered Grimaldi's after hour wait. Flies every where, no AC .  Wanted a cold beer after long walk, NO LIQUOR LICENSE. (I GUESS THEIR AIR CONDITIONER LICENSE IS STILL PENDING AS WELL). Didn't surprise me, from the type of service received, I'm sure owner has a criminal record.  Only saw waiter once, had to ask him to bring us water with ice, first ones had no ice, (straight from the Hudson River I'm sure), Horrible water. Waiter took order for table next to us. Instead of saying pardon me, he hovered over me, touching my head. Had to ask him to give me space. He didn't like that one bit, even though I was polite about it. Absolutely the worst service I have ever received In New York (Just unheard of).     Pizza finally came out after 45 minute wait. Regardless of the horrible service, this food was not worth the wait or horrible service. Pizza crust was black & burnt, middle of pizza was soggy & watery. Only flavor or character this pizza had was from the STORE BOUGHT SUN DRIED TOMATOES. Next time I'll take my family next door to eat after Awesome walk, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.  Regardless of the most horrific service I have ever received from any city ( that's including Me living in Chicago & Hollywood CA where restaurant owners know how to treat patrons), Veloce pizza on the east side makes Grimaldi's look like Domino's pizza (which I would say Dominos has better customer service than Grimaldi's).   I would not recommend this place. After walking over Brooklyn Bridge, I would suggest eating next door to Grimaldi's rather than subject you & your family to this low class service that Grimaldi's gives you.",1.0
"Brought my bf here for the first time last week. It was a chilly Monday night do there were no lines! This was also my first time visiting Grimaldis since they moved down the block to Toro's old spot.They cram small little tables and small little chairs into their gigantic space to seat as many people as they can. They have the oven right at the front, so you can see them pumping out all the pizzas. The wait staff are okay - their thinly veiled hatred for their job is only apparent when you talk to them. They kept our water glasses full and didn't really rush us (again- slow Monday night) so I guess points for that?Food wise - as good as ever! The best part of Grimaldis would be the ingredients they use. They're fresh and delicious. Grimaldi's is definitely leaps and bounds ahead of Lombardis. I brought a few slices of leftovers for my dad (which he ate cold) and he said it was much better than L&B's! Which kinda surprised me because my dad looooves L&Bs. Overall - good food, still good even when it's cold, meh wait staff.",4.0

"I've been coming here for years, before they relocated a few steps down. Not not only do I love this place for the historic factor of it but the pizza can not be beat! Original and the best! I always bring out of town visitors here for the true New York style pizza experience",5.0
"Some of the best pizza I have ever had. My boyfriend and I stopped at the brooklyn location the other weekend while we were in nyc. This place is very popular and the line was out the door. I actually considered going to the pizza place next door but my boyfriend had been dying to go here. Fortunately, we were able to get seated after waiting probably 15 minutes. We were seated on the second floor of the restaurant.  Grimaldi's has waiter service but is not fancy at all. Service was good but everything was very busy In there. We ordered a plain medium sized pizza and my boyfriend and I split it. It did not disappoint. Their pizza is amazing and I love that they use mozzarella cheese on it. Also, it's not overly greasy and doesn't leave you feeling disgusting after. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in New York.",4.0
"Debated if we should have given this place  a 3 star or a 4 star... Reason being that the service wasn't that great. There was an middle aged man sitting at their bar greeting people as they came in and he seemed to be the owner or a main manager, we didn't have to wait at all to get seated. But the server was not as nice, didn't explain much to us and didn't give us change for the bill(so he ended up getting a lot more for tip that he actually would have). They DO NOT HAVE ALCOHOL here!!! So frustrated because all we wanted was a place for a beer and pizza.Pizza was good, we got small, pepperoni, with mushrooms and it was enough for my husband and me. It was delicious, but we ate something very similar in Long Island city and it wasn't touted as ""world famous pizza"". Either way, nice place to visit if you're in town, want some good pizza, have extra money to spend on tip",3.0
"In our past visit to New York last week, my wife suggested we go to the famous Grimaldi's Pizza. She had been there on a previous visit and wanted me to experience it. I'm in my 40's and have had a lot of pizza in my life. This wasn't a bad pie but it certainly doesn't win any awards with me. There was a small line and it was just my wife and I (party of 2). The door man/comedian asked us no less than 5 times how many in our party. He even wrote it down on a clipboard but insisted on continuing to ask us how many. After a hot and uncomfortable 45min wait we were finally seated. Then another waiting game for someone to serve us. Oh, and no AC! Awesome! This is also when we found out they don't serve beer or wine! We ordered a pepperoni, sausage and ricotta pizza and a couple of sodas. So after another 20mins or so, we get our pizza. I'm a sucker for semi-crispy thin crust you can fold over and eat. I'm glad they gave us a fork and knife because the middle of the pie was doughy and soggy. The bottom was also slightly burned which was palatable but annoying. I had assumed that in an italian pizza joint, the sausage would be italian sausage with a little zest... Nope. regular pork sausage with lots of chewy grizzle!This is the last time I'll be heading to Grimaldi's. If you want to experience great pizza head on up to Manhattan to Uncle Mario's Pizza. Now that is pizza!! No line, accepts credit card, draught beer or wine, small wait time for freshly prepped pizza. Oh and it is leaps and bounds better tasting!",1.0
"I had finished with my wedding dress shopping at Kleinfeld's and I was starving because of course I didn't eat anything before my bridal appt. As we were walking, the scent of pizza filled the air and we followed our noses to a nearby famous pizzeria. We had a hard time trying to find the entrance and so we had to go through a clothing store to get to the pizzeria.The regular pizza was more than enough for the 2 of us, we got mushrooms, onions and sausage on the pizza. I was surprised we had to ask for crushed red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese. The pizza was pretty good. I especially liked the crust. I don't know if this place lived up to its hype.",5.0
"Grimaldi's... one of the few on my short list of places to go for pizza.  However, before you read too much into it, it is not the best pizza.  That acclaim can only be given to Di Fara.  People rave and rave about it as the best... i can not disagree more.  My reasoning isnt superficial... nor does it all come down to the pizza itself.  It's everything.When I brought my play date here for some good eats, we noticed the seating was tight and packed together in arms with our neighbors.  So much for atmosphere.  That went out the door, especially with the crazy line waits... is it really worth the wait?  The answer is a resounding no.  Our pizza came out somewhat doughy and crispy at the same time... an odd combination of undercooked-ness.  We also felt like we were being rushed- in and out.  Is the food good, that much I might agree to if I was hungry, which I was.  We'll see if I return... I shall have an update for you.",4.0
"Had a great time walking over Brooklyn bridge. That all stopped when my family & I entered Grimaldi's after hour wait. Flies every where, no AC .  Wanted a cold beer after long walk, NO LIQUOR LICENSE. (I GUESS THEIR AIR CONDITIONER LICENSE IS STILL PENDING AS WELL). Didn't surprise me, from the type of service received, I'm sure owner has a criminal record.  Only saw waiter once, had to ask him to bring us water with ice, first ones had no ice, (straight from the Hudson River I'm sure), Horrible water. Waiter took order for table next to us. Instead of saying pardon me, he hovered over me, touching my head. Had to ask him to give me space. He didn't like that one bit, even though I was polite about it. Absolutely the worst service I have ever received In New York (Just unheard of).     Pizza finally came out after 45 minute wait. Regardless of the horrible service, this food was not worth the wait or horrible service. Pizza crust was black & burnt, middle of pizza was soggy & watery. Only flavor or character this pizza had was from the STORE BOUGHT SUN DRIED TOMATOES. Next time I'll take my family next door to eat after Awesome walk, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge.  Regardless of the most horrific service I have ever received from any city ( that's including Me living in Chicago & Hollywood CA where restaurant owners know how to treat patrons), Veloce pizza on the east side makes Grimaldi's look like Domino's pizza (which I would say Dominos has better customer service than Grimaldi's).   I would not recommend this place. After walking over Brooklyn Bridge, I would suggest eating next door to Grimaldi's rather than subject you & your family to this low class service that Grimaldi's gives you.",1.0
"Brought my bf here for the first time last week. It was a chilly Monday night do there were no lines! This was also my first time visiting Grimaldis since they moved down the block to Toro's old spot.They cram small little tables and small little chairs into their gigantic space to seat as many people as they can. They have the oven right at the front, so you can see them pumping out all the pizzas. The wait staff are okay - their thinly veiled hatred for their job is only apparent when you talk to them. They kept our water glasses full and didn't really rush us (again- slow Monday night) so I guess points for that?Food wise - as good as ever! The best part of Grimaldis would be the ingredients they use. They're fresh and delicious. Grimaldi's is definitely leaps and bounds ahead of Lombardis. I brought a few slices of leftovers for my dad (which he ate cold) and he said it was much better than L&B's! Which kinda surprised me because my dad looooves L&Bs. Overall - good food, still good even when it's cold, meh wait staff.",4.0
"SERVICE- not so great. They are very busy with long long lines. You can't expect great service when you are that busy.  I understand that, but when they make you wait in the same long line for take out, is a little ridiculous.  I tried calling my order in three times but no answer. They need a better system. PIZZA- just okay. I ordered the pizza to go and by the time we made it to our room the pizza was cold.

"I visited Grimaldi's (under the bridge) last night to get take out.  After spending an hour looking for parking I was finally able to get out of the car and into the restaurant. The line outside the place was two blocks long and I remember feeling grateful that I could simply order takeout. Anyway, I digress, I walk in to the restaurant and was greeted by a someone snide, somewhat indifferent,  wiry, brown haired check out girl. She was counting money and appeared to be totally uninterested in my visit. As I approached her she begins the interaction with ""Yes"" to which I reply ""I'd like to order take out"" then she asks ""did you wait on the line outside?"" I explained that I had not. I asked, to confirm, if waiting on that line was necessary even for takeout.  She of course said ""yeah you gotta wait on the line"".   This seem to be just a little ridiculous.  If someone is getting take out why would Grimaldi's make them wait on a line with people who are hoping to get a table?  Needless to say I did not wait.   I have been coming to Gramaldi's for years and have found it to be an enjoyable experience 90% of the time.  But they seem to be trying to find ways to make the customer unhappy.   The customer service is horrible and the lines are reminiscent of amusement parks.  I will not return to Grimaldi's. I am sure they have lost a lot of business because of this.  But I am doubly sure that they are satisfied with the tourist dollars they generate and hardly care about the folks that have made them who they are (Brooklynites).",1.0

I would choose this joint over John's on bleeker any day! Grimaldi's has several locations with a way shorter wait time; food is just as good",5.0
I finally had a chance to check out Grimaldi's.  By far one of the best pizzas I ever had.  I would go back in an instant if I was in New York City.,5.0
"YUMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Best Pizza around!!!! Grimaldi's is an institution, a brand, a name in the pizza game since 1905!okay so I reviewed there other location in Coney Island and let everyone know how unbelievably yummy this pizza is, so this review is mostly about location and service.Location is great.......UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.......its a block away from Brooklyn Bridge park (pier 1 and 2), its kind of tricky finding parking in this area, but if your going to the park you can walk from the Grimaldi's to the park or vice versa.  The actual pizzeria is a beautiful white old time building, with huge windows, arches and lots of detail. Its a landmark, has the plaque on it, apparently it was Brooklyn's first safety deposit bank, back in 1869.THE LINE: everyone says ""look for the line"" and they were rite! There is a line outside for seating and takeout, but I think they do this in order to keep the waiting crowd away from the dinners, since there's not much standing around space inside. Older dude keeps the line moving quickly, waited less than 10mins. Ordered my ""to go"" pie (we were having a pizza picnic in the park), got a # ticket and back outside I go to wait. Waited another 10 minutes and before I knew it the take out girl was yelling my #.Walked over to Bk bridge park, got a spot on the lawn, had a spectacular view of the city skyline, near the water, great weather, beautiful sunset and crispy thin crusted pizza with fresh mozzarella, and sweet tasty marinara sauce made with fresh crushed tomatoes.....what's better than that???????????Large regular pizza is 14 bucks, toppings are generally 2 bucks. I think this a very fair price, all pies have fresh mozzarella. Customer service is good, line dude was kind of strict, but I guess that's what keeps it ""moving"". Didn't feel like I waited long. Take out gal was friendly. NO CREDIT CARD, NO RESERVATIONS, AND NO SLICES  (and you will have NO hard feelings about all this after trying there pizza!)Did I mention I think this is the best pizza around???....oh yea....I DID!......LOL",5.0

"Grimaldi's does have a line of tourists and locals, usually a wait of 1 hour.  The wait is always long, but their pizza is worth it.  Fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and slightly blackened, and crispy crust.  You must try Grimaldi's. If you have the energy to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge towards the Manhattan skyline, you'll have an afternoon/evening worth remembering.",4.0
"Another great pizza place located under the Brooklyn Bridge. The staff is super friendly and the pizza is absolutley delicious. The line can get pretty long and the worse part is they have you wait outside...so during cold weathers you may not be all too happy especially if you're cold AND hungry...the wait for the pizza is pretty long too. So I'll catch myself staring and drooling over the table next to us. Despite all that waiting, Grimaldi's pizza is a must try!",4.0
"DELICIOUS!! A must try for New York pizza! One of the best I've had in the city (so far)!You can tell the place is family-owned and operated - with the head of the family there to greet you at the door. The place itself is pretty big with two floors of seating, but it gets packed pretty fast! If you get there right when they open at noon, there's no line. The place is cash only and they don't serve by the slice (pies only). Decent price for what you get!Bottom line: If you just walked across the Brooklyn Bridge or are wandering around DUMBO looking for something to eat, give it a try!",5.0
"I visited Grimaldi's (under the bridge) last night to get take out.  After spending an hour looking for parking I was finally able to get out of the car and into the restaurant. The line outside the place was two blocks long and I remember feeling grateful that I could simply order takeout. Anyway, I digress, I walk in to the restaurant and was greeted by a someone snide, somewhat indifferent,  wiry, brown haired check out girl. She was counting money and appeared to be totally uninterested in my visit. As I approached her she begins the interaction with ""Yes"" to which I reply ""I'd like to order take out"" then she asks ""did you wait on the line outside?"" I explained that I had not. I asked, to confirm, if waiting on that line was necessary even for takeout.  She of course said ""yeah you gotta wait on the line"".   This seem to be just a little ridiculous.  If someone is getting take out why would Grimaldi's make them wait on a line with people who are hoping to get a table?  Needless to say I did not wait.   I have been coming to Gramaldi's for years and have found it to be an enjoyable experience 90% of the time.  But they seem to be trying to find ways to make the customer unhappy.   The customer service is horrible and the lines are reminiscent of amusement parks.  I will not return to Grimaldi's. I am sure they have lost a lot of business because of this.  But I am doubly sure that they are satisfied with the tourist dollars they generate and hardly care about the folks that have made them who they are (Brooklynites).",1.0
"Yes the pizza is good but I don't understand the hype. I stopped by during the summer on a Saturday afternoon and the line was ridiculous. Down-the-block type of thing. I think it's safe to assume at least 50 people waiting out front. Reminded me of the cake boss bakery in Hoboken, NJ but worse! I didn't want to wait on line of course, so we left and went to Adrienne's which is in Financial District, just a few minutes away across the BK Bridge. I was invited here again yesterday. **SIGH** I was relunctant to go but it was a Tuesday afternoon, so I figured I'd take my chances. We arrived at 6pm and horray..... NO LINE! I was happy that I'd finally get to try this pizza everyone raves about and waits hours on line for. I thought I'd develop some sort of magical powers. We ordered the pepperoni. Yes, pizza was good and better than average but nothing out of this world. I wouldn't wait on line for this stuff. The place is CASH ONLY and service is not great. Oh yeah, no super powers either :-/",3.0

The pepperoni were the smaller cut that curls and gets a bit crispier which I actually liked. Also there wasn't an overwhelming amount of sauce.

My mother, aunt, and I happily got into line, prepared for the wait.Then we got to the front. The guy at the door asked how many and we said 3. He then proceeded to seat three different groups of four who were behind us in the line. Ok, I thought to myself, maybe they have some tables that only seat three people and they're waiting to seat us at one of those. Nope. They finally sat us at a four person table. The wait would have been about 15 minutes shorter had we been seated in the order that we were in line.Once we were in the incredibly crowded upstairs, we waited again until our waiter finally came over.

How would we be waiting for more pizza when you have literally not come near our table? Then we sat with the bill. I honestly think that the guy was just waiting for us to give up and leave cash on the table so that he wouldn't have to bring us change and get a bigger tip.

"Three words:  best. pizza. ever.  I don't care if you're from Jersey City or Chicago, you'd still agree with me if you were fortunate enough to wrap your mouth around one of their slices.  It's everything you were told and more.  Some tips: -Get there at least 45 minutes prior to opening time because the line can stretch down five blocks -- no joke.  -A small pizza ($12 base; +$2/topping; large is $14 base) can be split among two people with large appetites or four girls on a diet.  I would be in the former group.  -All pizzas come with basil by default, but they hand-shred the basil, so you get a net of three leaves.  My advice: pay the additional $2 for extra basil.  -If you eat meat, opt for sausage.  It's pure awesomeness.  Less is more when it comes to Neapolitan pizza, so I would not order more than two toppings.    -Go to the Brooklyn location.  You will not immediately have room for dessert if you split a small pizza with one other person, but still enough energy left to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  Once you've crossed it, you will then have room for a Chinatown bakery pastry.  It's the perfect plan.  -They don't sell by the slice, but why would you not want a whole pie?  Silly.-It's cash-only.",5.0

I thought it 15, but with tax it was clearly 16.50 I hadn't seen that so when my change didn't match I asked about it.  He quickly runs off to find the check and rectify the situation. He comes back pissed and using profanity saying it was 16.50 and I got the right change, thrusting the bill in front of me. I'm turned off by his demeanor,but I recognize the mistake.  He then insults my appearance and curses some more. I never accused him of trying to rip me off but he sure took it that way.",1.0
"This is without question an absolutely delicious pizza. Located right near the Brooklyn Bridge, Grimaldi's has been and continues to be one of the names that's become synonymous with elite New York style pizza. Yes, there will be a line around the corner if you arrive during peak hours. That is certainly a negative. However, the consistency of execution at this restaurant is to be admired. Grimaldi's coal brick oven gives the pizza the perfect texture--light, perfectly crispy, with a rich flavor. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. The tomato sauce is perfectly zesty and present in the right quantity. The mozzarella is excellent and perfectly melted on top of the pizza. The sausage and pepperonis have that authentic Italian flavor. Honestly have nothing negative to say about this slice. It's excellent. And if I'm going to put my two cents in, I feel that Grimaldi's (based on my personal experience) is a tastier slice than its rival, Lombardi's. That being said, is this pizza so good that you need to drive all the way to Brooklyn to get it? My answer is probably not. New York, in particular, has plenty of delicious hole-in-the-wall pizza places that are comparable (maybe slightly less tasty) that you can access much easier without waiting on lines. That being said, I can certainly vouch for why this has become such an iconic NY restaurant. And if you eat here, you can say ""I ate here."" At this point, it's like visiting the Empire State Building. Okay, maybe not quite. But close.",4.0
"Grimaldi's is completely and utterly OVERRATED. New Yorkers can get way better pizza, with much better service, and at cheaper prices. Why anyone would subjugate themselves to the torture of waiting on a line - for a ridiculous amount of time - for mediocre pizza (repeatedly) is beyond me. This place is overhyped and is more of a touristy spot. They're also conveniently placed in an area that lacks in food choices. Hooray for shake shack opening up! But honestly, it's definitely not worth the money. It also doesn't help when service is rude and  the man curses out your party. Not worth it and completely don't recommend.",1.0

I honestly think that the guy was just waiting for us to give up and leave cash on the table so that he wouldn't have to bring us change and get a bigger tip. If the pizza were truly amazing, it might be worth it to wait in a line and suffer the terrible service. But it's not. Go somewhere else, anywhere else. Go next door. I haven't been, but I can't imagine it's worse.",2.0
"For 6 months, before I moved to Brooklyn, I was assured by a friend that this place would blow my mind and was the #1 place I needed to visit in NYC.  So I waited an hour in line to enter this place, when I did arrive, and it was just very mediocre.  My crust was blackened and was so thin the pizza seemed fairly inexistent.  The sauce was good.  The cheese was spare.  Very blah.I've always been more taken by Artichoke Pizza or Patsy's or Fornino's or Vito's (in Williamsburg, Brooklyn)",2.0
The pizza and service was great. For some reason it just didn't agree with my stomach. But it might be worth still eating.,4.0
"Three words:  best. pizza. ever.  I don't care if you're from Jersey City or Chicago, you'd still agree with me if you were fortunate enough to wrap your mouth around one of their slices.  It's everything you were told and more.  Some tips: -Get there at least 45 minutes prior to opening time because the line can stretch down five blocks -- no joke.  -A small pizza ($12 base; +$2/topping; large is $14 base) can be split among two people with large appetites or four girls on a diet.  I would be in the former group.  -All pizzas come with basil by default, but they hand-shred the basil, so you get a net of three leaves.  My advice: pay the additional $2 for extra basil.  -If you eat meat, opt for sausage.  It's pure awesomeness.  Less is more when it comes to Neapolitan pizza, so I would not order more than two toppings.    -Go to the Brooklyn location.  You will not immediately have room for dessert if you split a small pizza with one other person, but still enough energy left to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  Once you've crossed it, you will then have room for a Chinatown bakery pastry.  It's the perfect plan.  -They don't sell by the slice, but why would you not want a whole pie?  Silly.-It's cash-only.",5.0
"The pizza itself was okay. It's NYC style in the truest sense which is not my favorite,but when in Rome...  what makes this a 1 star is the rude white bald guy. Not sure of his name. He didn't talk much and neither did I. Cash only so I paid and I had only glanced at the bill. I thought it 15, but with tax it was clearly 16.50 I hadn't seen that so when my change didn't match I asked about it.  He quickly runs off to find the check and rectify the situation. He comes back pissed and using profanity saying it was 16.50 and I got the right change, thrusting the bill in front of me. I'm turned off by his demeanor,but I recognize the mistake.  He then insults my appearance and curses some more. I never accused him of trying to rip me off but he sure took it that way.",1.0
"This is without question an absolutely delicious pizza. Located right near the Brooklyn Bridge, Grimaldi's has been and continues to be one of the names that's become synonymous with elite New York style pizza. Yes, there will be a line around the corner if you arrive during peak hours. That is certainly a negative. However, the consistency of execution at this restaurant is to be admired. Grimaldi's coal brick oven gives the pizza the perfect texture--light, perfectly crispy, with a rich flavor. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. The tomato sauce is perfectly zesty and present in the right quantity. The mozzarella is excellent and perfectly melted on top of the pizza. The sausage and pepperonis have that authentic Italian flavor. Honestly have nothing negative to say about this slice. It's excellent. And if I'm going to put my two cents in, I feel that Grimaldi's (based on my personal experience) is a tastier slice than its rival, Lombardi's. That being said, is this pizza so good that you need to drive all the way to Brooklyn to get it? My answer is probably not. New York, in particular, has plenty of delicious hole-in-the-wall pizza places that are comparable (maybe slightly less tasty) that you can access much easier without waiting on lines. That being said, I can certainly vouch for why this has become such an iconic NY restaurant. And if you eat here, you can say ""I ate here."" At this point, it's like visiting the Empire State Building. Okay, maybe not quite. But close.",4.0
"Grimaldi's is completely and utterly OVERRATED. New Yorkers can get way better pizza, with much better service, and at cheaper prices. Why anyone would subjugate themselves to the torture of waiting on a line - for a ridiculous amount of time - for mediocre pizza (repeatedly) is beyond me. This place is overhyped and is more of a touristy spot. They're also conveniently placed in an area that lacks in food choices. Hooray for shake shack opening up! But honestly, it's definitely not worth the money. It also doesn't help when service is rude and  the man curses out your party. Not worth it and completely don't recommend.",1.0
"The Honest Truth: So far my favorite pizza in NY.  Great location near the piers.  Reasonably priced around $14 depending on toppings for a large.  Crust is thin, but thick enough to keep its shape and prevent flopping. The Details:I came here with a couple friends after first going to Lombardi's to compare the two of the best acclaimed pizzas in New York.  I have to say that Grimaldi's won the competition.  We got there around 6 on a saturday and there actually was no line.  We were told to go upstairs and see Frank.  Sure enough Frank was waiting and got us seated.  We ordered a large sausage pizza and it took a little while for it to come out so know that you might have to wait a little bit.  The crust was delicious.  It was a good thin crust, but it didn't fall apart (like Lombardi's did).  The sausage, cheese, and sauce were really good quality and quite tasty and there was a good balance of topping to cheese and sauce.  Overall a great experience and a must try if you're in Brooklyn.  It's easy on the budget too. The only thing Lombardi's has over Grimaldi's is that their sauce is a little more flavorful and sweeter.  Other than that my vote goes to Grimaldi's!",5.0
"Coal brick oven fired pizza?! Tell me more! My fiancée and I had just finished a morning run across the Brooklyn Bridge and had planned to go to Grimaldi's on her suggestion. We got there about 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a big line outside waiting to get in. Fortunately, we made the first wave of customers and didn't have to wait!From our upstairs table we were able to watch as our pizza was made. I kept thinking they weren't putting nearly enough sauce on it, but when the pizza came I was pleasantly surprised, and would be quite content if there was less sauce on my pizzas from other places now.A big plus upstairs, there were electric outlets by a number of the tables, so we could charge our phones if needed. My only gripe is that there was no bacon on the menu to add to the pizza!",5.0
"12 years since my first visit to New York and 12 years since my first visit to Grimaldi's. The pizza has not changed, and that is a great thing. Bring cash and your appetite.

BUT the incredibly slow service (FIFTY FIVE minutes for ONE PIZZA?! geez louise!), the line out the door (ugh), and the rough (sometimes rude) waiters really bring my impression of this place down. They couldn't even offer something. Waiting almost 55 minutes is just ridiculous for pizza that is slightly above average at best. The restaurant is cramped, and they really need to add a brick oven or add liquor to the menu. Other than pizza,  a mediocre antipasto appetizer, a cannoli, and coffee/soda, you'll just have to sit there and twiddle your thumbs out of boredom. There's really nothing else.

"Maybe 2 1/2 stars?You have to look at this place for 2 reasons:1) the food 2) the experience FOOD: the pizza here is really good. Great... No... Really good. Keep it simple and don't over do the toppings; it spoils the pie. I usually get pepperoni or just a regular pie. FYI - they don't do slices. You can do a 1/2 1/2 pizza for toppings.My visiting friends always want to load up their pizza like Pappa Johns and usually end up eating all my Pepperoni because they like it more... I hate that LoL.EXPERIENCE: the new building is cute; much better than the old small place. But, in my view, the history of it all is lost because they relocated. They also removed alcohol from their menu the last time I went... If you're a drinker.I ONLY go here with visiting tourist. I would never come here on my own. It's not worth it to wait 1 hour in line for pizza that's just GOOD. The reason you go here is because you've walked the Brooklyn Bridge and this is another known tourist spot.There is better (lesser known) pizza in NYC [see other reviews*]. There is also a Grimaldi's in Manhattan that is a branch of this one that is essentially the same in the old LimeLight Church = more NYC history.I think that's a better option since you get pizza AND history...

"Love this place! Too bad it is a little far from UES! I've been there a few times and lovvve the pizza.Mr. Grimaldi is the sweetest - the 1st night I was in NY (moving from CA to stay in NY in May 2010), my son, friends and I went to Grimaldi's.  The wait was not long as it was still early, but Mr. Grimaldi brought me a chair and a bottle of water - that was a sign I had to stay in NY!All this said, this is a fun place and the best pizza I've had -- They are very friendly and  the food / ambiance are great --- need to go again soon!",5.0
"I always have a great time at Grimaldi's. The pizza is brick coal oven made and it is simply the best way to make pizza.I went to Grimaldi's before they move a stores up, still a great family experience.Go early, like few minutes after open or else you will suffer the extremely long line of death.",4.0
"Out of all the pizzas I tried in New York, this was by far the best. We had sausage and garlic on our pizza and it was fresh and delicious. We didn't need to add anything to it, it was just perfect. I would recommend getting two if you're eating with three or more people.",5.0
This was our first stop in New York.  I told my friend I wanted pizza and she said she heard great reviews about this place.  She said there is usually a line outside but when we arrived on a Thursday afternoon we were seated immediately.  We started with some tasty breadsticks and mixed some oil and vinegar to dip. Then our pizza... The crust was crispy and the sauce and cheese were fresh and delicious.  We topped our pizza with mushrooms and garlic and that made it even better! We will definitely stop by the next time we visit New York!,5.0
Best pizza in New York!! Just be patient.. The line is super long (20-30 min wait) it was all worth it!,4.0
"One word: OVERRATED.I don't understand the hype AT ALL.Wait was 20 mins during lunch time on a weekday. We ordered a large pizza that was supposed to feed 3-4 people. We weren't starving by any means but between my gf and I, we were able to finish it no problem.The pizza was $14 plus $3 for each additional topping which they're pretty stingy with.We had to go try another pizza place to make up for the ""NY style"" pizza we wanted to have.I will not be returning here, there's just simply better pizza and better prices elsewhere.",1.0
"Long lines...expect a wait! Great pizza, but the older gentlemen tending the line outside is loud and rude. The pizza is great, but I have ate at other NYC establishments with just as good of a pizza, and with better service. An establishment should be thankful for their customers and not treating them as if they are an inconvenience.",3.0
"This was my FAVORITE pizza in NY....and I ate a lot of pizza that week. The line was superrrrr long - all the way to the next door pizza shop which we seriously contemplated going to, considering it was drizzling on and off. However, I'm really glad we didn't - the line ended up taking around 30 min.The pizza was perfectly soft and crispy and flavorful and the service was excellent. The prices are comparable to all the touristy NY pizza spots - about $30/pie. Being from LA, that is kind of a ridiculous amount to pay for a large pizza, but it was totally worth it. AND they have a location here in LA, yay!",5.0
"Maybe 2 1/2 stars?You have to look at this place for 2 reasons:1) the food 2) the experience FOOD: the pizza here is really good. Great... No... Really good. Keep it simple and don't over do the toppings; it spoils the pie. I usually get pepperoni or just a regular pie. FYI - they don't do slices. You can do a 1/2 1/2 pizza for toppings.My visiting friends always want to load up their pizza like Pappa Johns and usually end up eating all my Pepperoni because they like it more... I hate that LoL.EXPERIENCE: the new building is cute; much better than the old small place. But, in my view, the history of it all is lost because they relocated. They also removed alcohol from their menu the last time I went... If you're a drinker.I ONLY go here with visiting tourist. I would never come here on my own. It's not worth it to wait 1 hour in line for pizza that's just GOOD. The reason you go here is because you've walked the Brooklyn Bridge and this is another known tourist spot.There is better (lesser known) pizza in NYC [see other reviews*]. There is also a Grimaldi's in Manhattan that is a branch of this one that is essentially the same in the old LimeLight Church = more NYC history.I think that's a better option since you get pizza AND history... If you really have to say you had Grimaldi's Pizza.*i went on a Pizza Tour of New York one summer as a self experiment. I got fat; but are a lot of good pizza pies. LoL",3.0

"If you want doughy average pizza and want to wait for 2 hours, then be seated elbow to elbow, go here. If you want much better pizza, go to Lombardis in SoHo. Been there twice. First time by choice, second time with guests who insisted..never going to be a third time.Other pizza places (conveniently located in Manhattan and worth trying)Eataly and Motorino. Pizza at whole foods is better than the stuff they sell you here. If you want the best pizza in NYC, go deep into Brooklyn for DiFaras or Lucali",2.0

"I don't really understand the hype of this place.  I went here on Saturday around 6pm, just before the lines got super crazy.The pizza (3/5):  My friend and I ordered a large pie with sun-dried tomatoes and Italian sausage.  I don't like a lot of sauce on my pizza, but the sauce on this pizza was not only lacking, it didn't have much flavor.  Thank goodness we got it with the sun-dried tomatoes because they really made up for the lack of flavor.  The pizza felt like it was a lot of crust though (not always a bad thing if the toppings make up for it...which in this case it didn't.)  On the other hand, everything did seem very fresh.  Fresh ingredients and nicely crisped crust.  Just wish it went all the way to flavor town.In terms of prices, it's not horrible, but drinks are $3 (really? A bottle of soda or Snapple is $3?)  Pizzas are about $12, toppings are $2-$3 each (doesn't matter if it's half or whole pizza.  Still the same price).  They only have one appetizer which is the antipasto ($12), which I didn't want to try.  Everything but the pizza seemed like a rip-off so stick with just the pizza, imo. Service + Ambiance (1/5):  First of all, they don't change the table cloth on the tables.  I noticed busboys just flicking off a few crumbs with the menu before seating another group of people.  Everything felt DIRTY.  You could see stains and feel leftover crumbs on the table cloth (obviously because they don't change them).  It made me wonder when the last time they cleaned the tables was.  Our waiter was a jerk.  When we asked for refills of water, he brought over a pitcher and from a height (taller than my seated self), he poured the water into the cups.  Not only did he splash it on the table, my napkin and utensils, he did it to my friend as well.  My friend asked if he could pour the water closer to the cup to which he replied, ""Why?""  My friend said that he didn't want it splashing over the place to which the waiter replied jokingly, ""Sorry, no can do."" and continued to pour from a height.Wait time (1/5):  I was lucky that it was just me and my friend, but if you're in a group of 3, good luck.  I saw the guy in the front asking for a group of four many times and passing by groups of three.  If you have a group larger than 4...you might as well go somewhere else.  Saw a group of 6 waiting at the front of line when I got on it (all the way in the back) and still waiting by the time my friend and I got in (an hour later).Overall: If you're in town and you want a good slice of pizza, this is certainly not the place.  You would think that this was some upscale place with the reviews and the long wait line, but it's not.  You can find plenty of other pizza places serving up better tasting NY pizza with less headache.  Would I come back?  No.  Not worth it.",2.0
"My parents tried to get into this restaurant last year on their trip to NY. They were unsuccessful, as they were feeling rather impatient and the line was down the street (per usual, as the restaurant was featured on the Food Network). This year, they were determined to get in. We hailed a cab to Brooklyn to drop us off at this circus of a restaurant.  The line was actually not bad, according to my parents. I think we got there right before peak lunch time. We ended up waiting roughly 40 minutes to get in. Luckily, it wasn't one of our torturous heat days, so we were OK. The wait to get the food was roughly 40 as well. We ordered the meat pizza as well as a veggie pizza.  They were both super good, but I do think it may have been a tad overrated.  I think the wait may have also hindered my taste buds.  It was fun watching the pizza chefs make all the pizzas.  I wish I could make pizza that quickly!Lastly, we had one of the ice cream truffle desserts.  The dark chocolate and espresso bean one.  That was the best part of the meal, those things were DELICIOUS! I am not sure if they make them homemade, or if they are store-bought, but regardless--SO AMAZING. My sweet tooth was definitely satisfied.All in all, it was a great meal, and I enjoyed it.

"The ""no line"" is deceiving. There will always be a wait here as someone at the door is essentially dictating when a party will get a table. It seems like they prefer larger parties than smaller parties. We waited 30 minutes even though there was no line at the time we waited. Our party of three at to wait for all the parties of four to clear out from the ""no line"" before we were seated. From my understanding, the restaurant is popular due to the rivalry between them and Juliana's.  The two restaurants are next door to each other. The day we went for lunch, both had no line out front. My friend wanted to eat at both places. He preferred Juliana's crust to Grimaldi's crust. Due to the fact we had to wait a lot longer than anticipated we ended up only eating here for lunch. He felt Gramaldi's was a bit commercialized as they have a small store in a mall in Las Vegas as well. I'm a bit biased as NY pizza taste all the same to me. I prefer thin, crispy Sicilian style crust over the thin NY style crust that can be folded. I'd be hard for me to tell the difference unless I lived in NY and ate pizza frequently. If I were to do it all over again I'd eat at Juliana's first and then try Grimaldi's.",3.0

Some may or may not like the proximity (don't think others coming with a larger party would have the same problem).

"I think the place was just too overhyped for me. I have also been hearing whispers along the streets of New York that Rays in Manhattan is the new reigning champ of New York Pizza. But, with all of that said, this place is way better than your standard go-to pizza joints. There is no pizza like a thin-crust pizza. I must preface by saying that I am a huge huge huge fan of Thin crust and have done a lot to go out of my way for this type of pizza. I wouldn't say it rivals some of the best I've had, but it's definitely upper echelon. My favorite thing about this place is probably going to be the dough. Although on the saltier side, when adding pizza sauce to your pizza, it creates a nice balance with their signature sauce. Also... Let's all agree that an open-fire pizza oven is always... ALWAYS going to taste better than your standard oven / heated up / whatever other device you might concoct to use to make pizza. I'm not sure that I'd be willing to wait the line... but seeing as they do take-out... count me in as a repeat customer!",3.0

I have heard other locations are much better but I wanted the original and I am sad to say I don't understand what people like about it.",2.0
"1st experience with a NY pizzeria & it did not disappoint. Pizza was excellent. Would have preferred more sauce but it was still good nonetheless. Pepperoni was flavorful and Italian sausage had the right amount of spice without the need to drink water. Highly recommend if in Brooklyn. However, they are cash only so be prepared.",5.0
"My experience was good. I've been wanting to go to Grimaldi's for a while, but whenever I am in the neighborhood, there seems to be a extremely long line. So my solution...be there when it opens. I came with my gf and got seated immediately. What was weird was that we were sitting right next to another. Some may or may not like the proximity (don't think others coming with a larger party would have the same problem). The food came out quickly, which was a plus, but again, I was there right when it opened. The pizza was good, but I am sure I could find pizza just as good anywhere else for less hype. Then we ordered a cannoli. Ehhhh on the cannoli. Looks good, but not the best tasting. Decent, but don't think it's worth the hype.",3.0
"STOP.WASTING.YOUR.TIME. Grimaldi's was started by Patsy Grimaldi one building over many years ago. The pizza you want and the pizza everyone has written up is actually at Juliana's, next door. I went to Grimaldi's in 2008 and then in 2013 after they'd moved to the new building and it was like night and day. Take my advice and go to Juliana's. It will change your life (and you can pay with a credit card!)",1.0
"I think the place was just too overhyped for me. I have also been hearing whispers along the streets of New York that Rays in Manhattan is the new reigning champ of New York Pizza. But, with all of that said, this place is way better than your standard go-to pizza joints. There is no pizza like a thin-crust pizza. I must preface by saying that I am a huge huge huge fan of Thin crust and have done a lot to go out of my way for this type of pizza. I wouldn't say it rivals some of the best I've had, but it's definitely upper echelon. My favorite thing about this place is probably going to be the dough. Although on the saltier side, when adding pizza sauce to your pizza, it creates a nice balance with their signature sauce. Also... Let's all agree that an open-fire pizza oven is always... ALWAYS going to taste better than your standard oven / heated up / whatever other device you might concoct to use to make pizza. I'm not sure that I'd be willing to wait the line... but seeing as they do take-out... count me in as a repeat customer!",3.0
"Came here early Saturday around opening to avoid lines. Pizza here isn't bad. The 4 of us ordered a large chicken pie and a small garlic, we all agreed the chicken wasn't seasonedAnd tasted Bland. It's decent pizza all around but for the price and EXTREME hype this location receives, it doesn't impress. I know of a few local pizzarias that are amazing and much more preferred. This isn't a place I'm visiting again.",3.0
"Came here for lunch with 3 other people. They seated us and as we were looking at the menu, they asked us kindly if we would like to move to a table that was more comfortable and spacious. I was already comfortable where we were, but whatever, we just moved. As I walked over to our new table, I noticed that it was in a corner. And all the tables surrounding us were ASIANS. WTF. I felt so segregated. Not only did I feel extremely uncomfortable from thinking that they moved us to sit here because we are Asian, but the so called ""more spacious"" table was in the corner of the room and it was WAYYYYYY more cramped than the comfortable, non-segregated table we were originally at. Also, our pizza had a giant burnt black bubble on it.",2.0
"Since the last time I came here, which was 4 years ago, Grimaldi's has gotten a lot bigger and popular.  Four years ago, it was a little shop in the middle of the block.  Now, Grimaldi's moved to this white castle at the corner of Front Street.  The place expanded to two floors.With two friends of mine, we waited in line for hours just for a couple of slices of pizza.  When you finally get a table, you might as well order three whole pies, one for each person, because the slices are so thin and you are starving from waiting so long.  Once you place your order, be prepare to wait another hour or so for your pizza, because they make each pie from scratch.  You are so hungry that you might start eating the peppers from the table.  Finally the pizza come and you take the first bite, and it is not that amazing.  It's just regular pizza with fresh mozzarella and fresh basil.  Grimaldi's famous tomato sauce does not taste that different from a regular sauce.  Although, the slices were very crunchy due to the fact that the pie has a thin crust and bottom.  The whole pie cost $16 for the large pie (18 in.).  It is $2 extra for extra mozzarella or sauce, or basil.  Service was decent.  The waiters were really busy trying to serve all the tables that we were forgotten at times.  The check took a while to get to us as well.Personally, the pizza was not that special for me to wait in line and pay more than double of what I would pay at Two Bros.",3.0
"Keep away, don't waste your time or money! Pizza is good, more Neapolitan style vice NY style pizza.

As a customer I appreciate that when  standing there hungry!The pizza was very delicious and fresh! I like the added basil. The mozzarella cheese was amazing!

Celebrated are 1st year anniversary as husband and wife here last Dec.. I've heard about the long line and the waiting game here before you finally be able to get your table and luckly we try this during winter and we avoided the long line. Service is fast..

So I guess if you want to avoid the hassle of falling in line better try this pizzeria on winter.,4.0
"What can I say? It's a total pain in the butt to go to this place but it is completely worth it. We waited for 45 minutes in 95 degree heat to get in to this place, and it doesn't have air conditioning. But there we were, refusing to get out of line, on this pizza pilgrimage. Sounds like hell right? Before we started eating it felt like it, and we kept saying things like, ""This better be worth it,"" as we grumbled in line drowning in sweat. But even with all of that, I'd go again. The dough is what does it. The chewy, stretchy, but crispy dough! It's perfect and I would eat that dough every day if I could. We got 2 small pizzas for the 2 of us- 1 white pizza and 1 italian sausage pizza, and we ate both of them. All of it. I'm almost embarrassed to admit it but that's how good this pizza is. It's a must in Brooklyn or Manhattan.",5.0
"LOVE. THIS. PLACE. It is absolutely worth waiting in line for. Even better, if you make it there on a weekend around 11:30, the place opens at noon and you will likely get seated with the first group of people. Grimaldi's moved relatively recently and now occupies a much larger building than before, so I imagine that wait times have decreased as well. The pizza here is perfection, hands down one of the best places in New York. If you have guests in town that want to experience quality pizza, Grimaldi's can't be missed. Not only is the food amazing, it is CHEAP. One pizza easily feeds 2 people, 3 if you're not that hungry. Seriously, if you haven't been here yet you're missing out.Heads up: CASH ONLY.",5.0

The server was friendly enough.We ordered a small regular pizza with pepperonis and jalapenos. The pizza was served to us pretty quickly. The pizza was phenomenal. All of the elements were in perfect balance with each other. The crust was light and crispy. The cheese was tasty but not greasy. The pepperoni was flavorful and the jalapenos were pleasantly spicy.

I circled around for 15 minutes and finally lucked out when I saw someone who was about to leave. I dashed over just as the host asked my friend how many guests. Perfect timing!I've been to the Hoboken location several times. The same great pizza, but the Brooklyn location has the history and the architectural charm. We were seated upstairs by the glass windows where we could look down at the pizza makers and the entrance.Delicious thin crispy and yet chewy NY pizza. My friend left NY happy and full.",4.0
"No slices! No reservations! No delivery! No credit card! No Joke... that's what's written on their menu!! (On the bottom)Food: Yum! It's more of a chewy thin crust pizza, and it was delicious! If you decide to do half side of toppings you're charged a full price $2-$3 depending on your topping choice. I was disappointed that the toppings on the pizza are limited. We had a mushroom and sausage pizza and I had half a mushroom on one slice... hmm... If you want toppings better ask for extra! Décor: A two story restaurant... that on a warm Spring day... can be kinda warm and stuffy... but it was a nice rustic building with red and white checkered table cloths. Service: Super disappointed... I've never been to a restaurant where if the line was long... and you want to order to go... you have to stand in line... when I asked the owner/ manager ""don't you take orders over the phone?"" His response was ""good luck getting through"". Uh... ok...? Otherwise the wait staff were chill and helpful. Cost: The pie was about $16 (marina pie) and $18 (white sauce pie) and just add the price of $2-$3 for toppings.Overall: If the pizza was tasty... I would probably not wait an hour or more for it. It would be ideal to order it over the phone... if the owner or manager weren't rude... If you have time on your hands... this would be a great place to go... otherwise... I don't see myself returning anytime soon. There are so many delicious pizza places in the City that appreciate your patronage.",3.0

The pizza is great.  The people are annoying.  We sat at the bar and the people next to us gave small tips.  The waiter audibly scoffed when collecting the money.  I don't need that.  Also my water glass was never filled and that's also annoying.  Use this place for take out.

Loved the pizza :) Saturday night. 6:30pm. Wait was about 45 minutes for 2. Regular small pizza with sausage and mushroom. It was great! It's not your typical neighborhood pizza. The tomato sauce was delicious. The mozzarella tasted fresh. Everything went well together. The only downside is the service was slow (though friendly).,5.0
"My mom and I decided to walk the brooklyn bridge to come get some pizza. It was a nice walk and then a great way to finish our walk with some pizza!Great pizza. I love that it is a thin crust because you can eat a few slices without getting full off the bread. My mom and I ordered a small with onions, mushrooms, and sausage. A small pizza costs $12 but comes with cheese, garlic, basil, and tomatoes. Additional toppings are $2 each. Good amount of sauce and topping and good ratio to the bread. The crust has a salty taste, but it was good and not too salty. Probably can't help it since it's brick oven, but the bottom of our pizza was sort of burnt. That was probably the only downfall of the pizza. But nonetheless, still good!",4.0
"Wow! Great New York thin crust, crispy pizza. Nothing special or gimmicky. Just good food and kind service.  Had nothing but pizza. It was excellent! Stood in line for 35 minutes. Well worth the wait!!  Line was long and moved quickly.",5.0
"VERY LONG LINES = long WAIT Time!!! but actually it went by quickly...it was about 30 mins waiting during the summer time.The pizza lives up to expectations. SOOOO darn good. No other is comparable. The pizza pie was actually pretty cheap, around $12-15, i was expecting to pay more since its a tourist trap. It serves about 8 people (8 large slices), the only con I have is the oven is right by the tables, so it was very hot inside and the smoke and smell of the oven was over powering. They def. need to open the windows or vents. Otherwise, this is a must try for everyone!!",4.0

"Grimaldi's was another overhyped pizza house. Now hear me out before y'all from Brooklyn try to murder me out here. It was no doubt one of the most unique pizzas I have ever placed in my mouth and it should be famous for that alone. The cheese was a very interesting texture that I couldn't quite put a finger on. Slightly gooey feeling but at the same time stiff in some ways. The cheese was not evenly spread across the pie and there were just parts with just tomato sauce. The toppings were fresh and very nice but this uniqueness didn't sit well with me. It just didn't taste like pizza to me, and left me a bit unsatisfied. I do however compliment them on their legitimate dough crusts that were thin and crunchy. I like how the store has an old school feel and that its on the way to the ocean where Manhattan/the bridges can be observed. Let's say 3.5 rounded down.",3.0
"My friend from California wanted a NY experience and part of that was having some NY pizza. I took her here to Grimaldi's because it's an institution. Knowing about the long lines and having witnessed them myself, I had my friend hop out of the car to wait in line while I went to go park the car. I circled around for 15 minutes and finally lucked out when I saw someone who was about to leave. I dashed over just as the host asked my friend how many guests. Perfect timing!I've been to the Hoboken location several times. The same great pizza, but the Brooklyn location has the history and the architectural charm. We were seated upstairs by the glass windows where we could look down at the pizza makers and the entrance.Delicious thin crispy and yet chewy NY pizza. My friend left NY happy and full.",4.0
"No slices! No reservations! No delivery! No credit card! No Joke... that's what's written on their menu!! (On the bottom)Food: Yum! It's more of a chewy thin crust pizza, and it was delicious! If you decide to do half side of toppings you're charged a full price $2-$3 depending on your topping choice. I was disappointed that the toppings on the pizza are limited. We had a mushroom and sausage pizza and I had half a mushroom on one slice... hmm... If you want toppings better ask for extra! Décor: A two story restaurant... that on a warm Spring day... can be kinda warm and stuffy... but it was a nice rustic building with red and white checkered table cloths. Service: Super disappointed... I've never been to a restaurant where if the line was long... and you want to order to go... you have to stand in line... when I asked the owner/ manager ""don't you take orders over the phone?"" His response was ""good luck getting through"". Uh... ok...? Otherwise the wait staff were chill and helpful. Cost: The pie was about $16 (marina pie) and $18 (white sauce pie) and just add the price of $2-$3 for toppings.Overall: If the pizza was tasty... I would probably not wait an hour or more for it. It would be ideal to order it over the phone... if the owner or manager weren't rude... If you have time on your hands... this would be a great place to go... otherwise... I don't see myself returning anytime soon. There are so many delicious pizza places in the City that appreciate your patronage.",3.0
Pizzza Pizzaa!! Expect a super long line if you are going on a weekend,4.0
The pizza is great.  The people are annoying.  We sat at the bar and the people next to us gave small tips.  The waiter audibly scoffed when collecting the money.  I don't need that.  Also my water glass was never filled and that's also annoying.  Use this place for take out.

"Walked right in on a Monday night. Yes I consider myself lucky. I felt like no's were being shouted at me left and right. NO credit cards. NO reservations. NO slices. NO delivery. In other words, wait in line, whole pie it is, and pay with cash.We were seated and ready to order in no time. Then we waited. And waited and waited. Finally after a good 10 minutes someone that worked there made their way to the back to take our order. We ordered drinks and our pie all at once. Our pie came out rather quickly. It was quite the sight although for me, it didn't deliver on the taste. Enjoyed the crisp thin crust but it seems like NYC always delivers a solid crust. Loved the small circle curled up edges of the pepperoni although I did feel they were shisty on the amount of them they gave. Was not a fan of the nearly burnt basil leaves. The tomato sauce was flavorless. Cheese was good. I was seduced last night by a fantastic slice of pie so Grimaldi's didn't come close to impressing me. Service was painful so really once was enough for me. I'm just happy I didn't wait in line for it. Please don't scorn me for 2 starring Grimaldi's.

"Yes - it's worth the hype.  All our family and friends in the area told us we had to eat here if we found ourselves in Brooklyn...well, as faith would have it we ended up taking a water taxi to DUMBO and walked to Grimaldi's just in time for lunch on a weekday.  The first floor was already full so we were seated on the 2nd floor.  We got a window seat which had a great view of the building interiors overlooking the 1st floor.  Service was curt...which I didn't like. I thought to myself this pizza better be good.  And it was!  Simple menu, reg or large with your choice of toppings.  The reg was perfect for two adults.  We also ordered the antipasto platter for our daughter.  She doesn't eat pizza yet so the appetizer which had fresh tomato slices, mozzarella, olives and salami (which we ate) was perfect for her. Food came out really fast.  I think we just came at the right time.  The pizza was perfectly balanced.  Crispy and chewy - Not too heavy on sauce or cheese.  And there is NO crust.  The pie makers here make it the real way in which they take the sauce and cheese almost all the way to the edge of the pie.  I love that - I hate when a slice is mostly doughy crust.   Service also got better once we were seated and the food began to arrive.  Even if guys try to act like bad asses, being around a friendly toddler will always get them to smile.  So yes - believe the hype.  Enjoy the wait by bringing friends, a good read, or some tunes.  And reward yourself by stuffing your face!Baby tips to know: small dining area.  Break down your stroller to get into the restaurant.  They have a designated area to place them (near the stairs). No changing table in the bathroom.  If you (or the baby) prefer one, there a changing table in the park next to the Garden Cafe.",5.0
"I finally decided to come here and see what they hype was all about. Got here early before they opened, maybe 10 minutes prior and no issue with a line. I'm by myself so I end up sitting at the bar.When the bartender comes, I tell him, ""I'm from f-ing New York and I'm not like all these other tourists."" He laughed when I said that. Nk, besides the table of cops that was behind me, every other table were tourists. Even the other people who joined me at the bar were tourists. Place is CASH only, so make sure you bring enough cash. It's a thin crust pizza, not NYC style at all also. So while I liked the pizza, don't think this is an example of NYC pizza because it's absolutely not. I ordered the 12"" and got a half and half. Got anchovies on one side and pepperoni and olives on the other. Yeah, my pizza turned out kinda salty but it was all good. I ate the whole thing by myself and it's really good. A really solid pizza. There's only one big complaint and I've found. The pizza cools down after 5-10 minutes and the cheese on it congeals. The taste of the pizza becomes very mediocre. at this point. So the lesson is to eat as much as possible when they bring it out to you pipping hot.So a funny story. The couple next to me didn't finish their 12"" and left 2 slices. The guy asked if they wanted him to pack it but they told him to throw it out as they couldn't bring it with them. Out of habit, I immediately told them not to throw the food out and I'd take it! Terrible. I suddenly realized what I had done and laughed at myself a little embarrassed but everyone there took in great stride. The couple especially. I told them I was from a third world country and just couldn't see food being thrown out. The couple was again, totally cool and very happy to give me their last two slices. Those slices btw, didn't taste no where as good when I took them back and reheated them. So another lesson, don't do take-out here. Eat the pizza here.Oh, I do want to say one last thing.

"First off the customer service was disappointing. Ashley was taking orders and I thought she was rude, impatient, uncaring (seeing how she never looked at me as I ordered) and snappy. When I received my pizza I didn't understand what this ""perfect crust"" hype was about. Mine was completely soggy. The spices were good and unique but the cheese wasn't. It was like someone baked it in the oven, put it in the freezer, then reheated it in the microwave and let it sit out for too long. It wasn't fresh and the consistency wasn't appealing. I literally considered tossing my leftovers but I couldn't bring myself to throwing away an entire pizza. They should really sell by the slice instead of forcing you to buy an entire pie. I wanted to sell my leftovers to the line but I thought I'd spare them my poorly prepared pizza and hoped that theirs was better.

My Recommendation: BEST NYC PIZZA!",5.0
"Pizza was great. But service could be better. While our server was great, guy watching the line was worse than a mall cop on a power trip. Wait for a pizza was very long. And ""cash only"" policy was very annoying.",3.0
"I don't know why people continue to line up and eat here. Granted about 4 years ago when they were next door the place had a bit more authenticity and they actually took some care in making their pizza. Oh, their glory days are long gone. Service was always bad not going to complain about that but it wasn't something I cared about because the pizza was good. Now all they care about is churning out the pizzas as fast as they can, quality is so low with the pizza burned to the point you wonder if you'll get cancer the very moment you eat it. And it just doesn't taste the same. Really not worth the hype and don't waste your time lining up.",3.0
"Not worth the 45 minute wait outside and the additional 45 min wait once seated.  Thankfully it was nice and comfortable day out so at least the weather was on our side.  Once inside, we witnessed a family of 5 leave after they got seated when they were told that it would be ""no more than 45 minutes wait"" for their pizza.  If we weren't so hungry and hadn't already waited close to an hour outside, we would have left, too!  Service was nice enough, but seemed stressed and just ready to get you out of there once you were done eating type service.  We didn''t mind feeling rushed though.  After our last slice, you couldn't get us out of there fast enough!We chose to come here because a friend told me it was the best pizza in New York and that we should definitely give it a try during our trip.  She warned us about the wait, but she also said it would be worth it.  Well...it was not.  The pizza is good - don't get me wrong.  It's thin, cooked in a brick oven and tastes fresh, but just not the wow factor that we were expecting.  So yes, this is just another tourist trap (located ""under the Brooklyn Bridge"") that we didn't manage to avoid.",2.0
"I really didn't care for the pizza here at all...especially after having joe's pizza and Juliana's pizzas first.  Not to mention the host guy is weird, rude and has no rhyme or reason for how he seats people.  There is a line outside and you would think he would go in order but instead took 4 other parties of two ahead of us despite us being at the front of the line...just weird.",1.0
"I wish I could give six! Best pizza we have had in NYC! The crust sunk this basket crisp, thin but chewy and fresh! Red sauce , fresh mozzarella and we opted for olives (the black salty kind) with Italian sausage. An antipasto app and two sodas...38$!",5.0
"Great pizza, amazing service, nice atmosphere. What would make it better? BEER! If you come alone (like I did) skip the line and head to the bar.",4.0
"First off the customer service was disappointing. Ashley was taking orders and I thought she was rude, impatient, uncaring (seeing how she never looked at me as I ordered) and snappy. When I received my pizza I didn't understand what this ""perfect crust"" hype was about. Mine was completely soggy. The spices were good and unique but the cheese wasn't. It was like someone baked it in the oven, put it in the freezer, then reheated it in the microwave and let it sit out for too long. It wasn't fresh and the consistency wasn't appealing. I literally considered tossing my leftovers but I couldn't bring myself to throwing away an entire pizza. They should really sell by the slice instead of forcing you to buy an entire pie. I wanted to sell my leftovers to the line but I thought I'd spare them my poorly prepared pizza and hoped that theirs was better. Never again.Extra note: They only accept cash and their atm fee is $4.50. If you go down the street there's another atm that is cheaper",1.0
"I finally had a chance to try this hyped up pizzaria. I mean what's the big deal, it's just a pizzaria right?I came on a weekday afternoon(around3:30pm)---no line! From what I've read from other reviewers, it is quite common that you will stumble onto a line when you're visiting this corner pizzaria. The pizza was simple, fresh, and mind-blowingly delicious. I'm not a really big pizza eater but I couldn't stop myself from finishing the last piece of the pie.The service is really quick and they are also very friendly. Our made to order pizza was at our table within 10 minutes. It was so worth the trip!",4.0

"Yes folks, Grimaldi's Pizza lives up to the hype.  At any given point there are huge lines outside the establishment waiting to be served Grimaldi's famous Pizza.  A huge reason the line's are so long besides the 5 star Pizza taste is because many tourist's that come to NY are being pitched to come eat there as part of their Brooklyn Bridge tour.The Pizza itself is served only as a whole pie with many topping to choose from.  The Pizza is made in a thin crust style and almost feels like you're popping them in your mouth like chips.  Every bite is a good as the first bite.  I would recommend getting some red wine with your pizza.  There is only one catch to this place and that is that they only accept cash.  Cash is king in this joint.  For any pizza lover, this is the place to experience thin crust Pizza heaven.",5.0
"Lived in Brooklyn my whole life but have never been here before, as such I put this place on my bucket list. Finally got a chance to come down here and try their famous pizza.Came here with  my family around 11 p.m., the line was looongg. I considered leaving because I just hate waiting in lines, but was persuaded to wait it out and glad I did. After you take one bite it is clear why there's a wait. I don't think I have ever had better pizza, anywhere! Surprisingly, the service was exceptional at the place. Usually when you are at a high volume place like this and the place is known for the quality of the food, the service is not of top priority. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the service. We ordered 2 cheese, 2 sausage, ans 2 pepperoni and I expected to wait an hour because there wasn't an empty seat in the house. Our food was served hot and delicious in about 20 minutes. I absolutely loved this place, and glad I finally tried it out. Will definitely be back here again, and again, and again.....you get the point.",4.0
"Hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten!! Incredible toppings (it's the cheese!), flavorful sauce, non-greasy, and chewy/soft crust. Yes, the wait here is ridiculous but it'll give you more time to build up your appetite and enjoy the pizza even more. However, you can easily bypass the line on a busy evening if you only come with one other person and agree to sit at the bar. My friend and I did that and we only had to wait about 30 minutes on a Saturday night. The bar seating area was comfortable and spacious.The price here is good too. Split a small original pizza for $12 between 2 and you'll definitely be full. Drinks(Soda/Snapple/Root beer) are only $2.

"We took a family trip here and really loved it. The original Grimaldi's is in a spectacular location right under the Brooklyn Bridge on the Brooklyn side with amazing views of lower Manhattan just outside the door. When I think about New York sytle pizza, this is how I picture it. The pizza is hand made with super fresh, delicious ingredients in a coal-fired brick oven. Coal was used instead of wood during the depression and yields a slightly smokey flavor. We tried two pizzas. One had delicious Italian sausage with a hint of fennel and onions. They use a nice, fresh mozzarella and plenty of delicious marinara. The pizza has a nice, thin slightly blackened crust with areas that are really crispy and bubbly form the oven's very high heat. Its a nearly perfect New York pizza. My only complaint is that I really prefer pizza that is crispy all the way to the center. These are slightly soggy in the middle.I will say that the service was not very good. It was very difficult to get food ordered and to even more difficult to get the waiter's attention later. Overall, however, I highly recommend it for both the pizza and the experience. Go get an ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory next door afterward.",4.0

That is where the heart is.TL;DR : ""Grimaldi's"" used to be Patsy's, now it isnt, its a giant tourist trap with no soul. Go to the old patsy's, which is actually now called ""Julianna's"".",3.0
"Waited so many years to come here. It was nothing more than another bucket list of things to do. Line outside was about 20 minutes. Not too bad. The wait inside was extremely long. The place is run down. Pretty dirty and unkept. The bathroom was dirty. Toilet paper everywhere. There was even a plate in the ladies bathroom.  Floors and tables were dirty. As for the pizza... It was bland. No taste. We ordered different toppings and yet it was nothing exciting. I had to put salt and garlic on my slices and I Never put salt on anything. The ingredients were fresh but even so it was not the best pizza. As for the customer service, I actually enjoyed the maître d Ernie. Great and funny guy. No complaints about the service. I won't be back.",1.0

"Wow, overrated! I had my first dinner in NYC here, and being a pizza lover, I was damn excited. It was about a 15 minute walk from my friend's apartment in Brooklyn Heights. I decided to stand in line while she came straight from work, but to my surprise and hers, there was no wait. We had the table right next to the door. I heard there's normally an hour wait, sometimes longer.While waiting to use the restroom (it's hot since its right next to the brick ovens!), I got to see the workers creating a masterpiece. Or so I thought. My friend was also running late, and they took her empty chair to another table. I was like umm, can I get another chair for her please? We got a large pizza, my half was with pepperoni and mushrooms, her half no cheese, basil, and mushrooms. Our pizza came out within 15-20 minutes, and it was...COLD. also being in the corner table sucked since we were totally ignored by the rude workers here. the only nice person here was the manager or owner of the place that greets customers inside. Anyways, we ask for them to reheat it, and he walks away with other people's dishes. Since he never came back to take it, or maybe he took our reheat request as an insult, I asked the manager/owner if they could reheat it. He did so kindly. It finally came back (I mean, another 15 minutes! We thought they either forgot or were totally pissed at us), and it had steam coming from it, like OTHER tables around us. Anyways, I felt the pizza was bland, and had to ask for parmesean cheese (which I thought was weird that they dont automatically offer it, or maybe I was the weird one that needed it?). I liked how you could see where they put the balls of mozzeralla cheese, but again, just so flavorless. The only flavor I got was the hints of basil they put on the pizza, and the pepperoni. The crust was just okay too, but I barely ate them. I also NEVER leave pizza behind, but we left some slices and didn't bother taking them to go.My friend had been here several times before and has said no experience has ever been as bad as this, so maybe I was there on an OFF day.

It was the first time I used a knife to cut my pizza. The crust was giving me a particularly difficult time and it was difficult to chew.

"I've finally made it to the infamous Grimaldi's! And strangely enough, there was NO line! It was a Tuesday afternoon and beautiful so this struck me as kind of strange. Every other time I've ever gone by they've had a huge line of people waiting.2 Important Things to Know:1) This place is cash only. 2) They sell pies, not slices.We got a margarita pie, a large. Reasonably priced. For those of you who are non-New Yorkers and reading this...I would suggest you NOT eat with a knife and fork (it makes the locals laugh at you on the inside). Just fold it in half and eat it like the rest of us.So, back to the pizza. It was good pizza, but definitely not the best in New York. There are far better places. There was a lot of crust. The sauce was good. The cheese could've been fresher...when we got the pizza it was kind of coagulated...and not longer hot.Since it's Grimaldi's though, you should give it a shot and pass judgement.

"I got there at 5:30 on a Saturday and the line was only about 15 min long, though it took 40 min for them to bring us pizza after we ordered. Really great thin, fluffy crust, with fresh tomato and cheese. And by thin I really do mean thin - by the time the pizza cools, the crust is pretty much soggy from the toppings. This is meant to be eaten right after ordered. All in all, it was a very good pizza - I'm just not sure it merits the long wait times and all the hype.",4.0
"I must say, Grimaldi's has some pretty darn good brick oven pizza. I thought Grimaldi's would be a over hyped pizzeria because of it's name and fame but it's actually not. The ingredients were great. Their thin crust pies are very crunch and crispy. I really like the cheese they use and their not too heavy on the sauce. What I like most about Grimaldi's is that their pizza isn't full of grease and oil. I hate eating a pizza that is leaking orange oil. At Grimaldi's, I didn't get that at all. Every ingredient on their pizza is well balanced.There are 2 things I dislike about Grimaldi's.1 - Their restroom was pretty nasty. Bunch of flies and mosquitoes everywhere and the floor was a hot mess too.2 - When I was waiting to use the restroom, I stood right by where the guys prepare the pizzas. I saw a couple flies flying around touching the cheese and other ingredients. Verdict - Still very good brick oven pizza. I just wish they were cleaner. When I see things like that, I can't understand how some restaurants can get an A grade posted on their window from the health inspections. There's no question that their pizzas are good but you can't kick cleanliness to the curb just because you're a famous pizza spot.",4.0

"Talk about visiting NY and I'm pretty sure you can't avoid Grimaldi's being brought up.  Umm the only thing that they never bring up is that it's CASH ONLY! My friends and I made the trek here from Manhattan to try this glorious pizza place out.We got here around 5, and there was a short but not terrible line. We got SUPER lucky though because they were looking for a 3 party group to seat, so we only waited in line for about 5-8 minutes! Sat down and we already knew what we wanted, large pizza w/ mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, italian sausage and pepperoni. It took about half an hour to come out, and it seemed even longer becuase we were all hungry.Finally the pizza came out and it looked gooooooooooood. I had to warn my friends not to not to dig in until I managed to snap a picture! The pizza was good, but to be honest I wasn't blown away...  the crust wasn't crispy or crunchy, I'm not sure if it's a NY thing, but I had expected more texture and less.. mushy. BUT, besides that the pizza was good. It came out piping hot, there was a bunch of delicious fresh mozzerella, the tomatoes were good and overall very enjoyable! It just wasn't life changing, I guess I hyped it up for myself. Something good to keep in mind when trying out this place.Overall not a bad experience, but I'm not sure it would be worth the long wait (that I didn't have to endure). The price was good, it came out to about $10 per person and that's with tip! I recommend going over at off hours so the line isn't as long. We left there around 7 and the line tripled!",4.0

"I stopped by here yesterday at around 3:40 because my friends and I were hungry and had quite some time to kill.The line didn't seem too long when we arrived. There were maybe a good 20 to 30 people in front of us. The line was moving along quickly and every once in a while, a guy would come out and keep a tally of the number of seats needed. Eventually, my friends and I got to the front. We were the second group on the line, hopeful that we were going to be called any minute now, BUT... they started calling two people at a time and people in the back ended up getting a table before us. It was to the point where my friend wanted to ditch us in order to get a table, hahaha.We got a table at around 4:40 and we ordered the 16"" pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. It arrived at around 5:05 and at that point, I was just starving so I digged right in. I must admit--it was a unique experience, but it surely wasn't the best I've had. It was the first time I used a knife to cut my pizza. The crust was giving me a particularly difficult time and it was difficult to chew. I liked the mushroom and pepperoni, but overall I felt like the pizza lacked flavor. It needed a bit more tomato sauce in it.Overall, I give my experience at Grimaldi's a 3/5.",3.0

We had a seat just before 7 p.m. and ordered our pie immediately.Cut to 40 minutes later when a manager came over and told us that he hoped our order made it in before they had to clean the oven (in the middle of dinner service... on a Saturday evening...). Spoiler: it did not make it. We were assured that cleaning the oven only takes a few minutes and adds about 10 to 15 minutes on to the normal estimated wait time of 25 minutes (but we're already at 40 minutes at this point, so...).One hour after we ordered, there is still no pizza. Not only do we not have a pizza, but nobody in the upstairs seating area has one. The place doesn't even smell like pizza. The table next to us complains and are told by the manager that ""this is Grimaldi's -- you have to wait.

This is the way you treat paying customers?At an hour and 20 minutes, I head downstairs to use the bathroom and realize: a) there are no pizzas in the oven because it is still apparently being cleaned, and b) not a SINGLE PERSON in this ~ 200 seat restaurant has a pizza on their table.

Grimaldi's pizza was delicious. This pizza reminded me of the fresh pizza I had when I studied abroad in Florence. The fresh mozzarella cheese and thin crust is the best part. The best decision we made was calling ahead and ordering our pizza via telephone. When we called to order they told us it would be a 15 minute wait. By the time we got to Grimaldi's our pizzas were ready to go and we were able to bypass the long line outside.

Funny thing is that I work for a Canadian airline (I'm American and live in Chicago) and one of the pilots, who is Canadian and resides in Toronto, told me about this place. He's never been before, but I will talk him into it when I get a chance.So anyway, the pizza was great and the price was reasonable. Best thing was there was absolutely no line! The place was hoppin' though. I love thin crust even though I grew up in Chicago, which is known for deep dish pizza.The service could have been better. It was probably lousy because they know their pizza is amazing and you're there to have their pizza, good service or not, which is very unfortunate for us.Tip: Since the service isn't all that great, I would order the pizza to go.

"Hands down my favorite pizza in Brooklyn, and my favorite pizza overall (other than Prince St Pizza's and Artichoke's Sicilian slices).

"Took a trip out to NYC and of course I had to eat a NY Pizza. Apparently, found this place on yelp as highly rated. Came in around 3pm and seated right away.

"They were being racist. It was only our table and another. The other table came in later than us and they received their pizza first. They ordered more than us and we only ordered one. We had to wait a really long time, the waiters paid no attention to us and in the end, they gave us a cold pizza with little cheese, little tomato and the pizza was super thin. The table next to us had theirs all hot and freshly baked. You could see that their cheese melted but ours was cold and hard. Please do not discriminate your customers. I do not believe this is how a restaurant should be run.",1.0
Loved this place. The wait wasn't too bad. The food was excellent. Didn't take as long as others have suggested. Try the Italian soda:)Unfortunately you lose 1 star because we felt rushed to leave as the line outside had increased.,4.0
Grimaldi's pizza was delicious. This pizza reminded me of the fresh pizza I had when I studied abroad in Florence. The fresh mozzarella cheese and thin crust is the best part. The best decision we made was calling ahead and ordering our pizza via telephone. When we called to order they told us it would be a 15 minute wait. By the time we got to Grimaldi's our pizzas were ready to go and we were able to bypass the long line outside.

"I've heard so many good things about NY pizza, maybe too many, because I was slightly disappointed by Grimaldi's.

But I found the pizza below-par. The base didn't seem to be fully cooked and the toppings okay but underwhelming. There was also the wait: although I was shown to a table immediately, the pizza took 30 minutes to arrive, much longer than I'm used to. Further, at close to $28 for pizza, two toppings and tip, I'd say the value was questionable, even despite the pizza's size. So my quest for the legendary NY pizza continues.

Pizza is at its best over here. You can really say that it is a great pizza just by tasting the cheese on it. It is cooked in an original fire oven and the crust is delicious. They accept only cash. It is a problem as people have to head out to the ATM before coming to the place. The wait queues are huge and usually it is easier to get tables for smaller parties. Weekends get really crowded at this place. It is a must eat place in NewYork.,5.0

"Can't believe I never reviewed this place! After living in NY and eating numerous pizzas, this is my favorite pizza place. Yes, it is touristy, but not one of those touristy let downs.Pizza is amazing here. It's all about the thin crust and sauce here. They also moved down the street, so the space is a lot bigger now.

"Old school pizza at it's finest.  I've had the pleasure of having gone on somewhat of a Brooklyn pizza tour recently (Saraghina, Totonno's, L&B Spumoni Gardens & now Grimaldi's), and without question this plce stacks up right along side the best in the city.  I haven't been in over 10 years & the product is consistent...even in the new location. Before you stand in line, pop inside to see if there are any spots @ the bar.  I did that recently & my wife & I avoided the long line of tourists outside :)",5.0
"Great pizza. Great location, right under the Brooklyn bridge. I shared a pizza and a cannoli and can't complain about either one. The crust was so soft and you could really take the smokiness from the oven. It was great. We got there late almost to closing and they still sat us. The service was a little slow but the food was timely and that's the most important part, right? Very affordable and hey, it's Grimaldi's. All in all, great experience. Definitely going back.",4.0
"Fantastic. My favorite pizza joint in NY and where I always brought visitors. I've had just about every variety of pizza they offer and have loved them all. To be clear, this is pizza. While tremendous, do not expect the pizza to talk to you or do magic tricks. Your experience seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time should be slightly more exciting than enjoying grimaldis. However, do expect to have fun in a bustling atmosphere and enjoy terrific pizza.",5.0
"I came here with a couple of friends on a weekday afternoon. There was no wait. We ordered a large mushroom and pepperoni pizza, per the waitor's suggestion, and a couple of old-fashioned root beers. The pizza was delicious, but the reputation has been definitely over-hyped. This is New York City, the land of pizza, so it's not something I'd go out of my way to eat. This is definitely a great place to bring your friends from out of town, as it is also down the street from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory and the Brooklyn Bridge.",4.0
"BF has been asking about going to Grimaldi's ever since we started dating 4 months ago. I've only been to the Garden City location, so I was up for the trip to Brooklyn. We managed to get there at 11:45am (Grimaldi's opens their doors at 12pm on the dot!) and were probably the 5th couple on line. I read that they recently moved to a new location just a few stores down, and their new space is much bigger than its last. I recommend getting there at noon to be seated promptly without much of a wait. BF and I ordered two small pizzas (yes I know... but we packed half of each to go!). We got one white and one regular with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, and extra basil. Both pizzas were delicious. The white came out first and smelled divine! I love the smell of garlic and basil. Everything is so good when it's fresh out of the oven! Service was friendly and prompt, and the pizza is great (and I'm not really a big fan of pizza, lol). Yes, it's considered a tourist trap, but hey, everyone should play tourist every now and then and discover your own city!

We didn't get any ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory since it was pretty cold and windy out, but next time!",5.0
"Awesome pizza. Basic pizza comes with cheese, sauce and basil, basically a margerita. We asked for a sausage topping. Got our pizza in no time. It was huge and though we ate 2 slices each, we also look 2 home for dinner. The coal fired oven adds to the great taste and service is excellent. We are at the downtown Grimaldis but it is great anywhere. A staple must do if you want the real New York pizza.",4.0
"Best pizza I've had in a long time.  On a trip to New York and wanted an authentic New York pizza.  We were not disappointed.  Ordered a large white pizza and large pepperoni for the family.  The crust was thin and perfectly done with with a little char.  The pepperoni we smaller, but thicker and more flavorful than any I've had before.  We ordered takeout and walked over to pebble beach for sunset. Overall a great New York experience!",5.0
Pizza is at its best over here. You can really say that it is a great pizza just by tasting the cheese on it. It is cooked in an original fire oven and the crust is delicious. They accept only cash. It is a problem as people have to head out to the ATM before coming to the place. The wait queues are huge and usually it is easier to get tables for smaller parties. Weekends get really crowded at this place. It is a must eat place in NewYork.,5.0
"I have yet to leave Grimaldi's with anything but a wide grin on my face.  Though wait times can be extensive depending on when you go, the pizza is phenomenal.  The service has always been impeccable and their large with fresh mozzarella, basil and garlic is my absolute go-to.  Their Douglaston location is great, but you can't beat the DUMBO location!",5.0
"Can't believe I never reviewed this place! After living in NY and eating numerous pizzas, this is my favorite pizza place.

The plain pizza is hands down the best item on the menu. Super good and fresh and flavorful. Easily the best pizza I have ever had. I've tried it with chicken as well but nothing beats the plain pizza. The cannoli was also massive and oh so good not to mention those tiny chocolate covered ice cream balls. I had to take a star off because the service was horribllle. Our waiter disappeared and would not come back for ages or ask if we needed anything. The manager is such a sweet guy.

Grimaldi's is absolutely delicious New York brick oven pizza !!!!!It's worth the wait and is a fun place to bring out of town guests for that true New York experience.  Their sausage is made with just the right mix of spices and shouldn't be missed.,5.0
"All I could say is if your lookin for pizza in Brooklyn I recommend this place. It's a tourist spot for people craving for NY pizza! Expect long lines and long wait time they also take long cooking your pizza because it's cooked old style brick and coal. But it's worth it for the experience. When you walk inside it's smells like coal mixed with pizza smell it's not that typical smell you would get from other pizza places. The servers are all happy dancing to the beat of whatever music there playing 80's type of music. The desert was so good especially the cannoli. Stop by and try it for first timers, you will not regret the wait!",4.0
"Finally, i took the pilgrimage to Grimaldi's after many tries. The line was expected so i didn't fault them for it. Plus taking a trip down to the dock and getting ice cream made the wait seem shorter. And once we finally reached the entrance, the hostess was extremely nice and apologized many, many times for the inconvenience. For new york coal pizza, i always compare it to my favorite, Lombardi's. And no doubt, it is up to par with the fresh mozzarella and basil. The peperoni was good but unlike Lombardi's, the experience was forgettable. The place was dirty and our table was not wiped down from the previous patrons. The prices were extremely fair ($6 less than Lombardis) but the menu only contains pizza or antipasto, nothing else food wise. The pizza came out within 5 minutes but half the slices' crust came out burnt. The unburnt slices were great and were not greasy. Some members of our party had committed blasphemy and stated that they liked Grimald's better than Lombardis. I respect their opinion and could see why they would, but Lombardis adds so much to the experience including salad on their menu. Grimaldi's is a place to definitely try because you might think this is your favorite pizzeria in NYC, and i hate when people say Grimald's is hands down the best pizza or Johns or Lombardi's or Joe's because they are all great and comparable to one another, there is no clear favorite, just a slight preference. My recommendation to grimaldis is to increase the price of the pizza by a dollar and save that money to renovate and buy the unnecessary store next to you to expand",3.0
"Very short wait in line to get in and served very promptly and it was a Friday evening. Pizza was very good, classic Brooklyn brick oven.

"Why am I waiting here on this long line? Feet hurt, getting dark and cold out, looking like a fool tourist. Real New Yorkers don't wait on line for touristy things - its embarrassing! Persevere I must to experience this mecca of mozzerella. Now, I know full well that there is always a line here, but since we just walked across the Brooklyn Bridge it was a must destination stop. Sucked it up and got on line. The manager would come out every few minutes to get a head count and keep the line moving. It is kind of funny how we all secretly count everyone walking out and wish they would move their asses and hurry up in there! Sit down, eat your pizza, get up, go!Inside the place is small and has many pictures of Sinatra and other celebrities on the walls. Tables cramped together with red checkered table clothes on them, each one with a pizza tray holder. We finally got in and were placed in a prime position on the aisle right in the middle of the place. Every table was packed with fello pizza lovers. It was a euphoria of cheese and sauce and everyone was in orgasmic bliss! Had a great view of the pizzas being made. A view of the alter so to speak. Ordered a regular large pie, Pelligrino water, and a Brooklyn lager. Just going basic for this first time.The pizza here is the real deal. Freshly made in a charcoal oven, thin crust, burnt edges, gooey cheese, almost no grease, tasty tomato sauce, cooked just right. After waiting on line for so long I wanted to take my time and savor each delectable slice. And so I did. Slice by slice. Bite by bite. Yes, it was just as good as you heard about. I wanted to order another pie but figured I will wait until next time and get some different toppings to try, as the pepperoni and sausage pie next to us was calling me ever so softly.Service here is minimal, but gets the job done as that is fine by me. Polite and attentive when needed. Just get me a beer and a pizza and leave me alone to enjoy. No slices, cash only, and take out line is same as line to be seated so be forewarned. Manager was nice enough to come by and ask if we enjoyed our meal, so that is a plus in my book. Was this the greatest pizza I ever had? No, it was not, but is close to being one of the best. It was very good. I also think it is better then Lombardi's which I feel is way over rated. Totonno's, Nicks, Patsy's and Grimaldi's are in my top tier.    Tip - they clean the ovens and resupply coal between 5-7 so wait time can be longer during these hours.",4.0
The plain pizza is hands down the best item on the menu. Super good and fresh and flavorful. Easily the best pizza I have ever had. I've tried it with chicken as well but nothing beats the plain pizza. The cannoli was also massive and oh so good not to mention those tiny chocolate covered ice cream balls. I had to take a star off because the service was horribllle. Our waiter disappeared and would not come back for ages or ask if we needed anything. The manager is such a sweet guy. If only the staff adopted his attitude as well,4.0

"I'm not sure what the hype is about. The pizza here isn't bad, but it's not good enough to rate this place a ""New York institution"". I'll take Joe's Pizza over this any day. The first clue should be the large number of tourists here!",3.0
"Stopped in for lunch with a co-worker since we were in the area.  I had never been here but she had on a few occasions and was a big fan.  It's a big establishment with seating upstairs and downstairs.  We ordered a large cheese pizza.  The pizza is thin crust so it's easy to eat 4 slices no problem.  The sauce is ok and the cheese is fresh mozzarella.  Overall, it's tasty but not the best I've ever had.  The price of $14 for a large plain pizza was a bargain in my book.  The pizza came out fast so if you're on you're lunch hour, you should be ok.   The price for a soda was $3.  NYC pricing I guess and my soda was flat.  The service we had wasn't friendly or warm but it was acceptable.    I will be back.",4.0
Grimaldi's is absolutely delicious New York brick oven pizza !!!!!It's worth the wait and is a fun place to bring out of town guests for that true New York experience.  Their sausage is made with just the right mix of spices and shouldn't be missed.,5.0
"All I could say is if your lookin for pizza in Brooklyn I recommend this place. It's a tourist spot for people craving for NY pizza! Expect long lines and long wait time they also take long cooking your pizza because it's cooked old style brick and coal. But it's worth it for the experience. When you walk inside it's smells like coal mixed with pizza smell it's not that typical smell you would get from other pizza places. The servers are all happy dancing to the beat of whatever music there playing 80's type of music. The desert was so good especially the cannoli. Stop by and try it for first timers, you will not regret the wait!",4.0
"Finally, i took the pilgrimage to Grimaldi's after many tries. The line was expected so i didn't fault them for it. Plus taking a trip down to the dock and getting ice cream made the wait seem shorter. And once we finally reached the entrance, the hostess was extremely nice and apologized many, many times for the inconvenience. For new york coal pizza, i always compare it to my favorite, Lombardi's. And no doubt, it is up to par with the fresh mozzarella and basil. The peperoni was good but unlike Lombardi's, the experience was forgettable. The place was dirty and our table was not wiped down from the previous patrons. The prices were extremely fair ($6 less than Lombardis) but the menu only contains pizza or antipasto, nothing else food wise. The pizza came out within 5 minutes but half the slices' crust came out burnt. The unburnt slices were great and were not greasy. Some members of our party had committed blasphemy and stated that they liked Grimald's better than Lombardis. I respect their opinion and could see why they would, but Lombardis adds so much to the experience including salad on their menu. Grimaldi's is a place to definitely try because you might think this is your favorite pizzeria in NYC, and i hate when people say Grimald's is hands down the best pizza or Johns or Lombardi's or Joe's because they are all great and comparable to one another, there is no clear favorite, just a slight preference. My recommendation to grimaldis is to increase the price of the pizza by a dollar and save that money to renovate and buy the unnecessary store next to you to expand",3.0
"Very short wait in line to get in and served very promptly and it was a Friday evening. Pizza was very good, classic Brooklyn brick oven. Had an antipasto and large white with regatta cheese and whole tomatoes and two sodas for less than $40. After we ate we took a nice walk along the river in the Brooklyn Bridge park which is only a block away. Worth the trip.",4.0
"I never knew what good pizza was until I had Grimaldi's.  The BEST pizza I've ever had!  Fresh ingredients, tasty, not overly salty, just delicious!  Don't miss this if you're in Brooklyn!",5.0
"Why am I waiting here on this long line? Feet hurt, getting dark and cold out, looking like a fool tourist. Real New Yorkers don't wait on line for touristy things - its embarrassing! Persevere I must to experience this mecca of mozzerella. Now, I know full well that there is always a line here, but since we just walked across the Brooklyn Bridge it was a must destination stop. Sucked it up and got on line. The manager would come out every few minutes to get a head count and keep the line moving. It is kind of funny how we all secretly count everyone walking out and wish they would move their asses and hurry up in there! Sit down, eat your pizza, get up, go!Inside the place is small and has many pictures of Sinatra and other celebrities on the walls.

"I lived in Brooklyn all my life. I'm a pizza type of gal! Grimaldi's is over hyped and over rated!

"This has got to be, hands down, the best pizza place ever!I am a huge pizza buff, but I have no idea what Grimaldi's trick is because I have never had better pizza. It must be the cheese, but when I asked the person that speedily lines the cheese up on the dough, he told me it was just mozzarella. I swore he was lying, so next I asked the person manning the brick over. He said it was mozzarella too. Jeez... this mozzarella is super gourmet and magically delicious. I have no idea how to describe it, but they have got this recipe perfected beyond imagination. Try the standard margarita and the white pizza without the toppings and you'll see that this is the real deal. That is how I usually measure the difference between pizza-serving restaurants, because I know that toppings will certainly make it better. You got to judge by the staple ingredients.I've been to Grimaldi's many times, each time with a huge wait because it's just that worth it. I've even forced my parents to wait in line with me in the freezing winter because I wanted to show them a whole new world. The good thing is that within the past year, this place has moved down to the end of the block and occupied a larger space so that more people can fit.Please... do yourself a favor and eat at Grimaldi's.",5.0
"This was the first pizza place I came to when visiting New York a few weeks ago and it definitely did not disappoint. It wasn't the best pizza that I had in New York, but it's worth a trip since it's almost a landmark pizza joint.The crust was nice and thin, sticking to the traditional New York style. The sauce was good but a little bit too sweet for my liking. The cheese was fresh and delicious! Nothing kills the taste of pizza faster than overly processed cheese :/ . I just wanted a few more herbs in the sauce and this pizza would've been perfect for me, but then again, if you're into very simple flavors then this should tickle your fancy! Hah weird saying... Anyway don't get me wrong, I do enjoy simplicity in my food, but this needed just something... Oregano maybe?The place is nice and clean and the service here was awesome! Even the prices are extremely affordable.",4.0
"So, I'm having trouble giving this place the three-star rating that I am. Based on the hype (and Yelp reviews), Grimaldi's is supposed to be a New York pizza institution (pizzatution?), a mind-blowing cut above the rest. What I tasted here, however, did not impart that gust to my brain. Went last night at around 7pm, and didn't have to wait in line (score). However, we did have to wait a good amount for the pizza itself, which was slightly irritating, but a good sign that it was made fresh to order. My friend and I just got a plain, regular pizza with red sauce, in the ""small"" size (which is, in fact, more than large enough for two). It was good, and obviously made with quality ingredients, but I think there was something off about the cooking procedure...the crust was too chewy, the basil was burnt, and the cheese was rubbery and stringy. It also got cold pretty quickly, which is likely a factor of it being thin crust, and the cold weather outside. All in all, it could've benefitted from less time in the oven, and probably also less time on the pizza pan (our fault).Being as it is very fresh and affordable ($12 for a small and $14 for a large), I'm willing to give Grimaldi's another chance, someday. It might not be for a while, though, as I think there's better pizza to be had in New York City.PS: CASH ONLY",3.0
"Danny loves pizza. He eats, lives and breath pizza - he wouldn't probably even marry it if he could so this place was on out ""must go to"" list when in New York after reading about it on yelp!Pros:- cooked in coal brick oven - pepperoni, sausage and jalapeno  - flavorful - each bit was so amazing- great crustCons:- Cash only- gets really cold if you are sitting downstairs near a window - poor service- no beer! Helpful:- small regular pizza (feeds 1-2 people) $12- large regular pizza (feed 3-4) $14- toppings: $3 eachOverall:4 stars. It wouldn't have been a New York trip if we missed out on Grimaldi. After walking in the snow in 20 degree weather, I was ecstatic to see the Brooklynn Bridge. I was even more ecstatic when I saw Grimaldi right underneath (how convenient!) When we got there there was like 3 parties right at the door. It was very confusing because i had no idea whether I was suppose to go inside to put my name down or what. I then walked instead and the guy (I am assuming the manager) starts yelling for us to stand outside. I told him that we are here for two and just confirming on the process. He responded by saying ""yeah, i know two. now stand outside"" That kind of caught me off guard a bit but didn't stop me! Got in line and thank goodness was only in it for no longer than 10 minutes. We got seated by a window table in the far back. When we were waiting for our food, our area got extremely cold (maybe around 30 degrees) which kind of made it difficult to eat/wait. The couple next to us complained, but the manager said it was ""just them"" and moved them elsewhere. As we were waiting, the line outside grew and grew. If I was waiting more than an hour outside, and got seated instead (in the cold) i wouldn't have been happy. Anyhoo, we ordered a large pepperoni, sausage and jalapeno between two people and devoured every last bite. I asked Danny if this was his favorite, and he stated that he has had better but it was still really good and tasteful. I guess it really depends on what type of pizza mood you are in! Overall, great experience, glad we tried it and would go back again if we were in New York.",4.0
I hate to be a harsh critic but I honestly do know see what all the hype is about. I expected greatness from Grimaldi's and it certainly under delivered. I've honestly had better frozen pizza.

But honestly, and I'm not the only one who thinks so, the pizza, the thing u actually come here and wait for, is pretty whack. I'm not picky about pizza and even I could tell it sucked. The sauce has zero depth, tastes like a can of tomato paste, and the cheese is just plopped on in blocks, barely melted and definitely not cooked in. The service here is also so awful. I mean I know they're trying to be quick in and out but we were completely ignored. When asking a waiter if he could snap a quick pic for us his literal response was ""I CANNOT"" said loudly, while walking away and never even looked us in the face. When asking for the check we waited for about 15 min (which u would think they would hurry this along considering the absurd line outside). Lucky for them my friends wanted to be honest, good people and left the appropriate amount with a crappy tip. I was so pissed at the service, the food, the wait, the hype, everything I wanted to dine and dash! Not really, but in theory, hell yes. This review won't do anything and ppl will continue to wait for ""the ny pizza experience"" but ugh, so, unbelievably, not worth it.",1.0
"Pizza cannot get any better, their ingredients are so fresh! Thin crust that has a nice chewy bite to it but crispy on the outside and ends. Lots of tasty gooey cheeseGreat options for toppingsNot greasy at all, and the flavors the come from cooking it in the brick oven are deliciousssssBeing a west coaster, good pizza is hard to come by (obviously). This place takes the cake and the fact that its located right under the Brooklyn Bridge is an added bonus! You can go for a stroll on the bridge to walk it off after!",5.0
"The first time I ate at Grimaldi's was about 12 (or so) years ago. The second was this past Friday.  When we arrived, I was a bit confused...I initially walked to the wrong place and in my memory, it was a smaller place.  So, a little reseach and I learned they had moved to the new location (just next door to the old) a few years ago.At least the pizza fit my memory perfectly!  It was amazing.  The table beside us recieved their pizza just as we sat down.  The guy said to the waiter ""wait....we ordered a small...this can't be a small.""  The waiter turned and said ""yep...everything's bigger in New York!"".  It was a good chuckle.We ordered the pepporoni and mushroom pizza (small, of course), and couldn't finish it all.  It was amazing though.  The fresh basil was a nice touch.Yes, it's cash only, but worth it!",5.0
45 minute wait on a sunday night for dinner (whether you're ordering in/out)!is it just hype OR is Grimaldi's thin crust pizza worthy of brooklyn? locals might say it's a tourist trap BUT i do think the WHITE PIZZA is worth some mention! (although i wouldn't wait a full 45 minutes for it)---white pizza w/ mushrooms & olives: LOVE the CHEWY sliced mozzarella & slightly charred crust!!! however the olives were a bit too salty... MMMmm! sad that most people probably stick to the tomato sauce pizza---tomato sauce pizza w/ sausage & pepperoni: not bad but nothing speciala small pizza has 6 slices VS a large has 8!NOTE: you pay per extra topping & its CASH ONLY,4.0
"This place always has a line of poor gypsies outside waiting to eat here. Tonight i decided to be a gypsy and finally try it. What a load of garbage. I mean cold, not fully cooked pizza. No joke, elliots frozen pizza is ten times better. May i also point out, if you like thin crust, proportioned amounts of cheese and tomato and bread, you will have a better time at 2 Bros Pizza. Just the fact that it was uncooked is disgusting. This place es una porqueria, y puedem meter la pizza en mi culo.",1.0
"I don't think this review will be much for anyone who reads this. I've been there twice, the service is absolutely terrible. Since this is a potentially mafia owned place, I don't think they give a damn about serving people, the waiters were rather standing chitchatting. For sake of the taste of the pizza, I'm so generously offer a two star",2.0
"I'm a life-long New Yorker and know my pizza. For some reason, I see a lot of whiny out-of-towners bitching and moaning about ""customer service"" and the wait times. Suck it up, buttercup! You're in New York - if you want froo-froo nice, go back to Cali or wherever you came from.Grimaldi's is old-school, just the way I like it. Yeah, it's touristy, and yeah, you've got to wait a little, big deal. But the pizza is KILLER! As many times as I've been there, it has never failed to impress me. Love. It. The fresh local mozzarella, the sauce, the crust - awesome. Go there. Wait in line. Gorge on the pizza and then walk it off on the Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan.

"Loved the pizza even though you pay per topping, limits the possibilities.  A male friend and I shared the smallest pizza with pepperoni as our topping and even had leftovers.Our waiter was very inattentive, never got our water filled, he never came to the table and it wasn't even a packed house.

The place itself looks a run down. A paint job is needed. Also, where they placed us in the back we had to deal with flies! What attracts flies?

There 100s of places where you will find more tasteful pizzas. I was dissapointed to say the least. It was bland and the toppings kept sliding off which indicates that the pizza is too oily and probably low grade oil.

We got there around 5:30 and there was already a line out the door. I dropped her off to find parking and circled around and around in traffic trying to find parking and increasingly got infuriated and convinced that this better be the best freakin' pizza in the universe.It wasn't.Yes, the chunks of mozzarella cheese is nice but was it worth it? Definitely not. I like my pizza saucy and cheesy and this was neither. Just a few basil leaves here and there and I felt so unimpressed. They owe me gas and parking money.",2.0
"The pizza is average. It's good, but nothing special. 20 bucks for a small and two toppings. Classic wood fire pizza. The service isn't very good either. Only 1 water refill even though I asked for more. I would choose another pizza spot if you head to Brooklyn.",3.0
"If Grimaldi's weren't scenically located by the waterfront, it would be a tourist trap. As it is, it's a tourist trap by the docks. The wait for my group of 7 was probably about 30 minutes, not intolerable if you're with friends. It's mostly frequented by tourists who surely hop back on the GrayLine bus satisfied by the admittedly well-done thin crust pies. More on this now: the crust is chewy and well done, but not burnt (our 3 pies were pretty consistent). I can't verify if the tomato sauce is made from San Marzano tomatoes by taste alone, but I thought it was at least adequate though probably tapped from cans. Gobs of gooey cheese sprinkled with a bit of seasoning completes the margherita pie. The toppings they have are good, but excluding Southern Italian staples like artichokes keeps Grimaldi's squarely in the traditional New York pizza bracket.The guys here are mildly cheeky and old-school, fluent in the expected Brooklyn paisano-speak tourists crave. However, this does not excuse, for instance, bringing us the wrong carafe of wine, never bringing the antipasti, and subsequently charging us for the undelivered dish. Sorry guys, even popular places can't get by on reputation alone.On pizza quality, Grimaldi's outshines the even more touristy Lombardi's, matches Totonno's, but for me falls short of the no-nonsense, no-pretense experience at John's on Bleecker (same simple offerings, same great quality, but more neighborhood-specific character).",3.0

We got a mushroom and sausage pizza, which was pretty tasty in how fresh it was but also a little bland for my taste. I also thought the dough was not cooked all the way through or maybe too thin in the middle of the pizza. The crust was really good. I thought that 2 slices was definitely enough to make me full.

"Wow. Some of the best pizza I've ever had in my life. The crust is crispy on bottom and soft in the middle, balanced perfectly.

We thought about heading there but we decided to wait it out and I'm so glad we did. Once inside we got our table and our order was taken so quickly. We ordered a small ham, mushroom and garlic pizza, and trust me a small is by far enough for 2 people. It came within about 15 minutes and we literally devoured it. The staff in here were really efficient, the drinks and the food came so quickly, and the prices are great considering how much food you actually get.

"Best NY style pizza? I don't know, after waiting about 2 hours for this pizza I really don't think it's really worth all that waiting. We ordered a pizza with just sausage on top of their traditional pizza-they have a white pizza option as well but we went with the more traditional kind. The mozzarella was fresh, and you could taste the difference and the basil also was fresh and pungent but there wasn't a lot of it and it was focused on the center of the pizza. The sausage was just all right, I thought it would be a spicy Italian sausage but it didn't really carry too much flavor on its own. The pizza though was pretty good, but the overall experience was just okay.",3.0

"Best NY style pizza? I don't know, after waiting about 2 hours for this pizza I really don't think it's really worth all that waiting. We ordered a pizza with just sausage on top of their traditional pizza-they have a white pizza option as well but we went with the more traditional kind. The mozzarella was fresh, and you could taste the difference and the basil also was fresh and pungent but there wasn't a lot of it and it was focused on the center of the pizza. The sausage was just all right, I thought it would be a spicy Italian sausage but it didn't really carry too much flavor on its own. The pizza though was pretty good, but the overall experience was just okay.",3.0
"REALLY disappointed! I've driven by loads of times and seen the lines, so I had to see what the hype was all about. I've lived in NY my entire life and had more than my share of pizza. Grimaldi's was very much below average. Soggy crust, absolutely tasteless sauce, rubbery cheese. Overall, a serious disappointment. I'm going to assume that most of the folks waiting in line are tourists. Very sad that they will come away thinking that Grimaldi's is NYC's best pizza.",2.0

"Not that I intend to create a dent on the 3000+ reviews, but as it turns out with many famed places, it's just the brand name that makes a place popular. We had a half-half white and regular pizzas which were good, nothing to rave about. We had to wait in a queue at around 9-10 pm on a Saturday, but it moved at a decent pace and didn't see one when we were done. It took some time to place our order, and the place doesn't offer liquor which was a bit of a downer for us.",3.0
"LINES!!!!!!  But, don't be TOO discouraged because it does move rather quick and it's worth the wait!  The pizza is DELICIOUS!I'm from SF so normally the pizza crust is rather fluffy and very filling.  these pizzas are made with very thin crust so what is one SF pizza slice = 2 NY slices just because you don't have all the bread expanding in your belly.  Don't be intimidated by ordering a LARGE PIZZA.we came at 10:15pm and it's hard to believe but there was still a line of people half way down the block.  i was initially put off by the idea of waiting for a pizza but we actually got seated rather quickly since there was only 2 of us.  there's a lot of large groups so the host will walk down the line picking and choosing who is up next to try their savory slices of pizza.we were debating between the medium and large and looking around all tables including 2 ordered large so we thought WHY NOT.  let me tell you.... you will be STUFFED but you will enjoy every single bite.  If you're from SF, don't be intimidated!  I have a pretty small stomach and we only had one slice of pizza left.we ordered half and half of margarita and sausage mushroom.  the crust is thin, the cheesy is oozing and gooey, the sauce completes the entire meal.  add a drink to your pizza and total out the door for two people is under $30 including tip!  AMAZING!My only hesitation going back is those lines.  Not sure about that....",4.0

"My friends and I completed a four pizzeria bike tour in Brooklyn this past summer.  We met under the Brooklyn Bridge at Grimaldis, and then rode our bikes to Di Fara, Totonnos, and then L & B Spumoni Gardens.  Grimaldi's was the first stop, and it did not disappoint. I have heard from a lot of people that Grimaldi's is overrated and not worth the wait.  I disagree.  I think its reputation as a solid choice for NY to pizza is an accurate one, and I enjoyed the plain pie I had from the shop.  The line was a bit long, but it moved quickly.  I tried to call in my to-go order (which I know you can secretly do), but they did not pick up the phone. All in all, it took under an hour to get the pizza.  What I liked about the pie was the quality of the cheese, the ratio of sauce to cheese, and the crust--it was cripsy but not overdone.  I think tourists should make the journey and locals should continue to eat it, at least until Juliana's opens next door...",4.0
"Grimaldi's serves up tasty coal-fired pizza, but I'll be honest, I don't think it's worth the hype.  And the service definitely needs improving.We originally set out with alternate lunch plans, but came down to Grimaldi's when they didn't pan out as intended.  The line wasn't too bad - just to the end of the building - which by the way, has relocated to the corner storefront.After about a 25 minute wait, we were seated in the far corner of the upstairs dining room.  It took forever to be acknowledged by a server (after several parties seated after us had already placed their orders and received their drinks), but we were ready with our order when he finally came over.  We opted for a large ""regular"" pie with pepperoni and fresh garlic.  The ""regular"" only means that your pie is made with tomato sauce, rather than a white pizza (sans sauce).  Our drinks were essentially slammed on the table in front of us, which I didn't really understand, and it was definitely a challenge to order a second round.The pie didn't take too long to make it to our table.  The crust was perfect - not too crispy, but not too chewy.  The toppings were relatively well-placed, and the flavor was great.  The large pie was the exact right amount of pizza for our hungry group of 3 (including one bird-like eater).  For larger groups and/or heartier eaters, a second pie is a necessity.The pizza itself is the only reason Grimaldi's gets 4 stars from me.  The service makes me want to give 2.5-stars, max.  I understand the place is busy, but Grimaldi's is making money hand-over-fist (and all cash, at that!), so hire a couple more servers (or give them some customer-service training) so your patrons can have a pleasant dining experience, and be eager to return!  Our server's slamming the drinks on our table without any regard to who ordered what really bothered me, as did the fact that quite a few other tables in our general vicinity were treated with a helluva lot more courtesy.",4.0
"I do want to give this place another shot since there seems to be so much hype around the pizza here! I took some friends that were visiting NYC here since I heard it was the best pizza in NYC.

I liked the plain pizza more but I wasn't all that into either pizza. I thought the crust was a little soft and didn't have much of a crisp (I would pick up my slice of pizza and the front would pretty much droop down).

"Grimaldis has doled out award winning pizza for decades. No question their secrets are a time-tested procedure and a brick oven. The new location has definitely eliminated a lot of the cons that the old location had--cramped elbow-to-elbow room and dim & dreary lighting--but it also felt like it lost a piece of who it was: a poorly-light, true Brooklyn Pizzeria. Nonetheless, we can't complain because the pizza is as true as it gets. The prize here is the tomato sauce -- so unbelievable sweet and chunky. If there is anything better than fresh buffalo mozzarella spotted-ly placed atop--it's the tomato sauce. The crust is thin, crunchy and sporadically blackened, there's no question that the ingredients convey the highest of quality at Grimaldi's. I only wish they were a little more free with the basil, as our pizza only had one measly leaf. I recommend ordering extra basil--however I remember the pies I received back then were plentiful with basil--perhaps another inconsistency with this new location. I can't say this is the best pizza in NYC, but Grimaldis has definitely held its own all these years.",4.0

"Meh.On a late summer *ahem - it was HOT* Saturday afternoon, waited over 45 minutes just to get in the door & get a table.  Our table was upstairs.  The a/c was broken.  *cries*We also were let in about halfway through that evening hour where they refresh the oven.  So we were starving before we ever arrived & lost about 2 pounds each as our stomachs cannabalized themselves.We ordered our pizza (pepperoni & sausage) when the oven was ready (the waiter would not take orders before it was).  We probably waited another 30mins for the pizza.  (Pizzas are sold whole only, btw; NO  individual slices are sold.)At this point it's been, like, 2 hours since we were hungry.  By the time the pizza came, we were on the other side of STARVING.  STARVING!!!!  Oh my goodness!The pizzas arrived upstairs piping h-o-double-t.  I was ready.  I was fully prepared to slide off of my chair from the deliciousness.  I was poised to faint from the sheer delectability that had been placed in front of me.  I'd read the reviews, I'd heard the chatter of the folks in line, I'd seen the satisfied faces of those who left.  I WAS READY!Bite 1.  *no angels singing*Bite 2.  *no seven swams a swimming*Bites 3-6.  *NOOOO GOLDEN RINGS*I'd been misled.  I'd been lied to.  I had been knocked unconscious and hypnotized awake to believe that Grimaldi's was the best pizza Brooklyn - NY, even - had to offer.I was mad and I want everybody to know it!All that hype.  All that time on my poor aching feet after a walk through the city and across the bridge.  For this.  For Grimaldi's.The cheese was chewy, not stringy, not melty.  The sauce was the best thing on the pizza.  Not too sweet, bursting with tomato flavor.  The pepperoni was oily - oil was flying everywhere.  The sausage is placed raw on the pizza and then ""cooked"" on the pizza in the oven (but some of my pieces were still raw).  Where the heck was the crispness to my mothereffing crust?!Two hours of hunger.  Review after review after review of hype.  Step after step after step on the Brooklyn Bridge, many of the last hundred taken with surety that I was about to indulge in some of the best pizza around.All for nothing.Thanks, Grimaldi's.  Thanks for nothing.2 stars for ambience, excitement, being able to watch the pizzas being made & the comraderie with other tourists.",2.0

"It's like going to DMV, you know there will be a line, high prospects for low-patience (indoor)waiters and frustrated (outdoor)line-waiters (hey-o). You do this process once every 10 years to validate you still live in NYC, than as you go past over the subsequent years, you marvel how anyone not from Detroit could wait in line so often and you say, glad I got my pie taken care of! Any misplacement of NYC pizza dignity card, I recommend visiting an express DMV station like Lombardy's in Soho. Different but equally as delicious.",4.0
If I lived in Brooklyn I would totally get more stuff here. It is such a great place and such a great pizza. i like a get a whole pie to myself ad then stuffing as much as i can in my mouth. After that I take the rest to stuff in my fridge for break fast. I am totally into food like this. It is not such a difficult place to get to from jersey.,4.0
"Great pizza!!! Need I say more... Reason it's not a 5 starts, they don't serve alcohol (beers with a pizza just does it for me)! By the way the restaurant has such a great back story... Read the plaque on the outside!",4.0
"Arrived at 12PM and a line was already forming outside. Wait time was originally 1 hour, but was shortened to 30 minutes since people gave up and left. Restaurant itself is of a decent size, but tables are side by side, as if you were dining with the people sitting next to you; definitely a bit cramped. The boyfriend and I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and olives. The olives were definitely a no-go, they were super salty, to the point where its becomes bitter. We eventually picked them off since it was unbearable! Aside from that, the pizza was really good.Staff was nice, but in a rushy way.",3.0
"Grimaldis has doled out award winning pizza for decades. No question their secrets are a time-tested procedure and a brick oven. The new location has definitely eliminated a lot of the cons that the old location had--cramped elbow-to-elbow room and dim & dreary lighting--but it also felt like it lost a piece of who it was: a poorly-light, true Brooklyn Pizzeria. Nonetheless, we can't complain because the pizza is as true as it gets. The prize here is the tomato sauce -- so unbelievable sweet and chunky. If there is anything better than fresh buffalo mozzarella spotted-ly placed atop--it's the tomato sauce. The crust is thin, crunchy and sporadically blackened, there's no question that the ingredients convey the highest of quality at Grimaldi's. I only wish they were a little more free with the basil, as our pizza only had one measly leaf. I recommend ordering extra basil--however I remember the pies I received back then were plentiful with basil--perhaps another inconsistency with this new location. I can't say this is the best pizza in NYC, but Grimaldis has definitely held its own all these years.",4.0

"Meh.On a late summer *ahem - it was HOT* Saturday afternoon, waited over 45 minutes just to get in the door & get a table.  Our table was upstairs.  The a/c was broken.  *cries*We also were let in about halfway through that evening hour where they refresh the oven.  So we were starving before we ever arrived & lost about 2 pounds each as our stomachs cannabalized themselves.We ordered our pizza (pepperoni & sausage) when the oven was ready (the waiter would not take orders before it was).  We probably waited another 30mins for the pizza.  (Pizzas are sold whole only, btw; NO  individual slices are sold.)At this point it's been, like, 2 hours since we were hungry.  By the time the pizza came, we were on the other side of STARVING.  STARVING!!!!  Oh my goodness!The pizzas arrived upstairs piping h-o-double-t.  I was ready.  I was fully prepared to slide off of my chair from the deliciousness.  I was poised to faint from the sheer delectability that had been placed in front of me.  I'd read the reviews, I'd heard the chatter of the folks in line, I'd seen the satisfied faces of those who left.  I WAS READY!Bite 1.  *no angels singing*Bite 2.  *no seven swams a swimming*Bites 3-6.  *NOOOO GOLDEN RINGS*I'd been misled.  I'd been lied to.  I had been knocked unconscious and hypnotized awake to believe that Grimaldi's was the best pizza Brooklyn - NY, even - had to offer.I was mad and I want everybody to know it!All that hype.  All that time on my poor aching feet after a walk through the city and across the bridge.  For this.  For Grimaldi's.The cheese was chewy, not stringy, not melty.  The sauce was the best thing on the pizza.  Not too sweet, bursting with tomato flavor.  The pepperoni was oily - oil was flying everywhere.  The sausage is placed raw on the pizza and then ""cooked"" on the pizza in the oven (but some of my pieces were still raw).  Where the heck was the crispness to my mothereffing crust?!Two hours of hunger.  Review after review after review of hype.  Step after step after step on the Brooklyn Bridge, many of the last hundred taken with surety that I was about to indulge in some of the best pizza around.All for nothing.Thanks, Grimaldi's.  Thanks for nothing.2 stars for ambience, excitement, being able to watch the pizzas being made & the comraderie with other tourists.",2.0
"I've dreamt about coming to this place ever since it was featured on pizza paradise.  Well it's not worth the hype.  Too light on the sauce and definatly light on the meat.  I was really wanting to be wowed but wasn't.  The service was ok not great.  Came from a long way, and as they the journey is more fun then the destination.",2.0

"Had to get a taste of New York style pizza, after all, that's what you're known for right? I was depending on Yelp to steer me to a pizzeria that is rated highly with alot of reviews; boy, I wasn't disappointed... First of all, I EXPECTED A LONG LINE and planned accordingly; besides, it helps if you're flexible and can make it down here at around 500pm before the line gets really long. There were only about 6-10 people in front of us, the two of us were seated after about a 5 minute wait partially because the people in front of us weren't ready because they were expecting the rest of their party. We didn't have a problem with the owner, he was nice to us; of course we weren't irate to begin with because we were waiting for an hour either... That said, the place on the inside is very casual, crowded, and even a bit tight. I found out later that the line in back isn't necessarily for take out; it's for the unisex bathroom. The place seems, well, traditional and historic... We split a 16"" pizza, a six slicer, with sausage, mushrooms, roasted bell peppers, and garlic.

"I wound up here after walking over the BK Bridge.  My friend suggested I stop by.  Luckily I came 15 minutes before it was to open (11:45am on the Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend).  The best time to come is at least a half hour before it opens to avoid the longest lines.  When I arrived I couldn't believe there was a line for a pizza shop!  As I was waiting I went onto Yelp on my phone to take a look at the reviews to see if it warranted my waiting on line, lol.  Everything looked good so I stayed on line and it ""only"" took an hour to be seated which is great considering the wait times I have heard.It's a nice sized place.  I guess the line IS warranted considering all the people they have to shuttle in and out (and they don't rush you which is nice).  My server was nice, cute and attentive considering all the tables he had.  They only take cash and they don't serve individual slices so I wound up leaving with the rest of my 4 out of 6 slice (small) pie to take home.  By the way, even if you want take out, you STILL have to wait on that line.  The pizza was good and reminded me of the pizza I had as a child at local pizza shops (before I got into Dominoes and Papa Johns!)  My favorite part was the mozzarella!  It was gooey-fantasticness!  (And the pizza tastes great the next day - 4 out of 5 stars for the line).  But this all was a one time deal for me.  I don't do lines like that.  I'm not the one you'll see on a city street camped out waiting to see a celebrity perform!  Next time I want Grimaldi's I will surely be going to the one in LI or Chelsea.",4.0

"The pizza here is pretty dank! Came here with 4 other fiends and we waited in line for about 30 minutes for pizza.

One was with garlic and mushroom and the other with italian sausage. Each regular large pizza is $14 and each topping ranges fro $2-$4. Most of them are $2. Both pizzas were very good. Theres extra pepper, cheese, and garlic at each table if people want to add extra. Each of us got about 3-4 slices. Pretty good. We ended up paying about $8.50 each for lunch. What a steal. They are thin sliced pizzas. They do not serve by the slice and accept cash only. It's good for parties no more than 8 though. The service is great.

"This pizzeria has been standing under the Brooklyn bridge and serving NYC's ""must have"" pizza for years. Yes, the line was humongous. Yes, it was worth it. Yes, the dough was spectacular (and perhaps it was Brooklyn's ""water"" after all). But would I do it again? Not unless I was taking a friend for the first time. Or unless the weather was slightly more forgiving. We ordered: a large regular pizza with chicken, jalapeños, and mushrooms.",4.0
"Met up with a couple friends to stop by Grimaldi's for some of their famous pizza. We lined up before they opened, but still had to wait in line for 45 minutes to get a table. Right before we were to be seated, we indirectly had an unfortunate experience with one of the servers. While he was impatiently trying to get everyone in line to step off the main steps, he made a callous racial comment to the party in front of us which I personally felt offended by. While I try to base my ratings solely on food and service, this was one detail I couldn't overlook.After being seated, we ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. While waiting for the food, we walked around the place, partly because the walls had some interesting pictures, partly because it was extremely hot and stuffy at our corner table. About 15 minutes later, our pizza came and we chowed down. My favorite parts of the pizza were definitely the sausage and the cheese. The sausage was very tasty, fresh, and thankfully not too salty. The cheese had the perfect consistency between stringy and hearty. I also appreciated the thin crust, crispy and not too hard.We ordered a second pizza once we realized one wasn't enough and decided to go with the sausage again. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, our server didn't stop by our table again without being asked for. I had to ask for my water to be refilled 4 times and we had to try and get the server's attention for almost 5 minutes when ordering the second pie.Overall, it was a definitely something checked off the tourist list but nothing more.

"The pizza here is pretty dank! Came here with 4 other fiends and we waited in line for about 30 minutes for pizza. It is a pretty big place and if there is always a wait outside then it must be good. Between 5 of us, we got 2 large regular pizzas. One was with garlic and mushroom and the other with italian sausage. Each regular large pizza is $14 and each topping ranges fro $2-$4. Most of them are $2. Both pizzas were very good. Theres extra pepper, cheese, and garlic at each table if people want to add extra. Each of us got about 3-4 slices. Pretty good. We ended up paying about $8.50 each for lunch. What a steal. They are thin sliced pizzas. They do not serve by the slice and accept cash only. It's good for parties no more than 8 though. The service is great. People are always checking to make sure you have water and everything you need. I don't know if I will be back, but was worth the wait. At least must try once.",4.0
"After the line we saw outside this place one evening, I thought it would be pretty amazing. I went for lunch and did not have to wait to be seated which was nice. We got a large cheese pizza for $14. We decided the prices for toppings was not worth it. It fed 3 people and was okay, but nothing impressive. Our waiter was kind of neglectful, which irritated me. I was drinking other peoples water. And they only take cash which is annoying. There was a tiny pizza shop with $1 slices that was better than this place.",3.0

It wasn't covering the whole pizza so you'd have spots where it was just tomato sauce but it honestly was a perfect cheese/sauce ratio. My only complaint is the crust.

Sooo...this may be an unpopular opinion, but bear with me--Grimaldi's in its current location isn't even a tenth as good as the pizza they made in their original location (now Juliana's). I've heard that it's due to the unceremonious ouster several years ago of the OG of pizza, Patsy Grimaldi. Seriously, the current version pales in comparison to what they once were.

"BEST. PIZZA. EVER. We knew we would be walking around the Brooklyn bridge around mid-day, so we wanted something near for lunch.  Grimaldi's had popped up when I did a search of food places nearby, so we figured we'd give it a shot. It is a beautiful building on the corner, with lots of smiling faces exiting the doors with take outs and leftovers. When we saw there was a line, I ended up waiting while my friend went to shoot photos down by the water.  The wait wasn't bad, about 15 minutes around lunch time. It was quite warm outside, being that it was mid-day during summer, but there was a tree providing shade for much of the wait. When I got called to go in, my friend was able to walk over from the water, and got there within a couple minutes, so it's convenient for those who like to go wander if they aren't patient enough to wait in line. We were seated on the second floor over-looking the prep/work area, which was great for taking photos. It was fun watching all the pizza's being made, and trying to see if we could spot ours before it was cooked. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because of the service. After being seated, we had to wait 10 minutes before anyone came to get our drink order. Additionally, when we needed refills of water, we would have to go track down our server, who was wandering all over the place.  He had quite the personality, so my amusement was greater than my patience level slightly decresing.We ordered a small pizza, more than enough for 2 people. It came with 6 huge slices, and was $12. Each topping was $2, even if the additional topping(s) is only used on a portion of the pizza.  You can taste the ""fire"" from the coal brick oven on the crust, and the ingredients were so incredibly fresh. Each bite was an explosion of herbs, spices, and the taste of fresh mozzarella.  The crust was nice and crunchy, with the rest of the slice of a softer consistancy, but not soggy. The pizza was so good we ended up coming back again a couple days later for dinner. They do not do individual slices, but the pizzas are so fairly priced, that I didn't even mind buying a whole one.  They are a cash only establishment, so be sure to come with some. I wish we had a place in California that came close to the taste Grimaldi's produces, but I will have to wait until next time I venture out to the east coast!",4.0
"The pizza is pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's more exceptional than any other brick oven pizzeria like John's, 800 Degrees, etc.The owner/manager of this location likes to present himself as some sort of Soprano like figure which is hilarious. They have moved into a bigger location right down the street, which helps the wait time in line, but like I said, I wouldn't wait longer than 10-15mins max for this pizza. Plenty of other equally good options in NYC.Oh yeah, don't get the calzone. It's bad.",3.0
"First time I discovered this place was when I had friends visiting from Minneapolis and they couldn't leave without getting a good slice of NYC pizza. While my friends were able to enjoy the experience in the restaurant, I ended up having the leftovers. My hopstop app failed me and gave me directions to take the R from Jay St. to S.Ferry/Whitehall. Realizing I was in Manhattan and over the bridge instead of under I hopped in a cab. Welp that didn't help me either the cabbie claimed to know where the place was. However, after 35 minutes of driving back and forth across the bridge from BK to Manhattan, he finally said he had no clue and said he was now off-duty and I could ride with him to the Bronx. -_-  Um no thanks. I decided to get out of the cab and meet my friends at the next destination. Nonetheless, even the leftover slices were good and still tasted fresh hours later. My pals had ordered the regular with black olives, mushrooms, and extra basil. I've since gone back twice to eat at the restaurant and I've been lucky enough to avoid the long lines. Trick to beating the long lines: Go on a rainy day, I've done it twice and there were no long lines or wait times. I love how the pizza is made to order and arrives fresh out of the oven. The staff is very friendly. Plus, this $14 bucks for a regular is more than enough for two people to split. Not a bad price at all. A few downfalls, the seating is a bit cramped and they only accept cash. I will warn to bring enough because the ATM in the restaurant has a $4.50 transactions fee! Never seen anything like it lol. Overall, I recommend anyone looking for a good pie to try Grimaldi's.",4.0
"We went on a Monday at 5pm in winter, no line!! We'd heard so many opinions we had to try for ourselves.  My summation, pizza is fine, nothing mind blowing that you can't find at a decent place in manhattan, but it's good. I think the reason it's so popular is simply the location. I don't know that I would wait on line all night for it, but little to no wait in the area I'd return.",3.0
"I don't want to hear another word about Grimaldi's being ""overrated"". This was far and  away the best pizza I've ever had. So good I've had to go back and edit my other pizza reviews accordingly. Sure. I have been eating crap all along, but it still doesn't detract on how great my pizza was. Maybe it's because they gave me the garlic I've been looking for all my life. Punch you in the mouth garlic... I'm going to be smelling you for days garlic... Don't worry, though. There's gum for that.The four of us ordered a half and half. Garlic, sausage, ricotta and plain. If we had ordered all plain, I may not be writing such a rave review. It was pretty good... just not great.  But if you love garlic... Whoa. Just whoa. It's not a tourist trap by any means. 30 bucks to feed 4 people is a pretty sweet deal. Okay. There's a line to get in, but it moves fast and it wasn't too long despite it being such a beautiful spring day. And try to get seated upstairs. It's not nearly as cramped as it looks downstairs.The Cash only, no slice policy isn't a big deal either. There's an ATM, and just buy a whole pie you cheap bastard. It's worth it.",5.0
"My nephew went to Grimaldi and ordered a margherita pizza to go and he waited for his pizza and when it was done they told him they didn't have any pizza boxes!!! Who ever heard of a pizza place, a Famous pizza place that have no pizza boxes!!!  My nephew is disabled and may not look like the ideal patron, so I find this to be discriminatory.  They made him carry the pizza home in a plastic shopping bag.  He saw other customers come out with their pizzas in boxes.  He did not want to argue with the Grimaldi sales person so carried the pizza home in a bag. So if you have a disability Grimaldi's is not the place to go.  The pizza may be good, but leaves a bad taste in your mouth",1.0

"Yelp keeps telling me that my next review awaits. Why Yelp is so insistent that I review Grimaldi's, I have no idea. Have I been? Yes, Yelp, at least a few dozen times. Have I been recently? No, Yelp, not really.For me, there's no reason to go back. The owner's a shyster and quality has slipped every year. The old Italian crank at the front of the house who struts around like a bantam hen is very unpleasant. So, sometimes, are the guys who collect your money in the back when you go to pick up. (And why would you do anything else? Is there any food on earth worth waiting on this sort of line for?)More important, the pizza really isn't that great any more. Not only are there dozens of places around NYC that make pizza this good these days, but the Grimaldi's folks seem pretty actively disinterested in quality maintenance. Even worse for Grimaldi's, the real Grimaldi (Patsy) has taken back his spot and is crushing. Grimaldi's has had to decamp down the block into a location that's been a revolving door of restaurant failure.But don't worry. If this Grimaldi's closes, you won't miss the inconsistent crust (sometimes charred, sometimes mushy). Or the above average sauce. And even if you do, you'll still be able to get your Grimaldi's fix in Douglaston, Manhattan, Coney Island, Hoboken, Hoboken, Garden City, Chandler, Chandler, Gilbert, North Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Peoria, Tucson, Fort Myers, Tampa, Tampa, West Palm Beach, Clearwater, Palm Beach Gardens, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Sparks, Mt. Pleasant, Allen, Grapevine, Katy, Dallas, Dallas, Sugarland, The Woodlands, San Antonio, San Antonio, or Corpus Christi.Yeah, it's really not the same these days. Hope you're glad I did this, Yelp. Because Grimaldi's is fine. But I'd just as soon the guide book crowd keep crowding this joint and leaving a table open at Juliana's for me.",3.0
"I drove to the city with a group of friends for a weekend trip. One friend in particular was searching for highest food-rated places every where we went; Grimadi's was one of them. It was a Sunday right before we were headed back home, and we decide to check it out. While driving past, we notice the line is about 2 blocks long.......... at least. I didn't care to go because I was famished but everyone else was all about it, so I stopped anyway. Call me nice or what?!There was no parking, some shady guy came up to my car and said he was valet. I asked how much and he told me $15.00. Hesitant, I paid. Luckily I ended up getting my car back - hours later.We waited in line for 1.5 hours, timed. And while we were next in line to be served with their heavenly pizza, people behind were going in before us because we had to wait for a table of 5 to open up. We walk in, place is completely swarmed with people. Uncomfortable seating. Eventually, get our food.. expecting to taste nothing else like it, and turned out to be the greatest disappointment. Papa John's over Grimaldi's. I'll never go back there again. I guess other people think differently since they're willing to wait in a crazy line.. But, I saw/tasted nothing fantastic.The experience wasn't even good, it was warm, you get miserable and impatient. It makes you re-think why the hell you're standing in line? Inside wasn't what I expected it to look like. Noisey and crowded. Next time I wait in a 1.5 hour line for pizza, I expect to be carried to my seat within a private room to enjoy my food peacefully.And FYI, you can't order out (per door sign), you MUST stand in line.",1.0
"One word: hype.- Cash only. ATM was broken and took forever to reset which made me extremely uneasy - New location doesn't serve alcohol- possibly due to a pending liquor license?- Prices were reasonable, the pizzas came out fairly quick, and it was a solid pizza pie nevertheless, but it still doesn't justify the wait (which sometimes can be over an hour and blocks deep). - Worth a try if there is no wait.",2.0

It was fun watching all the pizza's being made, and trying to see if we could spot ours before it was cooked. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because of the service. After being seated, we had to wait 10 minutes before anyone came to get our drink order. Additionally, when we needed refills of water, we would have to go track down our server, who was wandering all over the place.  He had quite the personality, so my amusement was greater than my patience level slightly decresing.We ordered a small pizza, more than enough for 2 people. It came with 6 huge slices, and was $12. Each topping was $2, even if the additional topping(s) is only used on a portion of the pizza.  You can taste the ""fire"" from the coal brick oven on the crust, and the ingredients were so incredibly fresh. Each bite was an explosion of herbs, spices, and the taste of fresh mozzarella.  The crust was nice and crunchy, with the rest of the slice of a softer consistancy, but not soggy. The pizza was so good we ended up coming back again a couple days later for dinner. They do not do individual slices, but the pizzas are so fairly priced, that I didn't even mind buying a whole one.  They are a cash only establishment, so be sure to come with some. I wish we had a place in California that came close to the taste Grimaldi's produces, but I will have to wait until next time I venture out to the east coast!",4.0
"The pizza is pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's more exceptional than any other brick oven pizzeria like John's, 800 Degrees, etc.The owner/manager of this location likes to present himself as some sort of Soprano like figure which is hilarious. They have moved into a bigger location right down the street, which helps the wait time in line, but like I said, I wouldn't wait longer than 10-15mins max for this pizza. Plenty of other equally good options in NYC.Oh yeah, don't get the calzone. It's bad.",3.0
"First time I discovered this place was when I had friends visiting from Minneapolis and they couldn't leave without getting a good slice of NYC pizza. While my friends were able to enjoy the experience in the restaurant, I ended up having the leftovers. My hopstop app failed me and gave me directions to take the R from Jay St. to S.Ferry/Whitehall. Realizing I was in Manhattan and over the bridge instead of under I hopped in a cab. Welp that didn't help me either the cabbie claimed to know where the place was. However, after 35 minutes of driving back and forth across the bridge from BK to Manhattan, he finally said he had no clue and said he was now off-duty and I could ride with him to the Bronx. -_-  Um no thanks. I decided to get out of the cab and meet my friends at the next destination. Nonetheless, even the leftover slices were good and still tasted fresh hours later. My pals had ordered the regular with black olives, mushrooms, and extra basil. I've since gone back twice to eat at the restaurant and I've been lucky enough to avoid the long lines. Trick to beating the long lines: Go on a rainy day, I've done it twice and there were no long lines or wait times. I love how the pizza is made to order and arrives fresh out of the oven. The staff is very friendly. Plus, this $14 bucks for a regular is more than enough for two people to split. Not a bad price at all. A few downfalls, the seating is a bit cramped and they only accept cash. I will warn to bring enough because the ATM in the restaurant has a $4.50 transactions fee! Never seen anything like it lol. Overall, I recommend anyone looking for a good pie to try Grimaldi's.",4.0
"We went on a Monday at 5pm in winter, no line!! We'd heard so many opinions we had to try for ourselves.  My summation, pizza is fine, nothing mind blowing that you can't find at a decent place in manhattan, but it's good. I think the reason it's so popular is simply the location. I don't know that I would wait on line all night for it, but little to no wait in the area I'd return.",3.0
"I don't want to hear another word about Grimaldi's being ""overrated"". This was far and  away the best pizza I've ever had. So good I've had to go back and edit my other pizza reviews accordingly. Sure. I have been eating crap all along, but it still doesn't detract on how great my pizza was. Maybe it's because they gave me the garlic I've been looking for all my life. Punch you in the mouth garlic... I'm going to be smelling you for days garlic... Don't worry, though. There's gum for that.The four of us ordered a half and half. Garlic, sausage, ricotta and plain. If we had ordered all plain, I may not be writing such a rave review. It was pretty good... just not great.  But if you love garlic... Whoa. Just whoa. It's not a tourist trap by any means. 30 bucks to feed 4 people is a pretty sweet deal. Okay. There's a line to get in, but it moves fast and it wasn't too long despite it being such a beautiful spring day. And try to get seated upstairs. It's not nearly as cramped as it looks downstairs.The Cash only, no slice policy isn't a big deal either. There's an ATM, and just buy a whole pie you cheap bastard. It's worth it.",5.0
"My nephew went to Grimaldi and ordered a margherita pizza to go and he waited for his pizza and when it was done they told him they didn't have any pizza boxes!!! Who ever heard of a pizza place, a Famous pizza place that have no pizza boxes!!!  My nephew is disabled and may not look like the ideal patron, so I find this to be discriminatory.  They made him carry the pizza home in a plastic shopping bag.  He saw other customers come out with their pizzas in boxes.  He did not want to argue with the Grimaldi sales person so carried the pizza home in a bag. So if you have a disability Grimaldi's is not the place to go.  The pizza may be good, but leaves a bad taste in your mouth",1.0
"Fine. There's no doubt that Juliana's has better pizza, but the vibe here is much more interesting given the extremely weird diner-in-a-diner layout, the larger and louder clientele, and the spooky top-floor bathroom area.",4.0
"Yelp keeps telling me that my next review awaits. Why Yelp is so insistent that I review Grimaldi's, I have no idea. Have I been? Yes, Yelp, at least a few dozen times. Have I been recently? No, Yelp, not really.For me, there's no reason to go back. The owner's a shyster and quality has slipped every year. The old Italian crank at the front of the house who struts around like a bantam hen is very unpleasant. So, sometimes, are the guys who collect your money in the back when you go to pick up. (And why would you do anything else? Is there any food on earth worth waiting on this sort of line for?)More important, the pizza really isn't that great any more. Not only are there dozens of places around NYC that make pizza this good these days, but the Grimaldi's folks seem pretty actively disinterested in quality maintenance. Even worse for Grimaldi's, the real Grimaldi (Patsy) has taken back his spot and is crushing. Grimaldi's has had to decamp down the block into a location that's been a revolving door of restaurant failure.But don't worry. If this Grimaldi's closes, you won't miss the inconsistent crust (sometimes charred, sometimes mushy). Or the above average sauce. And even if you do, you'll still be able to get your Grimaldi's fix in Douglaston, Manhattan, Coney Island, Hoboken, Hoboken, Garden City, Chandler, Chandler, Gilbert, North Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Peoria, Tucson, Fort Myers, Tampa, Tampa, West Palm Beach, Clearwater, Palm Beach Gardens, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Sparks, Mt. Pleasant, Allen, Grapevine, Katy, Dallas, Dallas, Sugarland, The Woodlands, San Antonio, San Antonio, or Corpus Christi.Yeah, it's really not the same these days. Hope you're glad I did this, Yelp. Because Grimaldi's is fine. But I'd just as soon the guide book crowd keep crowding this joint and leaving a table open at Juliana's for me.",3.0
"I drove to the city with a group of friends for a weekend trip. One friend in particular was searching for highest food-rated places every where we went; Grimadi's was one of them. It was a Sunday right before we were headed back home, and we decide to check it out. While driving past, we notice the line is about 2 blocks long.......... at least. I didn't care to go because I was famished but everyone else was all about it, so I stopped anyway. Call me nice or what?!There was no parking, some shady guy came up to my car and said he was valet. I asked how much and he told me $15.00. Hesitant, I paid. Luckily I ended up getting my car back - hours later.We waited in line for 1.5 hours, timed. And while we were next in line to be served with their heavenly pizza, people behind were going in before us because we had to wait for a table of 5 to open up. We walk in, place is completely swarmed with people. Uncomfortable seating. Eventually, get our food.. expecting to taste nothing else like it, and turned out to be the greatest disappointment. Papa John's over Grimaldi's. I'll never go back there again. I guess other people think differently since they're willing to wait in a crazy line.. But, I saw/tasted nothing fantastic.The experience wasn't even good, it was warm, you get miserable and impatient. It makes you re-think why the hell you're standing in line? Inside wasn't what I expected it to look like. Noisey and crowded. Next time I wait in a 1.5 hour line for pizza, I expect to be carried to my seat within a private room to enjoy my food peacefully.And FYI, you can't order out (per door sign), you MUST stand in line.",1.0
"One word: hype.- Cash only. ATM was broken and took forever to reset which made me extremely uneasy - New location doesn't serve alcohol- possibly due to a pending liquor license?- Prices were reasonable, the pizzas came out fairly quick, and it was a solid pizza pie nevertheless, but it still doesn't justify the wait (which sometimes can be over an hour and blocks deep). - Worth a try if there is no wait.",2.0
"As a visitor to NYC this place came highly recommended, but a lot of the yelp reviews for this place seemed mixed, saying its more of a tourist attraction, or the line makes it not worth the wait. Well, I would wait in line for this pizza!!! It was so good! It was flavorful and the ingredients tasted fresh. So if you are looking for good pizza try this place but bring your patience just in case you have to stand in line. Take note: this place is CASH ONLY and does NOT serve alcohol.",4.0
It is great pizza. I consider it one of the top pizza places in NYC. Haven't been there for a year now...I think they have moved since I have been there. I am not a fan of standing in a long line outside...but the pizza is incredible - I could eat an entire pizza...its so light and easy to eat. I wish I could order delivery from there.,5.0

"YUMMY.  They say less is more on their pizzas.  I've gotten a red-sauce pizza both times I've gone since they import their tomatoes from Italy, and I wanted to have a authentic pizza experience.  I got mushroom as a topping, which I wouldn't recommend it made the pizza extra soggy from the water in the mushrooms, and the mushrooms are in more of a raw state then a good browned baked state.  Environment is cool.  Get there early before the main meal times cause lines get long.  They are pretty quick if it's just two people.  Two people can easily eat a small pizza which consists of 6 Huge slices.  Don't take leftovers they'll just get soggy, but its good enough to eat it all there and be a little extra full.",5.0
"Grimaldi's doesn't live up to the hype. I've simply had better pizza all over Brooklyn, and in other states as well. If this restaurant is supposed to be the pinnacle of New York pizza, prepare to be underwhelmed.The building itself looks quite nice, on the corner , 1 Front St, but it would be better suited for a bar or small club, honestly. The service was casual and nonchalant, borderline inattentive.The food is decent - we ordered the small cheese pizza, which should have been really flavorful since it's basically just cheese, sauce, and dough, maybe basil if you want to get fancy. Instead, the pizza was just basic. Literally, nothing special. Don't stand in line for this place. If you are in the area (for whatever godforsaken reason) and can't find anything else - Grimaldi's will do.",3.0
"Despite a change in ownership and a new location (just down the block from the original), Grimaldi's continues to deliver a pretty solid pie. Their biggest problem is that Patsy Grimaldi (the original owner) has set up shop in the original Grimaldi's location next door and is delivering a better product in a more welcoming atmosphere.But, let's not dwell too long on the competitor next door. Instead, if you feel you must go to Grimaldi's, you aren't likely to be disappointed. This place still turns out a more than respectable pizza. The biggest problem with Grimaldi's continues to be the line. There's some variance in length of wait but if you go at a prime time on a warm day, you should easily expect to stand outside for an hour or more. In my book, there simply doesn't exist a pizza that's worth this wait but clearly there are plenty of people that disagree with that sentiment.Once you do make it into Grimaldi's, you should expect a high volume, no frills experience. These guys have a boatload of people coming through the doors every day so the goal is to move bodies in and out and the service reflects that. It's not that the service is bad, but don't expect any sort of personal touch, it's all very matter-of-fact and, given the crowds, that's probably the right approach.Overall, Grimaldi's is probably a 4 star place if it weren't for their neighbor. But, given the close proximity of these two joints, the comparison is inevitable and Juliana's just wins out on quality and overall experience for me.",3.0
"The BF really wanted to try this place, and since we were planning on walking on the Brooklyn Bridge, we stopped by for dinner.

Unfortunately, we discovered it was cash only and I sucked it up and paid the $4.50 transaction fee to use their ATM machine. Sigh. The price we way for delicious food.We ordered a large regular pizza (in retrospect, that was ambitious of us) with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and garlic (I love my garlic, don't hate). It was very delicious, and it was a thin crust pizza, which is my favorite. However, each topping is $2+ so our pizza ended up being 20 bucks with 3 toppings. Quite pricey, if you ask me. However, I've had better pizza elsewhere (in Seattle, can you believe it?), but I will admit their pizza is very good.",4.0
"Excellent pizza, worth waiting 2 hours for a pie- absolutely not. Want the same pizza without the wait go to Staten Island or Hoboken.

There was something about the flavor that was incredible. Even though the pizza  didn't live up to my expectations, I don't regret waiting in line for an hour. It was definitely worth it, if just for the experience.  I was never in the old location, but the new one is really nice and we didn't feel rushed even with the long line waiting outside.If you've really got your heart set on going here, I say try it once and then you can decide whether you'd go back.  My decision -  I came, I tried, It was good, but Grimaldi's will only be a one hit wonder for me.",3.0

I thought that was a plus considering a lot of these big restaurants become hoity toity after making it big and being featured on this FoodNetwork show or that.

There was something about the flavor that was incredible. Even though the pizza  didn't live up to my expectations, I don't regret waiting in line for an hour. It was definitely worth it, if just for the experience.  I was never in the old location, but the new one is really nice and we didn't feel rushed even with the long line waiting outside.If you've really got your heart set on going here, I say try it once and then you can decide whether you'd go back.  My decision -  I came, I tried, It was good, but Grimaldi's will only be a one hit wonder for me.",3.0
"Can't possibly say enough great things about this truly authentic Brooklyn pizza shop in DUMBO. It's just perfect. Definitely going each time I visit NYC and hope to introduce many friends to it as well. The manager also stood outside to have a conversation with us and was totally humble about the place. I thought that was a plus considering a lot of these big restaurants become hoity toity after making it big and being featured on this FoodNetwork show or that. Not Grimaldi's-- :)Beware though, tons of food and they only take cash. Grimaldi's, can you please open up a shop in the West Coast?",5.0

"I went to Grimaldi's on a Sunday afternoon with Katie M. and Alex Z., who both live in Brooklyn.  It was the first visit for all of us, and after weighing all the factors, I'd guess it was the last.The experience was just kind of a pain in the ass.  First, there was the forty minute wait in the freezing cold, during which we got the starting end of a light snow.  I expected to wait, though, and I understand that some things are worth waiting for.  But the annoyance did not end at the door.  Once we were herded in, the table service was terrible.  We were largely ignored, and the food took forever to come out.  We thought it was strange that our antipasto was taking a half hour (we ordered it because we were starving and figured it shouldn't take too long to slap a few meats and olives onto a plate), but we stopped wondering when our pizza came.  Our server apologized and said he had completely forgotten that we ordered the antipasto and gave us the option of ordering it then.  We said never mind.Now that the complaints are out of the way, I did like some things about this place.  The atmosphere was great.  Casual, old school, no slickness, and only a little bit of institutional pretension.  The music suited the place - Sinatra and the like.  When ""That's Amore"" came on, Alex noted, ""They must get sick of this song.""  I had a Brooklyn Lager (mostly while waiting for, rather than with my pizza), and it was a nice refreshing beer to start my Sunday.The pizza was great.  We got a medium red pizza - a classic Margherita with sausage on half - and a small white with mushroom.  The crust was excellent, with a pleasant yeasty flavor and a beautiful crunch to the crust, with a lot of flop in the middle.  The red pie was nice, though I thought a little more acid in the sauce would have gone a long way.  The basil was good, and the herby sausage was a lovely topping.  The small white pizza was almost as big as the medium, with six large slices.  The white pizza came with garlic and melted cheese, and it was pungent and flavorful, with a key assist from the earthy mushrooms.I wouldn't say, though, that Grimaldi's pizza was the best I've had, and I wouldn't go through the same amount of hassle to visit again.  That said, the crust was exceptional and I am glad I went.  If you want famous New York pizza, this is not a bad spot to get it.  Just be prepared for the attending headache.",3.0
"After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge during a hot summer day and then trekking to Grimaldi's, I was mind-blown to see a line already formed at 11:30AM, which is opening time.  Taking it in, I patiently waited for a seat.  Service was fast and pretty darn good. Waiters were dancing to the old 70's songs in front of the manager.  Cute.Near the front door, I watched my pizza pie's birth as a guy generously put on all the toppings I ordered.  Within 10 minutes, that pie is on my table.  In another 3 minutes, that pie is in my stomach.  The inevitable comparison to Lombardi's or any other famous pizzeria has to be made now.  I truly enjoyed Grimald's better.  Lombardi's toppings fell right off the pizza before it could enter my mouth. The crust was not chewy.  My experience at Grimald's far trumps Lombardi's.Highly recommended for any tourist that wants to spend an hour crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and enjoy a famous pizza pie.

"Came here on a rainy day, so plenty of tables were waiting for us. The pizza we had was not hot enough. The bottom was burnt while the center top was too wet. The favor is good tho. The service was not good at all. Servers weren't attentive. We asked for cheese. A server gave it to us. Few minutes later, another server picked this bottle up, shook it, put it down and left without saying anything. Oh... When we asked for anything, they don't even say a word. We didn't even know if they heard what we said. The only nice thing is probably the owner gave us a warm welcome when we walked in.",2.0
"Wow! That's a great pizza. We went on a Tuesday at 3.30pm so there were no lines and pizza came out within 20mins or less. The service wasn't amazing, but they took your order and got your food to you. The pizza was pretty great and really, you go there for food, not service",4.0
"Best. Pizza. In. NYC. Period.I heard about the wait - but lucked out as it only took about 30 mins to get seated, even on a Saturday night.  I think it also helped that I was only with one other person.We sat upstairs, over looking the lower dining room.  It's a no fuss place - simple menu.Ordered a large pie and it was served quickly.  Light, airy dough, just enough sauce and toppings.  Perfect balance of flavors.On the loud side - but the price can't be beat.  For one topping, large pie and a soda/bottle of water - $20.",5.0
"Known as one of the first pizza place in nyc, I just had to try this place.  I don't think i can ever forget my first impression of this place.  The waiter that greeted us at the door was this big guy who talked like he was in a Russian mafia. The Music in the restaurant made me feel  like I'm in a euro rave/techno scene. We ordered a small pizza but it was plenty for two. The pizza was decent and I liked how the crust tasted.  I would recommend this place for the interesting atmosphere and decent pizza.",4.0
"One of only a few coal oven pizzerias in NYC, the famous Grimaldi's is one of my new favorites. They don't try TOO hard and they keep their roots. Pizza is EXCELLENT for this style. It's simple, traditional pizza. Tip: Just get a size Large as it's only ~$2 more than a medium. Can't go wrong here. I took my wife here for Valentine's Day as we live in the neighborhood. Simple, fun and yummy.Visited February 2013",5.0

"My bf and I were brought here by his sister and her husband when I first came to visit NY. It was so talked about it even became a number one place to stop by even before the statue of liberty. I never eat pizza because I'm health conscious but when your on vacation its game over!It almost seemed like a cute whole in the wall place. My first impression was WOW that's a long line. I was expecting a LOT because of what people told me and seeing the line I thought this must be the BEST pizza. After about 25 min of waiting we were finally seated and I was so excited my smile looked like the joker. We ordered 2 different types with sausages, mozzarella, basil and other toppings. OMG when I saw it, my impression was that is a huge pizza. It's the pizza on my profile picture, and yes it's bigger than my face. First bite was amazing, warm, hint of spice, just perfect. Not too cheesy or greasy. But I must say I think I was a tad disappointed because It was so hyped up that when I ate it, it just tasted like great pizza but nothing I would wait in line for no more than 15 min. And I like my pizza thin crusted (Venice, Italy style) so I was not a big fan of huge thick crust. But Overall it was a great experience and still very tasty.",4.0

"I had to wait 2 hours unthe summer on line for this pizza and it was by far the best wait of my life. The pizza was amazing oven-baked pizza I had. This place is worth the wait, the environment is super comfy. Highly Recommended in the top 3 of pizza places.",5.0
"This place was AWESOME.I do believe it is the best pizza I've ever tasted.My cousin and I visited this place during our trip to NYC for new years. After a stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge, we stopped by this place around 4 pm and were surprised there was a third floor for people waiting to get in the joint. Very impressive. We only waited 10 minutes or so.The place is crowded, but what place in NYC isn't? They served Stewarts cream soda - a delicacy you can only find at select shops. The pizza itself was YUM! There was fresh mozzarella bubbling from the pizza when it was served.I hated that we were going to the Nets game and couldn't bring the last uneaten slice with us - it was a tragedy to leave such good food on the table. Would've made for a great midnight snack.This place is well worth a trip to Brooklyn if you have time. And if you don't have time, make time!",5.0
"If you make it, they will come! And yes, this place has definitely put themselves on the map and has made it to super stardom when it comes to their infamous pizza.

Maybe it's the hour long line outside we stood in the freezing cold waiting to get in, or maybe it's some special mozzarella they use, the pizza is thin, and the cheese is stringggg---gyyyy. it's delicious. We ordered a large pizza, got full, then had to get a 2nd one JUST because 1. it was a long wait, and 2. we knew we were too busy scarfing down the first one, we wanted to actually remember how it tasted like the 2nd time around.

"Been here a couple of times and never disappointed!! Of course, you have to wait in line outside for a table but the line moves quickly and once your seated you'll be served right away.

"You have to order a whole pie but each pie is made fresh to order.I get that this place uses fresh ingredients and the pie is cooked in a brick oven but that does not make a pizza taste good.The most important part of the pizza is the basic structure which is the sauce, cheese and the crust.  The sauce taste good and there is plenty of it.  However there is not enough cheese.  More than half of the pizza is missing cheese.  I rather them use enough dry mozzarella than not enough fresh mozzarella.  Also the bottom of the pizza is covered with carbon which just means you eating your way towards cancer.I just like my pizza covered in cheese instead of mostly sauce but most people seem to like the pizza here.",3.0
"Why wait in line? Don't be a schnook. Call ahead and pick up a pie, then go eat it at Brooklyn Bridge Park. I think this pizza is usually good, but sometimes it can come out a little dry.

However - it's usually pretty darn tasty, and the proximity to the park makes it a special event.",4.0
"The pizza was decent but nothing special, especially not worth the 40 minute wait on line and another 40 minutes waiting for the pizza after placing the order.I would've given it a 4 star rating if it doesn't for the lack of service.  If the service was better and the food came out quicker I would definitely change my rating to a 4 star.",3.0

It only took them about 15 minutes for them to make our pizza.. fresh out of the oven!We got the large regular pizza (regular = mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and basil) and it was delicious!

"I grew up in NYC but have resided in Chicago for the past 12 years.  When I heard that Grimaldi's has the ""best"" pizza in NYC, I knew we had to make the trek.  On our recent visit, our girls and I crossed the Brooklyn Bridge during a hot June day. It was absolutely worth the trek! We got there at 11:15 AM so we were the first in line. The doors were actually shut closed and I was afraid that they weren't open for lunch.  Luckily, a sweet employee named Ralph reassured us that they open at 11:30 AM. By11:20 AM a line had started to form.  I think as long as you get there before Noon for lunch, there will only be a minimal wait. Now for the PIZZA...Let me start by saying I am NOT a sentimental person but I actually shed a TEAR when I bit into our sausage pizza.  My girls said I ""cried a river"" but it was just 2-3 tears of sheer joy.  It's simply pizza perfection - crust is nicely charred (not burnt) and has the perfect chew to it.  The cheese is fresh mozzarella and the ratio to cheese:sauce:crust - again, perfection! Service was OK and No credit cards. We had a large 18"" pizza (8 slices) and 3 sodas for $24.  I think it's a bargain for such amazing pizza. Finally, if you have kids with you, you can bribe them with the promise of ice cream from the nearby Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.  Not nearly as memorable as the pizza but it will keep them from whining about the walk.",5.0
"Grimaldi's... The pizza is pretty good, I have to say, but probably not worth justifying the 1.5 hour (gasp) wait. At least they let us into a bar on the top floor such that we only waited outside in the cold (this was during the Winter months) for about 20 minutes. The reason we had such a long wait time was most likely due to our party of 6.

Mind you, our party was 7 people so that wasn't bad at all. Our stomachs and eyes were hungry...I mean really hungry. Every time we inched ourselves a little bit closer to the door, we would breathe in the smell of Grimaldi's pizza goodness. Almost there.We sat down finally. Immediately asked the waiter if he was Italian, and he got our hopes down by saying he was Polish. :( Who cares. We were still f-ing hungry. Ordered 2 margarita pizzas (basil + mozarella), 1 veggie (tomatoes, onions, mushrooms), and 1 meat (ham, sausage). Plus two humungo ""jars"" of wine. Classy, just the way we like it. The margarita pizzas were awesome. But, it would be a dream if we could get all toppings onto one pizza (of only they weren't $3+ per topping!)

"Was visiting from California looking around Brooklyn for a good pizza place.  Discovered Grimaldi's and saw some good reviews on Yelp so we took a chance.  This was a simple pizza with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and jalepenos that they turns into something so delicious I can hardly describe it.  The pepperoni is nothing like what you find in California pizzas.  The circles are smaller, cut thicker, and have the most amazing peppery flavor to them.  They start the pizza with sliced mozzerella, then a layer of toppings, and finally the sauce.  Maybe that is the clue to a better pizza. Or, more likely it's the sauce... it was delicious with pieces of basil which added so much extra flavor.  If we ever return to NY, we're definitely returning to Grimaldi's.",5.0

"There's always a line outside, but I got lucky one Sunday morning. Instead of going to the normal smorgasburg, I decided to wait on line for 15 minutes to check out  Grimaldi's new location.

If you ever miss this first set, you should probably just give up because you'll be waiting another hour to have the pizzas made, eaten, and checks paid.  I think there's a paper about this somewhere that talks about wait times at restaurants around peak hours.Anyway, the best idea is to call in and get the pizza to go. Eat it in the park and make everyone else jelly. You could probably sell a slice at Smorgasburg if someone's desperate enough.We got a pepperoni pizza pie and ate 4 slices each. I don't mind to admit it when I'm a piggy. When you wait 30 minutes to get a seat, you might as well get a large and indulge in the stewarts black cherry or rootbeer. The pizza itself. Still awesome like the last time. I'm sure most of your complaints will be about the wait. If I had the time to kill, I'd defiintely do it. In fact, this would be a great date spot so you can see which girl is patient enough to take the time to wait for a good thing. Or... which girl really loves pizza. Both are wins in my book.",5.0

"The Skinny:  Good casual place to take your fun date, not the crazy one! Atmosphere: Classic pizza-place look. Who cares! I was there for food. Price: Mid-range. aka affordable Food: Fresh and delicious!The Long Review:Going to Grimaldi's on a weekend requires a ritual: you have stand on line that often stretches beyond the horizon and curves to the next block over. Reminds me of people waiting on the gas line after a storm. But like gas, waiting for a fresh pie at Grimald's is worth the wait. We went in and sat on a small table that barely fit us both in but not before shoving us right next to three other couples. It can be LOUD in there. But hold off on the headphones there now! When they bring out the food, they sometimes chant, letting the house know another fresh pie is about to be eaten. The food: The pizza at Grimaldi is fresh in taste. I had a margarita pie and my buddy had a pie with different toppings. Both arrived at the same time and the waiters yelled out ""two hungry boys"" as they brought us our pies. And oh we were hungry indeed. After all, we had a good 5 mile walk from the Island of Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge and taking the elusive walk-path stair exit that leads us pretty close the restaurant.The taste was rich with a gentle balance of sauce, flavor, cheese, coupled with the soft bites of crunchy slices that just made love in my mouth. D-licious! When we were done, we paid for it and went off to a dessert place.Overall:Good place for adults; not exactly a great place for tiny little kids but the owner/manager will try to accommodate people with kids. The people:The people are nice but they are fast paced. Well, they have to be because they have to make fresh pizza and bring them to the table in much much shorter time.",4.0
"It really is good crust. Very good. Thin crust without being brittle and stale, and doughy without being chewy. But my pizza come out lukewarm, and the flavor just didn't wow me. Good, but not amazing. My least favorite part: the mozzorella is not soft and gooey, but dry and rather rubbery. Odd. Not worth the wait.",3.0
"Worst service ever, the wait was eternal, and my pie was soggy and raw. I had so looked forward to going back to see the newer space. What the new owners have done to the Grimaldi name is an abomination. Total waste of my time and money. You want the real deal? Patsy Grimaldi, the legend himself, is alive and well and serving up the best pies in all of the USA RIGHT NEXT DOOR at JULIANA'S. Love that man!",1.0
"A friend brought me to this place several years ago. Didn't realize how touristy it was until I got there with him. It was a 30 minute wait -and everyone in line was from out of town. I'm always apprehensive of touristy spots...People sat very close next to each other, shoulder to shoulder at the community style tables. Since no one knew each other, and everyone was a tourist -it turned out to be fairly awkward. In fact -one tourist just stared at me wide-eyed throughout the entire meal. I think she had never seen a real live Asian person before from where she's from! In retrospect, it's hilarious, but at the time, it made me completely uncomfortable and annoyed.The pizza itself was just okay. I've had better oven baked thin pizza in Japan. With just okay pizza and too many tourists, I probably wouldn't stop by here again.",3.0

"I came to this place with my aunt while on vacation to NYC. She has been here before and mentioned to me this is a place I have got to try. We walked over the Brooklyn Bridge to get here so we worked up quite an appetite! Walking in-the atmosphere, decoration and layout was very captivating. Its very unique and I like that there was an upstairs that was a little more private. It was really cool to be able to look over to see over the whole restaurant. But I felt a little cramped upstairs. I felt like I could elbow the people behind or beside me while eating. I'm not particularly a pizza person but the pizza at Grimaldi's exceeded my expectations. It was so authentic and full of flavor! There were so many choices of toppings! We were very pleased with our pizza. We were however disappointed with the way our leftovers were packaged. There were two slices left and our waiter put them both in foil paper which made them stick together and not to mention the oils and sauce from the pizza leaked all over the place. BUT that is just minor. Since I have been back home to Kansas, I occasionally get a craving for Grimaldi's and will DEFINITELY visit this restaurant again when I return to New York!",4.0
"This is not quite the Grimaldi's I recall from when it was Patsy's back in the 90's but it was still better than average brick oven pizza. I think they skimp a bit on the toppings (seriously, 2 baby pepperonis/slice) and the cheese is a little light, but the pizzas come out quickly and cooked perfectly. The ambiance is nice if you're a sports fan like me, with multiple TVs showing ESPN highlights and just the right amount of noise to speak loudly but not be able to hear or be heard beyond your own table.The staff seems a bit cold, but that's to be expected from most old school pizzerias. Overall, I would say this is good for a quick lunch but if you're expecting greatness and inviting friends for dinner, you're probably asking for disappointment.",3.0
"Had friends visit from out of town, and there is not better NY experience than NY pizza so we decided to do our one touristy thing for the weekend and do Brooklyn bridge and Grimaldis.We arrived at 11:35 (opens at noon) and we were at the front of the line, probably within the first 15 people so when it opened at noon we were seated right away. Ordered all white pie, and regular with mushroom and onion. We all liked the all white the best, so maybe worth giving it a whirl! Cash only, so prepare yourself for that.Overall it was good for a touristy thing to do, we all liked it and had a great time. The service was mediocre, but they know they can get away with it because they are a tourist hot spot, nothing you can do about that....",3.0
"Delicious and authentic. Had the white pizza and pizza with sausage- both were great!!! They exceeded my expectations about the hype. The pizza with sausage was great for what it was, but no exciting flavors. Don't get me wrong- it was done very well and I'd eat 3 pies of it for dinner if I could, but nothing unique. The white pizza was the star for me. I am not a fan of pizza without red sauce, but this made me a believer!!! I never liked white pizza before coming to this place, but it seriously changed my life for the 10 minutes I was eating it. There's some sort of garlic oil or something they put under the ricotta because I was in heaven. The ricotta was creamy and the little bit of basil made everything taste fresh. Give it a shot! I'm glad I did!",5.0

I had a margarita pie and my buddy had a pie with different toppings. Both arrived at the same time and the waiters yelled out ""two hungry boys"" as they brought us our pies. And oh we were hungry indeed. After all, we had a good 5 mile walk from the Island of Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge and taking the elusive walk-path stair exit that leads us pretty close the restaurant.The taste was rich with a gentle balance of sauce, flavor, cheese, coupled with the soft bites of crunchy slices that just made love in my mouth. D-licious! When we were done, we paid for it and went off to a dessert place.Overall:Good place for adults; not exactly a great place for tiny little kids but the owner/manager will try to accommodate people with kids. The people:The people are nice but they are fast paced. Well, they have to be because they have to make fresh pizza and bring them to the table in much much shorter time.",4.0
"It really is good crust. Very good. Thin crust without being brittle and stale, and doughy without being chewy. But my pizza come out lukewarm, and the flavor just didn't wow me. Good, but not amazing. My least favorite part: the mozzorella is not soft and gooey, but dry and rather rubbery. Odd. Not worth the wait.",3.0
"Worst service ever, the wait was eternal, and my pie was soggy and raw. I had so looked forward to going back to see the newer space. What the new owners have done to the Grimaldi name is an abomination. Total waste of my time and money. You want the real deal? Patsy Grimaldi, the legend himself, is alive and well and serving up the best pies in all of the USA RIGHT NEXT DOOR at JULIANA'S. Love that man!",1.0
"A friend brought me to this place several years ago. Didn't realize how touristy it was until I got there with him. It was a 30 minute wait -and everyone in line was from out of town. I'm always apprehensive of touristy spots...People sat very close next to each other, shoulder to shoulder at the community style tables. Since no one knew each other, and everyone was a tourist -it turned out to be fairly awkward. In fact -one tourist just stared at me wide-eyed throughout the entire meal. I think she had never seen a real live Asian person before from where she's from! In retrospect, it's hilarious, but at the time, it made me completely uncomfortable and annoyed.The pizza itself was just okay. I've had better oven baked thin pizza in Japan. With just okay pizza and too many tourists, I probably wouldn't stop by here again.",3.0

"I came to this place with my aunt while on vacation to NYC. She has been here before and mentioned to me this is a place I have got to try. We walked over the Brooklyn Bridge to get here so we worked up quite an appetite! Walking in-the atmosphere, decoration and layout was very captivating. Its very unique and I like that there was an upstairs that was a little more private. It was really cool to be able to look over to see over the whole restaurant. But I felt a little cramped upstairs. I felt like I could elbow the people behind or beside me while eating. I'm not particularly a pizza person but the pizza at Grimaldi's exceeded my expectations. It was so authentic and full of flavor! There were so many choices of toppings! We were very pleased with our pizza. We were however disappointed with the way our leftovers were packaged. There were two slices left and our waiter put them both in foil paper which made them stick together and not to mention the oils and sauce from the pizza leaked all over the place. BUT that is just minor. Since I have been back home to Kansas, I occasionally get a craving for Grimaldi's and will DEFINITELY visit this restaurant again when I return to New York!",4.0
"This is not quite the Grimaldi's I recall from when it was Patsy's back in the 90's but it was still better than average brick oven pizza. I think they skimp a bit on the toppings (seriously, 2 baby pepperonis/slice) and the cheese is a little light, but the pizzas come out quickly and cooked perfectly. The ambiance is nice if you're a sports fan like me, with multiple TVs showing ESPN highlights and just the right amount of noise to speak loudly but not be able to hear or be heard beyond your own table.The staff seems a bit cold, but that's to be expected from most old school pizzerias. Overall, I would say this is good for a quick lunch but if you're expecting greatness and inviting friends for dinner, you're probably asking for disappointment.",3.0
"Had friends visit from out of town, and there is not better NY experience than NY pizza so we decided to do our one touristy thing for the weekend and do Brooklyn bridge and Grimaldis.We arrived at 11:35 (opens at noon) and we were at the front of the line, probably within the first 15 people so when it opened at noon we were seated right away. Ordered all white pie, and regular with mushroom and onion. We all liked the all white the best, so maybe worth giving it a whirl! Cash only, so prepare yourself for that.Overall it was good for a touristy thing to do, we all liked it and had a great time. The service was mediocre, but they know they can get away with it because they are a tourist hot spot, nothing you can do about that....",3.0
"Delicious and authentic. Had the white pizza and pizza with sausage- both were great!!! They exceeded my expectations about the hype. The pizza with sausage was great for what it was, but no exciting flavors. Don't get me wrong- it was done very well and I'd eat 3 pies of it for dinner if I could, but nothing unique. The white pizza was the star for me. I am not a fan of pizza without red sauce, but this made me a believer!!! I never liked white pizza before coming to this place, but it seriously changed my life for the 10 minutes I was eating it. There's some sort of garlic oil or something they put under the ricotta because I was in heaven. The ricotta was creamy and the little bit of basil made everything taste fresh. Give it a shot! I'm glad I did!",5.0

"EhhhhIdk what happen during my experience but sticking to the Pizza, it was good but nothing to rant and rave about. I read the other reviews and saw pics so i thought 4 sure this would be a no brainer 5 stars. Nope! The pizza was not super hot, the pepperoni they use is a tad bit overly salty and I could barely taste the mushroom. Thank GOD we did not have 2 wait in the heat or in a line. I am willing 2 give them another chance one night when im drunk n craving pizza. P.S. Everything tastes good when your drunk!Went again a second time (sober) and the above remain, nothing to rant and rave about",3.0
This was the best tasting pizza I had while in New York.  It's exactly what I pictured for a New York City Neighborhood Pizza Joint.  It's loved by locals and tourists.  The atmosphere is simple but cozy.  The tables are all crammed inside and the wait is usually long.  You share big tables with strangers but that is part of the appeal.  It's cool to see the Pizza Oven right behind the counter while they make your pie.  They won't let you take a picture of the oven for some reason.    Another fun part was walking the Brooklyn Bridge there and back.,5.0
"Walked across the brooklyn bridge in 20 degree weather, just to go try this spot. and as soon as we got there, the smell coming from the kitchen alone woulda been enuff.

The fresh mozzarella was delish and creamy. The pepperoni were thick and oh so tasty. Sausage had a good spice. You can definitely taste the difference in the pizza by how they bake it in a coal oven.

As soon as we paid, they wanted us out.  We couldn't leave, because my sister was in line for their tiny bathroom.  We didn't feel comfortable taking her things and waiting outside because she had a lot of bags and we didn't want her to go outside in the cold without her coat.  It would have been fine if our waiter had asked us politely to leave, but our waiter slammed a bunch of plates and menus on our table.  A couple minutes later, while my sister was still in line for the bathroom, the waiter rudely urged us to leave.  He was clearly irritated with us and loudly grunted, ""Can you please go?  There are people outside and it is very cold.  Can you go?""  We started to grab our things and the waiter already brought in the next family.  They stood breathing down our necks as we had to grab my sister's coat, purse, bags, etc.  The waiter almost pushed us out the way to set up the table while we were still getting our belongings.It was the most terrible experience I've ever had.  They ruined our night.  We've always brought our family and friends to Grimaldi's, but no more.  We have never felt so unappreciated.  After seeing how they make everyone's pizza 1/2 burnt and how they treat us, it is clear that they do NOT care about their customers.  They generate so much money from the number of people that come in that they don't need to care.  I don't want to give my money to a place that feels like the restaurant is above the customer.  Where the restaurant feels like it can get away with anything.AND AND AND...the reason why they're moving is because the owner (Frank Ciolli) owes rent money, despite the fact that he owns 18 pizzerias nationwide.  Sleezy.  The original creator of Grimaldi's also regrets selling his business to Ciolli.  What does that tell you?",1.0

Way over rated. Terrible pizza and lost liquor license. We live in the area. Tourists come here without knowing anything. Front door people are so rude. The original guys are next door. Way friendlier and better pizza. Wouldn't ever step in grimaldi again. Julianas is way better.,1.0

"What we ate: Large pizza with ricottaMy mom was in town for the first time in a couple of years and wanted to revisit her favorite pizza place from her prior visit - Grimaldis. Now I love some Grimaldis but after standing in line for about an hour a few years ago in below freezing weather I had sworn off the Brooklyn location, especially during peak hours. Plus with the new one opened much more conveniently in Chelsea why trek out to Brooklyn if I don't have to (sorry BK fans). But can a girl will do when her mom is in town and wants the same one she had before... so off to Brooklyn we went. We arrived around 8 pm on a Saturday night (did I mention I especially want to avoid peak hours...) and joined the expected line trailed down the street towards the water front. As we had come from the east river ferry, we were perplexed to find several minutes later that the line went straight past the entrance we expected and curved around the street corner up ahead. Only then did we see that the original location of Grimaldis was boarded up and had newspaper clippings explaining the current ownership situation. I wont bore you with the details here but it is an interesting story of 2 talented pizza makers and 1 location. Short version is that the Grimaldis my mom had visited a few years before had now moved to a new store front just 1 spot up the road.The new location was much more modern and spacious. It has 2 levels with high ceilings plus bar seating so there is a lot more room to sit and move around. They had music in the background, the servers seemed a bit more friendly (though it could also be my time in NYC has gotten me more used to gruff service), and the general atmosphere was more relaxed than before. Though there were 3 of us, no one was particularly hungry so we settled on 1 large pizza to share. I am a big fan of ricotta cheese on pizza but I don't like it at many places - Grimaldis happens to be my favorite though. So for my sake and the sake of simple ordering we got a large traditional pie with ricotta cheese. It came pretty quickly and was almost just like the pies at the prior Grimaldis. The only difference I noticed was that the crust wasn't a charred as before, and I have to say I actually prefer a little less char and a little more chew to my crust. So I was pleased!

"One of the best NY pizzas ever! My friend and I walked across the Brooklyn bridge, got lost for a bit, but finally found the renowned Grimaldi's! :)It's this tiny little hole-in-the-wall type setting and it gets pretty packed in there! We waited in line outside and after about 30 minutes (which I heard is actually not a bad wait time), we were seated at a 4-seater table next to a random couple. Nice...double-date with a stranger. What better way to talk about where you're from and other great places to try in the city? ;)The ingredients are fresh and you KNOW it's going to be just-out-of-the-oven because you see the chefs creating each masterpiece behind the plexiglass (or maybe it was actually glass). Either way, they're truly artists working on a craft, b/c the pies they make are works of art for your taste buds!!!Supposedly, the next stop you should go to is the ice cream place down the street, but I was way too full and too tired from crossing the bridge. HAHA. If you can, though, make your way across that bridge! It's a breath-taking view.",5.0

"Pizza was pretty good. I love oven baked and thin crust pizzas, and I think Grimaldi's is the closest thing I've found to a thin crust pizza from Italy. I had pizza there one summer that pretty much changed my life, and I've been craving it ever since.You have to order a whole pie and they are made fresh to order. Our group of six got two pies, and it was more than enough. My only quibble would be that the burnt parts of the crust got too burnt.

"I had been to Grimaldi's a few years ago when they were in the smaller building next door (probably mid-2010) and had a wonderful experience. So when my family visited this weekend and wanted pizza, I thought it would be a great place to take them. Unfortunately the quality of the service and the food have gone down quite a bit since my last visit.First of our, our waiter was absolutely terrible. (He was also taking care of the couple at the table next to us, who we ended up chatting with, and they agreed.) After he took our order, he literally didn't stop by our table once except to bring us the check at the end of the meal. He didn't even bring us our drinks or our food--we had to ask another waiter to check on both for us. I know he had a few other tables besides us, but the restaurant was barely half full and he spent a great deal of time flirting with the teenage girls in line outside and trying to look down their shirts. I thought I was imagining things until the guy at the table next to ours said out loud ""what a creep!"" and we ended up talking about it. All the other staff were professional and friendly, but for some reason we got stuck with this guy who was just gross.The food was just... not good. We started off with the antipasto, since the ovens were shut off for cleaning when we arrived (they're coal-burning ovens so the restaurant is legally required to clean them every few hours or so--I knew to expect that, so not a problem at all). The olives and the peppers were fine, but the bread was stale, and the mozzarella was pretty dry and seemed like it had been sitting out for ages. The pizza wasn't bad, but I remember being really, really impressed back in 2010,  and this was just okay. Not sure if they've changed the recipe since the move. It also didn't seem hot enough to have just come out of a 1,000 degree oven, but that may have been due to our negligent waiter.Grimaldi's doesn't sell slices or accept credit cards, which are hassles I don't mind if the place is extraordinarily good, but there are just too many better pizza places to bother. We had planned to stay for dessert, but ultimately decided it wasn't worth waiting another half hour for food that likely wouldn't be good anyway. We ended up walking down to Brooklyn Bridge Park for ice cream and a view instead. Hopefully our experience was just a fluke, otherwise it's really a shame the place has gone so downhill.",2.0

"I want to give this place a awesome review. I love businesses that are basically a tourist attraction. I love it even more when they are actually awesome!Parents were in town and they wanted to try it out - I guess they have been on TV before? Grimaldi's, not my parents. So they wanted to try it - As did I. So being a proper yelper I educated myself before coming. I wanted to know what to expect. Long lines? Ok no big deal. Borderline shotty service. Ok, as long as the Pizza is good. We got there and waited 20 or so minutes which wasn't that bad at all - Got seated and waited longer for a waiter to take our order. I kind of expected that. to the point - You will wait in a long line  - You will probably have shitty service - The Pizza is good. A note to Grimaldi's management and ownership. I know you're Grimaldi's and you can basically treat people like they are waiting at the DMV. But if you have the opportunity to make the best possible, well rounded experience to people that are looking for that great neighborhood pizza place that everyone wants to come to...then do it. HAVE GREAT SERVICE. Please fix your busted ass menu. Its 2013 and your website across the top is broken up. If you are reading this. I will do it for free. Well - Maybe all that is the charm of the place. 4 Stars because I will come back and will suggest it. Only for people that need a place to eat while they are walking around Dumbo. I'm just being a negative Nancy...I guess it wasn't all that bad.",4.0
I'm not sure if this place is worth the wait in line.  I like my pizza's packed with flavors.  Granted their thin crust is nice and soft.  As for toppings and flavors.... I just want's too impressed.Still worth the try.  I would give this place a solid 3.5 / 5.,3.0
Way over rated. Terrible pizza and lost liquor license. We live in the area. Tourists come here without knowing anything. Front door people are so rude. The original guys are next door. Way friendlier and better pizza. Wouldn't ever step in grimaldi again. Julianas is way better.,1.0
"Best pizza in NYC, don't wait in line, call ahead grab it to go and have picnic at the park with the view of manhattan. Sun dried tomatoes, pepperoni, sausage, and red peppers, are my favorite toppings. You can't go wrong.",5.0
"What we ate: Large pizza with ricottaMy mom was in town for the first time in a couple of years and wanted to revisit her favorite pizza place from her prior visit - Grimaldis. Now I love some Grimaldis but after standing in line for about an hour a few years ago in below freezing weather I had sworn off the Brooklyn location, especially during peak hours. Plus with the new one opened much more conveniently in Chelsea why trek out to Brooklyn if I don't have to (sorry BK fans). But can a girl will do when her mom is in town and wants the same one she had before... so off to Brooklyn we went. We arrived around 8 pm on a Saturday night (did I mention I especially want to avoid peak hours...) and joined the expected line trailed down the street towards the water front. As we had come from the east river ferry, we were perplexed to find several minutes later that the line went straight past the entrance we expected and curved around the street corner up ahead. Only then did we see that the original location of Grimaldis was boarded up and had newspaper clippings explaining the current ownership situation. I wont bore you with the details here but it is an interesting story of 2 talented pizza makers and 1 location. Short version is that the Grimaldis my mom had visited a few years before had now moved to a new store front just 1 spot up the road.The new location was much more modern and spacious. It has 2 levels with high ceilings plus bar seating so there is a lot more room to sit and move around. They had music in the background, the servers seemed a bit more friendly (though it could also be my time in NYC has gotten me more used to gruff service), and the general atmosphere was more relaxed than before. Though there were 3 of us, no one was particularly hungry so we settled on 1 large pizza to share. I am a big fan of ricotta cheese on pizza but I don't like it at many places - Grimaldis happens to be my favorite though. So for my sake and the sake of simple ordering we got a large traditional pie with ricotta cheese. It came pretty quickly and was almost just like the pies at the prior Grimaldis. The only difference I noticed was that the crust wasn't a charred as before, and I have to say I actually prefer a little less char and a little more chew to my crust. So I was pleased! Is it still worth the hour long wait in a line outside, probably. Will I try to new/original pizza join that will be re/opening in the recent grimaldis store front, probably. Will I still visit the grimaldis in Chelsea before trekking to Brooklyn unless someone very special makes a special request, definitely.

"I first heard of this spot when I read a story about Supreme Justice Sonia Sotomayer and this being her favorite pizza spot.  There are so many places to eat pizza in New York, but I will say this is the best I've had on my many trips to the city.On my most recent visit (March 2013), I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge in the rain (long story), and upon reaching the restaurant, I realized they moved up the street a bit. Wasn't really busy, but I had to wait a few before someone came and took my order. I had a simple cheese and basil pizza with half pepperoni. Delicious! The sauce is light, the crust is the right thinness and crispness.  Mozzarella cheese tastes homemade and the pepperoni was a nice addition.I also enjoyed a Stewart's soda (black cherry).

"Still the best, as always. Perfect as a dinner spot after a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, hungry stomachs abound! We had the half and half - half pepperoni and half mushroom.

The place smells so heavenly, I swear it makes one ever hungrier as you are waiting for your awesome, delicious food!

"This review is about 7 months late lolBeing a tourist, Grimaldi's was one of the spots we just HAD to hit up.  Damn.Not only was it 92 degrees out but we waited in line for 60 minutes -_- ...and I'm already tan as it is but my shit was burnt after that hahaThe location of the restaurant is right underneath the BK Bridge which is pretty cool though :)Anyways... I didn't really know what to expect with ""authentic new york"" style pizza...I've had versions of it in Seattle, but I was excited to finally try the real thing!  We ended up ordering a sausage & pepperoni and tasted pretty good!  You can tell they used fresh ingredients and the brick oven makes it taste cleaner! lolI won't front...after waiting that long and hearing all the hype about this place I expected the pizza to blow me away...but it was just OK to me...comparable to places in seattle like tutta bella and piecoras....All in all, it was an experience to wait that long but it's cool to be able to say I've ate at a famous place like this.  Will I ever go again?  Probably not. lol",3.0

It is cheaper than the previous place we ate at; $14 for small here with $2 for additional toppings.

"Came here late afternoon on a Saturday and saw a line, maybe 20 deep. Friends and I hummed and hawed over waiting it out, or checking out the fairly busy Julianna's next door. I'm glad we did wait because the line was moving briskly, and we were seated after 30 minutes (a short nothing since it was a weekend and Grimaldi's for Pete's sake!). Inside, the pizzeria is brightly lit and toasty, with red checkered tablecloths and polished wood. The three of us shared a large pie with mushrooms, onions, olives, Italian sausage and ricotta cheese. Though the pizza was slightly soggy from tip to a third of a slice in--maybe due to the ricotta?--GOD! That stuff was doing all sorts of good things in my mouth. Loved the slightly salty and chewy dough, all the way up to the crunchyness of the crust. Get the ricotta and olives! I am not a huge fan of olives, but the olive toppings here are slightly chunky and briny, and complimented the pie so well. Kinda went crazy over it. Minus one star because of the price. Due to a slightly large brunch at Alice's Tea Cup earlier, I was pretty weak-sauce and only managed a slice and a half, but I'm sure I want a whole pie all to my greedy little self the next time I'm up for a trip to dumbo.",4.0

"grimaldis, oh hot diggity damn, i stood out in the mf'in cold for 23 minutes but idgaf cause when i entered the establishment I automatically felt like a regal lord coming home to his 6 bitches after a long day hunting ducks. the pizza, however, tasted about as far away as I can possbily imagine from a raw duck. that shit was meltin in my mouth..... GARRGHHGH fuckin good ass pizza sauce was saucy and cheese was cheesy. The place has two floors and even tho I almost tripped and fell down the steps cause that lighting about as dark as teddi, i would fall down a flight of stairs for that pizza any day. place is 2 floors and i got to look out at all of the peasants on the street while i ate my wonderful meal which made me feel like a kingly king. i highly suggest visiting cause after ur taste buds will be whylin",5.0
awesome pizza. the wait to eat in is long and probably not worth it unless its under 30 minutes. the way to do it is to call in a take out order and pick it up and bring it to brooklyn bridge park across the street and eat it there! you will not regret making a trip to eat this pizza!,5.0
"This is a must try place whether you're a local or a tourist. After a nice walk on the Brooklyn Bridge a good pie is the best reward. We ordered a small mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza. All of the ingredients were fresh. The crust was perfectly cooked, just the right amount of crunch. The sauce was tangy and flavorful. . Very good pie! They also have a good selection of beers, wines and other beverages. I ordered the Black Cherry soda and my husband had a Peroni.I do recommend you go early. We went on a Monday at a little past noon and did not have to wait to be seated. When we left there was already a line. I will definitely be back.",4.0
"I love pizza. It's at a point where you can say ""pizza"" to me and immediately grab my attention. You can also say ""pizza"" and my mouth will probably start to water. I should be embarrassed by my love for the pizza pie, but screw it. It's too delicious.In all my visits to NY, I had yet to cross the bridge to get a meal at Grimaldis, so it was a must-do on my itinerary for my most recent visit.  The restaurant itself seats you in (almost) communal style tables.  As soon as a spot opens up, they will seat the next group in line that will fit. So, if you're up front in line but your group is too small/too big, you'll keep waiting until a spot just for you opens up.  If you're there with a large group, be prepared to wait, order take out, or just get lucky. The menu is pretty simple - just pick a size pie you want, and then pay additional for whatever toppings you want.  We ended up ordering a small with pepperoni and sausage.I was pretty hungry by the time we were seated, up to the point where I wanted to grab pizza from the next table.  I'm glad I was able to restrain myself, because the pie came out relatively quick.  We ate, and ate, and ate.  There is NOTHING quite like the amazing crust you get from baking a pie in an oven that is probably as hot as.. well.. you know.  Pizza does not need a lot of frills to make it good; it just needs a great crust, a great sauce, and the freshest toppings you can get. Grimaldi's scores on all three counts.",5.0
Kind of a tourist trap!  The pizza was good but was it good enough to wait in line for an hour? At this point...I'm not really sure. There are no slices here...I just wanted to try the pizza but was forced to buy the whole pizza...luckily I have a fridge in my hotel room...I've got pizza for the rest of the week.  The crust was fantastic on the pizza...the coal burning oven just rocks.  I'm glad I tried it but I would not go out of my way to return here.Good people watching!  Guy running the front door was funny.  He had to keep busting on tourists. People would try to scam into the resturant...after walking past the line outside. Yeah because 60 people standing outside a pizza joint is normal in every country.    Oh yeah bring cash too...no credit cards! Take that Uncle Sam!!!So to recap! Fun experience but would probably never do it again!!!,2.0
"I have been hearing mixed reviews about this place, how great it is and how over-rated it is.  I can  confidently say that this place deserves the praise it gets.  The food was excellent.  My friends and I split 2 pies and it was more than enough to fill us all.  The pies were delicious.  The service was good too. Our waiter helped us split the slices from the pies.  I like the casual atmosphere this place has.  The one gripe I had was the really long wait time for a group of 6.  The wait time is faster if you are in a smaller group.",4.0
"Yes, deliciousYes, long waitYes, worth a tryNo, if you have been before, is it worth going out of your way or waiting in the cold until your fingers are numb and fall off? If you are in the area, the pizza was definitely satisfying with a Peroni beer. The pizza was very good, but I'm not sure how it compares to other pizza places. Not sure how it lives up to the hype, but it was good--just didn't live up to what I had imagined it to be while waiting in the freezing cold.This place gets packed so be prepared to sit in tight quarters",4.0

"Came here late afternoon on a Saturday and saw a line, maybe 20 deep. Friends and I hummed and hawed over waiting it out, or checking out the fairly busy Julianna's next door. I'm glad we did wait because the line was moving briskly, and we were seated after 30 minutes (a short nothing since it was a weekend and Grimaldi's for Pete's sake!). Inside, the pizzeria is brightly lit and toasty, with red checkered tablecloths and polished wood. The three of us shared a large pie with mushrooms, onions, olives, Italian sausage and ricotta cheese. Though the pizza was slightly soggy from tip to a third of a slice in--maybe due to the ricotta?--GOD! That stuff was doing all sorts of good things in my mouth. Loved the slightly salty and chewy dough, all the way up to the crunchyness of the crust. Get the ricotta and olives! I am not a huge fan of olives, but the olive toppings here are slightly chunky and briny, and complimented the pie so well. Kinda went crazy over it. Minus one star because of the price. Due to a slightly large brunch at Alice's Tea Cup earlier, I was pretty weak-sauce and only managed a slice and a half, but I'm sure I want a whole pie all to my greedy little self the next time I'm up for a trip to dumbo.",4.0
"Thumbs way up! This place is not famous without reason- great pizza, fresh toppings, (super lethal spicy jalapeños ) and vintage feel. I also really like their ricotta cheese, and fresh basil. If you're ever strolling over the Brooklyn bridge, definitely make this part of the trip!",5.0
"grimaldis, oh hot diggity damn, i stood out in the mf'in cold for 23 minutes but idgaf cause when i entered the establishment I automatically felt like a regal lord coming home to his 6 bitches after a long day hunting ducks. the pizza, however, tasted about as far away as I can possbily imagine from a raw duck. that shit was meltin in my mouth..... GARRGHHGH fuckin good ass pizza sauce was saucy and cheese was cheesy. The place has two floors and even tho I almost tripped and fell down the steps cause that lighting about as dark as teddi, i would fall down a flight of stairs for that pizza any day. place is 2 floors and i got to look out at all of the peasants on the street while i ate my wonderful meal which made me feel like a kingly king. i highly suggest visiting cause after ur taste buds will be whylin",5.0
awesome pizza. the wait to eat in is long and probably not worth it unless its under 30 minutes. the way to do it is to call in a take out order and pick it up and bring it to brooklyn bridge park across the street and eat it there! you will not regret making a trip to eat this pizza!,5.0
"This is a must try place whether you're a local or a tourist. After a nice walk on the Brooklyn Bridge a good pie is the best reward. We ordered a small mushroom, pepperoni and sausage pizza. All of the ingredients were fresh. The crust was perfectly cooked, just the right amount of crunch. The sauce was tangy and flavorful. . Very good pie! They also have a good selection of beers, wines and other beverages. I ordered the Black Cherry soda and my husband had a Peroni.I do recommend you go early. We went on a Monday at a little past noon and did not have to wait to be seated. When we left there was already a line. I will definitely be back.",4.0
"I love pizza. It's at a point where you can say ""pizza"" to me and immediately grab my attention. You can also say ""pizza"" and my mouth will probably start to water. I should be embarrassed by my love for the pizza pie, but screw it. It's too delicious.In all my visits to NY, I had yet to cross the bridge to get a meal at Grimaldis, so it was a must-do on my itinerary for my most recent visit.  The restaurant itself seats you in (almost) communal style tables.  As soon as a spot opens up, they will seat the next group in line that will fit. So, if you're up front in line but your group is too small/too big, you'll keep waiting until a spot just for you opens up.  If you're there with a large group, be prepared to wait, order take out, or just get lucky. The menu is pretty simple - just pick a size pie you want, and then pay additional for whatever toppings you want.  We ended up ordering a small with pepperoni and sausage.I was pretty hungry by the time we were seated, up to the point where I wanted to grab pizza from the next table.  I'm glad I was able to restrain myself, because the pie came out relatively quick.  We ate, and ate, and ate.  There is NOTHING quite like the amazing crust you get from baking a pie in an oven that is probably as hot as.. well.. you know.  Pizza does not need a lot of frills to make it good; it just needs a great crust, a great sauce, and the freshest toppings you can get. Grimaldi's scores on all three counts.",5.0
Kind of a tourist trap!  The pizza was good but was it good enough to wait in line for an hour? At this point...I'm not really sure. There are no slices here...I just wanted to try the pizza but was forced to buy the whole pizza...luckily I have a fridge in my hotel room...I've got pizza for the rest of the week.  The crust was fantastic on the pizza...the coal burning oven just rocks.  I'm glad I tried it but I would not go out of my way to return here.Good people watching!  Guy running the front door was funny.  He had to keep busting on tourists. People would try to scam into the resturant...after walking past the line outside. Yeah because 60 people standing outside a pizza joint is normal in every country.    Oh yeah bring cash too...no credit cards! Take that Uncle Sam!!!So to recap! Fun experience but would probably never do it again!!!,2.0
"I have been hearing mixed reviews about this place, how great it is and how over-rated it is.  I can  confidently say that this place deserves the praise it gets.  The food was excellent.  My friends and I split 2 pies and it was more than enough to fill us all.  The pies were delicious.  The service was good too. Our waiter helped us split the slices from the pies.  I like the casual atmosphere this place has.  The one gripe I had was the really long wait time for a group of 6.  The wait time is faster if you are in a smaller group.",4.0
"Yes, deliciousYes, long waitYes, worth a tryNo, if you have been before, is it worth going out of your way or waiting in the cold until your fingers are numb and fall off? If you are in the area, the pizza was definitely satisfying with a Peroni beer. The pizza was very good, but I'm not sure how it compares to other pizza places.

"My star rating is actually 3.75 really. FINALLY! I get to stand in that ever-long line to try their famous coal oven pizza! WHOO HOOOOOO!   Came here with a group of friends and they were all very pleased with the pizza.  Based on their overall feedback - they felt that the crust was fresh and chewy...which is not easy to create for any pizza joint.  To them, Grimaldi's stood out to be one of the best pizzas they have ever tried.    For me, the tomato sauce was REALLY fresh and I felt that the ingredients were all up to par with quality and taste.  One pie is definitely fit for 3 people on average so the portions were not lacking at all.  In terms of the crust, my palate is very picky.  Although i do see the point about the chewiness of the crust and the way that it's made - I also taste the burnt aspect of the coal oven surface touching the bottom of the pizza.  Because of that, i felt the burning (or coal) taste prevailed over the fresh ingredients.  Again, this is because of the palate being very sensitive to a lot of flavors, especially when presented  simultaneously.  Besides, my review does not even matter even with no stars... it's already got superb reviews.  But it's a good thing to point out, nonetheless.Ok, so the way it works is that for the pizza menu - it includes a list of  toppings for $2 each mainly.  Garlic, mushrooms, extra cheese, haha.  Before you know  it, you're adding toppings like nothing and the bill comes out to be one hefty pizza pie! HAHA  So just be mindful of your topping choices.  The place itself is a bit tight - so be aware.  My friends were over 200+ lbs and it was a tight squeeze but we made it work for ourselves.  Because of the tight space, you have to be careful with pizza guys floating around trying to serve other customers.  Again, depends on where you will be seated.  The other area that might be lacking is service, depending on how lucky or unlucky you are.  Some of the servers may be exceptionally friendly and there are those who just wants to get you the damn pizza and give you the check.  I also noticed waiters who were trying to work through a tight space and showing some expressions of irritation (I mean, it is a busy place).   So it really depends.  (but to me, I find this to be heaven for waiters with constant turnovers and imagine the gratuities! haha!) Oh, another recommendation is that if you are intimidated by the the line, there is always Juliana's.  It's the same brick oven Grimaldi's use to have.  Well, you can google their news on that.",4.0
"I hate to be a Debbie Downer, but Grimaldi's didn't live up to the hype. I felt like the crust to sauce/cheese/topping ratio was off... like 3:1:1. For a ""brick oven"" pizza, I found the crust to be too fluffy and bread-like. And as a topping hound, I would have liked to see some specialty options (read: lots of pre-selected topping combos), rather than a DIY list of choices. We entered at around 45 minutes to closing and were seated right away. The staff was gracious and accommodating even though we closed out the place...always greatly appreciated!Remember to hit up the ATM pre-meal... this place is CA$H only.",2.0

Indifferent. With a steady, persistent line of new customers arriving from far and wide, complaints are meaningless... and Grimadi's knows it.

"The pizza's definitely different.Came here for the first time on Thursday lunch!  The place wasn't at all hard to find because you could see the line from down the street.  Since we were only two, the wait to get seated was only ~20-30 minutes. Decor - The place is actually 3 stories! (damn, Grimaldi's)  And tables are spaced out enough so that we didn't get jolted as we were eating. Food - price is about $14 base +$2 for toppings which I think is totally reasonable given the size.  We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, olives, and extra cheese along with a beer each to wash everything down.   Now I think that this pizza (especially with so many toppings) is meant to be eating with a fork.  The dough part is thin (as according to NY style) and gets soggy.  I mostly ended up eating the toppings first, scooping the dough into my mouth, and munching on the crust.  Didn't mind though - it was pretty good!Will come back when there's time.  A 30 minute wait with good company is reasonable, but probably not worth more than an hour's wait when hungry. (hilariously, a pizza place opened next to Grimaldi's to take advantage of this drawback.)",5.0
"Memories came back after eating here the other day. I've been to Grimaldis a few times when I was younger and the pizza lived up to it. People are saying this is a tourist trap. I don't know if they got a bad pie or what but it's definitely worth a try atleast once. Forgetabout the pepperoni it's small and makes the pizza way too greasy. Stick to a simple plain pie or a sausage and peppers pie. (Their crumbled sausage is really good) don't overload these pies with toppings do that when you go to your regular place, too many toppings will make the crust mushy. For instance one pie we got had mushrooms sun dried tomatoes and garlic and it made the crust a little soggy. (Taste was there texture wasn't). I'm not counting service in my review because honestly all of the workers were jerks and were rude. I wasn't surprised though. I came for the pizza not the atmosphere or guidos running the place so the service will slide for this one.",4.0
"Oh, Grimaldi's you let me down the second time.The first visit my out-of-town friend and I LOVED. Delicious sauce, fresh cheese and basil, cooked to perfection. We devoured the entire pie and then walked the Brooklyn bridge to burn it off.The next year we went back. Luckily both times on a Wed. night, with no line at all. We were greatly disappointed. The sauce was not the same, there was less cheese and the crust was burned, wayy overcooked.  It was like a totally different pizza we didn't even want to finish this time. :(Perhaps they cut back and cheapened their ingredients? Too bad because I won't be returning. If in Brooklyn by the bridge, it is good to try once...Hopefully their better qualitly returns.",3.0

"Forget the others. Grimaldi's makes the best pie in Brooklyn. Phoney foodies looking for pies with tofu, pear emulsion and free range truffles can find them at any number of fly-by-night trendy pizza spots, but for a full on traditional, delicious Italian-American pie, Grimaldi's is the best around. Lines can be long but it's totally worth it. We've been coming here ever Friday night for 12 years and we've never been disappointed.",5.0
"A NY friend recommended this place and I've also seen it on Food Network so naturally we had to try it. Plus, there's a feud of which has the better pizza, Grimaldi's or Lombardi's. Grimaldi's gets a 3.5 stars in my book. Not as good as Lombardi's but still pretty good.The wait, sucked sucked sucked. About 45-60 min wait in hot hot Brooklyn during Memorial day weekend.....the line moved soooo slow, and of course, the inside seats only like 60 people.The pizza sauce was not as fresh tasting. Though you can see them make the pizza right before your eyes, the sauce and the basil did not excited. There was wayyy too much cheese and NOT ENOUGH SAUCE!! The ratio was all off!!

"I have been trying all of the local pizza places in the NYC area and we decided to come to the original grimaldi's in brooklyn.  We came on a friday night around 7 pm after walking around the brooklyn promenade and walked right into the restaurant without a wait.  Was pleasantly surprised there was no wait.Had a white pizza and it was pretty good.  The oven seemed a little uneven because half of the pizza was somewhat burnt.  Overall, the pizza was pretty good, very thin crust and tasty.",3.0
"The pizza's definitely different.Came here for the first time on Thursday lunch!  The place wasn't at all hard to find because you could see the line from down the street.  Since we were only two, the wait to get seated was only ~20-30 minutes. Decor - The place is actually 3 stories! (damn, Grimaldi's)  And tables are spaced out enough so that we didn't get jolted as we were eating. Food - price is about $14 base +$2 for toppings which I think is totally reasonable given the size.  We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, olives, and extra cheese along with a beer each to wash everything down.   Now I think that this pizza (especially with so many toppings) is meant to be eating with a fork.  The dough part is thin (as according to NY style) and gets soggy.  I mostly ended up eating the toppings first, scooping the dough into my mouth, and munching on the crust.  Didn't mind though - it was pretty good!Will come back when there's time.  A 30 minute wait with good company is reasonable, but probably not worth more than an hour's wait when hungry. (hilariously, a pizza place opened next to Grimaldi's to take advantage of this drawback.)",5.0
"Memories came back after eating here the other day. I've been to Grimaldis a few times when I was younger and the pizza lived up to it. People are saying this is a tourist trap. I don't know if they got a bad pie or what but it's definitely worth a try atleast once. Forgetabout the pepperoni it's small and makes the pizza way too greasy. Stick to a simple plain pie or a sausage and peppers pie. (Their crumbled sausage is really good) don't overload these pies with toppings do that when you go to your regular place, too many toppings will make the crust mushy. For instance one pie we got had mushrooms sun dried tomatoes and garlic and it made the crust a little soggy. (Taste was there texture wasn't). I'm not counting service in my review because honestly all of the workers were jerks and were rude. I wasn't surprised though. I came for the pizza not the atmosphere or guidos running the place so the service will slide for this one.",4.0
"Oh, Grimaldi's you let me down the second time.The first visit my out-of-town friend and I LOVED. Delicious sauce, fresh cheese and basil, cooked to perfection. We devoured the entire pie and then walked the Brooklyn bridge to burn it off.The next year we went back. Luckily both times on a Wed. night, with no line at all. We were greatly disappointed. The sauce was not the same, there was less cheese and the crust was burned, wayy overcooked.  It was like a totally different pizza we didn't even want to finish this time. :(Perhaps they cut back and cheapened their ingredients? Too bad because I won't be returning. If in Brooklyn by the bridge, it is good to try once...Hopefully their better qualitly returns.",3.0

"Forget the others. Grimaldi's makes the best pie in Brooklyn. Phoney foodies looking for pies with tofu, pear emulsion and free range truffles can find them at any number of fly-by-night trendy pizza spots, but for a full on traditional, delicious Italian-American pie, Grimaldi's is the best around.

"A NY friend recommended this place and I've also seen it on Food Network so naturally we had to try it. Plus, there's a feud of which has the better pizza, Grimaldi's or Lombardi's.

About 45-60 min wait in hot hot Brooklyn during Memorial day weekend.....the line moved soooo slow, and of course, the inside seats only like 60 people.The pizza sauce was not as fresh tasting. Though you can see them make the pizza right before your eyes, the sauce and the basil did not excited. There was wayyy too much cheese and NOT ENOUGH SAUCE!! The ratio was all off!!

"$12 regular pizza, $18 regular white pizza with two toppings of Italian sausage and mushrooms.Phew, got there around 6pm and had an hour long wait in the cold of Brooklyn. The place is pretty cool, with artwork and a nice finish to the decor that makes it feel spacious but still cozy.The pizza itself was actually a little bit of a disappointment, perhaps just a bad day or an insensitive palate or overhyped expectations. The pizza's ingredients tasted really fresh, and it was nice and hot out of the oven within say 10 minutes of ordering, which was great. The service was also pretty fast, which is no surprise for a place that was so busy.That said, the components of the pizza just didn't come together for me. The mozzarella was fresh and had a nice melt to it, but was far too bland for me. Even the white pizza, with the garlic and herb seasoning tasted pretty bland without the toppings of mushroom and sausage, which really saved the pizza for me. The tomato sauce on the regular pizza was too little and didn't bring out much flavor. Last of all, the crust, for all that people keep raving about, really didn't appeal to me. It was blackened in some areas, and for the most part too hard and too much of it on the pizza. Was really looking forward to crust that had some crisp to the outside but still soft on the inside.For the price and the wait, it just wasn't worth it for me. It was fresh, and tasted decent, but just not outstanding enough to warrant the hype and cost around it. Sorry Grimaldi's!",3.0

"This pizza is fine, but this is New York, there's lots of good pizza. It makes absolutely no sense to wait in line for Grimaldi's, unless you want to spend your time with grumpy tourists getting in line because they were told to by their guidebooks.",3.0
"Grimaldi's was just regular pizza. Maybe even worse because I would actually eat regular pizza. I mean, it is brick oven pizza but there was nothing special. There was not much sauce on our pizza and it ended up to be a little dry.Thing is, it was so dry that I felt the need to put on some peppers and garlic and even that didn't help. Some of my acquaintances who came with me said ""good pizza doesn't need condiments."" This pizza couldn't even be saved with condiments. They all ""ate it with orgasmic pleasure,"" but I came here with my best friend and he said it was terrible too. So I don't know if the rest put on a facade or they actually enjoy eating pita bread with cheese and sausage on it.",1.0
Nothing too spectacular. It was just average pizza to me. Need to know:_Order the pizza to go (avoid the line) and eat it on on dock under the Brooklyn Bridge,3.0
"The first time I came to NYC a few months ago, I headed to Grimaldi's after several recommendations.  I didn't end up eating there because the line was ridiculous, so I headed next door.I'm visiting NYC again, so I decided to give Grimaldi's another chance.  I went on a Saturday night when it was threatening to rain, and I ended up waiting for less than 5 minutes.We ordered a small pie for 2  and added pepperoni and ricotta.  We didn't have to wait too long for our pizza to get there.  While the crust was thin and crisp and I do like a little bit of char to my crust, I think ours was almost too charred in some spots.  Additionally, the mozzarella on our pizza was very chewy and thick and not gooey like you would expect it to be when just coming out of the oven.  Not sure if they let it sit too long before bringing it.  The other toppings and flavors were pretty good, but the mozzarella thing was disappointing.Another disappointment is their insistence on being a cash only place.  Seriously, it's 2013 and you still refuse to take cash?Overall, my Grimaldi's experience was good, but not great.  If you want to get basically the same pizza (but better IMO), while avoiding the typical wait and cash only policy, go to Juliana's next door.",3.0
"I recently came here for a weekday dinner after about a year long hiatus, and my mind was blown. The place was newly renovated and became so much larger and cleaner! Most importantly, there was no wait! I assume it was because it was a weekday and because the place became large enough to accommodate more people. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant change for me. The pizza itself, however, was exactly the way I remembered it to be. Everything is cooked to perfection- the crust, toppings, sauce, etc. Although the service isn't that great, I really can't complain about any other aspect of this place. I can say with confidence that this is one of the best pizza parlors in the city, along with Di Fara and Bleecker Street Pizza.",5.0
"GRIMALDI'S CHANGED MY LIFE!We got the small pizza with nothing but basil, tomato sauce, and fresh mozzerellea (their standard pizza). It seriously CHANGED MY LIFE! I can't eat pizza the same anymore! Okay, all I can say is the pizza is really AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!! I dream about it sometimes, SERIOUSLY, NO JOKE! I stare at pictures that I took of the pizza...I'd also like to point out at this point that I'm not crazy, thank you. :)We had the most interesting time here, besides the pizza being wonderful, we sat next to what I think was a newly wed couple, literally it looked like they had just said their vows like an hour ago, now get this, the couple looked like they were 17 years old! They were there with 2 friends (obviously friends of the bride) and parents from both sides. The sad part, the groom looked so, incredibly, sad. He just sat there, didn't say a word and the bride did all the talking, ordering, just everything. Me and my friend couldn't help but try to figure out the background of that situation. LOL. To the couple that was there that day, best of luck to you and your new marriage...cause that boy did NOT look happy! But yes, PIZZA here is A+++++++++!",5.0
"Overrated tourist trap?The pizza here wasn't that great. The toppings were good, I'll give them that.. but the center of my pizza was literally soggy and kind of even cold.

I'll do that! Standing in line for the pizza took 30-40 minutes. Luckily, I chatted with a Bonny and John from Wisconsin. Nice people, they were. And then I got to go to the front of the line because I had a take-out order. So. You're not allowed to order just ONE slice of pizza. I didn't find out until I was 25 minutes into my wait, by which point, I just told myself I'd just have to eat the entire small pizza (6 slices, so what?). This is what I get for not having a smart phone and making spontaneous decisions. I got the small regular. It was good, but maybe it's that I'm not used to coal brick oven pizzas, but I was expecting there to be more... of ... well, just more. More basil? More sauce? More...deliciousness? I went to a nearby park, enjoyed the beautiful weather as I munched on my pizza (succeeded in finishing off 3 slices), carried the other half as I walked across the bridge and gave it to the nice Pedestrian Guard who in return, took a picture of me on the bridge.

"Such a great location near the park... I brought my husband and sister in law here on her visit to the city.  She wanted some authentic NY pizza, and we were not disappointed in our experience.  We waited in line for maybe an hour and a half on a Saturday night, and our order took a while to get to our table, but the pizza was really yummy and the atmosphere was fun.  You can see them making the pizzas with their hands, the big brick oven, and all the fresh mozzarella behind a sneeze guard.  They also had a bar... I don't know if you have to wait in line for the bar top, but you did for take out, so probably for the bar, too...We got two pizzas, and enjoyed both topping combos, but found the pepperoni to be quite greasy.  The antipasti was a nice start to calm our ravenous hunger after waiting in line and then another wait for a freshly baked pizza.  Beer, wine, and local sodas are the beverage list. A little pricey.  My husband still raves about the pizza. It was even more delicious cold the next day.  No credit cards, no slices, no reservations, no delivery.",4.0
"This is a famous pizza place in New York so definitely stopped by this place for their pizza. I love pizza!! The reasons why I gave this place three stars include many different factors. First of all, this is a very popular place so the wait time is absolutely long. We waited in the very cold weather for 1 hour before we were able to sit in the restaurant. Therefore, I had my expectation high when I walked in. Secondly, the menu was very simple which had one appetizer, drinks, and many pizza toppings to choose. The ordering process was rather simple because there were not many items to pick. We ordered the appetizer and a medium size pizza with mushroom, onion, and Italian sausage. I like how it was very easy to order and straightforward. The pizza came out and looked pretty good. However, it was a bit cold. I was expecting fresh out of oven hot so that kinda lost few points there. After we tried the pizza, the flavor was a bit too weak for our taste buds. All the toppings were high quality but they did not go very well together on the pizza. I loved their mozzarella cheese!!! I loved how light the pizza was with their fresh ingredients, compared to American pizza. But the flavor was really not as strong as I was expected. Overall, the pizza did not ""WOW"" me with their flavor. However, the freshness and quality of their toppings were perfect for their pizza. If we would order different toppings for our pizza, the pizza might taste complete different and could over turn my ratings. For this particular visit, I would give a 3 stars; however, I could see how other people rate it higher.I did like their pizza even though it was not like what I was expected. I appreciate that they kept the traditional method of baking the pizza and the old school restaurant style. However, the wait for 1 hour in the cold weather did affect my rating and experience in the restaurant. I would still recommend visitors and tourists to try this place; however, be prepare for the wait and be open minded to try a different style of pizza.",3.0

Fruitful fresh, hearty tomato sauce, nice spices, like oregano that you actually taste, quality cheese. How so they rate on these criteria? Chewy, rather thick crust, a little rubberlike. Tasteless, loveless tomato sauce. Cheap, (fake?) cheese. Pepperoni was good. So overall not too great. Certainly nothing special. And absolutely not worth an hour wait. Tastes are different, but this is my opinion: save the time.",2.0
"I didn't actually go to the restaurant. My husband and BIL ordered it to go. So I ate an almost cold mushroom and pepperoni pizza, and it was still good. IMO that says a lot. I will have to come back to NY and try it again.",3.0
Kudos to Grimaldi's for building such a strong brand and presence in NYC tour guide books - clearly the only reasons there's ALWAYS a line out the door (I should know - I live a couple of blocks away.)Used to be a huge fan and have watched in horror as the sad thing that happens to most culinary successes in this city happened - a complete slide downhill.This pizza truly does NOT taste good anymore by any objective standard. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because takeaway takes 10-15 minutes despite the lines. I'll gladly take advantage of the speed again when the product gets better!,2.0
"Such a great location near the park... I brought my husband and sister in law here on her visit to the city.  She wanted some authentic NY pizza, and we were not disappointed in our experience.  We waited in line for maybe an hour and a half on a Saturday night, and our order took a while to get to our table, but the pizza was really yummy and the atmosphere was fun.  You can see them making the pizzas with their hands, the big brick oven, and all the fresh mozzarella behind a sneeze guard.  They also had a bar... I don't know if you have to wait in line for the bar top, but you did for take out, so probably for the bar, too...We got two pizzas, and enjoyed both topping combos, but found the pepperoni to be quite greasy.  The antipasti was a nice start to calm our ravenous hunger after waiting in line and then another wait for a freshly baked pizza.  Beer, wine, and local sodas are the beverage list. A little pricey.  My husband still raves about the pizza. It was even more delicious cold the next day.  No credit cards, no slices, no reservations, no delivery.",4.0
"This is a famous pizza place in New York so definitely stopped by this place for their pizza. I love pizza!! The reasons why I gave this place three stars include many different factors. First of all, this is a very popular place so the wait time is absolutely long. We waited in the very cold weather for 1 hour before we were able to sit in the restaurant. Therefore, I had my expectation high when I walked in. Secondly, the menu was very simple which had one appetizer, drinks, and many pizza toppings to choose. The ordering process was rather simple because there were not many items to pick. We ordered the appetizer and a medium size pizza with mushroom, onion, and Italian sausage. I like how it was very easy to order and straightforward. The pizza came out and looked pretty good. However, it was a bit cold. I was expecting fresh out of oven hot so that kinda lost few points there. After we tried the pizza, the flavor was a bit too weak for our taste buds. All the toppings were high quality but they did not go very well together on the pizza. I loved their mozzarella cheese!!! I loved how light the pizza was with their fresh ingredients, compared to American pizza. But the flavor was really not as strong as I was expected. Overall, the pizza did not ""WOW"" me with their flavor. However, the freshness and quality of their toppings were perfect for their pizza. If we would order different toppings for our pizza, the pizza might taste complete different and could over turn my ratings. For this particular visit, I would give a 3 stars; however, I could see how other people rate it higher.I did like their pizza even though it was not like what I was expected. I appreciate that they kept the traditional method of baking the pizza and the old school restaurant style. However, the wait for 1 hour in the cold weather did affect my rating and experience in the restaurant. I would still recommend visitors and tourists to try this place; however, be prepare for the wait and be open minded to try a different style of pizza.",3.0

"I live in NY and have always avoided coming here because I heard how awful the lines were.  I don't care how good anything is, I am not waiting on a line for over an hour.With that being said, I finally went with a visiting friend in January.  The lines were OK, still out the door, but I only needed to wait about 15 minutes.I was so excited because I heard how amazing this pizza was...unfortunately, the pizza was not nearly as good as I was lead on to believe.  The pizza was good, but not crispy (soggy actually).  The toppings were OK, but nothing special.  I am so happy I didn't wait online for over an hour because I would have been very pissed.I think at some point this place was awesome, but perhaps the more famous it got the more it compromised itself.  The problem is, the myth of this place is so powerful and ingrained in NYC folklore that perhaps it added to the taste like a seasoning would.I wouldn't stop anyone from trying this place, but I'd at least try to lower their expectations.  At least that way, they can decide if it's worth the line.",3.0

"Very, very good coal brick-oven pizza! Pizza comes out quickly and is incredibly fresh. They also use good quality sausage! It's not the best pizza I've had in New York, but very much worth a try.

"I have been to this place a few times. Most times I have had to wait outside on a line, which the food and service definitely did not justify. True, the pizza is pretty good artisanal brick-oven pizza, but the tacky Italian-American decor (THAT much Sinatra?

People love lines, and when they wait on one forever they sometimes justify it retrospectively by trying to like the place more than it deserves, and I think Grimaldi's is a perfect example of this.Instead of the hike to DUMBO, and waiting on line with tourists, try checking out either a nicer restaurant in Carroll Gardens which would cost the same, or better pizza at any of the nice, cheap, friendly pizza places and artisanal pizza shops all over the borough.In my opinion, Lucali's beats Grimaldi's any day.",2.0

"Yes, I am very late to try Grimaldi's, sorry jeez! I've heard many mixed reviews about this place, which is why I have been so hesitant to try it.  On top of that, every time I'm around the DUMBO area the weather is warm and everyone is hopping on the ridiculous line and I'm not the type to wait 2 hours for a slice of pizza.  So fortunately for me I didn't have to wait because the weather was cold.  To my surprise, their pizza was pleasantly delightful.

Well, the inevitable lines had daunted me before, so this time, my friend Carlos and I decided to go there at 10PM on a weeknight since they close at 11. If you can hold out that long, that's the key since the place is fairly empty at that hour on a Wednesday. In fact, we got the table next to the window, so we were quite happy and had moved from peckish to bulimic with our respective appetites. There was no doubt we were going for the 18-inch Large for $14. We asked for mushrooms and black olives, as well as sausage on half of it. Each extra ingredient costs an additional $2. It already comes with melted slices of fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, and their freshly made dough. Our order came out in no time, and the result was sheer heaven (see my photo). Dare I repeat the obvious...it's the best New York-style pizza I've had since my first slice of Original Ray's during the early Reagan years. The secret is their coal-fired brick oven where in a flash, the pizza picks up a smokiness and the crust becomes light and crisp. We devoured it in twenty minutes...tops (see sad result in my photo). We even got a free dessert since the waiter forgot to get us our post-pizza cappuccinos. It was their Tartufo, a frozen ice cream concoction shaped like a chocolate-covered apple with a jammy center (see my photo). That was gone in about five minutes. Service was terrifically friendly. The Italiano waiter told us the daily special was pizza. While I love a walk on the Brooklyn Bridge as much as anyone else, it becomes less appealing at night with the temperature dipping below thirty. We took the A-train to High Street where the stroll down to Old Fulton Street was a breeze. Try it for yourself...now that's New York. FOOD - 5 stars...pizza my heart AMBIANCE - 4 stars...checkered tablecloths, old photos of Sinatra...get the picture, paisan? (see my photo)SERVICE - 4.5 stars...friendly like you're a real goombah TOTAL - 5 stars...let's face it, it's the must-go pizza stop in NYC",5.0
Not even close to being the best pizza in this neighborhood.  Save yourself the wait and go next door to either Juliana's or Ignazios!,3.0
"Yes, I am very late to try Grimaldi's, sorry jeez! I've heard many mixed reviews about this place, which is why I have been so hesitant to try it.  On top of that, every time I'm around the DUMBO area the weather is warm and everyone is hopping on the ridiculous line and I'm not the type to wait 2 hours for a slice of pizza.  So fortunately for me I didn't have to wait because the weather was cold.  To my surprise, their pizza was pleasantly delightful. I think the rich flavor of the tomato sauce beats Lombardi's any day. I would definitely come back, but only if there isn't a wait.  Do I need to keep emphasizing that? lol",4.0
"Buncha hype. I got lucky and didn't have to wait in the legendary lines. When I got in, the waiter was rude and inattentive. There were other waitstaff with whom I had good interactions but our waiter was the worst.The pizza itself? Again, overhyped. There are so many places in Brooklyn to get pizza that I can't understand why someone would subject themselves to long waits for sub-par quality. Do yourself a favor and skip this place and head to Ribalta near Union Squre. This place is not worth the time or money.",2.0
"Great tasting pizza!  The calzones are great too! Only downside is, there is usually wait on the weekends.  In my opinion, it's definitely worth the wait if you have time.  I would return!",4.0
"The pizza is good, BUT the service is the worst we have ever received. The drunkard at the door, Ralphie, randomly selected people to be seated; order didn't matter. He yelled at one person in our group, which caused many people in line to leave ...in retrospect, we should have done the same. The servers were if the grumpy kind, too. Go to the place next door, they'll greet you with a smile.",1.0
"Who ever said this is best pizza, well does not know anything about pizza.I found this pizza to below average. Service downright terrible.Back in the day I used to live in Brooklyn in Bensohurst/Dyker Heights area and back then it used to be Italian area, any corner pizza shop was putting out 100% better pizza. This place is nothing more then tourist trap, plus cash only really rubs me the wrong way.",2.0
"Every time I walk by Grimaldi's and see a jaw dropping long line down the block, I can't help but feel sad. The pizza does not live up to the hype, and certainly doesn't live up to the sometimes over-an-hour wait. Try Lombardi's in NoLita across the bridge (I can already hear the ""you shut your mouth""'s). The pizza at Grimaldi's was fine. It's not bad pizza. It's just not special enough that you ignore the other bajillion amazing pizza joints in NYC. Wait once for the 'experience' but certainly never again.",3.0
A bit overrated but it was a decent pie. I wouldn't wait the 45-60 minutes outside on the streets again though.,3.0

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the wait however you have to do it at least once. The pizza is incredible and worth the 1 hour wait just not something you want to have to do all the time. Highly recommend and at least while you wait it's a nice view.,4.0
"Be able prepared to wait but also be prepared for one of the best pizzas ever.  Waited just under an hour but worth the wait.  Ordered 2 large pizzas, one cheese and one with sausage, pepperoni & ham.  Both were outstanding.  Crust to-2-die-4, amazing sauces, and topping were perfect.  Order 4 different desserts and each was excellent.  Next time we are visit NYC this is on the ""got to b there"" list.",5.0

"Overall, pretty damn good NY pizza at Grimaldi's.  We didn't have to wait long at lunchtime on a Thursday, and once inside the service was swift (occasionally maybe a bit impersonal with how many people they shuffle through).But the real reason you're out here -- the pizza -- is worth the trip.  For the two of us, a small pizza was plenty of food, and I'd save the large for a group of at least three or four.  Everything about it was foldable, delicious and mozzarella-dripping.Grimaldi's is a great example of an iconic NY eaterie that has made it big and scaled well to its popularity (unlike some other places).  We'd definitely come back.",4.0

"It is hard not to leave Grimaldi's disappointed these days.

Grimaldi's is at a crossroads. It can either go back to the basics, perfect pizzas in a smaller location, or continue its decline and hope for a future in fast food franchising while its name is still synonymous with pizza. With every passing day as an inferior pizza joint guidebooks are changing their reviews and less locals are  willing to give Grimaldi's a second chance.",2.0

"""Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and then have some pizza in Brooklyn"" seemed to be the agenda for most tourists on that day...and you'd probably be tempted to do the same like I was. WARNING: Do not go here if you are already hungry! We waited 20 minutes for a table, then another 20-25 minutes for the food to arrive. Ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and mushrooms. The pizza ingredients were each good on their own, but together something was just missing - maybe not enough fresh basil or spices? I don't know, I just didn't feel the Grimaldi's magic. Service was horrendous. Our waiter practically disappeared after bringing our order, so we had to ask two different people for water refills and the check. I wouldn't come back unless there was no line.",3.0
"Pros: The pizza is delicious and the toppings are super fresh. Closest to real Italian pizza you can get outside of Italy. Love the soda selection. Prices are also decent.Cons: The wait. Don't come here if you don't like waiting. I've been to Grimaldi's four times, and I don't think I've ever spent less than two hours from the back of the line to exiting after the meal. Not only is the line long, but service is slow and it takes forever to pay the bill. It's nearly impossible to get a waiter's attention. Last time I was there, I asked for water and never got it. One of the doors in the bathroom was broken last time I was there too, and there was no toilet paper in that stall. The pizza also always gets cold before I finish it. Tips: Don't ask for ridiculous toppings that aren't on the menu. If it's not on the menu, it's insulting to ask for it.Parties of 4 usually get called in ahead of parties of 2. Take-out is put in a paper bag, not a box.Even though it has its flaws, I always suggest Grimaldi's to my friends from out of town, because it's just great pizza.",3.0
"My friends and I, in a party of 4, wanted to try REAL New York pizza, so why not start with Grimaldi's? We ordered one large regular pizza (18"" diameter) with sausage and mushroom. As with all mushroom dishes, the mushroom has a very strong taste, but thankfully  it didn't overpower the other ingredients. In the pizza you could definitely tell the freshness of the mozzarella, which brought somewhat of a tart to the otherwise savory dish.Our waiter was okay. I was hoping for better service, but he did not once check up on us or gave us a water refill.",3.0
"-Waited way too long-Service sucked-Pizza was good, didn't blow me awayWe waited well over an hour for our pizzas to come AFTER we were seated. Don't even remind me about the wait to GET seated.

It's a shame the pizza couldn't save this place that extra star. I was surprised by the bill though, less than $100 after tax and tip for 5 pies.",3.0
"My wife and I recently stopped here as part of the ""A Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour"" (highly recommend!) and really enjoyed the pizza.  This is one of the best slices of margherita pizza (neopolitan style) we've ever had, for sure!  The sauce is plain (just San Marzano tomatoes) but paired with the wonderful fresh mozzarella and basil, it was simple and delicious!  And the crust is absolutely outstanding!  Crisp and thin!  We ate at the ""Under the Brooklyn Bridge"" location which has the bonus of being located in a historic building and also within a block of a wonderful view of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan skyline.Positives: Excellent crust, delicious enough to stand on its own (tomatoes, cheese, basil...that's all you need), historic building and great view of Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridge just oustide the door.Negatives: Depending on the day/time, you may have to wait in line for a while.  Luckily we had no wait due to the tour we were on which had exclusive access to bypass the line.",5.0
"I always pass by Grimaldi's everytime I am around the neighborhood, but I never had the urge to stand in the long line for pizza.

We ordered a medium pizza that had pepperoni, mushroom and extra cheese. The pizza smelled wonderful, and looked really tasty. I picked up a slice of pizza, and to my surprise the crust was soggy! I have never encountered or eaten a pizza that had a soggy crust before so I was really disappointed with Grimaldi's (as this was a place that was highly praised). Another disappointment was that the pizzas were not made by the owners of the pizzeria, but by people they hired (whom they probably pay low wages to while they themselves keep a large chunk of the profits). My favorite pizzeria is still Di Fara's; it may be overpriced but he makes his own pizzas and the crust is not soggy at all!I think Grimaldi's is overrated, and definitely not worth the hours of wait.",2.0
"We were on vacation and this place was highly recommended by quite a few of the locals, and they were right, this place was absolutely the best by far. Would highly recommend eating here, I will definitely be back the next time a visit New York!",5.0
"It is hard not to leave Grimaldi's disappointed these days. It takes over 30 mins for the pies to get to you after ordering, the new location lacks charm and is in need of a renovation, the oven is inferior and too hot, leading to invariably burnt crust and obliterated basil, and all the while you wish you had just gone to Juliana's. Grimaldi's is at a crossroads. It can either go back to the basics, perfect pizzas in a smaller location, or continue its decline and hope for a future in fast food franchising while its name is still synonymous with pizza. With every passing day as an inferior pizza joint guidebooks are changing their reviews and less locals are  willing to give Grimaldi's a second chance.",2.0
"Worth the journey and the queue? Yep I would say so, although obviously still not a patch on a pizza in Rome. Grimaldi's is a tiny Pizza restaurant but the queue was stretched down the street lucky for us we jumped the queue as there were a number of big groups ahead of us and we were happy to be seated and eating. The service was less Disney than you get in Manhattan which suited us much more and some fun music made for a fun lunch. We didn't go large but were regretting it since the pizza was great.",4.0

"""Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and then have some pizza in Brooklyn"" seemed to be the agenda for most tourists on that day...and you'd probably be tempted to do the same like I was. WARNING: Do not go here if you are already hungry! We waited 20 minutes for a table, then another 20-25 minutes for the food to arrive. Ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and mushrooms. The pizza ingredients were each good on their own, but together something was just missing - maybe not enough fresh basil or spices? I don't know, I just didn't feel the Grimaldi's magic. Service was horrendous. Our waiter practically disappeared after bringing our order, so we had to ask two different people for water refills and the check. I wouldn't come back unless there was no line.",3.0
"Pros: The pizza is delicious and the toppings are super fresh. Closest to real Italian pizza you can get outside of Italy. Love the soda selection. Prices are also decent.Cons: The wait. Don't come here if you don't like waiting. I've been to Grimaldi's four times, and I don't think I've ever spent less than two hours from the back of the line to exiting after the meal. Not only is the line long, but service is slow and it takes forever to pay the bill. It's nearly impossible to get a waiter's attention. Last time I was there, I asked for water and never got it. One of the doors in the bathroom was broken last time I was there too, and there was no toilet paper in that stall. The pizza also always gets cold before I finish it. Tips: Don't ask for ridiculous toppings that aren't on the menu. If it's not on the menu, it's insulting to ask for it.Parties of 4 usually get called in ahead of parties of 2. Take-out is put in a paper bag, not a box.Even though it has its flaws, I always suggest Grimaldi's to my friends from out of town, because it's just great pizza.",3.0
"My friends and I, in a party of 4, wanted to try REAL New York pizza, so why not start with Grimaldi's? We ordered one large regular pizza (18"" diameter) with sausage and mushroom. As with all mushroom dishes, the mushroom has a very strong taste, but thankfully  it didn't overpower the other ingredients. In the pizza you could definitely tell the freshness of the mozzarella, which brought somewhat of a tart to the otherwise savory dish.Our waiter was okay. I was hoping for better service, but he did not once check up on us or gave us a water refill.",3.0
"-Waited way too long-Service sucked-Pizza was good, didn't blow me awayWe waited well over an hour for our pizzas to come AFTER we were seated. Don't even remind me about the wait to GET seated. The pizza was good, it wasn't typical greasy NYC pizza, and the crust was not too crispy and not too chewy and had an amazing subtle smoky flavor. It's a shame the pizza couldn't save this place that extra star. I was surprised by the bill though, less than $100 after tax and tip for 5 pies.",3.0
"My wife and I recently stopped here as part of the ""A Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour"" (highly recommend!) and really enjoyed the pizza.  This is one of the best slices of margherita pizza (neopolitan style) we've ever had, for sure!  The sauce is plain (just San Marzano tomatoes) but paired with the wonderful fresh mozzarella and basil, it was simple and delicious!  And the crust is absolutely outstanding!  Crisp and thin!  We ate at the ""Under the Brooklyn Bridge"" location which has the bonus of being located in a historic building and also within a block of a wonderful view of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan skyline.Positives: Excellent crust, delicious enough to stand on its own (tomatoes, cheese, basil...that's all you need), historic building and great view of Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridge just oustide the door.Negatives: Depending on the day/time, you may have to wait in line for a while.  Luckily we had no wait due to the tour we were on which had exclusive access to bypass the line.",5.0

"Ever since I moved to New York, I've probably heard the phrase ""You've gotta go to Grimaldi's"" once a week. I finally went with my boyfriend this past Sunday, and wow: I see why NY is famous for its pizza.We arrived after a pleasant stroll over the Brooklyn Bridge and said to each other,""Are you hungry?""""No. Are you?""""No. Wanna go get pizza?""""I'm already looking up directions on my iPhone.""So we started our quest towards Grimaldi's. It was a bit difficult to find since we over-shot it coming off the bridge, but eventually, we found it... and were confronted with an intimidating line out the door. Neither of us our patient people; we decided to wait fifteen minutes, and see how we felt after that.The problem was that we both had to use the restroom. When we went inside, the line for the restroom was right next to the oven. So, while waiting to pee... all I smelled was fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil, while my face was warmed from the heat out of the oven. I almost forgot I had to pee. It was then that I knew that no matter how long the wait was, we'd be eating there.Luckily, since we were a party of two, we were seated earlier than expected. We ordered pizza and mushrooms with the pizza... and ten minutes later, we were in pizza heaven. Fresh chewy-cheese mozzarella. Thin and chewy-- and not at all crispy-- crust. Fresh barely-burnt basil. Lightly drizzled olive oil. Even though the crust was half-burnt (uneven flame distribution), it was still excellent without much charcoal taste. I bet it would have tasted even better, actually, without the toppings because the pie was just that good.Yup: best pizza in New York that I've had, yet. It's a Must Eat when in NY. Five stars, all for the food! The service was mediocre, but to be honest, I wasn't paying attention since I couldn't stop thinking about the pizza.The pertinent details:- Total wait time: 30 minutes (Sunday around 1pm)- Line is outdoors: bring a coat- Take out is same line as eat in- No half pizzas or slices- Cash only, not many banks near by- Does not taste as good re-heated, but still adequate- To get here: take the stairs where the Brooklyn Bridge forks, go towards Brooklyn Heights- Crowded quarters: you'll love your neighbors for sure!

"Grimaldi's is over-hyped. My expectations were extremely high, and my experience was less than satisfying. Thankfully, I came on a Thursday afternoon around 3:30pm, when there was only one other party ahead in line. The wait was about 10 minutes, which was not bad at all, considering the stories I've heard about people trying to get seated.It took the waiter over 15 minutes to take our order, which was only one large pizza. We ordered our pizza with sausage and mushrooms. When it came after 30 minutes, I was less than impressed. The pizza, quite frankly, was tasteless. The tomato sauce was bland, and the only flavor came from the crumbled sausage, which was one of the only decent aspects of the meal. While I liked the consistency and thinness of the crust, I expected the sweet charred flavor that the crust at Lombardi's has. This pizza had none.The service was also sub-par. In addition for taking a long time to take our order, it also took them a long time to bring us the check. No one checked in on us to inquire about our meal or if we needed refills on drinks.I'm glad I waited so long to give Grimaldi's a try. I'm also disappointed that it was such a letdown. I don't think I'll be returning. If you want coal oven pizza, I suggest going to Lombardi's instead.  The food and service is immensely better, and let's face it - you'll be waiting in line regardless of whichever place you choose.",2.0

It was worth it since I never walked across the Brooklyn Bridge.I came at a good time because the line outside wasn't long. While I was eating in the restaurant, the sun also started to shine after a rainy morning.I would recommend getting half-half (tomato sauce and non-tomato sauce). Any of the toppings are good. The pie we got took about 10 minutes to come out.

We always ignore it and head to Manhattan during the weekends.. So we came to Grimladi's once on a Sunday evening around 6.. The line is super long and I guess we waited for at least 45 minutes to an hour?? I am not sure.. I am too hungry to think about it.. I am glad that I am here with all of my AWESOME friends to keep me away from complaining.. The weather is extremely hot and sunny!!! I haven't had a good meal for the whole day and I was extremely grumpy!!!!!! Grrrrr....Their business model is a little weird where we have to stand and wait in a line instead of writing our names into a list. The pizza was served in less than 15 minutes.. 5 minutes later the large pizza was gone!!!!!!! That explained how hungry we were!!! My guy friend gave me the largest piece of pizza which I did not realize because I am way too hungry... I am too lazy to rate the pizza since I am extremely hungry.. the only thing that was on my mind is to EAT!!!! so.. my first bite.. Mmmmmm.... great pizza... so i continue eating it... ""So.. Do you prefer Grimaldi's or Lombardi's???""... After filling my stomach with half slice of the pizza... It makes me stop and think for a second.. My experience with Grimaldi's is good.. I am not a huge pizza fan.. but something tells me that I prefer Lombardi's pizza compare to Grimaldi's.. I guess the cheese and the ingredients that used to make the pizza might be different??? I feel that the cheese in Lombardi's pizza is fresh and there is a weird taste in Grimaldi's pizza.. (well if I really have to compare since that was the question..) Put it this way... I give Grimaldi's a 5 stars because the taste of the pizza is good as well!!! :) and it's not expensive as Lombardi's.. it's almost half of the price..

My girl friend and I had tried Lombardi's before this and we keep saying that Lombardi's will definitely be better!!!Since Grimaldi's is located 15 minutes walk away from our apartment.. We always ignore it and head to Manhattan during the weekends.. So we came to Grimladi's once on a Sunday evening around 6.. The line is super long and I guess we waited for at least 45 minutes to an hour?? I am not sure.. I am too hungry to think about it.. I am glad that I am here with all of my AWESOME friends to keep me away from complaining.. The weather is extremely hot and sunny!!! I haven't had a good meal for the whole day and I was extremely grumpy!!!!!! Grrrrr....Their business model is a little weird where we have to stand and wait in a line instead of writing our names into a list. The pizza was served in less than 15 minutes.. 5 minutes later the large pizza was gone!!!!!!! That explained how hungry we were!!! My guy friend gave me the largest piece of pizza which I did not realize because I am way too hungry... I am too lazy to rate the pizza since I am extremely hungry.. the only thing that was on my mind is to EAT!!!! so.. my first bite.. Mmmmmm.... great pizza... so i continue eating it... ""So.. Do you prefer Grimaldi's or Lombardi's???""... After filling my stomach with half slice of the pizza... It makes me stop and think for a second.. My experience with Grimaldi's is good.. I am not a huge pizza fan.. but something tells me that I prefer Lombardi's pizza compare to Grimaldi's.. I guess the cheese and the ingredients that used to make the pizza might be different??? I feel that the cheese in Lombardi's pizza is fresh and there is a weird taste in Grimaldi's pizza.. (well if I really have to compare since that was the question..) Put it this way... I give Grimaldi's a 5 stars because the taste of the pizza is good as well!!! :) and it's not expensive as Lombardi's.. it's almost half of the price.. The dollar value that I spend and the amount of the time I have waited to get a table.. So.. if you ever want to save some money & don't mind the waiting for a good pizza.. COME TO GRIMALDI!!!",5.0
"So my friend that we were visiting, had this on our ""must do's"" while we were in town, and who was I to disobey?  This place has a line, and luckily for us, it wasn't too extremely bad this day, and it has a great view right next door, which helps to pass the time.Anyways, it was definitely worth the wait, the food was great!! I was told that this is one of the older pizzerias in town, nice little family owned spot. I am glad we had a chance to visit here, put it on your list when you visit NYC",4.0
"Had a great time walking over the Brooklyn Bridge and down to Grimaldi's. We showed up late afternoon and there was a very short line. The place is actually pretty big inside. We were seated upstairs. The inside is nothing exciting. Very basic, old. The pizza was exactly what we expected based on the all of the good reviews we read. Awesome traditional NYC think crust pizza. It wasn't to die for, but it was really tasty, and fun to visit such an iconic pizza joint. Jimmy was helping manage the place that day and he is fully of personality. He even let my 12 year old borrow his basketball, so he could go play pick up ball down the street.  I would def recommend a visit to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn or NYC.. If you go to the Brooklyn location, consider walking the bridge like we did. Amazing views of the East River, Lady Liberty, and the NYC Skyline. We took a ferry back to the city. The Dumbo district along the river is a fun place to stroll around.",5.0

"Sad to say, I was expecting so much more. Grimaldi's is a chain and because of that will go into the chain category of mediocre food that was once good but is sub par at best. The dough is too chewy even though it's thin crust, the basil isn't fresh and used sparingly and the cheese is so damn heavy even though it's fresh.There's no way I'd wait in line again to eat here. I'd rather grab street pizza in the city. Also, it's cash only. Really? I've been to hole in the wall pizzerias that accepted cc.Don't believe the hype. If you want real pizza, go to Lucali.",2.0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  Got to go to the orig. location in Dumbo.  Best pizza in NYC!  Well worth the wait in the long ass line, however here is a trick-- you can call the store and order take out and guess what?  You can skip the line and go right in to pick up your order :)",5.0

I did not check Yelp first, so I was not expecting the huge line! Ok , it must be damn good then right? WRONG. It's just decent. Mediocre pizza. Not worth waiting twenty minutes for that is for sure and what place doesn't take credit cards in this day and age unless they are lying on their taxes????? Grab a friend and Pizza hop all over Brooklyn, skip this spot unless you just want to say you ate there.",2.0
"I reviewed it's competitor, Lombardi. Gave this place one star less, for several reasons:1) How much better can pizza get? Lombardi Vs Grimaldy is either the same, or just a tad different. 2) Place is too small. And no, I will not be one of those people that wait in line for 30mins-1hr so that I can get a pie to go. 3) Because of the hectic environment, service is a little rude/pushy.

"I went last  night, and contrary to popular belief the line was long. However moved quick. We waited for about 10 minutes. We had a party of four. It was quick and easy! We ordered two pies, sausage/pepperoni and ricotta/meatball/mozzarella. Delicious!  Washed it all down the a black cherry soda.  The staff was AWESOME! We had tried to take a shameless selfie and the waiter came up to us and said ""I do this all day long long here is the best spot!"" Moved a table, took a picture & let us see. Once we gave it the ok he put everything back and did the same thing for another table. Service was AWESOME. The pizza tasted like Italy in the summer time on a cool breezy night. (or I assume lol) Everything did taste fresh and crisp. As it should it's old school brick oven Italian pizza. One draw back though, the liquor license is pending. No drinking. At least it's family friendly. Still no complaint's! I highly recommend this NYC staple!",5.0
"Wow!!  Talk about great tasting pizza not to filling but just right in flavor spice the most fabulist aromas of tomatoes, garlic, basil, arugula, and mush more toppings to choses from.  Love the atmosphere and hospitality of the place although it's not a very big of a place and indeed there is a wait time depending on the day of the week you go.  It still a must go an experience endeavor.   So for an Italian orgasmic taste in spice and aromas I do recommend this wonderful trendy place to be explored on your next visit to Brooklyn.",5.0

"This place is so overrated. Waited 30mins or so, the individual I was with, ordered a 2 topping pizza.It was probably the worst pizza I've ever had. The crust was so thin, the little amount of sauce that was over the pizza made it  so soggy, it was difficult to pick up. I took a bite and that's all I could manage and I love pizza! Who doesn't. It's been over 6 years and I still won't return. Don't believe all the hype!",1.0

"This place was pretty good when you finally got the pizza, but the question should be... was it worth it? I'm still not sure.. I think that after you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge from downtown on an empty stomach in the heat and then manage to find the place and wait in line out front in the heat for almost an hour... anything would be good served in Air-conditioning and serving you a cold drink to go with it. Once you finally get in the joint, it's CASH ONLY!!! LOL.. Watching the people see this after their trek to see that they had no cash, was more than interesting.. they pack you in the place, sit you at a table with others.. so, if you sit 2 people at a table of 4, go to the restroom first, otherwise, you're trapped in the chair.. The waiters are not very attentive and that is being kind- they barely wait on you or come by, imagine Tony Soprano's gang pissed off because they're slinging pizza in a dark dingy joint... hmm...or I think our waiter resembled the Italian kid friend from the show, ""The Wonder Years"".. I'd be more specific had he come back by to ask us how the food was or if we needed refills, another drink or something, but he didn't.  The reason you wait so long outside is that the service bites.. they all get your order, never come back, then.. you sit there and have to wave someone down for your bill and remember.. It's CASH ONLY.. so, if you need change.. you'll sit there a long time to get that.. the table behind us sat there the entire time we got seated, ate and were trying to get our check to get their change.. yes, that is part of the dilemma with the wait outside.. Thankfully, I had cash and some singles to leave it after only waiting about 15 minutes to get anyone's attention to find the waiter for the ticket.. then, he never came back.. who thought he would? There were 2 of us, we ordered the regular/small pizza and drinks.. it was only $24 or something.. the pizza was big, we didn't finish all of it.. others next to us with 2 people got the normal size and it was HUGE.. I guess if you want to take it with you, it's worth it, but who in the hell is going to carry a huge pizza box back across the bridge commuting where ever in the heat?? .. I will tell you who.. Tourists.. yes, I witnessed it.. and it was 98degrees outside and they were hauling it back over the Brooklyn Bridge with them.. Maneuvering through NYC is hard enough, let alone having to do it with a large pizza box.. to each their own.. My only reason for going through this experience was because my mom was visiting and had seen it on Food Network or something and had asked to go. The Pizza- it's big, hot, piping hot, gooey, crispy thing crust and topped with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and we added garlic, mushrooms, pepperoni.. it was good. However, a few days later, we went to Patsy's Pizza in Midtown.. No wait, walked right in, A/C, good service and guess what? The pizza was just as good.. so, I wouldn't rush back over to do that again, when I can get the same/better closer.",3.0

"It's the first day of Spring. Tuesday. A week day. i decide to be spontaneous and wrangle my friend Gigi to join me after work to go out to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. This time I'm prepared for the one hour line. I've been on it before but with a bigger, less patient group. We discover that the 2 or 3 train to Clark street from Manhattan is a much faster commute as well. Once we walk up to the middle-of-the-block location, all we see is scaffolding and a dilapidated, boarded up storefront for what used to be Grimaldi's. But I'm not ready to give up. The restaurant next door lets us know it's around the corner.We back track and pass a sign that says as much. When we arrive at the corner property, there it is- the new home for Grimaldi's and......wait for it...NO LINE! ABSOLUTELY NO LINE.We sit down and realize that the place is still quite packed for a Tuesday evening at 7:30PM. And then we notice the high ceilings and the two floors. That explains why there are no lines. We order a large margherita with extra basil on one half and sun dried tomatoes on another. First bite and I think: I wouldn't mind waiting in line for an hour for this. The crust is thin but has the perfect balance of crispiness and chewiness. The basil is fresh. The cheese is fresh and not oozing with oil. It's also used with care rather than being dolloped on till the crust collapses under it's weight. The sun dried tomatoes are charred just the right amount and pack in a tangy, slightly sweet bite. In one word: PERFECTION.Since I've had pizza in Italy, i can't say it is THE BEST pizza in the world. But it is definitely ONE OF THE BEST pizzas I've had.So why am I knocking off one star? Simply because I rate on total experience. The wait staff is, for lack of a better word, aloof. I didn't expect them to come and see how we were doing. it's a pizzeria after all! But I can foresee that if I happen to return on a busy night, they might be grumpy and take it out on the customer. Also, the bathrooms were atrocious! But these a trivial things. So I can ignore them. The pizza on its own gets FIVE STARS!PS: By the time we did leave, there was a line of about 10 people waiting to be seated. Not bad for what it used to be. Not bad at all.",4.0
"It's all about the crust. Toppings are just toppings but it's the crust that makes a great pizza. I savored every bite until it was all gone. It was the best. Only complaint was they didn't have fountain drinks. A cup of ice and a $3.00 twenty ounce coke is what you got . But then I thought about that delicious, savory, wonderful crust...and all was once again harmonious in the universe.",5.0
"I find to believe the news that Peter D. brought to the forums that Grimaldi's is getting evicted from their classic spot on Old Fulton when they are so busy on the weekends. We waited over an hour in line (thank good there was a overhang from the next door construction to provide shade) and people continued to snap shots of the line documenting how ridiculous the wait was.When we got inside we ordered a large pie with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and mushrooms to share. They were out of the independent soda/root beer, cream soda, black cherry, orange. The pie is soggy like Lombardi's. The sauce and ingredients are fresh. The crust is thin with burnt sides distributed unevenly on each pizza. One pizza can feed about 3 people. It's cash only and a real NY / Brooklyn pizza experience. Talk to the people next to you in line, you are all there for the same experience and you have quite the wait. We were also nicely surprised when the Red Bull Mini Cooper arrived right next to our group in line. Two model-type blondes began to pass out free Red Bulls as well as swag. My three extra cans in the fridge is an example of how asking and being in the right place at the right time has some real benefits.",3.0
"So apparently this was the place to go for pizza.  I mean, I'm in New York City... Ever since the first Ninja Turtles movie, New York City has made pizza famous and as been famous for it's pizza pies.  It's a shame I couldn't try more pizza places, but I guess I have to try one of the best there is in the city.Grimaldi's is located directly under the Brooklyn Bridge.  it's actually kinda cool because it has a pretty nice view of it from the front of the restaurant.  And since there's always a line in front, you'll sure have an opportunity to look at the bridge while you wait.  I went at around 8:30 PM and the line was about 10 people deep.  However, the ""door person"" (seriously, he was dressed up like the Don from godfather) asked for anyone with a party of 3/4 so we got to skip the line.  Guess this is a tip for anyone that wants to get in a little quicker.  They have communal seating in the middle of the restaurant (kinda like german abbey style), but on the sides they have tables of 4.  Guess this is why they want to fill those up first.Looking at the menu, it's drop dead simple.  Pizza, with what toppings... that's it.  The pizzas are hand made in a brick coal burning oven in the back with multiple people making the pizzas.  I also noticed that there isn't a single woman that worked there... interesting... We ordered a pizza with italian sausage, sweet peppers, and garlic.  It came out in about 5 minutes after we ordered it.  The pizza was about 1/3 of the size of the table.  The crust was thin all around, and topped nicely.  The pizza didn't really hold it's pie shape when you ate it though, it was really soft in the middle (not sure if it was supposed to be like that) but eating the pizza with a knife and fork was definately a necessity (unless you really want to wear the pizza).  The pizza was definately the best I've had in a while.  I'd even go as far to say that it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  If you're in New York, you definately have to come to Grimaldi's and have the ""Don"" makea you a pizza you can't refuse.BTW, I had dominos the day after having this pizza at work in toronto...

Ever since the first Ninja Turtles movie, New York City has made pizza famous and as been famous for it's pizza pies.  It's a shame I couldn't try more pizza places, but I guess I have to try one of the best there is in the city.Grimaldi's is located directly under the Brooklyn Bridge.  it's actually kinda cool because it has a pretty nice view of it from the front of the restaurant.  And since there's always a line in front, you'll sure have an opportunity to look at the bridge while you wait.  I went at around 8:30 PM and the line was about 10 people deep.  However, the ""door person"" (seriously, he was dressed up like the Don from godfather) asked for anyone with a party of 3/4 so we got to skip the line.  Guess this is a tip for anyone that wants to get in a little quicker.  They have communal seating in the middle of the restaurant (kinda like german abbey style), but on the sides they have tables of 4.  Guess this is why they want to fill those up first.Looking at the menu, it's drop dead simple.  Pizza, with what toppings... that's it.  The pizzas are hand made in a brick coal burning oven in the back with multiple people making the pizzas.  I also noticed that there isn't a single woman that worked there... interesting... We ordered a pizza with italian sausage, sweet peppers, and garlic.  It came out in about 5 minutes after we ordered it.  The pizza was about 1/3 of the size of the table.  The crust was thin all around, and topped nicely.  The pizza didn't really hold it's pie shape when you ate it though, it was really soft in the middle (not sure if it was supposed to be like that) but eating the pizza with a knife and fork was definately a necessity (unless you really want to wear the pizza).  The pizza was definately the best I've had in a while.  I'd even go as far to say that it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  If you're in New York, you definately have to come to Grimaldi's and have the ""Don"" makea you a pizza you can't refuse.BTW, I had dominos the day after having this pizza at work in toronto... BRUTAL!",5.0
"Ahhh! The epic battle over which NY pizza is best -- and the winner is: Grimaldi's! Hands down each and every time. BAMMM! Just like that.Hate lines? order to go....Come here for the experience of it all and enjoy it; breathe it in. What's the rush anyway? I have been here winter, spring, summer, and fall. I have waited for a long time, I have not waited at all, and I have been here at that awkward time when the stoves have to be reset or whatever the hell it is they do to it. It's empty and you get seated right away during that weird time but since the ovens get shut off to be reset you can't get any food. I guess it's better to be seated and waiting sipping on some vino than to be out there on line. I order the pepperoni with the fresh basil. I can eat an entire pie by myself and most of the time I do, only here. It's just good. The crust is great, the pepperoni is great, the fresh basil is great, and the pizza in it's entirety is simply unmatched. You may find good pizza elsewhere with a hell of a lot less wait times, but never better than this. NEVER. P.S. place is cash only and the only ATM in the area never works. BRING CASH.",5.0
"Some of the best pizza I've had. Husband and I inhaled two small pies - a white and margherita.  I'm not a huge fan of white pizza, but it was really good. I still preferred the margherita pie though - just a personal preference.  We actually ended up here after being told there was a 2 hour wait at Lucali's.  Only had to wait about 10 minutes to get inside. Waited about another 10-15 minutes for our pies, but it was pretty worth it. Crust is perfectly crisp and sauce is light and just right! :) Would definitely revisit one day.",5.0

"Wanted to go to Spumoni Gardens for pizza, but discovered it was kind of far from our other Brooklyn activities, so we decided to try Grimaldi's since it was also on our list.  Got there around 3, and I figured the line wouldn't be super bad because it was an off time, but not so much, we probably waited about an hour. Upon entering, we were blasted with cold air, and I agree with others that it makes the food get too cold, really fast.  We just went with the cheese pizza in order to try the classic.  I was really impressed with the quality of the cheese, it had a lot of flavor.  I did think there was a lack of basil though, and parts of the crust were a little too burnt.  I don't know if I would wait in that line again, but I'm glad I tried it.",4.0
"This is the best pizza I've had in my life! Coal fired pizza is the way to go! The cheese is incredible too and I loved the sausage and pepperoni toppings.My group got there at 11:30, 30 minutes before opening and the line was long, but we were part of the first group to sit down.The only problem was that the air conditioner was blasting even though it wasn't that warm outside and it cooled off our pizza way too quickly.",5.0
"Grimaldi's never disappoints. i always bring guest here if they want that to experience that NY style pizza. The small itself can easily feed three people. I just love that crust, there is something about it; perfect consistency with that hint of oven taste. You must go to the one in BK, don't think all locations are the same. I went to the one in Manhattan and although it was good, it wasn't the same. The oven does matter when it comes to making pizza and the original one in BK makes a better pizza. Also, remember it cash only.",5.0
"I've read about it, seen plenty of reviews about it and seen the long ass lines as I've passed it by. Now I'm wondering, really, why?? I have been to countless pizza shops, with less clout, that blew the doors off this place. If the reviews weren't for the food then I don't know what, there wasn't anything else unique about it. I had gotten a small  regular pie, nothing special, but still... Don't understand why this place is so popular, I certainly wasn't wowwed.",3.0
I love the Pizza here but the wait is really long.  last time my friends and I waited about an hr before we got our pizza to go.  The people who were on line to dine in before us was able to sit and eat before we got our pizza.  Shame they couldn't be more efficient with the process.,3.0
"Wow, I've found the best New York pizza! Word of caution: arriving 20 minutes before the place opens will only get you 40 people away from the door. Yes, the line gets long before the place even opens. Given the choice between deep dish pizza like the one found in Chicago or New York style pizza, I'd definitely choose the latter. It worked out well that I got to experience this awesome pizza joint. On my first trip to the Big Apple, our group made sure to include Grimaldi's on the list of destinations. We lined up as if we were at Disneyland, 20 minutes before opening hour. After getting to the front of the line and getting our table and getting situated, we hungrily ordered two large pizzas. When it was ready, the pizzas came thin, crispy, and right from the oven!! Each bite was soooo GOOD! Can't wait to come back again!!",5.0
Believe the hype.. the pizza is as good as ive ever had..4 stars because no matter what you have a long wait to get seated..service on this occasion was well below avg.I will definitely go back when im in NYC,4.0

"A windy trek across the Brooklyn Bridge was rewarded with two delicious, pipping hot, New York style pizza pies. This was after a half hour wait, before the restaurant actually opened. The moral of this story is, get here early! The dining room is not known for its spaciousness and you will most likely find yourself snuggling next to a burly stranger. Nevertheless, the famous coal brick oven pizza is worth the wait. Misjudging the size, we ordered two smalls for two people. Another case of me getting greedy and my hungry stomach doing the decision-making. A 14"" large, which has 8 slices, is more than large enough for two people. The pies are priced $14 for a small and $16 for a large with additional toppings costing $2 each. We went  for a regular mushroom and a regular Italian sausage. The pizza itself was what a New York pizza should be, in every way. The dough was perfectly chewy, as was the crust; the fresh basil was fragrant and flavorful; the tomato sauce tasted special; and best of all, the mozzarella was cut into slices (not shredded), and had the creamiest flavor. I loved the classic coal oven finish because you simply don't see these ovens being used to cook pizzas anymore.

"Delicious NY style pizza!With 2,000+ reviews here there really isn't much I can add other than it's delicious and worth the wait!! Without the wait I would give this place 5 stars, but due to my hatred of standing in lines and crowds I'm giving it 4 stars.",4.0
Ba damn!!! The crazy long line. White people and their carb addiction. No racist here. My gf and I decided to spend the late afternoon in nyc. It was a cloudy day. We walked the Brooklyn bridge after we parked the car in Chinaland and ordered take-out from here. We ordered a large sausage and a bottle of coke. It took 15 mins for our pie to come out. We ate it in the park adjacent park overlooking the bridge. It was great timing. We finished it before it started to lightly rain. We digested by walking back to the car. It was a very good pizza. My gf doesn't like cheese but she agrees that it was a tasty pizza.  I will not wait over 30 mins to get a table inside. It's just pizza people.  They don't use a traditional cardboard box. The pizza was on top of a big round thin cardbardish plate and stiffed in a white paper bag. I suppose it saves money and is green of them to do. I think they are being hipster.I'm more impressed with the original al La Lombardi's,4.0

Once seated, it took forever for the waiter to attend to us and that became the trend for the evening. And the staff were so indifferent and unhelpful that it ruined the evening for me. I wonder if it marred my taste bud judgement, but the pizza was really a disappointment. (Note: I'm vegetarian). Or maybe the deciding factor is your predisposition towards the baked/ charred flavor.

I had a good view of the pizza making area and enjoyed watching them make pies! They top all of them with Olive oil which was interesting. The pizza came quick and it was awesome. The fresh basil and the crust was what set this pizza apart from any other pie I've had. Crisp but still chewy mild tomato sauce and the cheese. Oh the cheese!

The line is long, but a hack we used was ordering it to go, it seemed to speed up the process.  Bottom line: There's probably going to be a line, but it's definitely worth it if you're a lover of pizza/obsessed with food, like yours truly.",5.0

"Very good pizza. It comes in a very close second to Lombardi's. The texture of the dough and taste of the tomato sauce is what I like a little bit better at Lombardi's. But still very good here at Grimaldi's. The crust comes out with some brunt blistered sections that add a great toasty crunch and flavor. It's then softened with the fresh melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, and fresh basil. The large is about $14 and each topping if I remember correctly was $1.50. I only had pepperoni which was great. There was a group of about 15 Korean young men and women at a table. The nice Italian owner asked them what were they doing in NYC. They told him they are a choir from Korea doing some concerts around NYC. The owner asked for a quick song; they sang a 10 second song. They sounded great. About 10 minutes later, the owner asked them for another song. So the group stood around the restaurant and sang a Korean choir song that lasted about two minutes. Wow did they sound great! I didn't think this place had good acoustics. If anybody speaks Korean, can you please tell me what does the name of this song mean. It sounded like: au-dee-do. A good late lunch and a short concert, all under the Brooklyn Bridge. It was cool as hell. The owner gave them all free canolli for their performance. If Yelp would allow video I would upload it. If anyone knows how, please let me know. Even with this large group the restaurant was half full, thus we didn't have to wait in any line. But I would not wait over 45 minutes in the 29º weather for this pizza. That is just too brutal. Tip: If you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge; you don't have to walk all the way to Tillary St. There is an stairway exit on the left as soon as you pass the second tower of the bridge. It leads you to Cadman Plaza E. Then make a right at the end of the stairway, it'll leave you in the neighborhood.",4.0

"Actually deserves 3 1/2 stars. The napolatean pizza is the type where they put wide slices of cheese on top of the sauce before baking.

"Grimaldi's gets a huge thumbs up for their crust.  It is crisp without being overcooked or cracker-like; it is flavorful without being overpowering.  I am usually not a fan of margherita-style pizza (maybe I am a provincial guy from the middle of nowhere, but I much prefer the cheese on top of the sauce, as opposed to the whole little-bits-of-cheese-over-sauce thing) but Grimaldi's may be the first step to a full conversion to the joy of the nuances that such a simple dish offers.I have gone twice so far; the first time was with a friend who is okay eating meat, so we got pepperoni and sausage.  The pepperoni was nothing to write home regarding, but the sausage was superb and worth eating on its own.  The second time was with my parents, who came into Brooklyn from North Carolina that day and wanted to eat at this institution.  They prefer cheese pizza, so we got cheese that time around.  Both are quite good:  this is a pizza that does not depend on the novelty of fancy or exotic toppings to be good.As other reviewers are noting, there can be a very long line to get in the door.  I have waited 20 minutes, and I have waited close to two hours.  Depending on the day of the week and time of the day your mileage may vary.  This is a good pizza, but not as amazing as the mountain of hype for this place might imagine it to be.  If people were visiting me I'd take them to get a ""slice"" (...it's ironic because they don't serve them... and now the crickets chirp) of old-school Brooklyn.",3.0
"Great crust, fresh sauce (crushed San Marzanos) and baked in coal fired oven with just enough charred bits to give it that artisanal taste but still remained chewy and soft.Well done fellows you have lived up to your reputation.The atmosphere of the place is nothing remarkable but the food is surely worth going for.",4.0
"After racking up a good appetite walking across the Brooklyn Bridge and almost getting run over by the vicious bicyclists there, I was ready to feast on some Grimaldi's on my recent trip to NYC. But of course this place had a line as long as a brontosaurus just like everywhere else in NYC that's good so my stomach just had to deal with the wait. We waited and waited and barely moved in line when these 2 guys come out of Grimaldi's w/ 2 boxes of pizza advising us to call in our order and do take out so we would only have to wait like 10-15 minutes instead of hours. So we tried it but the phone lines were so busy that it took us about 10 minutes to just place an order. They said it would be ready in 20 minutes but 20 minutes turned into probably 30-40 minutes until we finally got to leave w/ our pizza to have a picnic on the grass down by the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory. Even though we had to wait longer than they told us to we got our pizza before the people in front of us were even allowed in the restaurant so I think the advice we got from those guys was good. Plus eating down by the dock on the grass was probably a lot more calm and peaceful than sitting inside Grimaldi's where it was packed, cramped and loud. We also got to people watch and enjoy the view of the Brooklyn Bridge.Now about the pizza, we got a large pizza with sundried tomatoes and sausage to share between the 3 of us and it was really worth the wait. Maybe cuz we were all starving but us 3 little Asian girls ate that whole darn pizza pie all by ourselves. I loved the thin crust, fresh basil, mozzarella and sausage. Yum yum yum.

"I've been to Naples...I've had the pizza.I'm being honest here, Grimaldi's is JUST AS GOOD as the pizza in Naples. It truly was a party in my mouth. All I kept thinking was ""this is what makes life worth living"".",5.0
"Grimaldi's gets a huge thumbs up for their crust.  It is crisp without being overcooked or cracker-like; it is flavorful without being overpowering.  I am usually not a fan of margherita-style pizza (maybe I am a provincial guy from the middle of nowhere, but I much prefer the cheese on top of the sauce, as opposed to the whole little-bits-of-cheese-over-sauce thing) but Grimaldi's may be the first step to a full conversion to the joy of the nuances that such a simple dish offers.I have gone twice so far; the first time was with a friend who is okay eating meat, so we got pepperoni and sausage.  The pepperoni was nothing to write home regarding, but the sausage was superb and worth eating on its own.  The second time was with my parents, who came into Brooklyn from North Carolina that day and wanted to eat at this institution.  They prefer cheese pizza, so we got cheese that time around.  Both are quite good:  this is a pizza that does not depend on the novelty of fancy or exotic toppings to be good.As other reviewers are noting, there can be a very long line to get in the door.  I have waited 20 minutes, and I have waited close to two hours.  Depending on the day of the week and time of the day your mileage may vary.  This is a good pizza, but not as amazing as the mountain of hype for this place might imagine it to be.  If people were visiting me I'd take them to get a ""slice"" (...it's ironic because they don't serve them... and now the crickets chirp) of old-school Brooklyn.",3.0
"Great crust, fresh sauce (crushed San Marzanos) and baked in coal fired oven with just enough charred bits to give it that artisanal taste but still remained chewy and soft.Well done fellows you have lived up to your reputation.The atmosphere of the place is nothing remarkable but the food is surely worth going for.",4.0
"After racking up a good appetite walking across the Brooklyn Bridge and almost getting run over by the vicious bicyclists there, I was ready to feast on some Grimaldi's on my recent trip to NYC. But of course this place had a line as long as a brontosaurus just like everywhere else in NYC that's good so my stomach just had to deal with the wait. We waited and waited and barely moved in line when these 2 guys come out of Grimaldi's w/ 2 boxes of pizza advising us to call in our order and do take out so we would only have to wait like 10-15 minutes instead of hours. So we tried it but the phone lines were so busy that it took us about 10 minutes to just place an order. They said it would be ready in 20 minutes but 20 minutes turned into probably 30-40 minutes until we finally got to leave w/ our pizza to have a picnic on the grass down by the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory. Even though we had to wait longer than they told us to we got our pizza before the people in front of us were even allowed in the restaurant so I think the advice we got from those guys was good. Plus eating down by the dock on the grass was probably a lot more calm and peaceful than sitting inside Grimaldi's where it was packed, cramped and loud. We also got to people watch and enjoy the view of the Brooklyn Bridge.Now about the pizza, we got a large pizza with sundried tomatoes and sausage to share between the 3 of us and it was really worth the wait. Maybe cuz we were all starving but us 3 little Asian girls ate that whole darn pizza pie all by ourselves. I loved the thin crust, fresh basil, mozzarella and sausage. Yum yum yum. Don't forget to go have some ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.",4.0
"The pizza is good, but it's too touristy for me and the fact that they have expanded to places such as Las Vegas, Phoenix, LA, Florida etc.,  all but eviscerates its exclusivity and status as a NYC pizza landmark.  If you're going to Brooklyn, definitely check out Lucali's, Giuseppinna's  or another true New York pizza restaurant.",3.0
"Pizza set to Sinatra's music with the Brooklyn Bridge looming.  Can't beat that!!It's overwhelming.. but remember, you are here for one thing. To taste something special... Pizza from Brooklyn cooked only one way it should be..  in a coal brick oven! We visited this place in January.. it was a cold day. Waiting outside was not fun. So when the main dude called out and asked who wants to sit at the bar, we jumped at the chance... anything to get inside. Warning, if you sit at the bar, everytime the door opens, you will catch a draft.  But hey... you're inside, you can order... get some wine and relax. If it's your first time. Make it simple. Order a pizza with basil, garlic and mozzarella. You can ask to add the basil in after it's cooked, it will be fresher that way. Anyway, this pizza is classic and it's simply perfect. It's not just the pizza, it's the atmosphere. Soak it all in. This place is an institution. Check out the walls. If you have doubts on what to order, the staff is great. Tell them it's your first time and they'll school you on what to get.I said it once, and I'll say it again: Pizza set to Sinatra's music with the Brooklyn Bridge looming.  Can't beat that!!",4.0
"As a Londoner, this place is by far the best Pizza to be had outside of Italy.It is thin, crispy and has an authentic Italian American flavour to the decor, the ambience, and atmosphere. A family run feel, with lots of personal touches from the photos of Frank Sinatra that adorn the walls to the owner (I think it was him) who greets those that brave the cold and wait in line for a very long time to have the pizza.Highly recommended to all Brits (and others) who have no equivalence in the U.K (authentic Italian American pizzeria.)American pizzas have options for random toppings, not commonly use in UK like 'Broccoli' which actually is not as bad as it sounds!The base is crispy, thin and as fresh as you could ever want it.Whilst not dirt cheap, its also not expensive. I highly recommend for all visitors to NYC.Definitely go to Grimaldis!",5.0
"Second things first: its cramped, cash only and no slices. But, you came here for the pizza, which is pretty damn good.We ordered two larges, one pepperoni and one sausage for the 4 of us. Price plus (generous) tip came out to $12 a person. (thats 4 slices and a drink a piece.) I would've been totally happy with just the 2 slices so 1 pizza can and will serve 4 people. The crust is thin but sturdy, sauce is light and flavorful, mozzarella is fresh and its topped with fresh basil. Pepperoni was better than the sausage but both were really good.We got there about 1230 and had no trouble getting a seat, but as we left about 130, there was a line outside about 10-15 people deep.Bottom line, its really good pizza for a really good price. Check it out.",4.0
"Even after waiting an hour in the FREEEEEEZING cold, I have to say, Grimaldi's hand-kneaded and stretched pizza was pretty good. Maybe not worth waiting for in chilling winds in the dead of winter, but definitely good on a fair weathered occasion.We greedily ordered the large 18"" for the 2 of us. That's 8 big slices. You start with the base ($14) of red sauce, mozzarella cheese (i counted 22 slices on a large), and fresh basil. Then you can add toppings at $2 each. We topped our creation with roasted red peppers and sausage. While this was good, it could have used a bit more salt. And so if I were to go back, I'd get the sausage and pepperoni combo with extra basil. I think that would have been fantastic.Regardless, the pizza once baked in the old style coal oven, was delicious. The crust had just the right amount of give and chew. Crispy hot and fresh, yet thin. The ingredients are fresh. You can see the guys making them. All made to order. A well-oiled operation.Couple of quick tips:- Get there early and try to be part of the first seating when it opens. - Account for the pizza tours that show up and get priority seating. You may have counted on being among the first, but then the tour bus shows up and hogs up 20 of the best seats!- Come in small groups. Tables are tight.- Ordering take out takes the same amount of waiting time. It's a first come first serve basis.- There's only 1 bathroom so time your bowel movements for a line.- A small 16"" pizza is PLENTY for 2 people.- Cash only. There is an ATM outside the restaurant in case you forget.- And dress for waiting in line. You never know.",4.0
"Yet another tourist trap. Neither this place nor Lombardi's impressed me with their versions of thin-crust pizzas. To be honest, the only difference between these tourist traps and nationwide chains like Papa John's and Pizza Hut is that you're getting a lot less food for a lot more money. And time. Standing outside in the cold for an hour to get in? I'm sorry, but I took psychology 101 in college; I'm not going to fall into a cognitive dissonance trap the way every ignorant New Yorker or tourist will. Just because I waited and paid more doesn't automatically make the food better. There's a thing called objectivity, and it appears that a majority of the people that come here have lost it. The pizzas are covered with a few chunks of mozzarella, and I'll take their word for it that it's fresh. This is supposed to be the big difference between them and major pizza chains. That and the insanely long line. Granted, Pizza Hut in New York is considerably worse than Pizza Hut in other cities, but really? This is supposedly the best pizza in New York, and by extension (because New Yorkers are delusional and think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread and Jesus combined) the world? FUGGEDABOUTIT! I prefer Pizza Hut's cheesy bites pizzas! The pizza here is foamy and airy. There's no substance to the carbs, and it's not even filling. It's mass produced pizza at its worst, and yet people line up for blocks to pay their hard-earned money for it. Honestly, it's pathetic.

Hopefully kitchen is clean...Pizza came right away! we ordered large pizza with half white pizza with mushroom and sausage and another half with pepperoni and basil. I loved the pepperoni side! Really tasty and garlicky. If I  would ever come back I would get pepperoni only! Mozzarella cheese was delicious. However I couldn't taste mushrooms on the other side of pizza. And sausage was blend.We got two bottles of Brooklyn Pilsner and with tax and tip we paid $41. Quite steep for the pizza.I would say I still love Little Star pizza for the better ambiance and wonderful pizza combinations instead of just selection of toppings - as Grimaldi offers.",4.0
"I went here the day after I went to Lombardi's. And I gotta say Lombardi's was the winner for me. However, Grimaldis was close. The toppings, cheese and tomato sauce were all very good. I would say I prefer the tomato sauce at Lombardis but Grimaldis was also very good. The thing about Grimaldi's that I was not a fan of was the crust. It wasn't crispy, you couldn't fold it over and eat it because it was saturated with sauce so I had to cut it and eat it with a fork and knife. Flavor wise this place is a 5 star for me. Texture/crust wise I give it less. In any case, it is one of the best pizzas I've ever had.",4.0
"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST NY PIZZA - hands down!!!My friends weren't kidding about the line.  We went here for dinner and waited an hour and a half.  The line wrapped around the block.  I HATE LINES but it was well worth it!!!Once we were seated the service was quick.  We ordered a white pie, pepperoni, and calzone.  The calzone was HUGE, it was the size of 1/2 an entire pizza and filled with loads of cheesy goodness.  Between 4 men and 2 women the food was plentiful!  I wanted to order a cannoli for dessert but I was way too full.  The white pie is unlike anything you can find in Cali.  I've tried other white pies here and their attempt is purely sad.

"I went to Grimaldi's in Dumbo for the first time about three years ago with a couple of friends that were doing their engagement shoot nearby. It was freezing outside, and we insanely waited well over an hour on line to get our pizza fix. While the meal was really good, I pondered for a while if it was worth the wait. Was it just that any pizza tastes good after waiting in the cold for over an hour when you're starving? Maybe. Maybe not.I finally made my return to Grimaldi's last week with my sister-in-law for dinner. Although it is no longer in the same location (instead it is now right next door), not too much had changed except for one major aspect: there was no line. Oddly enough, the pizza place that assumed their original location next door, did have a line, even without the iconic name. I wondered if it had something to do with the brick oven that remained at the original space, because we expected a wait on a Friday night, but there wasn't one. There's an odd feeling from the service at Grimaldi's. Despite there being no wait, I greatly felt like our presence was an inconvenience. The man who seated us (who I suspect is an owner) mumbled something about how difficult his life is as we were being shown to our table. I almost felt compelled to apologize for coming until I realized how silly that was. There's also a lot of rules at Grimaldi's. No credit cards, cash only, no reservations, no slices, no delivery, and most recently... no alcohol (which is perfectly fine with me as both of us are pregnant, and I was never much of a drinker anyway). Since the alcohol section of the menu was crossed off with masking tape, I began to hypothesize that they once had an alcohol license, but perhaps didn't get it at the new location for whatever reason, which could be the reason for the lack of wait. Didn't matter to me though. Eventually we got our pizzas and they were gooooood. So it wasn't just the wait fooling me previously. They definitely make a mean pizza. I don't think it's unlike Lombardi's or many other places-- that's the thing about pizza- even bad pizza is good pizza- even those $1 slice joints. I think if I'm already in Dumbo for something, I would definitely go back, but it's not something I would go out of my way for. It's an easily duplicated experience that could be met with better service, and perhaps the acceptance of a credit card.",3.0
"Grimaldi's was, like many restaurants I've encountered here in New York, smaller than I expected. But the size of the place (and the fact that the floor is way dirty) doesn't deter from the fact that it makes damned good pizza. We had a pie with mushrooms, onions, and Italian sausage. I wish they'd make the whole pizza a little more crunchy instead of leaving it just at the crust (which was burnt in some parts), but it was tasty and not all that greasy. It was kinda pricey, but that wasn't too bad. I say they should've made it harder because towards the end of the meal, the last remaining slices were being finished so that we didn't have to box them and carry them around with us and the slice I ate became cold and soggy. I mean, I guess that was expected, but it'd be nice if the pizza was a bit firmer.Bonus of not having to wait too long for a table given the conditions outside.

They're still one of the most well known Pizza places in New York and being below the Brooklyn bridge the experience is a magical one. They only do whole pizzas and they don't do slices. They also don't do delivery and don't take reservations. The owner is extremely friendly and usually thanks everyone with a smile when you're leaving and it's really a friendly place.

Grimaldi's isn't my favorite pizza in NYC but it's absolutely in the top 10 (maybe even the top 5). The only real negative of Grimaldi's is that Grimaldi's has become more of a tourist spot then a place for locals and because of that 75% of the time they're open there's a line out the door and down the block of people waiting for a table (think Shake Shack).

"The pizza is delicious, and it's worth going once for the experience and to say you did, but now that I've been, it's defintely not worth the wait again!We waited in the hot sun for a little over an hour.  It was a fun adventure for the day - we took a subway there from Manhattan, ate at Grimaldi's, then walked back to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge.  I definitely recommend this approach!Fact is, the difference between this pizzza and other pizza places is not enough to make standing in the sun for an hour worth it more than once!  :)",3.0
"Call me crazy but I would never want to wait in line for more than, let's say, an hour for food, when I'm pretty sure a restaurant one street over is also making pizza.

Keep in mind that the service is not rude and sometimes even borders on friendly, but they do make a point of keeping things moving, so don't expect to spend a few hours catching up with friends. Also ... not to start a riot, but when we left at around 1 on a Sunday (and the line outside was ridiculous), there were several empty spots at the bar and tables which could have easily seated a two-person party. Now for the star of the show: this is not your overpuffed, Pizza Hut/Dominos deep pan pizza. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the thin crust, because I like eating more of the toppings than the actual dough. The mozzarella is delicious, though I wish they wouldn't skimp on the basil leaves. Get the italian sausage topping (or don't, if you're a vegetarian or just loathe sausage, but that means we can't be friends). Grimaldi's does one thing right - the dough should form huge bubbles near the crust.

"The infamous Grimaldi's is located in one of Brooklyn's most beautiful neighborhoods  situated near Brooklyn Bridge Park.  Sit down for some pizza, then grab some ice cream and go for a stroll along the promenade.  Here, you can get a gorgeous view of lower Manhattan and the East River.  The wait can be excruciating, especially if you have a large group, and there's no wait list so come prepared to stand in line.  Come a bit early if you don't want to wait too long.  We showed up close to 7PM on a weekday and only waited about 15 minutes.I can't say from my first experience if it was the best pizza I've had.  I probably need to go back and just have a plain margherita to decide.  I was really hungry that day so I wanted everything on my pizza: sausage, onions, jalapeños, etc.  It was good; the cheese and crust were especially memorable.  The large is pretty huge, but two moderately hungry people could finish it.  We did, and still had room for that ice cream afterwards.",4.0
"Really bad service. The waiter was cold and didn't even make eye contact with us the whole time. C'mon, man! Smile! Plus he got snotty when we asked about the vegetarian pizza.

"The first time I went because it is so highly praised from everyone in the city.  I was less than impressed on my first visit because they definitely do not pride themselves on service.  Talk about being parched and unable to get a refill on my water.Secondly, when I received my pizza it was not piping hot, yet they pizza supposedly comes straight from the oven that you see as you enter.  My second go around, I enjoyed my pizza much more because it was piping hot! The pizza is good, but I wouldn't say that it is ""omg amazing"" or anything.  I definitely will go again when friends are visiting from out of town.  The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think I will wait in the long line that you often find unless a friend is dying to have it.  I will say that the long line does move very quickly which is a plus!",3.0

"My boyfriend and I went to Grimaldi's after touring Brooklyn.  It was about an hour before closing time but we were lucky to have only waited in line for about 5 mins.  A 5 minute wait for New York Style Brick-Oven Baked Thin Crust pizza was worth it...We ended up ordering the ""small pizza"" with Italian Sausage, Peperoni, Sweet Peppers and Olives.  6 slices was plenty for us.  The crust was baked to the right consistency, the pizza had a good amount of sauce and toppings, but the best part for me was the sweet peppers.  I'm not entirely sure why I liked the peppers so much but they added to the pizza.  Keep in mind that each topping is $2 extra, sweet peppers were $4. (They're also cash only)I suggest trying Grimaldi's when there's not too much of a line or you're a big pizza fan.  Otherwise, it's somewhat touristy and the line gets too long for pizza.",4.0
"Went on a Sunday afternoon.  Beautiful white building.  Tourists EVERYWHERE.  I felt like I was near Times Square.  I don't mind tourists at all, but just didn't expect that.  Don't be a snob and go into the restaurant first to see if you put your name down, just get in line.  The tourists seem to know that.  The wait wasn't painful for 4 people as it was ~45 minutes.  Anyways, the pizza is solid and it's affordable ($ large plain is $14).  Nothing extra special about it, but it's a standout because it's made with great balance of crust, sauce and cheese.  I like it plain.   Perfect for a gluten glut.  There are other places like Arturo's, Artichoke, Motorino, Luzzo's, Grimaldi's Pizza etc. etc. in Manhattan that do a good pie so I don't know if Grimaldi's is best pound for pound for someone who lives in Manhattan.  But it's a place everyone should go, just to experience Grimaldi's and taste the long lasting history.  Also, take a stroll down to the pier, great view of Manhattan.",4.0

"I was here last week with my wife. She truly wanted Grimaldis but every time we are in Dumbos the long line never gave me the appetite to wait.

The line went quickly, especially if you are a couple it's a lot easier to get in than with a group. We were seated within 30 mins of waiting outside, not bad. We've ordered a large pie with meatballs topping. It took about 20 minutes to get it but this is expected and not bad of a wait. I've expected something remarkable on my first bite of the pizza, and I was disappointed. I had better pizza in Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst and Gravesend areas. I guess I've wanted for the dough to be thinner and crunchier, not doughy and burnt. It was a good meal just nothing over the top. I'll leave this spot for the tourists. PS. The prices are decent for a Dumbo location.",3.0
They don't take reservations so get ready to stand in line. But it is well worth the wait. the pizza is made to order so also there will be a wait for the food. They don't sell slices so you have to order a whole pie but taking the left overs home is not a bad idea at all. Bring cash they don't take credit cards. The ambiance is very casual but the food is just amazing so fresh we delicious. Great for lunch or brunch with friends. A must visit if you are in NYC.,4.0

"Took a trek to Brooklyn on my day off to finally try Grimaldi's. I was really excited and  was willing to wait no matter what since last time we visited Brooklyn we ate at Juliana's pizza instead because of the long wait here. Surprisingly on a friday afternoon the line was moving and my boyfriend and I only had to wait for 15 mins to get a table. We ordered a large pie which gives you 8 slices so that we could bring home some leftovers. I love pizza for breakfast!! Small plain pie gives you 6 slices for $12 while large plain pie cost $14. We had toppings of sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeños for the additional of $2 for each topping. Because of the name of the establishment, the pizza sells itself so the staff does not have to perform above and beyond for service. Service is quick and curt.  The pie taste good but I had better at Juliana's pizza next door or at Lombardis Pizza. There's too much sauce in the middle of the pie which makes the pie soggy and the crust did not hold the toppings well. They should put more sauce at the edge of the crust instead. With all the hype, I thought we were eating at the original Grimaldi's because of all the great reviews and long line. The real truth is Juliana's pizza next door is the real deal. Patsy Grimaldi sold his business in 1998. After some leasing problem Grimaldi's moved to this location with a new oven. The landlord offered Patsy Grimaldi the original coal oven location at 19 Old Fulton Street back in which he named it Juliana's pizza, a tribute to his late mother.",2.0
"Situated under the Brooklyn Bridge and touted as the #1 Pizzaria in the entire city, I knew that I had to give this famous New York staple a try. My friends and I were actually so excited about trying it that we decided to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge from Battery Park to get there. Once on the Brooklyn side, it was a little bit tricky to track the restaurant down on foot. However, after a time, we finally found it and noticed the relatively long line waiting to get their hands (and mouths) around a slice of Grimaldi's famous pizza. We were only a small party of 3, but it took about 45 minutes to finally be seated. 45 minutes may have seemed a long time to wait, but our gruff, no-nonsense host commented that it is usually a longer wait so we were thankful to finally be inside and seated, out of the wind and cold.This place was packed, with tiny tables that could accomodate only maybe half of a 4 person party. However, I suppose beggers can't be choosy. However, when a group of 3 Japanese girls were seated next to us at a 2-top they tried their best to squeeze in but couldn't manage to comfortably sit around the table. When they asked the host if they could move, he barked ""SIT DOWN OR GET OUT"". I was shocked to see a restaurant, especially one of Grimaldi's fame, could possibly treat their customers this way and still be in business. But as the case may be, they simply didn't care. There would always be people who would be happy to take those seats and sit down for dinner. It's a sad reality but there was simply no incentive for the restaurant to treat their customers amicably.We decided to order 2 large pies, one with pepperoni and sausage and the other with mushrooms and ricotta cheese. Made fresh and fired in an authentic brick oven, our pizza piping hot and smelled deliciously of fresh basil. The dough however, was a bit soggy from the tomato sauce and would droop and fall apart as we tried to bite into it. I usually like to add gratuitous amounts of shredded or grated parmesan to my pizza, but here at Grimaldi's, parmesan came with an extra charge so I decided to forgo my usual endulgence.Though tasty, I didn't really feel that this was the best pizza that I had ever enjoyed. Besides the hype (which I found out later to be largely due to their reputation as a tourist trap), I felt that Grimaldi's served better than average pizza, but certainly not the best. It's worth trying, but go for the pizza and not for the service. Just remember that, if you raise any sort of fuss, prepare to be pushed around and barked at because they are definitely not in the business of non-sense there.

Steaming with melted mozzarella and crispy pepperoni. Our eyes lit up and soon our stomachs expanded. So I ask myself was it worth the wait?

My only complaint would be the limited parking spaces around the area, so the only opportunities to enjoy their food is only when there is a parking spot when I happen to be driving by the place.",4.0
"As we stood out in the cold with the other 50 some people, we wondered if the wait would be worth it. As we waited patiently I noticed the door man looked like an old school mobster with his fedora, sharp suit and long black wool coat. Fast forward 45 min. later to us finally walking into this magical pie heaven. We sat, we ordered we waited about 15 min. and then our glorious pie was presented in front of us. Steaming with melted mozzarella and crispy pepperoni. Our eyes lit up and soon our stomachs expanded. So I ask myself was it worth the wait? I would have waited longer.Our server, decor and music was classic. By far the best pizza I've ever eaten. This entire experience was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.",5.0
I don't just hand out 5 star ratings but this is the best pizza I've had anywhere in the world. And trust me when I say I know my pizza. This is the perfect pie. I bought an extra one just to bring back to my room and have for breakfast in the morning.,5.0

"the walk here was beautiful.you can see the Brooklyn bridge and all the tall buildings, lights.ahhh it was such a beautiful sight!!i was afraid of a line and waiting in the freezing cold but surprisingly i didn't have to wait at all, i got seated right away.it was so warm inside so it made me even more happy to be eating Brooklyn pizza.ordered the large pizza with mushroom, onions and italian sausage.AMAZING!!i think the best thing is the cheese.you have to eat the pizza warm, when it gets cold, it's not as great.the staff were nice.pizza is even better.you MUST come and try pizza here!",5.0
"Grimaldi's has a great pizza but it feels like a tourist trap because of the sheer volume of people served in this small restaurant. Even though they serve a mean thin crust pizza pie they do not serve the best thin crust in the world. The Mozzarella gets stale too quickly. The honor for best thin crust pizza goes to Villa Paradiso in Oslo, Norway",4.0
"I almost gave this place four stars just because the pizza burnt the roof of my mouth and I am still recovering. But just like the wait in line, time heals all and it won't be long until I am enjoying pizza again soon!We didn't wait ""too"" long in comparison to the people at the end of the line on our way out. Our mushroom, onion, and black olive pizza came quickly and was just as delicious as I imagined. The people here aren't overly friendly because they know they don't have to be. While I liked the ambiance of the place, I think next time I would grab it to go to enjoy down by the park or in the comfort of my room. I'm lucky to live close enough to Grimaldi's to make it my go-to pizzeria. Now the trick is to figure out the perfect timing to get in and out. But that's a game that I'm willing to play.

"I was so surprised when I finally ate here two weeks ago and it didn't live up to the famous reputation. It's so popular, I thought, how could it be bad? The crust was chewy, but the stale kind of chewy, and also lacked the nice olive oil flavor I appreciate in good pizza crust. Tomato sauce and mozzarella were not as high quality as I expected. They did have Brooklyn soda in glass bottles, which was the highlight for me. Sad, I know.For good brick-oven pizza, I'd visit Numero 28 in the Village instead, any day. Two Boots is another delicious option (not brick oven) with interesting pies like my favorite, The Bird. Still haven't tried DiFara but I hear it's really the best pizza in New York.

"Damn good pizza but I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes for a seat. My party of 5 polished off a large and medium. We could have easily eaten 2 large pizzas.

"Trekked across the Brooklyn Bridge to Grimaldi's. Got there around 3pm, and luckily the wait was short. We waited for 10 minutes, most likely less.

The first slice was amazing. It was hot, crusty, chewy, and the cheese was gooey! But by the second slice, the pizza cooled down and lost it's effect. The tomato sauce was nice and fresh.

"This place is entirely overrated. This pizza came highly recommended and I had always wanted to try a real Brooklyn slice. I'm from Pittsburgh, a city not known for pizza at all, and I've had better. It wasn't bad, just nothing to write home about. The reason I gave one star was because of the service. AWFUL. Hopefully it was just our particular waiter. He took our drink order and then did not return to take our food order for another 25-30 minutes later, and that's only because we asked the manager multiple times to find our waiter. Finally got our order placed and another 45 minutes passed before we got our pizza. We watched larger tables who sat down after us get their food first, it was only myself and one other person! We were actually about to walk out when our food finally came. Also, they currently don't serve any alcohol and after waiting in the long line you definitely want a cold beer- but you can't get one here. Yes I am a tourist, so I only have this one experience to go off of, but it was not a pleasant one. If you're feeling lucky and you think it will be worth the wait- go for it! But I'd tread cautiously.",1.0
"You know, standing there (I mean sitting in my air conditioned apartment while my roommate stands on line) we weren't sure if Grimaldi's would be worth it.  Honestly - the people aren't that nice* - with that kind of line who has to be? They make you wait in the SAME LINE wether you are waiting for a table or taking out*.  But when the pizza got home - and was reheated, it was oh so tasty.  At first I didn't know, but around bite 5 I was smitten.  I don't think I'd wait in line to bring it up (unless above told roommate told me to) but I'd wait in line to eat it hot and fresh.  And that is how they keep that line long. Forget the bells and whistles - every last one of them. And just deliver good pizza.*All these details were provided by my loving, darling, and reliable roommate. :)",4.0
"Pretty good pizza! The ingredients were really fresh (basil, mozzarella) and the pizza just had good flavor overall. That being said, thin crust pizza i've had in Chicago is better ;) Ok, now that i've gotten that controversy out of the way. Yes, we waited in line but I didn't mind it so much since the line moved rather quickly. Once inside we were seated next to a group of guys that probably made the whole trip THAT much better for me. These guys had the accent you expect to hear in Brooklyn (blame the media!) and I was happy to be sitting close enough to be in on the conversation (and by in I mean eavesdropping). Once I stopped focusing on them (ok, when they left) I was able to look around and see people from all over and really take in the energy of the place. I can why people come here and why a short wait in line is definitely worth it.",4.0
"Ummmm....YUM!!!!!!After traveling from CA to NY, all I wanted was a true NYC pizza experience.  Grimaldi's sure delivered!!  My friend and I shared a pepperoni pizza.  The pepperonis were really yummy and sliced thick, and the mozzarella melted on top was delish.  The pizza was definitely worth waiting in line for.  Kinda bummed out that: a) they did not have any Italian sodas OR regular Dr. Pepper when I visited.  Double whammy b) they are cash only.  Our server wasn't the friendliest, but hey, I didn't go for the great service...I went for the pizza.  Thank you to Travel Channel (or was it Food Network?) for introducing me to this wonderful place.  Next time I'm back east, I'm definitely there!!",5.0
"Seems like they've moved to a bigger and better location. What hasn't changed is the line that stretches down the block! Waits can be anywhere up to an HOUR but the benefit of dining with only one other person is being able to skip ahead of the big groups. A large pizza is surprisingly reasonable at $18. Overall, I'd say it's only worth enjoying if you come when there aren't any lines, which isn't to say never.__April '12 Health Score - B",4.0
"Okay, I really can't say this isn't amazing pizza, because it is.  However, I would not wait on line for this pie.  It is great to go when it isn't too busy, but if not, no way would I go here.  One thing that is pretty irritating, is that the wait for take out is just as long as the wait for dine in.  As a resident of Brooklyn Heights, Grimaldi's really drives away any possible neighborhood fans.",3.0
"In all fairness, the pizza is good.  But is it worth the wait?  No.  Juliana's down the street is the same pizza without the wait, and if you are willing to venture a little farther into Brooklyn, places like Lucali and Giuseppina's are even better.  However, if you have friends who come into town and they are desperate to go to Grimaldi's, you will not leave hungry.",3.0
"Never thought I would say a place is better than Lombardi's in Manhattan, but I have to say this pizza has more flavor.   The crust is a bit chewy for my taste, but the sauce and crust have fantastic flavor.  Well worth the trek out to DUMBO and the pizza can stand on its own without any additional toppings.",5.0
"We were told that while vacationing in Manhattan you gotta walk the Brooklyn Bridge then stand in line for Grimaldi's for some awesome pizza.Two hours later, I'm standing in an hour long line of crazy tourists just like me, baking in full sun, trying not to think about the blister on my heel and craving some awesome pizza.Snail's pace.  People coming out aren't smiling and high fiving each other.  Are we making a mistake?  Should we cut and run, and go back to Angelo's?  No!  Awesome pizza, remember...?!Finally we're in!  Holy poop, it's tight in here.  We're sat at a table that holds 8 (four two tops pressed against each other).  Thank God we're on the aisle (until we're bumped repeatedly, that is), or else I wouldn't have been able to lift my arms.  Seriously, the pizza from the table next to us is sharing our airspace.Good pizza, not great.  They don't let you do half and half, so we did sausage and Kalamata olives.  Crust was a bit soggy in the middle (the kiss of death for thin crust pizza), and the cheese could have been more flavorful.  Maybe we don't know what real NY pizza is... but we didn't think this held up to the hype.",3.0
"Dont waste your time. New York is known for its good pizza. You won't find it here. We waited in line for 20 minutes for a mediocre pizza and contact with the nasty people working there. The thin cheese coating, I swear, looked like latex paint and tasteless, along with the meager sausage bits that they sprinkled on the pie. The service was rude, with not a smile on the faces of anyone working there, especially the older guy barking orders to customers. Their reputation doesn't match the experience. Kind of reminds you of the Seinfeld soup kitchen atmosphere, where we should be grateful that they are willing to take your money for food, except in this case, it is not incredible tasting pizza. They can't be bothered to take credit cards, or offer slices. The place is tiny, dirty and crowded, with 6 inches separating tables.

I'm from Pittsburgh, a city not known for pizza at all, and I've had better. It wasn't bad, just nothing to write home about. The reason I gave one star was because of the service. AWFUL. Hopefully it was just our particular waiter. He took our drink order and then did not return to take our food order for another 25-30 minutes later, and that's only because we asked the manager multiple times to find our waiter. Finally got our order placed and another 45 minutes passed before we got our pizza. We watched larger tables who sat down after us get their food first, it was only myself and one other person! We were actually about to walk out when our food finally came. Also, they currently don't serve any alcohol and after waiting in the long line you definitely want a cold beer- but you can't get one here. Yes I am a tourist, so I only have this one experience to go off of, but it was not a pleasant one. If you're feeling lucky and you think it will be worth the wait- go for it! But I'd tread cautiously.",1.0
"You know, standing there (I mean sitting in my air conditioned apartment while my roommate stands on line) we weren't sure if Grimaldi's would be worth it.  Honestly - the people aren't that nice* - with that kind of line who has to be? They make you wait in the SAME LINE wether you are waiting for a table or taking out*.  But when the pizza got home - and was reheated, it was oh so tasty.  At first I didn't know, but around bite 5 I was smitten.  I don't think I'd wait in line to bring it up (unless above told roommate told me to) but I'd wait in line to eat it hot and fresh.  And that is how they keep that line long. Forget the bells and whistles - every last one of them. And just deliver good pizza.*All these details were provided by my loving, darling, and reliable roommate. :)",4.0
"Pretty good pizza! The ingredients were really fresh (basil, mozzarella) and the pizza just had good flavor overall. That being said, thin crust pizza i've had in Chicago is better ;) Ok, now that i've gotten that controversy out of the way. Yes, we waited in line but I didn't mind it so much since the line moved rather quickly. Once inside we were seated next to a group of guys that probably made the whole trip THAT much better for me. These guys had the accent you expect to hear in Brooklyn (blame the media!) and I was happy to be sitting close enough to be in on the conversation (and by in I mean eavesdropping). Once I stopped focusing on them (ok, when they left) I was able to look around and see people from all over and really take in the energy of the place. I can why people come here and why a short wait in line is definitely worth it.",4.0
"Ummmm....YUM!!!!!!After traveling from CA to NY, all I wanted was a true NYC pizza experience.  Grimaldi's sure delivered!!  My friend and I shared a pepperoni pizza.  The pepperonis were really yummy and sliced thick, and the mozzarella melted on top was delish.  The pizza was definitely worth waiting in line for.  Kinda bummed out that: a) they did not have any Italian sodas OR regular Dr. Pepper when I visited.  Double whammy b) they are cash only.  Our server wasn't the friendliest, but hey, I didn't go for the great service...I went for the pizza.  Thank you to Travel Channel (or was it Food Network?) for introducing me to this wonderful place.  Next time I'm back east, I'm definitely there!!",5.0
"Seems like they've moved to a bigger and better location. What hasn't changed is the line that stretches down the block! Waits can be anywhere up to an HOUR but the benefit of dining with only one other person is being able to skip ahead of the big groups. A large pizza is surprisingly reasonable at $18. Overall, I'd say it's only worth enjoying if you come when there aren't any lines, which isn't to say never.__April '12 Health Score - B",4.0
"Okay, I really can't say this isn't amazing pizza, because it is.  However, I would not wait on line for this pie.  It is great to go when it isn't too busy, but if not, no way would I go here.  One thing that is pretty irritating, is that the wait for take out is just as long as the wait for dine in.  As a resident of Brooklyn Heights, Grimaldi's really drives away any possible neighborhood fans.",3.0
"In all fairness, the pizza is good.  But is it worth the wait?  No.  Juliana's down the street is the same pizza without the wait, and if you are willing to venture a little farther into Brooklyn, places like Lucali and Giuseppina's are even better.  However, if you have friends who come into town and they are desperate to go to Grimaldi's, you will not leave hungry.",3.0
"Never thought I would say a place is better than Lombardi's in Manhattan, but I have to say this pizza has more flavor.   The crust is a bit chewy for my taste, but the sauce and crust have fantastic flavor.  Well worth the trek out to DUMBO and the pizza can stand on its own without any additional toppings.",5.0
"We were told that while vacationing in Manhattan you gotta walk the Brooklyn Bridge then stand in line for Grimaldi's for some awesome pizza.Two hours later, I'm standing in an hour long line of crazy tourists just like me, baking in full sun, trying not to think about the blister on my heel and craving some awesome pizza.Snail's pace.  People coming out aren't smiling and high fiving each other.  Are we making a mistake?  Should we cut and run, and go back to Angelo's?  No!  Awesome pizza, remember...?!Finally we're in!  Holy poop, it's tight in here.  We're sat at a table that holds 8 (four two tops pressed against each other).  Thank God we're on the aisle (until we're bumped repeatedly, that is), or else I wouldn't have been able to lift my arms.  Seriously, the pizza from the table next to us is sharing our airspace.Good pizza, not great.  They don't let you do half and half, so we did sausage and Kalamata olives.  Crust was a bit soggy in the middle (the kiss of death for thin crust pizza), and the cheese could have been more flavorful.  Maybe we don't know what real NY pizza is... but we didn't think this held up to the hype.",3.0
"Dont waste your time. New York is known for its good pizza. You won't find it here. We waited in line for 20 minutes for a mediocre pizza and contact with the nasty people working there. The thin cheese coating, I swear, looked like latex paint and tasteless, along with the meager sausage bits that they sprinkled on the pie. The service was rude, with not a smile on the faces of anyone working there, especially the older guy barking orders to customers. Their reputation doesn't match the experience. Kind of reminds you of the Seinfeld soup kitchen atmosphere, where we should be grateful that they are willing to take your money for food, except in this case, it is not incredible tasting pizza. They can't be bothered to take credit cards, or offer slices. The place is tiny, dirty and crowded, with 6 inches separating tables.

The bland cheese gets somewhat chewy and rubbery.They have tortoni, which I got exited about because I never see it anywhere anymore, but it was only alright and slightly freezer burned.

Even though i had took few culinary sessions and made pizza myself before, but im not picky especially after being starved after 45 min of wait time.IT WAS SO WRONG!!  When I walking out the restaurant, I observe how the guy made the pizza, he simply put tomatoe sause after he put the cheese and the topping! So, that's dough, cheese, toppings then SAUCE!? then olive oil and then heat it up? No wonder my pizza is dripping tomato sauce kinda soggy.I didn't really care when I ask the waiter why is my pizza burn and soggy, he first gave explaintion that because the sausage needs to be cook 10 20 min on the pizza so that's why it's burn.  (Right, but my Italian sausage was pale white instead of slightly brown as other pizzeria shops and if they make the pizza fresh, the fact that they serve our pizza within 5 min after we order the pizza is not possible to get a good pizza.)Well. I then ask him why is it soggy, he gave me this i dun gave a damn type of look , guess what he said, he said then just DON'T come here EVER.If you guys still wanna go there, have fun waiting 45 min for a burn and soggy pizza, and worst service ever!

"Before I begin my review let me announce I am from Hawaii and we are in desperate need for good pizza.  I love pizza and honestly it was hard to believe pizza is better than anywhere else.  This is my third trip to New York but never attempted to take the pizza challenge. (Probably because this was pre-yelp)  Of course I watched food channels and heard about this place and I have my yelp app in my hand I am ready.  The question is where is the best pizza GRIMALDI'S or LOMBARDI'S. Here is my experience at Grimaldis.We have already been to Lombardi so Grimalds already had big shoes to compare to.  Arrived around 7 pm on a Sunday Night. Bad mistake the line was long and we waited over an hour. We debated leaving to go to another place to eat. After walking the Brooklyn Bridge we were tired and just wanted to eat so we agreed to wait.After an hour, the wait was over. We were greeted by a young Italian man with his strong Italian New York accent (really cool) who started hitting on one of our friends. Totally hilarious! We sat down and with 5 of us we decided to order 2 large pizzas (8 huge pieces) We ordered a pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage and a white pizza with spinach and garlic. No sides just straight up pizza. If you question if the ingredients are fresh go walk to the bathroom and you can see up close the chefs in action. They don't like it when you take pictures. Trust me the ingredients are fresh and pizzas are made to order.When the pizza came, I knew this was going to be epic!  The pizza was huge and everything looked fresh. One bite and I knew I was in heaven again. Final Verdict between the battle of Lombardi and Grimaldis.  I will say the same thing about Lombardi.....NEW YORK be happy you have options of maybe the best pizzas in the world. They are both amazing and a must add to your bucket list if you love pizza. I am forever ruined for future pizza....why are you so far away.CON: Only con is we waited one hour at Grimaldis and 10 minutes at Lombardis.  If wait wasn't an obstacle then lucky you have both options.",4.0

"Came here with a group of friends who were visiting the city - it seems that Grimaldi's is on the top of many tourist lists for cool places to go eat outside of Manhattan, so.. here we went!For a group of 12, on a Sunday night starting at 4:30 pm-Our wait was 1.5 hours - For 3 large pizzas, an additional 30 min. But, we had conversations going, so it didn't matter too much.Pro's:- The mozarella here IS good, I'll give it that.- Pizza has a nice thin, yummy crust. Minimal amount of tomato sauce (which I prefer). And it isn't too greasy, which was great.- The guys serving us were very attentive and easy going. Good.- We were surprised to see that, despite that long wait, the inside seating area of Grimaldi's wasn't actually 'packed' at all, like many other popular joints we've been to. I sort of admire the fact that they don't stuff so many tables into the restaurant to get as many people seated as possible. And, if anything, it made the eating environment less noisy, more enjoyable.Con's:- The wait. -- I would give this place 4 stars, but, I would probably never go to this place again because of the wait. But, I AM glad that I have at least tried it and can say that I've been here.- Again about the wait - the lines for eating in vs. take out are the SAME. Remember, CASH only!",2.0

I'm not sure what ""kind"" of pizza this is, but I don't think its for me, at least not from here.",2.0
"If I can. I would give zero star because IT IS THE WORST pizza EVER!!!!Now, why is a worse? Simply put, the bottom of the pizza was BURN .with black color type of burn patches. You can taste the bitterness of the ASHES!!  lolz. It was SOGGY like the other ppl mentioned here. Mines was like dripping wet!It might be good before, or good sometimes, depending who fix your pizza.I wonder how can you make a pizza taste so horrible. Even though i had took few culinary sessions and made pizza myself before, but im not picky especially after being starved after 45 min of wait time.IT WAS SO WRONG!!  When I walking out the restaurant, I observe how the guy made the pizza, he simply put tomatoe sause after he put the cheese and the topping! So, that's dough, cheese, toppings then SAUCE!? then olive oil and then heat it up? No wonder my pizza is dripping tomato sauce kinda soggy.I didn't really care when I ask the waiter why is my pizza burn and soggy, he first gave explaintion that because the sausage needs to be cook 10 20 min on the pizza so that's why it's burn.  (Right, but my Italian sausage was pale white instead of slightly brown as other pizzeria shops and if they make the pizza fresh, the fact that they serve our pizza within 5 min after we order the pizza is not possible to get a good pizza.)Well. I then ask him why is it soggy, he gave me this i dun gave a damn type of look , guess what he said, he said then just DON'T come here EVER.If you guys still wanna go there, have fun waiting 45 min for a burn and soggy pizza, and worst service ever! I left the place still hungry, not to waste the Money and time, I just ate their bland tasting toppings.When they are getting famous and rich, they hire a person who don't know how to make pizza, take your money, and say , next!",1.0
"I would gladly live underneath the Brooklyn Bridge if it meant that I could eat Grimaldi's everyday. Since I actually have no interest in being homeless, I will have to settle for eating at Grimaldi's during the only time I am ever in that part of Brooklyn: for the free summer movies under the Brooklyn Bridge.Be warned: Grimaldi's gets incredibly crowded, even if you are only going to pick up a pie. I remember waiting a good 40 minutes outside, just to order the pie, then another 30 minutes for it to be done. That being said, I will gladly wait over an hour and travel to the middle-of-nowhere Brooklyn (at least it feels that way, coming from middle-of-nowhere Queens) to get a Grimaldi's pie. Grimaldi's pizza + picnic blanket spread out under the bridge + free movie = best date ever.",5.0
If I had an option to not rate I would! They have the worst Customer service ever! We came all the way from California & walked the Brooklyn bridge in the damn rain to get the worst service! My friends and I decided to go next door to Juliana's which is amazing!! The food and service is beyond! Plus it super cute! Drop grimaldis and go to Juliana's,1.0
"Before I begin my review let me announce I am from Hawaii and we are in desperate need for good pizza.  I love pizza and honestly it was hard to believe pizza is better than anywhere else.  This is my third trip to New York but never attempted to take the pizza challenge. (Probably because this was pre-yelp)  Of course I watched food channels and heard about this place and I have my yelp app in my hand I am ready.  The question is where is the best pizza GRIMALDI'S or LOMBARDI'S. Here is my experience at Grimaldis.We have already been to Lombardi so Grimalds already had big shoes to compare to.  Arrived around 7 pm on a Sunday Night. Bad mistake the line was long and we waited over an hour. We debated leaving to go to another place to eat. After walking the Brooklyn Bridge we were tired and just wanted to eat so we agreed to wait.After an hour, the wait was over. We were greeted by a young Italian man with his strong Italian New York accent (really cool) who started hitting on one of our friends. Totally hilarious! We sat down and with 5 of us we decided to order 2 large pizzas (8 huge pieces) We ordered a pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage and a white pizza with spinach and garlic. No sides just straight up pizza. If you question if the ingredients are fresh go walk to the bathroom and you can see up close the chefs in action. They don't like it when you take pictures. Trust me the ingredients are fresh and pizzas are made to order.When the pizza came, I knew this was going to be epic!  The pizza was huge and everything looked fresh. One bite and I knew I was in heaven again. Final Verdict between the battle of Lombardi and Grimaldis.  I will say the same thing about Lombardi.....NEW YORK be happy you have options of maybe the best pizzas in the world. They are both amazing and a must add to your bucket list if you love pizza. I am forever ruined for future pizza....why are you so far away.CON: Only con is we waited one hour at Grimaldis and 10 minutes at Lombardis.  If wait wasn't an obstacle then lucky you have both options.",4.0
"Not that this place needs another review, so I'll just say that this is the best pizza I've ever had and I don't even eat sausage....I was wowed!!!",5.0
"I think if you like a social pizza this is the place to go. They really let the food do the talking  - at last. Service is accommodating and they temper the rush with a no reservation, cash only policy. They'll accommodate anything you need but the killer blow IS that the pizza is absolutely fantastic.This one goes to all those Italians who rock up late expecting perfection... cos this is as lose to casual pizza bliss you're going to find this side of the Atlantic. Bellisimo !!TIP 23/25@DunsterNY",5.0
"Came here with a group of friends who were visiting the city - it seems that Grimaldi's is on the top of many tourist lists for cool places to go eat outside of Manhattan, so.. here we went!For a group of 12, on a Sunday night starting at 4:30 pm-Our wait was 1.5 hours - For 3 large pizzas, an additional 30 min. But, we had conversations going, so it didn't matter too much.Pro's:- The mozarella here IS good, I'll give it that.- Pizza has a nice thin, yummy crust. Minimal amount of tomato sauce (which I prefer). And it isn't too greasy, which was great.- The guys serving us were very attentive and easy going. Good.- We were surprised to see that, despite that long wait, the inside seating area of Grimaldi's wasn't actually 'packed' at all, like many other popular joints we've been to. I sort of admire the fact that they don't stuff so many tables into the restaurant to get as many people seated as possible. And, if anything, it made the eating environment less noisy, more enjoyable.Con's:- The wait. -- I would give this place 4 stars, but, I would probably never go to this place again because of the wait. But, I AM glad that I have at least tried it and can say that I've been here.- Again about the wait - the lines for eating in vs. take out are the SAME. Remember, CASH only!",2.0
"My boyfriend and i got lucky the day we decided to try Grimaldi's. There was no line and we found parking like right in front. It was a spur of the moment thing as we passed by and i saw there was no line.We ordered a reg plain pizza. The pizza was good. Brick oven usually is. It was made quickly with fresh ingredients and i always love fresh mozzarella :) Sauce was good and overall the pizza was good.Inside the place was nothing special. just some tables, maybe a little wood feel and a blasting hot brick oven in the middle. It's cool that you can watch them prepare the pizza. Staff was ok, nothing great.I'm glad i got to experience the pizza without the wait. I think i would've thought way less if this place if i had to wait on line for an hr+ just to taste pizza that was ""good."" HOWEVER, as a tourist who hasn't experienced NY pizza, it would be really good :)",4.0
"Was it good? Sure. Was it worth an 1 hr long wait in the blazing heat? No. I never went to the Grimaldi's at its original location next door so I can't attest to whether the quality has gone up or down since relocating. However, I can say for certainty that Lombardi's beats Grimaldi's (new location)",3.0
Really awesome pizza!Went around noon on a Monday and there was line but we only waited about 10 min before being sent upstairs to be seated.  The server upstairs (bald headed gentleman) was really rude but what do you expect? I'm sure he deals with tourists all day long and that may be why he was PMS-ing.  We ordered the pie 1/2 sausage and 1/2 margarita.  The dough is very good but the only complaint I had was that there wasn't enough sauce with every bite but I guess that's how Grimaldi's makes their pizza. Cash only and be ready for the pizza nazi upstairs!!,4.0
"Grimaldi's is oft regarded as ""the pizza mecca"" for New Yorkers.  Why?  I haven't the slightest clue. I just didn't get what all the hype was all about. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but definitely not the best i've had.While I will give them credit for their use of ""just picked off the vine"" fresh ingredients and generous cuts of meat; i thought the flavor was seriously lacking,...dare i say, even bordering blandness. Perhaps, it was our poor choice of toppings that led to such an underwhelming experience (ordered a pepperoni & mushroom pizza.  1/2 reg. 1/2 white). Or could it have been the fact that I (secretly) refused to give in to the $2 Parmesan Cheese [surcharge].  What a terrible punishment.",3.0
"If you are taking the hike across the Brooklyn Bridge why not make a stop of this iconic restaurant.

Whether the patrons were tourists, locals, or business men everyone seemed to be enjoying the food. The staff was pleasantly grumpy and got the food out very quickly.

"Execellent fresh ingredient pizza. Poor service. Decent prices.I won't say it is the best because I have had better but this pizza is different than most because it's made to order. Most things made to order taste better. The cheese is real mozzarella, not the weak shit that normally is spread onto pizza nowadays. Also they put the cheese first then the sauce- nice twist.

I went to Grimaldi's with three other friends saturday night. We waited outside in line for five minutes before getting a table on the second floor. Foodies be aware this is a cash only and you need to order a pie (6 or 8 slices). You probably need three or four people to finish the pie. The pizza was nothing special definitely not Worth of a line outside.I came back to Grimaldi's the follow saturday evening in hopes of getting a better experience. Nope. Waited for 45 minutes. I tried the white pizza. It was saltier and worse than the regular pizza with tomato sauce.,2.0
Went last night with a close friend and sat down to eat there.  They didn't seem to be to crowded so that is always nice considering it was a week day and late at night.  The staff was very friendly and nice. We had a peperoni pizza with basil and it really was truly good. I've been traveling a lot and Ben eating pizza everywhere I go just to compare it and I can say I've only had 4 pizzas better than this one.  I would definitely go back again if time permitted. It wasn't overly pricey either so that's always pleasant.  And they don't do slices which is alright. But definitely worth stopping by and grabbing some pizza here.,5.0

Always a long line but we didn't have to wait long since we were willing to sit at the bar. We got a small pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was good. They use fresh mozzarella and basil.

"I'm giving these guys 3 stars for a number of reasons.  First of all, maybe it's my fault, but I had it really hyped up in my head before I had even arrived.  That day, my wife and I decided to take the 6 train to city hall and walk across the bridge.  By the time I got there, I was famished, but then I saw the line.  It was long, but this is New York.  Once we got inside, we were seated in a cramped table in very close quarters.  Then it took quite a while for us to be approached by our server.  In fact, we had to flag one down.  If we didn't , who knows how long it would have been.  We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom, two waters, and a root beer for my wife.  The pizza took a long time to come out.  Usually these thin crust, coal or brick oven places cook pizzas at a very high temperature, so a pizza can cook in 5 min or so, but it seemed to take about 20 mins or so for our pizza to come.  It did come out hot and fresh though.  Definitely no complaints on freshness. The pizza......it was big enough for two to eat, and take home a couple of slices.  It looked like it was cooked nicely from the top, just the right amount of toppings, not skimpy at all.  There were a few crust bubbles that should have been popped during cooking, that bubbled up and turned black, but I could live with those.  The pepperoni was excellent, maybe the best I've ever had.  At first, I thought they were too small, as I typically prefer the larger ones, but once I tasted them, they were amazing!  And nice thick pieces too.  The cheese was great, the mushrooms fresh.  My other complaint was that the crust was wet at the bottom.  Not from undercooking or being raw, but from condensation.  I think that means that they need to put some cornmeal underneath it to get a little airflow under it, but maybe not..I'm not a pizza cooking expert, just a pizza eating expert.  Lastly the sauce. It was rich, flavorful, and on the sweeter side.  it was awesome sauce.My wife didn't like her root beer, so I had a sip, and it was overly sweet for my tastes as well.  But not Grimaldis fault.  They didn't brew it.  The water, was water.  lol.Overall, I give three stars because the soggy crust was a big disappointment, the line was a little annoying, but not the worst, and the service was non existent.  The price wasn't bad either.  Our bill was just over $20.Would I go again? Probably not, but maybe.  I would prefer to keep moving forward on my search for the best pizza in NYC because there are infinite pizza shops in this city, and when you find something you love, you'll know it.Some other pizza places that I recommend are Patsy's in East Harlem, Europan because I love the super crispy crust, but my favorite was Eataly.  The pizza was wood or coal fired, but the best part was the cheese on the 4 cheese pizza.  It was the richest, creamiest cheese that I've ever had.  I love cheese my whole life, and I had no ideal that cheese even existed like the 4 cheese pizza at Eataly.  That place is by the Flatiron building.  Try it.",3.0
"I heard this was the best pizzeria in NYC.  It's not anything fancy, just a hole-in-the-wall kinda place.  It's pretty cramped in there.  You pretty much don't have any other choice but to be sitting shoulder to shoulder with stranger(s).  The staff is friendly, but due to the restaurant being so busy, you won't get as much attentive service that you normally would at a sit down restaurant.  HOWEVER, the pizza definitely makes up for it.  I don't consider myself a pizzaholic by any means, but from my experiences, this was the best pizza I've tasted thus far in my life.  YUMMMM.",5.0

"So our group wanted to do the touristy and walk the bridge, ending with Grimaldi's. I think that's where the hype comes from. You walk so much that when you get you food, you think it tastes amazing.Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad. The pizza is actually pretty delicious and flavorful, but the hype definitely contributes to my high expectations. The line, as expected, was very long and we were met with the same wait for our food.I like pizza, I really do. But I know there are a ton of smaller, less well-known places that can deliver as well. And without the wait. So overall, good pizza if you want to do the whole walk over the bridge deal.",3.0
"Let me start off by saying that grimaldi's has good and delicious pizza but my rating is for the way i felt after i ate it...let me explain. I was expecting an explosive burst of Italy in my mouth; something way beyond 5 stars. Everybody has hyped Grimaldi's up to be this unbelievabley crazy tasting pizza. The line, The wait...it's like this pizza that's supposed to be so exclusive that you have to wait. Well, I was so Dissapointed in the margherita pizza that me and my bf both finished.   The hype was so not worth even spending the money or wasting the tome.  As I said the pizza tastes good, but I've had far more better.",2.0
I went to Grimaldi's with three other friends saturday night. We waited outside in line for five minutes before getting a table on the second floor. Foodies be aware this is a cash only and you need to order a pie (6 or 8 slices). You probably need three or four people to finish the pie. The pizza was nothing special definitely not Worth of a line outside.I came back to Grimaldi's the follow saturday evening in hopes of getting a better experience. Nope. Waited for 45 minutes. I tried the white pizza. It was saltier and worse than the regular pizza with tomato sauce.,2.0
Went last night with a close friend and sat down to eat there.  They didn't seem to be to crowded so that is always nice considering it was a week day and late at night.  The staff was very friendly and nice. We had a peperoni pizza with basil and it really was truly good. I've been traveling a lot and Ben eating pizza everywhere I go just to compare it and I can say I've only had 4 pizzas better than this one.  I would definitely go back again if time permitted. It wasn't overly pricey either so that's always pleasant.  And they don't do slices which is alright. But definitely worth stopping by and grabbing some pizza here.,5.0
"Great pizza!!!worth waiting.But I would not stay there, service not as good as pizza.",4.0
Always a long line but we didn't have to wait long since we were willing to sit at the bar. We got a small pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was good. They use fresh mozzarella and basil. I was hoping the pepperoni would be a little spicier but it was good. People friendly took a little bit to gt served though.,4.0
"I'm giving these guys 3 stars for a number of reasons.  First of all, maybe it's my fault, but I had it really hyped up in my head before I had even arrived.  That day, my wife and I decided to take the 6 train to city hall and walk across the bridge.  By the time I got there, I was famished, but then I saw the line.  It was long, but this is New York.  Once we got inside, we were seated in a cramped table in very close quarters.  Then it took quite a while for us to be approached by our server.  In fact, we had to flag one down.  If we didn't , who knows how long it would have been.  We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom, two waters, and a root beer for my wife.  The pizza took a long time to come out.  Usually these thin crust, coal or brick oven places cook pizzas at a very high temperature, so a pizza can cook in 5 min or so, but it seemed to take about 20 mins or so for our pizza to come.  It did come out hot and fresh though.  Definitely no complaints on freshness.

"Stopped by Grimaldi's yesterday to try out NY's supposed best pizza... we waited over an hour in line for takeout- yes... I said TAKEOUT. You have to wait in the same line as everyone trying to eat in the restaurant unfortunately. We opted to eat at the pier down the street for the lovely city views at dusk and I'm very happy we did. The pizza was very good- we ordered a large half pepperoni. The fresh mozzarella is all that and more. The crust and sauce are yummy as well. But to tell you the truth, I've had pizza similar to this so I wasn't mind blown like some of the other yelpers were. I'd go back but hopefully not to deal with an hour plus line.",4.0
"Best. Pizza. Ever.I'm not even a huge pizza eater but I dreaaamm and droool about this place.  Crust is thin, soft when warm, and delightfully chewy when cooled.  Cheese is generously layered on in slabs, tomato sauce is light but wonderfully textured.  Ohhhh myyyyy.Always have to wait in line to get in, despite going at the oddest hours but SO INCREDIBLY WORTH IT.",5.0

"Stopped in here with my mom and my aunt after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. I had heard about long lines, but the line was short was when got there and it moved fast, we were seated in less than 5 minutes. We were seated upstairs, the tables were tight together and it seemed like most of the people around us were European. Service was friendly and efficient and in a short time we had a lovely Margarita pizza and some root beer to wash it down. Was it the best pizza ever? No. Was it really good pizza? Yes! I love me a good crust and this pizza had it. The ambiance is what really makes the place here. Our entire meal came to under $30 dollars and was probably the steal of our vacation. I would definitely visit again.",4.0

Why bother having a line if you're just going to pick and choose who gets in from the freaking line! Why bother waiting!

Let's go 1 hour into pour seating and we find out they're cleaning the fucking oven. Really?? Tell your customers that before sitting them!

"""Sooo when are we going to Grimaldis?  Jeff and I are down anytime.""  These were the words of a close friend who fell in love with Grimaldis the first time after going there in Manhattan.  ""It can't be better than Lombardis!"" was always me and a close girlfriend's reply.  So we went off on the search for the best pizza in the city, based on our limited time and knowledge.

The manager here is always so attentive too - walking from table to table talking and joking around. I've come back here multiple times after this, and most days, there has been a wait.

From all this, I have learned to just stick with the margarita pizza here. It is to die for. If you're visiting and aren't coming back any time soon, just stay in the long line and wait.

It was a tasty pizza but for me it's hard to differentiate great pizza. Once  pizza is done right, it's all very good to me. My one gripe has nothing to do with Grimald's but with Brooklyn Soda Works. It really sucks and isn't artisanal at all. The soda is terrible. They give you your own bottle and the soda is barely fizzy. I had root beer, for 4 dollars I'm expecting the root beer to taste better than Mug or A&W brand but it didn't. I love root beer and this tasted like dollar general root beer that someone opened, took a sip, and put it back on the shelf without the cap. Totally disappointing with the pizza.",4.0

"Grimaldi's does have pretty god pizza. It is also a little over-rated. The choices of pizza are pretty standard: pepperoni, sausage, pepperoni and sausage.Fortunately, though there is a ridiculous wait, my bud and I got lucky and we practically walked in as the line formed behind us down the street. Unfortunately, we got a table stuck in the corner that the servers barely seemed to notice.I'm not going to tell you that I have had better pizza that often, but baking home-made pizza would be pretty close to Grimaldi's except for the classic brick-oven.Would I wait in line at Grimaldi's a second time for the pizza? Probably not. Would I suggest going to anyone who likes pizza? Yes. Was I one of the tourists frustrating the New York locals who might not have gotten their pizza at the snap of their fingers? Yes.",4.0
"Upon further review, I feel like I want to place Grimaldi's just slightly ahead of Lombardi's, which has been my all time fav since '98.  Seriously on some other level of what a pie can be...just had Lombardi's in May, as well, so everything's fresh in my mind.That being said, I suppose choosing one over the other is an exercise in futility - Grimaldi's crust is better, but Lombardi's still brings it with the sauce and toppings.  They should, by all rights, be forever tied as the two best pizza joints in the history of humankind's existence.Anyways, 5 stars is a no brainer here.",5.0

They give you your own bottle and the soda is barely fizzy. I had root beer, for 4 dollars I'm expecting the root beer to taste better than Mug or A&W brand but it didn't. I love root beer and this tasted like dollar general root beer that someone opened, took a sip, and put it back on the shelf without the cap. Totally disappointing with the pizza.",4.0
"Delicious pizza!  Can't really go wrong!  Wait...you can?Ohhhh, you must be talking about the wait!I once waited an hour for a table.  It was someone's birthday and if it wasn't her birthday I'm not sure I would have waited.  I brought an out-of-towner when I went last week (the responsibilities of being a New Yorker!) and luckily we only had to wait 5 minutes!  It was also a Tuesday at 2:30pm.  But waiting aside, the pizza is delicious.  I thought that the large would be too much for the two of us, but we gobbled it down.  I wish they served salad though.  Nothing fancy or anything but I love some salad with delicious thin-crust pizza.",4.0
"Good pizza!!  Standing under the Brooklyn Bridge outside of the restaurant forming a line just to get a piece of that Brookly pie while sitting neck to neck to a stranger in the table beside you that is enjoying the same thing as you. Pizza is good and comes out very quick, seems like they just want you to eat and get out so they can keep their line moving outside, but it's understandable because of the high demands people ask for.  Pizza comes to your table, piping hot, slightly crispy and slightly soft, depending on where you bite, but overall very enjoyable.",4.0
"Grimaldi's does have pretty god pizza. It is also a little over-rated. The choices of pizza are pretty standard: pepperoni, sausage, pepperoni and sausage.Fortunately, though there is a ridiculous wait, my bud and I got lucky and we practically walked in as the line formed behind us down the street. Unfortunately, we got a table stuck in the corner that the servers barely seemed to notice.I'm not going to tell you that I have had better pizza that often, but baking home-made pizza would be pretty close to Grimaldi's except for the classic brick-oven.Would I wait in line at Grimaldi's a second time for the pizza? Probably not. Would I suggest going to anyone who likes pizza? Yes. Was I one of the tourists frustrating the New York locals who might not have gotten their pizza at the snap of their fingers? Yes.",4.0
"Upon further review, I feel like I want to place Grimaldi's just slightly ahead of Lombardi's, which has been my all time fav since '98.  Seriously on some other level of what a pie can be...just had Lombardi's in May, as well, so everything's fresh in my mind.That being said, I suppose choosing one over the other is an exercise in futility - Grimaldi's crust is better, but Lombardi's still brings it with the sauce and toppings.  They should, by all rights, be forever tied as the two best pizza joints in the history of humankind's existence.Anyways, 5 stars is a no brainer here.",5.0
"Supposedly the best pizza in NYC, I was HIGHLY disappointed when I tried it. Let me start from the beginning. I went here in the summer and had to wait outside for around 90 minutes, give or take, whilst starving. I finally get inside and the pizzeria, from what I saw, was only about half full. I sat down for about thirty minutes before someone came to take my order, which really ticked me off because it's already been two hours. I order one normal sized pizza to share with my cousin and we had to wait another 45 minutes for ONE relatively small pizza, even though other tables were being served before us, even though they came in after. I saw the chefs constantly making pizzas, so I don't understand why I had to wait so long. After receiving the pizza, it looked like there was little to no effort into making it and they skimped out on many of the ingredients (mainly the sauce and cheese). The quality of the meat and cheese were top notch and are the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of one. I'd give it a 1.5 if I could.TL:DR - After a three hour wait, I got a relatively small, overpriced pizza that looked like little to no effort was put into it. It was one of the most disappointing moments of my life, after hearing such great things about this place. Would not recommend unless the service drastically changes.",2.0
"If you make a trip out to Grimaldi's you should def soak in the sights of that the nearby brooklyn bridge pier 1 park has to offer. Perfect place for a date: grab some ice cream, watch the sun set over the Financial District skyline, and then finish the night off with some of NY's finest pizza.Been here 3 times, each time with a different group of visitors and there has always been a line! The line usually moves pretty quickly and I've waited 30 min twice, but memorial weekend I waited 1hr45min!! For whatever reason people were loitering inside and taking their sweet time that night. Good thing to do while waiting in line is have one of your party pick up ice cream from the ice cream factory and bring it back.The pizza is very comparable to Lombardi's. For those who claim Lombardi's is better than Grimaldi's or vice-versa, they're just kidding themselves. It's like a coke/pepsi argument. For toppings I  recommend fresh garlic, extra tomatoes, and extra basil. Simply delish!",4.0
"So there are a lot of things that change people's lives, and this happens to be one of those things that changed the lives of some New Yorkers I talked to. I figured I should try it, so a few friends and I ventured over. First of all, if you are able and strong enough, do cross the Brooklyn Bridge by foot. The view is amazing, the wind and sun are friendly, and do stay away from the bike lanes because they WILL run you over. There was a lengthy line when we arrived, but I do think we didn't stay in line for longer than 1.5 hours. Considering that I've waited around this time in plenty of situations here in California, this was no biggie. Of course it didn't help that it was unbelievably hot and there's no shade. Oh and I was wearing black. And jeans. And a turtleneck. I am such an idiot sometimes. Anyway, we finally got in and it was very crowded. The restaurant is small, and everyone sits pretty close to each other. There were only about three waiters for the whole place, and our waiter was pretty crappy. We didn't even get our water until we were about 25 minutes in, and it felt like a lifetime before we even got our pizza. We ordered a large pizza with mushrooms, garlic and sausage. So the million-dollar question: was it life-changing? No. It felt like a regular pizza for me. But this is an unfair question to ask me, because I think Pizza Hut can be heavenly as well. I would not go to Grimaldi's again though. The pizza was great, but I've already forgotten how it tasted.If you want a slice of real New York pizza though, don't go here. Go to a corner in the city and get it from a cart. Those are just as good for me.",3.0

"As everyone points out... is it really worth waiting in the line? Yep. sure is.  We went to lunch there yesterday and waited in line about an hour. It was totally worth it. The pizza was fabulous, the drinks nice and cool, the price a bargain and the service friendly and welcoming. If it is a sunny day, a sun umbrella is a nice thing to have along with you for the wait in line :)",4.0
"I had tried at least 3 times on my other trips to NY to eat here. The line was always blocks long - even to get to-go is the same line. It really looked like they have one coal burning oven with limited capacity to make pizzas. They also recently moved and changed owners which might explain the other location that popped up in Manhattan. I never had a chance to try the old place but the pizza here is pretty darn good. Anyways we came about a half an hour before opening and were first in line. Waiting before is way better than waiting in that long line. Anyways they took their sweet time opening up their doors and setting up the line poles. Didn't open till 5 minutes past. Then they have one guy bring in each party one at a time. We somehow got seated in the back and had the hardest time flagging a waiter down when we were ready. We were seated first so shouldn't we be able to be one the first ones to order. I saw at least 7 tickets in the window before we got our order up there. If there's anything that's a pet peeve of mine at restaurants, it's slow and inefficient service. So anyways we ordered 2 smalls - one with pepperoni and one with olive and sausage. Each small comes with 6 huge slices so 12 slices for 4 people is a lot. Especially when three out of the four are girls. I think we should've gotten a large (which is 8 slices) and called it a day. The crust is very thin and can be burnt at some places but it's fast to cook and the food came out relatively quick for pizza. I definitely think I'm more of a thin crust fan than a thick crust and this place makes thin crust like the best of them. Quality ingredients too. Pepperoni is small and kinda sparse on the pizza but thickly sliced and so good. Love their sauce and mozzarella cheese. I think I liked their sausage more but the olives were your typical canned olives and these were way to salty to me so it kinda threw off the balance of the pizza. Their sodas and beers are bottles btw. The busboy kept up with clearing the tables quickly but we had to ask for refills on water. And I asked him for the check (only because we didn't spot a waiter for like 15 minutes) twice to no avail. So annoyed that I just ended up walking up to the counter to pay. Should've stiffed them on their tip but whatever. Great, almost perfect pizza but dang their service and long lines prevents them from from getting so many stars.",3.0
"For my visit to NYC, I was determined to find some great NY pizza.  This was the spot.  The pizza was just flavorful with every bite.  They use really, really fresh ingredients, they use liberal amounts of basil, and their cheese is delicious.   Their crust is pretty special too.  I enjoyed every bite.  My friend and I finished a large between the two of us, but we probably would have been okay with a small pizza.  I ordered my pizza with sundried tomatoes, garlic, and pepperoni.  You probably don't need any of those ingredients....next time I'd just get a basic margherita.  I think the crust, tomato sauce, basil, and cheese are so flavorful, that you will be satisfied.The wait is what everyone talks about.  We came 15 minutes prior to it opening on a thursday in July and there were about 8 people in line ahead of us.  But I hear that wait times can be upwards of an hour if you come at a busier time.   Plan ahead if possible, because this place is worth a stop.  It's located in DUMBO and it's within a few feet of the brooklyn and manhattan bridges. Eat your food, walk down water st for some awesome desserts, and take some great pictures of the bridges.  Great way to spend an afternoon!",5.0
"Love this pizza! Get the margharita, all you need is cheese, basil and sauce. Less is more. But if you must get toppings, be assured everything is fresh and delicious. Its a bit thicker then some of the New York style pizza so its not as crispy. Its a taste thing and I think its great. We've never been disappointed. Only thing I've never liked is the seating arrangements. Often if you come in with a large group like coworkers out for a lunch, you end up waiting until enough space opens up or you get split up. Very inconsistent so sometimes its short and sometimes its long.  But the pizza is worth it.",4.0
"Grimaldi's is kind of a diva of a pizza place...it's kind of like housing in Santa Barbara, CA where you have an ocean view. Except the difference between Santa Barbara realtors  and Grimaldi's is that they won't rip you off for it (the prices are pretty fair), but what you won't get with your pie is a nice dining atmosphere. The dining room is small, cramped, and unless you have a party of four or more, be ready to share a table with strangers. The walls are old and hang outdated, dusty pictures. If you're the unfortunate soul to sit next to the kitchen, watch your head, you might get elbowed! There's one bathroom and you better wait next to the door because otherwise you'll be holding it for a long time and while you're waiting expect to be poked and prodded by the staff because you're in their way. I didn't believe that the line was outrageously long to place an order (to and in house dining is the same line) until I saw the sign next door to rent a chair for $3 with a $20 deposit. What I like about this place is that it's like a marriage...it works, so why put in the work to make sure its tip top and modern? The place is simple - cash only, no reservations, first come first serve. The olives are kalamata and I was happy to see capers and anchovies on the menu.  Cheese is the base for most pies, sauces is topped off on the end. Bring a sweater, it's worth the wait.",4.0

Pizza isn't something you ""slow cook"" in a 1000 degree oven.  So I'm not sure what they're doing back there but the lack of service and the time it took to get my pizza was absolutely absurd.  In summary, get in the place at like 11:30, probably don't get out of there until 1:30.  Stick to Joe's or Lombardi's where you can get a slice or a whole pizza in about 3 minutes.",3.0
"nothing new to be said... fabulous NY pizza, exceeded my expectations. ordered a regular small to split with my friend. perfect amount for two ladies.we arrived around 8 pm on friday evening. no surprise, there was a long line out the door. however, we walked right in and immediately plopped ourselves at the bar! easy peasy!4 stars for the pizza and snagging a bar seat right away5th star is for our delightful conversation with the owner, who walked over and chatted us up (of course with a heavy, charmingly mafia-esque NY accent and swagger) until our pizza arrived. cash only, no reservations, no slices, and no delivery",5.0
"After waiting for nearly an hour on a Saturday evening, it started pouring but good thing my friend brought an umbrella beforehand from a nearby gift shop. Hoping lines would get shorter after the rain, unfortunately, it didn't. Boo! I thought it must definitely be worth it. To my disappointment, this place was not what I expected. Living in NYC my entire life, I felt like this was just something simple. I could have definitely gotten better pizza elsewhere.Overall, this is definitely a ""must go to tourist spot."" Prices were decent and the restaurant itself was large and roomy.",3.0

"Adam R. mentioned to me that as much as I love pizza (especially real NY pizza), I've never given any place five stars. Not even Patsy's, which I really do just adore. So I decided I'd give that honor to Grimaldi's.I think every time I've been here has been preceded by a long walk (including going over the Brooklyn Bridge), which makes me wonder if the hunger I incur from that walk makes the pizza taste better. Or maybe it's just that good.I think it's that good.Yes, the lines suck. And yes, there are tourists and locals alike in that line. And yes, the line is worse when it's nice out. But the pizza when you finally get to it? It's heavenly. Huge bubbles on the cornicione with crispy crust. Not too heavy on the cheese but not skimpy either. Just delicious, really! I mean droolworthy... our party was so invested in this pizza that every time they brought a pie by we almost took down the waiter to steal it.",5.0
"[insert Karate Kid theme song ""You're the Best Around""]Let's get down to brass tacks folks - this pizza is freaking amazing.  I challenge you to name any better pizza in NYC or beyond.  Delicious salty crust, fresh pizza sauce mozzarella - you can't go wrong.The line out the door is always annoying, but always worth it.  I've waited out in the hot, cold, rain, etc., and have never been disappointed once I made it inside and sank my teeth into a slice of that delicious pizza pie.Last time I dined at Grimaldi's, I made a renegade decision and branched out from the margherita pizza and tried the white pizza - AH-mazing!  Next time we're ordering both.Don't forget - it's cash only, no refills on sodas.  It's annoying, but accept it.  The pizza product is worth it!",5.0

"Okay, so we've all heard how fantastic the pizza is here...

What we didn't know was they periodically call out looking to fill small tables for 2 and we surprisingly managed to cut ahead of about 40 people. What luck! We waited a while to be served. The pizza took a while to produce but came nice and piping hot. Their tomato sauce was on the sweeter side. We took about an hour to eat, get our check, and head out. And on the way out we spotted the party that was right ahead of us in the line. Yes, they were still waiting in the line. I kid you not.

"This was the first stop on our Pizza Tour of Brooklyn this weekend. Grimaldi's is often dismissed by pizza purists for being a tourist trap, but I thought it absolutely lived up to the hype. The pizza here was excellent, and while maybe not quite as good as Di Fara or Totonno's, it's certainly in the same league, and for many, much easier to get to. We got 3 pizzas: 1 plain cheese, 1 with garlic and 1 with half pepperoni, half mushroom. I only had the latter two, but both were top notch. The cheese was very high quality and the crust was some of the best I've had. The pepperoni wasn't the best, but the mushrooms were delicious. It was vastly superior to any pizza I can get in DC, that's for sure.The one obvious knock on Grimaldi's is the wait. You have to wait outside in line before you can order, regardless of whether you want to eat in or carry out. Our wait wasn't horrendous, but it was about 30 minutes, and in 95+ degree weather, it was a little taxing. The line got noticeably longer an hour later too. After waiting in line you still need to wait another 20-30 minutes for your pizza to be ready, and there's nowhere inside to wait, so back outside into the heat we went. I'd say Grimaldi's is absolutely worth going to, but like Di Fara, not an every day kind of place because of the long wait.

"Okay, I want to start off that this place deserves a 5-star review on the pizza alone.  However our server mistakenly rang up our order as a ""to-go,"" leaving us questioning where our pie was 30 minutes after having sat down. And after the looong wait, and me being starving, and them only giving us a sorry, I had to knock off one star. I will say that they did get the new pizza out within 10 minutes of having recognized their mistake. But with my husband being a restaurant manager, I've learned to expect a little more than just a ""sorry"" after a pretty big goof. But they've got people waiting in line for them, most of them tourists like us. So I imagine only a sorry is sufficient for them.Here's the deal:- The wait is long. I think it's worth it. If you don't like lines just to be seated, then don't come here. - It's a hole in the wall joint in Brooklyn steps from the bridge. If you expect upscale bathrooms, you'll be sorely underwhelmed.- This place is a machine. They take your order, pizza is (in our case, should have been) ready in about 10-15 minutes, you eat, you're out. (Keep in mind, there's some other person waiting for the pizza.  Don't just sit there and act like a schmuck for hours.)- This isn't Domino's or Pizza Hut. So don't come here looking for a 3 for $15 special. Is it a little pricier than what I'm used to? Absolutely.  But is it worth it? H-ll yes!!This is one of the best NY style pizzas I've ever had, with the exception of Village Pizza here in LA. The bread is good, the sauce is alright--not too powerful to overwhelm the pizza, but enough flavor to get the right taste. The pepperoni and mushrooms were fresh and perfect. The mozzarella wasn't loaded on the pizza, but covered just the right amount. I think the toppings individually aren't much to brag about. But when they come together in the pie, they work their magic on your taste buds.When I visit NY again, I will be back. N.B. I have never tried Lombardi's. So I can't compare the two.",4.0
"There was a very long line when we got here at 5pm on a Saturday (St. Patrick's Day), but we decided we might as well wait to see what the hype is all about. So we waited... and waited... for two minutes! We didn't change our mind, nope nope nope. We didn't sneak in. We got seated because the owner came out two minutes after we got in line, shouting he needed a party of five and we were the only group in line that had five people!We got seated immediately in the first floor and were excited to eat after walking across the Manhattan bridge and Brooklyn bridge park. I observed the place to be very small and cramped. There were waiters rushing about to and fro the front counter where the pizza was made and the customers were trying to dodge them to get to their table or the bathroom. The pizza counter was just busy and they were working non-stop. The table we were in was tiny but we managed. We were just very close to the adjacent tables and were in the walkway to and from the bathrooms and the back kitchen.An older gentleman, probably the father of the owner, asked if we ordered yet after a few minutes of waiting; and when we told him no, he summoned one of the waiters. We ordered three small pizzas at $12/each plus .50 cent for each topping: Pepperoni, margherita, and mushroom.We waited for approximately ten minutes for our food and could tell that the other customers had been waiting longer because they were there before we were seated and still hadn't gotten their food.After a few more minutes, we finally got our pepperoni pizza and it smelled really good. The pizza was pre-sliced and each of the slices (5) were huge. The small is comparable to a medium sized pizza here in southern California. The generous amount of mozzarella cheese was melted everywhere on the pizza and some of it even got on the crust. The small round pieces of pepperoni was sufficient, but I could've had more of it. Each of the pizzas also had a distinct taste of their herb seasoning and the basil leaves from it were still intact on the center of the pie. The pizza was not thick at all and didn't have the usual thick bread (the filler type) because the toppings dominated the whole thing. The mushroom and margherita pizza came just as we were finishing the pepperoni. The margherita was more subtle and contained enough cheese, sauce, and the herbs. The yummy tomato sauce with the sun dried tomatoes stood out more with this pizza. I was really hungry at the time and kind of wanted more of the pepperoni goodness. But we still ate all but two slices of the margherita pizza. The mushroom pizza was okay. My other family members are mushroom lovers and they liked it a lot. I had the smallest slice of it and it didn't really stand out to me. Overall, the pizzas were decent. They weren't oily or too bready and the ingredient that stood out was the generous amount of cheese. The sauce on each of them was rich tomato and not the Ragu tasting stuff some pizzas have. I really liked the pepperoni because the small slices were thick and it was just enough to make the pizza meaty and be the classic pizza topping it's supposed to be.Future patrons should be prepared for the loooooong line that could be an hour wait. The service was curt and the waiters do not do anything else but take your order, bring it, and re-fill your water. It's a busy place and the pizza could be well worth it, but if you're really hungry and need to eat within the hour, I'm pretty sure there are other pizza joints that could be better or similar quality pizzas without the wait. The pizza is pretty good and the pepperoni is probably the best one I've had. Next time, though, I'll ask for extra pepperoni.",4.0
I think Lombardi has a slight edge over Grimaldi but I'm not taking away anything from this place. It's still one of the best pizzas I've had... Just wished the place didnt have a take and go kind of feel to it,5.0
"It was okkkkkkk. Certainly didn't live up to the hype of life surrounding it (though I'm aware that it's an NYC institution). I've been twice (one time in the middle of the snowstorm of LIFE so I was tearing into it off the strength of being hungry LOL) and on both occasions, I still felt like there was more to be desired...For those contemplating standing in line (suckasss): DON'T! Just call ahead of time, place your order, stroll in and move on with the rest of your day! You also have the dine in option but the ambiance is nothing special.

"My suggestion? Hit this place up during the off hours. Unless you are willing to wait on a line that reaches down the block, I would say avoid going there on the weekends!

"A friend and I came here around 2pm on a Thursday afternoon. We waited in line for about 15 minutes before being seated, which was pretty good. The line moves pretty quickly, especially for parties of 2.We ordered a large pie with sun-dried tomatoes. Oh. My. God. It was some of the best pizza I've ever had. The crust was crispy on the outside, but chewy and soft on the inside, and perfectly charred by the coal-fire brick oven. The sauce was sweet and very flavorful. I love that they put basil on the plain pies. You don't even need toppings with the basil on there, but the sun-dried tomatoes were a good choice.The service was great, too. The waiters were attentive and helpful. I recommend going back to the bathroom and talking to the kitchen staff while you wait in line. They're really nice and taught me about the oven.Yes, it's touristy, but it's popular because it's amazing. I can't wait to come back.",5.0
"Never coming back here again! We went on a Friday afternoon and were seated immediately. The staff was extremely rude. They didn't refill our water until we asked the third time around. They brought the check before they refilled our water. The pizza is mediocre at best. The crust was chewy. My jaw was in pain after eating. I'm not even being dramatic. My friends felt the same way. Overall, terrible food experience.",1.0
"good pizza!  very fresh ingredients.  Friendly service.  If you drag the wait, call ahead, pick up the pizza, walk to the pier and eat it there!  I wish the crust was a bit crispier.  Other than that, every-time i decide to cross the Brooklyn bridge, i'd definitely eat here.They moved one building over!  It's roomier and is able to accommodate more people!",4.0
"Okay, I want to start off that this place deserves a 5-star review on the pizza alone.  However our server mistakenly rang up our order as a ""to-go,"" leaving us questioning where our pie was 30 minutes after having sat down. And after the looong wait, and me being starving, and them only giving us a sorry, I had to knock off one star. I will say that they did get the new pizza out within 10 minutes of having recognized their mistake. But with my husband being a restaurant manager, I've learned to expect a little more than just a ""sorry"" after a pretty big goof. But they've got people waiting in line for them, most of them tourists like us. So I imagine only a sorry is sufficient for them.Here's the deal:- The wait is long. I think it's worth it. If you don't like lines just to be seated, then don't come here. - It's a hole in the wall joint in Brooklyn steps from the bridge. If you expect upscale bathrooms, you'll be sorely underwhelmed.- This place is a machine. They take your order, pizza is (in our case, should have been) ready in about 10-15 minutes, you eat, you're out. (Keep in mind, there's some other person waiting for the pizza.  Don't just sit there and act like a schmuck for hours.)- This isn't Domino's or Pizza Hut. So don't come here looking for a 3 for $15 special. Is it a little pricier than what I'm used to? Absolutely.  But is it worth it? H-ll yes!!This is one of the best NY style pizzas I've ever had, with the exception of Village Pizza here in LA. The bread is good, the sauce is alright--not too powerful to overwhelm the pizza, but enough flavor to get the right taste. The pepperoni and mushrooms were fresh and perfect. The mozzarella wasn't loaded on the pizza, but covered just the right amount. I think the toppings individually aren't much to brag about. But when they come together in the pie, they work their magic on your taste buds.When I visit NY again, I will be back. N.B. I have never tried Lombardi's. So I can't compare the two.",4.0
"There was a very long line when we got here at 5pm on a Saturday (St. Patrick's Day), but we decided we might as well wait to see what the hype is all about. So we waited... and waited... for two minutes! We didn't change our mind, nope nope nope. We didn't sneak in. We got seated because the owner came out two minutes after we got in line, shouting he needed a party of five and we were the only group in line that had five people!We got seated immediately in the first floor and were excited to eat after walking across the Manhattan bridge and Brooklyn bridge park. I observed the place to be very small and cramped. There were waiters rushing about to and fro the front counter where the pizza was made and the customers were trying to dodge them to get to their table or the bathroom. The pizza counter was just busy and they were working non-stop. The table we were in was tiny but we managed. We were just very close to the adjacent tables and were in the walkway to and from the bathrooms and the back kitchen.An older gentleman, probably the father of the owner, asked if we ordered yet after a few minutes of waiting; and when we told him no, he summoned one of the waiters. We ordered three small pizzas at $12/each plus .50 cent for each topping: Pepperoni, margherita, and mushroom.We waited for approximately ten minutes for our food and could tell that the other customers had been waiting longer because they were there before we were seated and still hadn't gotten their food.After a few more minutes, we finally got our pepperoni pizza and it smelled really good. The pizza was pre-sliced and each of the slices (5) were huge. The small is comparable to a medium sized pizza here in southern California. The generous amount of mozzarella cheese was melted everywhere on the pizza and some of it even got on the crust. The small round pieces of pepperoni was sufficient, but I could've had more of it. Each of the pizzas also had a distinct taste of their herb seasoning and the basil leaves from it were still intact on the center of the pie. The pizza was not thick at all and didn't have the usual thick bread (the filler type) because the toppings dominated the whole thing. The mushroom and margherita pizza came just as we were finishing the pepperoni. The margherita was more subtle and contained enough cheese, sauce, and the herbs. The yummy tomato sauce with the sun dried tomatoes stood out more with this pizza. I was really hungry at the time and kind of wanted more of the pepperoni goodness. But we still ate all but two slices of the margherita pizza. The mushroom pizza was okay. My other family members are mushroom lovers and they liked it a lot. I had the smallest slice of it and it didn't really stand out to me. Overall, the pizzas were decent. They weren't oily or too bready and the ingredient that stood out was the generous amount of cheese. The sauce on each of them was rich tomato and not the Ragu tasting stuff some pizzas have. I really liked the pepperoni because the small slices were thick and it was just enough to make the pizza meaty and be the classic pizza topping it's supposed to be.Future patrons should be prepared for the loooooong line that could be an hour wait. The service was curt and the waiters do not do anything else but take your order, bring it, and re-fill your water. It's a busy place and the pizza could be well worth it, but if you're really hungry and need to eat within the hour, I'm pretty sure there are other pizza joints that could be better or similar quality pizzas without the wait.

"When you click 5 stars, this says ""woohoo! as good as it gets!"" and for pizza, Grimaldi's is as good as it gets. I'm not sure other people who reviewed Grimaldi's were prepared for the experience that they were about to have....first, we're going to talk about the pizza. it is AMAZING. I'm usually not a crust person (sometimes I don't even eat it) but their dough is ridiculous. It's like having your first french baguette in Paris after eating white wonder bread all your life. is this pizza dough!? how!? and the pepperoni! real Italian meat market pepperoni, which makes your pizza that much better. In full.... I got pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta. It did end up a little soggy ... i think it was too much for the pizza to take - the ricotta probably added some water. (will that sogginess deter me from coming back in the future? absolutely not!) in the future, i would get a pie with just pepperoni. and go with the LARGE. you're already there, you have no hope to resist, so you might as well indulge!as for the atmosphere, I LOVED IT. It's a two story building on the corner and the wait outside is part of your experience .... i showed up on a warm Friday night at 10 pm with a cup of coffee in hand. Once they got a big group in, the line moved pretty fast. I was seated upstairs and they have joint tables where you sit right next to your neighbor (as if you were being seated at a big picnic table with moving chairs). It's alive and bubbly feeling with the energy of NYC, the city that never sleeps.My only tip is this.....wear layers you can remove. Inside, I felt like I was sitting on top of the brick oven directly. They have a fan going, but that is a minor help. Luckily, I had a sweater I could take off. Be smart and do the same!",5.0

Each additional topping is $2.00.Our sausage, pepperoni, mushroom coal baked oven pizza turned out to be quite delicious! The crust had a good chew to it, the mozzarella on it was fresh, and the toppings definitely hit the spot. I was surprised our pizza came out in less than 10 minutes. I guess they had everything prepared and the coal oven was heated enough to bake the pizza at supersonic speeds! Go Grimaldi's. I'm taking off a star for a toilet that doesn't flush, somewhat rude servers, and a restaurant that smells mildly of toilet. Hehe. All in all, Grimaldi's serves up a pretty mean coal baked oven pizza (a kind of pizza that I've never had before).We walked out about 40 minutes later only to find a line that stretched half way down the block.

"Best pizza deal on earth. their biggest pizza is, what, $16? Light, chewy fresh slices of heaven I tell you. This is different from your typical corner pizza. Every time i talk about pizza, I put this one in a different category just because of its dough. I like my pizzas virgin. especially if you're in it for your first time. that intimate moment of your first bite with the basic regular pizza. oh my!I did try the white pizza. Its a little heavy in my opinion. With the regular, I think I can actually finish the whole pie. While, the white pizza, maybe 2 slices. Lines are a bitch. I once went there at the time it just opened. and I had to wait for an hour. Though there was a magical moment back in winter, when my school canceled all classes. it was a snow storm in the morning that calmed down in the afternoon. I went to this place and it was dead empty. No lines. Most tables beckoned attention and butt warmth. And we came hithering to it. So my friends, the lesson here is, go during a snow storm.

"Loved it! We had two pizzas, one with mushroom and pepperoni and the other just plain (or ""Boring Pie"" as the server called it). Both were wonderful. The mushrooms were so fresh and the pepperoni so juicy and flavorful. The plain pizza let the quality of the ingredients shine in all their simplistic glory. Everything, from the crust to the sauce, the cheese to the olive oil, was perfect.The line was actually good because I wasn't all that hungry when we showed up but I was by the time we got inside. At one point we were the second of three two-tops in line, and the guy came out and called for a group of 3 or 4. A truly brilliant woman behind us suggested we combine forces and take that four-top!

"The best New York pizza I've ever had! Being a California girl, I've still managed to make my way to Grimaldi's twice this year and even waited in the 45 minute long line to get into the door. The wait was definitely worth the fresh, doughy, thin crusted pizza with an array of toppings to delight your taste buds. I think the first time I went, we ordered mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and ricotta on our pizza. The second time we ordered basil, sun dried tomatoes, and sausage. Both times the pizza wasn't too oily or too cheesy, and the chewy sun dried tomatoes gave the texture an extra kick.

"When you click 5 stars, this says ""woohoo! as good as it gets!"" and for pizza, Grimaldi's is as good as it gets. I'm not sure other people who reviewed Grimaldi's were prepared for the experience that they were about to have....first, we're going to talk about the pizza. it is AMAZING. I'm usually not a crust person (sometimes I don't even eat it) but their dough is ridiculous. It's like having your first french baguette in Paris after eating white wonder bread all your life. is this pizza dough!? how!? and the pepperoni! real Italian meat market pepperoni, which makes your pizza that much better. In full.... I got pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta. It did end up a little soggy ... i think it was too much for the pizza to take - the ricotta probably added some water. (will that sogginess deter me from coming back in the future? absolutely not!) in the future, i would get a pie with just pepperoni. and go with the LARGE. you're already there, you have no hope to resist, so you might as well indulge!as for the atmosphere, I LOVED IT. It's a two story building on the corner and the wait outside is part of your experience .... i showed up on a warm Friday night at 10 pm with a cup of coffee in hand. Once they got a big group in, the line moved pretty fast. I was seated upstairs and they have joint tables where you sit right next to your neighbor (as if you were being seated at a big picnic table with moving chairs). It's alive and bubbly feeling with the energy of NYC, the city that never sleeps.My only tip is this.....wear layers you can remove. Inside, I felt like I was sitting on top of the brick oven directly. They have a fan going, but that is a minor help. Luckily, I had a sweater I could take off. Be smart and do the same!",5.0
"We trekked over the Brooklyn Bridge to finally eat at Grimaldi's. Sure we got lost and it took us an extra 15 minutes to find the place, but upon arriving 30 minutes after opening, we were surprised that there was no wait. WOO!! $14.00 for a small$16.00 for a largeTo me, they looked the same size, go for the small and save the $2 for more toppings. Each additional topping is $2.00.Our sausage, pepperoni, mushroom coal baked oven pizza turned out to be quite delicious! The crust had a good chew to it, the mozzarella on it was fresh, and the toppings definitely hit the spot. I was surprised our pizza came out in less than 10 minutes. I guess they had everything prepared and the coal oven was heated enough to bake the pizza at supersonic speeds! Go Grimaldi's. I'm taking off a star for a toilet that doesn't flush, somewhat rude servers, and a restaurant that smells mildly of toilet. Hehe. All in all, Grimaldi's serves up a pretty mean coal baked oven pizza (a kind of pizza that I've never had before).We walked out about 40 minutes later only to find a line that stretched half way down the block. HAHA SUCKERS. Helpful hints:1) Get there before noon to avoid the long lines2) Walk the Brooklyn Bridge to stirr up an appetite3) Bring cash b/c it's CASH ONLY.",4.0
"Best pizza deal on earth. their biggest pizza is, what, $16? Light, chewy fresh slices of heaven I tell you. This is different from your typical corner pizza. Every time i talk about pizza, I put this one in a different category just because of its dough. I like my pizzas virgin. especially if you're in it for your first time. that intimate moment of your first bite with the basic regular pizza. oh my!I did try the white pizza. Its a little heavy in my opinion. With the regular, I think I can actually finish the whole pie. While, the white pizza, maybe 2 slices. Lines are a bitch. I once went there at the time it just opened. and I had to wait for an hour. Though there was a magical moment back in winter, when my school canceled all classes. it was a snow storm in the morning that calmed down in the afternoon. I went to this place and it was dead empty. No lines. Most tables beckoned attention and butt warmth. And we came hithering to it. So my friends, the lesson here is, go during a snow storm. You'll do them good filling up those tablesfor dessert, skip brooklyn ice cream factory. for light dessert, go to almondine. for decadence, go to jacque torres. you're welcome.",5.0
"Loved it! We had two pizzas, one with mushroom and pepperoni and the other just plain (or ""Boring Pie"" as the server called it). Both were wonderful. The mushrooms were so fresh and the pepperoni so juicy and flavorful. The plain pizza let the quality of the ingredients shine in all their simplistic glory. Everything, from the crust to the sauce, the cheese to the olive oil, was perfect.The line was actually good because I wasn't all that hungry when we showed up but I was by the time we got inside. At one point we were the second of three two-tops in line, and the guy came out and called for a group of 3 or 4. A truly brilliant woman behind us suggested we combine forces and take that four-top! It probably only saved us about ten minutes of waiting, but those ten minutes would have felt like an hour.",4.0

It's not exactly what I would call ""New York"" style, but the crust IS on the thinner side and it is pretty good. The service is very slow though they are always at least a little busy. The tables are also kind of small and the layout makes it hard to navigate my fat a** around the tables.

"This was a must on my brother's ""tour of New York.""  It entailed him kicking me out of bed 10 to try to get there by 11:30.  Thank goodness I'm a lagger.  We got there at 11:50ish to line of 30 some-odd people in high 20 degree whether in front of a still closed store.  Yep, 12:00 on Saturdays people.But then again, maybe we should have arrived a few minutes early. When they finally opened the door, our group of three was the first to be barred by a velvet rope from going inside.  We did indeed have to wait for everyone who JUST went in to get seated, pick what they want, order, wait for their pizza and eat it.  It was fantastic.  Like 40 minutes in the cold fantastic.  It definitely didn't make us feel better that a tour bus pulled up and the door man (yes, a door man), lets them into the restaurant like a bunch of VIPs to a club - they weren't even hot!I was hungry, cold and bitter.  I got even more bitter when people were leaving, but in 2s.  So the doorman proceeded to parties of 2 in behind us in line.  When we finally got in, you can bet I took my sweet ass time inside.The pizza and black cherry soda was somewhat redeeming though.  We ordered a large pepperoni and a large ham and mushroom (yea 3 people to 2 large pizzas, ENJOY THE COLD OUT THERE!).  My relationships with pizza usually involves Pizza Hut, Papa Johns or CPK, so I'm not exceptionally picky about my pizza, so maybe I don't know what to look for in good pizza, but I wasn't blown away or anything.  It was good, and the pepperoni was definitely better than ham and mushrooms...but I don't know.  It was a long way to travel and a long wait for pizza that was good, but I wasn't completely convinced that it was worth it.But I appreciate that it's family own, been there forever and everything is made right in front of you.  The tables were fairly close together so with a lot of people seated in the restaurant, happy to be out of cold, it was a very happy atmosphere.  They also package your extra slices tight and it travels well (all the way back from NY to DC).I will probably never go back during winter to experience this again, but will consider going again any other time.PS, the takeout and eat-in line is the same line, so don't try to think you're outsmarting anyone.  It seems you can call ahead to order a pizza to go to get around that though.",3.0
"I'm not one to bash places or be completely negative but after hearing all the wonderful things about this place, I was dumbfounded. I kept hearing about this ""place under the brooklyn bridge"" that supposedly had the BEST pizza in NYC. My friend and I ventured all the way to NYC for a day trip and resolved to get us some Grimaldi's. I'm a loyal Lombardi's lover and I only eat Pizza when I'm in NYC and I only eat Lombardi's... until this particular day.We waited in a line like elementary school kids as some cranky older italian guy picked people at random by pairs or in strange numbers, splitting parties up, adding strangers together etc... My friend and I were about 3/4 to the door from the back of the line up, he pointed at us and some girl who was by herself and rushed us in, had us sit down together as we were telling him we were not a trio. He finally listened, snapped his fingers at my friend and literally said ""C'mahn, whattya doin'?"" as he angrily trudged us up the stairs, sat us, tossed menus at us and walked away. Right away we were put off. So, the waiter comes over after about 15 minutes, we order a regular margarita pizza. The pizza comes and I kid you not, I've had better at papa johns on a decent night. The cheese was tough and tasteless, like they melted those nasty craft mozzarella cheese sticks on the pizza, the sauce was overly sweet and the crust and dough was chewy. We each ate 2 slices and decided to give the rest to the first homeless person we saw (which we later decided against as that would have been cruel). The waiter never checked on us not even once after giving us the pizza. So after 25 or so minutes of looking at our terrible pizza, we flagged another waiter down, got the check and booked.

"What can I say?  Best pizza in Brooklyn.  It's Grimaldi's vs. Di Fara's.  Tie for first place.  Native New Yorkers and tourists will agree this may be the pizza ever made on the planet.  Period. End of story. Nothing else to say.  Oh yeah, be ready to wait on a long line.  The line is out the door and around the corner ALWAYS.  Because yes it is that good.",5.0
"I'm very sad that this place has gone downhill over the years. I've been coming here for at least 7 years and it's been on a steady decline, yet I still keep coming back, hoping that they will redeem themselves and serve me that piping hot, perfectly crisp pie that I remember.The crust has gotten thicker over the years and can either come out soggy and chewy or black and burnt. The generous topping of fresh basil has been replaced with a 2-3 browning leaves. Major disappointment and no longer worth the wait. Not to mention, the service is non existent.",3.0
"I know my review is going to be swallowed up by the thousands that came before me... still...This is pretty close to a true Neapolitan pie. In Italy they use mozzarella di bufala, which is mozz from the water buffalo. It's a little richer, and the one they use for the pizza has less moisture than the one they use here, but it's still really close. It's not exactly what I would call ""New York"" style, but the crust IS on the thinner side and it is pretty good. The service is very slow though they are always at least a little busy. The tables are also kind of small and the layout makes it hard to navigate my fat a** around the tables. Bathroom on the third floor is one toilet without  stall and a urinal, no door lock to be found so don't be surprised if you enter to find an embarrassed pooper.",4.0
Very tasty pizza plus the house wine and the evening has just begun. We had lots of parties here.,5.0
"Very overrated. I went one time and it was in the old location. I remember the pizza was expensive and really nothing special. I have had better pizza at patsy's in east harlem, lombardis, original rays(which is now closed) and a bunch of other places. Its decent pizza but its definitely not worth going out of your way for. I don't understand why people would wait online for this stuff. Probably tourists.",3.0
"This was a must on my brother's ""tour of New York.""  It entailed him kicking me out of bed 10 to try to get there by 11:30.  Thank goodness I'm a lagger.  We got there at 11:50ish to line of 30 some-odd people in high 20 degree whether in front of a still closed store.  Yep, 12:00 on Saturdays people.But then again, maybe we should have arrived a few minutes early. When they finally opened the door, our group of three was the first to be barred by a velvet rope from going inside.  We did indeed have to wait for everyone who JUST went in to get seated, pick what they want, order, wait for their pizza and eat it.  It was fantastic.  Like 40 minutes in the cold fantastic.  It definitely didn't make us feel better that a tour bus pulled up and the door man (yes, a door man), lets them into the restaurant like a bunch of VIPs to a club - they weren't even hot!I was hungry, cold and bitter.  I got even more bitter when people were leaving, but in 2s.  So the doorman proceeded to parties of 2 in behind us in line.  When we finally got in, you can bet I took my sweet ass time inside.The pizza and black cherry soda was somewhat redeeming though.  We ordered a large pepperoni and a large ham and mushroom (yea 3 people to 2 large pizzas, ENJOY THE COLD OUT THERE!).  My relationships with pizza usually involves Pizza Hut, Papa Johns or CPK, so I'm not exceptionally picky about my pizza, so maybe I don't know what to look for in good pizza, but I wasn't blown away or anything.  It was good, and the pepperoni was definitely better than ham and mushrooms...but I don't know.  It was a long way to travel and a long wait for pizza that was good, but I wasn't completely convinced that it was worth it.But I appreciate that it's family own, been there forever and everything is made right in front of you.  The tables were fairly close together so with a lot of people seated in the restaurant, happy to be out of cold, it was a very happy atmosphere.  They also package your extra slices tight and it travels well (all the way back from NY to DC).I will probably never go back during winter to experience this again, but will consider going again any other time.PS, the takeout and eat-in line is the same line, so don't try to think you're outsmarting anyone.  It seems you can call ahead to order a pizza to go to get around that though.",3.0
"I'm not one to bash places or be completely negative but after hearing all the wonderful things about this place, I was dumbfounded. I kept hearing about this ""place under the brooklyn bridge"" that supposedly had the BEST pizza in NYC. My friend and I ventured all the way to NYC for a day trip and resolved to get us some Grimaldi's. I'm a loyal Lombardi's lover and I only eat Pizza when I'm in NYC and I only eat Lombardi's... until this particular day.We waited in a line like elementary school kids as some cranky older italian guy picked people at random by pairs or in strange numbers, splitting parties up, adding strangers together etc... My friend and I were about 3/4 to the door from the back of the line up, he pointed at us and some girl who was by herself and rushed us in, had us sit down together as we were telling him we were not a trio. He finally listened, snapped his fingers at my friend and literally said ""C'mahn, whattya doin'?"" as he angrily trudged us up the stairs, sat us, tossed menus at us and walked away. Right away we were put off. So, the waiter comes over after about 15 minutes, we order a regular margarita pizza. The pizza comes and I kid you not, I've had better at papa johns on a decent night. The cheese was tough and tasteless, like they melted those nasty craft mozzarella cheese sticks on the pizza, the sauce was overly sweet and the crust and dough was chewy. We each ate 2 slices and decided to give the rest to the first homeless person we saw (which we later decided against as that would have been cruel). The waiter never checked on us not even once after giving us the pizza. So after 25 or so minutes of looking at our terrible pizza, we flagged another waiter down, got the check and booked.  Terrible service, terrible food. Don't do it.",1.0
"Exactly my review is ""I've experienced better"" this pizza was just ok --- a bit sloppy and wet, but good in flavor. Definitely to eat while there and not take it go. Our waiter was very nice. If you are reading this DO NOT WAIT in line to get in, we went there on a regular weekday and got right in. There are much much better pizza places in NY.

"I've been waiting to come eat at this place for almost five years now, and today I finally came. FINALLY. The line looks daunting outside, even at around 1:45pm on a Tuesday when you'd think there would be less of a lunch rush, but yes, it will still be there. No worries, though, because they get people in and out pretty efficiently. I think we got seated after waiting only about 15-20 minutes. We got two large pies for four of us -- both pies were the regular cheese pizzas. They use fresh mozzarella on the plain pizzas, with a sweet, slightly tangy tomato sauce and some basil. Simple. Understated. Yummy. That's what this pizza is. I must say, though, that I think this place is slightly overhyped. My friend and I agreed today that we think that the Patsy's at University Place near Union Square has pizza that is comparable to the pizza we had here at Grimaldi's. Some of you will be pissed that I even suggest this, but my friend agrees, so I know it's not just me! Might I even dare say that the crust is slightly crispier and doesn't get soggy as quickly at Patsy's as it does here? I like the open kitchen here and how you can watch those pizza guys flip and turn out pizza dough, artfully throw on toppings, and push the pizzas into a large brick oven in less than 2 minutes each. They are efficient here, no doubt. Don't take pictures of them doing the pizzas, though, otherwise they will get mad (I got away with taking one before they asked me to take away my camera, so check out my photos!). I'll be back here for pizza when I want to be near the Brooklyn Bridge (great place to walk off the pizza) or have visitors who want to marvel at NYC pizza.",4.0
"Anyone Brooklynite who thinks this place is better than DiFara's is simply insane. L&B's Spumoni Gardens is also better than this place. Heck, brick oven pizza from L'asso in the LES is better than this place. I have no idea what the hype is about - but Grimaldi's owes a lot to Food Network and the like for bringing them all this business.First things first - if your staff is rude and your establishment dirty, you definitely should have the food to back it up. Grimaldi's most definitely does not. You have to wait behind rope when you get there and they have all these rude, stupid signs taped to the windows about things you can't do. You go in and its just a tourist trap. This place is so clearly tourist central. There didn't seem to be any locals in there on a random Monday night. Only tourists, tourists, tourists. The only reason we were there, BTW, was because DiFara's was closed and our friends from Texas wanted pizza. L&B's would be too far for them as they were staying in Queens. So, we decided to meet halfway try Grimaldi's.We got one small and one large - both with pepperoni, one with mushrooms added. The ingredients were okay, but I agree with other reviewers that the pizza is soggy and bland. Their pizza isn't special at all. Anyway, the only reason the rude, inattentive staff and dirty environment was tolerable was because we were in fine company. I would never, ever recommend this place to friends or take them here. It was embarrassing, quite frankly.",1.0

"So, I finally made my way to Grimaldi's. Right up front, let me answer one question: yes, it's worth the wait.I waited with 3 friends for about 25 minutes in the chilled air and rain. Once we got called in, we all sat at this small table by the window. The place has an old charm about it. That might have been helped along by the fact that The Power by Snap was playing when we were first seated. I usually like to get a plain pie at places like this; I feel like if the pizza can stand on its own without toppings, then it's a quality pie. However, I didn't get to make that test today. We got a pie with pepperoni and sun-dried tomatoes. It did not disappoint: the sauce was fresh, the cheese was gooey, the pepperoni was fresh and curled from being baked. Lastly (but most importantly), the crust was just the right kind of chewy. I LOVE when a pizza has a good balance between crunch, snap, and chewy. It's probably going to be more moist/soggy than you're used to at your neighborhood pizzeria, but I like it.I had a cream soda along with my slices. Overall, it's nice to come to a place where the hype can be supported by actual quality. If you don't want a crazy wait, do like we did and go on a rainy day!",4.0
"Prepare to wait! Buttt the wait is definitely worth it. My friends and I waited FOREVER! I was starving. I was hoping it would only take at most an hour. Little did we know, it took us over 2 hours! I was scared that the kitchen would close on us and that they would not able to serve us. We got seated around 10:40ish. They close at 11PM. Luckily we made it in time. We ordered right away hoping the food would come asap. They make the pizzas after you order them. The pizzas are super fresh.We ordered 2 large pizzas both the same for a party of 4. We had sausage, extra basil, mushroom, and sun dried tomatoes. The pizza was steaming when we got it. The pizza was very clean and delicious. The crust is nice and thin. It was not overly cheesy, and the condiments are simple. I normally never eat pizza. However, I did eat more than usual here. That must mean something! We literally scarfed down our first slice. The pizza was amazing. Maybe the pizza was super good because we were so hungry? I don't know... Whatever the reason was, the pizza was probably one of the best I've had. I definitely will come back!",5.0
"Worth the trip to Brooklyn. Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Thin crust, amazing sauce and covered with mozzarella. Definitely lives up to the hype.Advice: If you can, get there early. We were there at 11:30 when the doors opened and didn't wait at all.",5.0
"Meh....not impressed.We trekked all the way to Brooklyn to wait in line for an hour to be crammed like sardines inbetween 2 couples, clearly on dates, to eat pizza...and it wasn't even spectacular pizza.I expected more from you, yelp. Usually, you will demystify those places that have been features on Travel Channel/Food Network shows and develop some kind of notoriety. But not this time, yelp, not this time.The crust was good, the cheese was ok, but the sauce was BLEH. Just a watery mixture of crushed tomatoes and a little basil and that was it. I actually had to add garlic powder, salt, and red pepper flakes to give my pizza some flavor! Not the sign of a ""fantastic"" pizza joint. My brother really liked it but I was more than disappointed. Even though the same people are associated with Patsy's...I prefer Patsy's.$14 for  a large, and $2 for every topping you add on to it. Cash only, folks.Great view of the water, bridge, and skyline from here though. 2 thumbs up.",3.0
"Yes, the pizza is good, and is definitely old-school.  However, it's absolutely not worth the hours of waiting on line outside. Here's the menu: pizza, calzone, antipasto (not the salad kind, the meat kind), dessert, and beverages. So after waiting online for hours and either sweating your butt off or being pummeled by wind or rain, you can't get a side salad, garlic bread, pasta - anything! The last time I was there, the pizza took about 20 mins to get to us and we were STARVING, sweaty and exhausted from the wait (my friend was in from out of town and was insistent on trying the famous Grimaldis - I was outvoted). The tables are small and crammed together - so prepare to eat with your purse on your lap and get intimately involved in the lives of your neighbors. The waiters, although efficient, are too busy. There's no sitting and chatting, although you wouldn't want to as the seats are not all that comfortable and it's loud, very loud. I'd much prefer going to one of its competitors any day.Cash only and no parking.",2.0
"Finally got to try Grimaldi's! We got there about 7:40 and were promptly seated. Within 5 minutes, people started to pour in and before you knew it there was a line waiting at the door. The smell of pizza hits you as soon as you enter. We opted for a pepperoni and mushroom pie. It couldn't come out fast enough the more pizzas we saw pass us by the hungrier we got. At last our pizza arrived (it really wasn't very long)! What a great looking pizza, toppings were put in all the right places and it looked like just the right amount. This pizza is pretty awesome! The crust is like nothing I have seen here, only in Italy (made by my fiance's aunt). The crust was thin and airy at the same time. You can tell that the ingredients are high quality and fresh. Everything almost melted in mu mouth. It was quite delicious. As for the space itself I would give it a 4, only because it is super loud and a bit crowded. I'm guessing it looks exactly the same as it did when it first opened its doors. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it adds to the charm, but don't go expecting a nice quiet dinner.Definitely worth a trip to Brooklyn and a big plus is you get to walk over to the water (right across the street) and enjoy a view of the city and the Brooklyn bridge.",5.0
"Ok, let's be clear.  The pizza here is good.  Maybe even very good.  But for all the hype that I've heard over the years and the waiting in the hot-ass sun that I had to do before getting a table in this restaurant that seems to be without decent air-conditioning I have to say that I was pretty disappointed.  The pizza doesn't really stand out to me in any significant way.  Brick oven pizza is always nice and they do make a decent crust here but I've had better pizza at Geppetto's in Providence, RI and I'm pretty sure you can get a brick oven pie that's just as good at other places in the city.  Even the service is ""meh"".  I just don't see what all the fuss is about.",2.0
"I've been waiting to come eat at this place for almost five years now, and today I finally came. FINALLY. The line looks daunting outside, even at around 1:45pm on a Tuesday when you'd think there would be less of a lunch rush, but yes, it will still be there. No worries, though, because they get people in and out pretty efficiently. I think we got seated after waiting only about 15-20 minutes. We got two large pies for four of us -- both pies were the regular cheese pizzas. They use fresh mozzarella on the plain pizzas, with a sweet, slightly tangy tomato sauce and some basil. Simple. Understated. Yummy. That's what this pizza is. I must say, though, that I think this place is slightly overhyped. My friend and I agreed today that we think that the Patsy's at University Place near Union Square has pizza that is comparable to the pizza we had here at Grimaldi's. Some of you will be pissed that I even suggest this, but my friend agrees, so I know it's not just me! Might I even dare say that the crust is slightly crispier and doesn't get soggy as quickly at Patsy's as it does here? I like the open kitchen here and how you can watch those pizza guys flip and turn out pizza dough, artfully throw on toppings, and push the pizzas into a large brick oven in less than 2 minutes each. They are efficient here, no doubt. Don't take pictures of them doing the pizzas, though, otherwise they will get mad (I got away with taking one before they asked me to take away my camera, so check out my photos!). I'll be back here for pizza when I want to be near the Brooklyn Bridge (great place to walk off the pizza) or have visitors who want to marvel at NYC pizza.",4.0
"Anyone Brooklynite who thinks this place is better than DiFara's is simply insane. L&B's Spumoni Gardens is also better than this place. Heck, brick oven pizza from L'asso in the LES is better than this place. I have no idea what the hype is about - but Grimaldi's owes a lot to Food Network and the like for bringing them all this business.First things first - if your staff is rude and your establishment dirty, you definitely should have the food to back it up. Grimaldi's most definitely does not. You have to wait behind rope when you get there and they have all these rude, stupid signs taped to the windows about things you can't do. You go in and its just a tourist trap. This place is so clearly tourist central. There didn't seem to be any locals in there on a random Monday night. Only tourists, tourists, tourists. The only reason we were there, BTW, was because DiFara's was closed and our friends from Texas wanted pizza. L&B's would be too far for them as they were staying in Queens. So, we decided to meet halfway try Grimaldi's.We got one small and one large - both with pepperoni, one with mushrooms added. The ingredients were okay, but I agree with other reviewers that the pizza is soggy and bland. Their pizza isn't special at all. Anyway, the only reason the rude, inattentive staff and dirty environment was tolerable was because we were in fine company. I would never, ever recommend this place to friends or take them here. It was embarrassing, quite frankly.",1.0
"The pizza here we great as advertised.  The servers were a little rude and service wasn't that great.  However, I would come again just for the pizza.",4.0
"So, I finally made my way to Grimaldi's. Right up front, let me answer one question: yes, it's worth the wait.I waited with 3 friends for about 25 minutes in the chilled air and rain. Once we got called in, we all sat at this small table by the window. The place has an old charm about it. That might have been helped along by the fact that The Power by Snap was playing when we were first seated. I usually like to get a plain pie at places like this; I feel like if the pizza can stand on its own without toppings, then it's a quality pie. However, I didn't get to make that test today. We got a pie with pepperoni and sun-dried tomatoes. It did not disappoint: the sauce was fresh, the cheese was gooey, the pepperoni was fresh and curled from being baked. Lastly (but most importantly), the crust was just the right kind of chewy. I LOVE when a pizza has a good balance between crunch, snap, and chewy. It's probably going to be more moist/soggy than you're used to at your neighborhood pizzeria, but I like it.I had a cream soda along with my slices. Overall, it's nice to come to a place where the hype can be supported by actual quality. If you don't want a crazy wait, do like we did and go on a rainy day!",4.0

There was a roped off section for the line in front of the restaurant like we were waiting to go inside a nightclub! We waited about 20-25 minutes to get seated inside. The wait may have been caused by a large tour bus of people dining earlier. We ordered (1) large 18"" pizza ($14) with 1/2 pepperoni ($2). Unfortunately, they charge you $2 regardless if you order 1/2 toppings or whole pizza toppings! The pizza is awesome because of the fresh ingredients. The crust is thin, crispy and airy. The sauce is just right.  I like the plain pizza with the fresh mozzarella and basil. I also had a glass of the house white wine ($4). I wish Grimaldi's would get with the times and start taking credit cards (I'll add a star once they do)!",3.0
"After eating at Grimaldi's old location (now Juliana) at least 4 times, I was very disappointed with my last visit at the new location.  I've read that when they relocated the famous brick oven could not be moved.  I was willing to ignore that fact and decided to wait 45 minutes on the line.  Boy was I wrong.  You would think after waiting on line for 45 minutes everything would taste delicious.  The pizza was very average something I could have experienced at a local Neapolitan joint.  The pizza was nothing like what I've had in the past.  The couple next to me drove down to Brooklyn from Philly just to get a slice and they felt robbed.  They didn't even bother taking what was left to go.  Folks are creating long lines because of what they use to serve not what they offer to customers now.",3.0
"Delicious pizza and worth a stop when you're in Brooklyn! I've heard such great things about this place that it was at the top of my list of places to eat. They use really good ingredients: fresh mozz cheese, really salty and brimey black olives, basil, good pepperoni - it all adds up to a great pie. Beware, cash only! And I would advise not using the ATM in the restaurant since it charges you a $4.50 service charge, WTF!! No line or wait on a Tuesday afternoon was a bonus too. Just go, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
Classic..Delicious..Cramped Seating..worth it to come again and again-- out doors is beautiful so take a walk and burn off some of those calories!!and the bathroom is almost always a long line (one bathroom for the place)3 people w 2 pies at 3 toppings a pie= $41entrance is too skinny for a wheelchair,4.0
"We arrived here 10 minutes before the restaurant opened and there was already a sizeable line. There was a bicycle race going on that day so hundreds of cyclists were zooming past us as we queued, yelling out things like, 'Wow, will you look at that line!' and 'It IS worth the wait, people!' and 'Trust me, people; it is NOT worth the wait!' About 30 minutes later we found out that it was worth the wait: the pizza was delicious and definitely the best we had in NYC. Good value too. We ordered a 'small' to share and it was freaking enormous.",4.0
"I only give Grimaldi's 4 stars because of the line outside situation. They need to figure out a better system, other than trying to kick out people that just finished eating :).Anyway, the pizza is as good as advertised. The flavor is amazing, and the crust is just perfectly crusty. As far as comparing to other pizzas in town I would say that it is way up there along with Patsy's, one of my other favorite pizza places.",4.0
"As for great pizza is concerned, this place has one of the best. Highly recommended by a buddy, we hit this joint up before we took a leisurely stroll across Brooklyn Bridge. The line was no joke just like any good place in NY, but it was worth it. If you are a fan of thin crust pizza, you have to check it out. Cash Only.",5.0
"This is the most important part of the review:  The sauce was so freaking good.  Sauce is so important.This place is so freaking good.  The line was about 20 minutes long (then again, we got there at around 3pm).  I wanted to eat here every single day and I was only in NY for 2.5 days.  It's something to do with the sauce.  It's such a delicious explosion in your mouth!  It's not just tourists that come here...it seems like locals and everyone who's heard of this place wanted some.  The service was quick and easy.  The place is pretty much a classy hole in the wall.  YUM YUM YUM.  I still think about it!!",5.0
"I FINALLY had Grimaldi's.  Yum!  Def some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I personally prefer Di Fara's, but the pizzas are so different I really think it's like comparing apples to oranges.  Whichever you prefer is just personal taste.  Grim's was delicious though, an amazing thin slice, good ingredients, crispy crust.  We called in our order and walked right in to pick it up, didn't have to wait at all, so that aspect is a huge win.  I think I would have been a little disappointed if I'd had to wait in that ridiculous line.",4.0

"Grimaldi's is definitely in the running for top NYC pizza. Went here over the weekend for lunch. Stood outside in line (it's a cute block!) for an hour, was surprised to then be seated and have to wait another 30 minutes before they took our order. And once we gave an order, it was yet another hour before we were served our plain cheese pizza! So be prepared for a long wait, I recommend eating before you go so you're not overly hungry by the time the food arrives. Or order for take-out. It's good - the crust is chewy and delicious, and the pizza is flavorful and easy going down. My significant other and I ordered a large pizza for the two of us, and we ate nearly all of it. I would put it right in line with Lombardi's - they taste very similar - but a step down from Luzzo's which I still think is the best in NYC. Try them all and let me know what you think!",3.0
this is the pizza that everyone waits in line 2+ hours for ???,3.0
"Good Pizza, not spectacular",3.0
"Tasty thin-crust pizza, solid ingredients, love the coal-oven char, but I have to say there wasn't anything that knocked me out of my seat.  I definitely enjoyed it and thought it was a good pizza, but shudder to think that it potentially could have been at the expense of hour(s) long waits.My friends and I arrived on a Wed about 15 minutes before it opened, was quickly ushered in with only a few parties ahead of us, and were served promptly and quickly.  That's the kind of wait I would put up with for this pizza, but if I saw the line up snaking further down the street?  Probably not.Also tried Lombardi's a few days prior to this trip - I like Grimaldi's better, found that the pizza was overall more flavorful, and texture of crust crispier and more pleasant contrast to the toothsome toppings.  However, I was a big fan of the pancetta at Lombardi's, of which there was no comparable topping at Grimaldi's.My point of reference, the pizza I hold all pizzas up to? Al Forno in Providence, Rhode Island.  Their grilled pizza is absolutely exquisite and an experience worth making the trip out for.",3.0
"I think that the reason why this place is so popular on Yelp (2000 reviews and 4 stars) is that it's one of the few restaurants around the Brooklyn Bridge vicinity and that you definitely bump into it if you crossed the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.  Also, the greeter at the front warmly greets and welcomes people here.  The pizza was just meh here, nothing extraordinary however.  Looked very family style and the tables were all squished together to fit maximum capacity.   Had to shift the table and such when someone wanted to go to the bathroom.  Also, the way this place works it that they serve the basic pizza but they don't have any special pizza.  Rather, you pay for each of the toppings you want on it and they're $2 each or $4 for speciality items.  But a large pizza is $10 and it's sharable amongst three people at least so price wise, it wasn't that bad. The worst part of the meal was when we were trying to pay the check with a credit card and the waiter serving us rudely clapped his hands and yelled, ""cash only!""  Geez buddy, sorry didn't know.  That guy did not get a tip.  Don't think I would return here and would instead make an effort to find another restaurant even if it is a longer walk.",2.0
"Over rated pizza! I'm born and raised in Brooklyn and this is NOT the best! Customer service is rude, and tablecloth is dirty! If you want good pizza that you don't feel obligated to leave a tip for, try anything else!",1.0
As Soon As I Walked In 1 Min Before It Opened There Were People Already Seated! The Manager Is Very polite although maybe i'm not accustomed to real pizza but this pizza made me run for the greasy old-fashion oven pizza up the street !,3.0
"There is much better if you search in the nooks and crannies of NYC. Grimaldis is good, but highly overrated.",2.0
"regret waiting on the  line for more than a hour. The pizza doesn't justify the long wait. You can find way better pizza in nyc! Service is terrible, they also add gratuity to the check without letting people know and expect us to add tips on top of it, great. This is a cash only place and far from being cheap ! DO NOT GO!!",1.0
"Waited in line with my boyfriend for a while with very high expectations for this famous pizzeria. There is much hype about this place! We were seated and first were a little disappointing that the menu was not as extensive as the Grimaldi's in Douglaston, NY and Garden City, NY. We ended up ordering a cheese pizza and were once again disappointed by the lack of flavor and seasoning. We live closer to the other locations, so we have frequented them more and find that the flavor of the pizza is much better at the Douglaston and Garden City locations. Their menus offer more options such as salads and more toppings, like meatball, which is one of our favorites. The location in Brooklyn is nice despite the lack of parking. One can walk the Brooklyn Bridge or visit Pier 11 and indulge in some ice cream from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.Needless to say, we were very excited to travel into Brooklyn to have some of the famous Grimaldi's pizza from the ""original"" location, but Queens and Nassau residents are definitely better off saving themselves the trip into Brooklyn and going to their local Grimaldi's.",2.0
