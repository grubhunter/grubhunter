"Hands down an amazing brunch place me and my dad came for our annual brunch date he comes from Guatemala once a year and we look for a nice place to walk around and eat, Dumbo provides the perfect scene for that. The place is busy so make sure you make a reservation in advance or be prepared to wait a long time. We were seated and promptly greeted by the busboy our server that day was not very friendly or attentive in fact he only approached us to take the order. We ordered the eggs florentine and the chicken and waffles. I had coffee and a cocktail and my father had coffee and fresh orange juice. The food was amazing the waffles were delicious and perfectly fluffy and the chicken was juicy! My dad really enjoyed his choice as well. Overall I'll definitely come back and give the service another chance!",4.0
"This placed is named ""Atrium,"" but it should have been called ""Terrarium."" So many lively green plants in this place! And the food is good. I left feeling like a stuffed caterpillar.First up: my friend and I shared the House Baked Bread with cultured butter, which was absolutely delicious in all of its warm glory. Moving on, my friend crazily got the Beetroot Tartare appetizer as her main course which consisted of like two slices cut into cubes. I did not ask to try as I did not want to rob her of her meager morsels, but she said it was good. Me, I got the Black Angus Burger. It was juicy, thick, and hefty. Just like I like them! The bathroom is clean but tiny. The clientele reminded me of those who populated restaurants in San Francisco--probably because a tech/startup ecosystem has similarly taken root in DUMBO. All in all, cute place, great service, good food.",4.0
"Our overall experience was awkward... then awful.Upon being sat for our reservation - I inquired about the oyster happy hour advertised on their website and was informed that you could only have the happy hour at the bar... which is absurd. The waiter suggested that there were two open spaces in the bar are if we wanted to move down there and enjoy the happy hour - we reluctantly went only to have the manage approach us and suggest we eat dinner at our reserved seats to ensure that we would be done with dinner in time to make it to a play next door on time... so we awkwardly RE-RE-located once again - and no one bothered to just offer us the damn happy hour special at our table. Fine. Well enough - we ordered the seafood platter, a meat platter and a side of the brussel sprouts.... the food was great... until.. while eating the brussel sprouts, I discovered a BROKEN PIECE OF GLASS.... a giant piece had broken off of a dish and was in our food... I informed our waiter and he took away the glass-ridden sprouts - to be brought a NEW order of sprouts (we were pretty turned off of brussle sprouts at that moment in time). We ate the rest of our dinner, enjoyed drinks and dessert and when we received our bill - NOTHING was deducted... they charged us for our glass-ridden brussle sprouts and didn't even bother to comp us for anything.... for having to be relocated TWICE - and finding glass in our food -- all we got was a shoulder shrug and a ""sorry"".... No Atrium, WE are the ones who are sorry.",2.0
"One of the best places for ambiance - a living wall, high ceilings and candles and lights everywhere! Love the atmosphere of cool, sophisticated, romantic all without feeling too pretentious. We stopped by for late night drinks and apps. The tea and kalamansi is what I downed all night - light and refreshing, with just the right amount of sweetness. They keep it classy and tasteful with their meats and cheeses platter. Definitely a nice place to catch up with good company or to enjoy that romantic ambiance on a first date. I'll be venturing back here soon!",4.0
"Atrium DUMBO was on my list from the moment I discovered the neighborhood.The only way to describe our Saturday is this:""Well, um, actually a pretty nice little Saturday, we're going to Home Depot. Yeah, buy some wallpaper, maybe get some flooring, stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath, and Beyond, I don't know, I don't know if we'll have enough time""Old married people problems that had us end up at West Elm, a new bed set and onward we went to Atrium DUMBO.Upon walking in, we noticed there was a small wait for large groups but we were seated immediately at the chef's table, which was weird at first but totally cool toward the end.The restaurant itself it super attractive inside including the living wall which just pops of color the moment you walk in. We were seated and given the run of the mill water and received the our menus, it was brunch (since brunch lasts forever in this town on the weekends).My husband and I both ordered the Croque Monsieur with an egg and my husband a coffee.It was very interesting to watch the staff cook and like I said ended up being informative and entertaining. Smart, it was smart too. It made you watch them cook different dishes and by the end vow to come back to try at least 5-6 of them.The dish itself was DELICIOUS! The bread was super crispy, with a creamy bechamel sauce, salty ham, and a massive amount of cheese. To be personally, I think the bechamel needed more salt but I don't hold this to the restaurant since I'm a salt-o-phile and they most likely assume that the ham and cheese salt will be enough. It came with a well dressed and seasoned field green side salad. My husbands coffee was served with the meal and for the bargain price of $3.50, I thought was amazingly expensive but when in NY, right?Overall, the experience was great and it is definitely a potential repeat!In the end, GO!",4.0
"muscles and Bronzino were amazingUpon arrival this is a small, double decker restaurant.  Very very hip and cute!!  I had read the reviews and wasn't too excited at first about trying this place.  However, I'm glad I did!!We ordered a few drinks, my Moscow mule was good but definitely not amazing.  My friends ordered the muscles and they smelled amazing...they said they tasted amazing too!I ordered the Bronzino served with zucchini and  squash...the first bite of fish tasted over salted. But then I cut up the veggies and mixed a piece of fish onto my fork and it was PERFECT!  The dish is definitely intended to be eaten mixed together.  If you eat just the fish alone it would be salty, and if the veggies alone they would be bland,..but mixed together My palette was pleasantly delighted! The desert donuts were ok...I hated the caramel dipping sauce.  Would recommend getting something else if you want desert.  Our server had a bright personality which immediately made me feel happy!!All in all I loved this place.",4.0
"Great place for dinner in DUMBO! After making a reservations we were seating right away once arriving. We ordered mussels as an appetizers that were great, they came in a creamy white sauce that was good enough to lick out of the bowl! We also ordered the lobster pasta that was filling and tasty. It was a great place for a date night and would return! Next time may plan to come for $1 oysters at the bar!",4.0
"HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE WORST MEALS I'VE EVER HAD. We came here in a group of 8 to celebrate one of our best friends birthday and with all the good reviews on yelp we were super excited, I give them the fact that the interior decor was just as described other than that the food was horrible.It tastes like a fusion of Italian and Asian gone very wrong. I got the chitarra pasta while the pasta was cooked al dente the sauce and pork sausage with cooked scallions did not sit well. I ended up throwing out all the pork sausage and making my way to eat some of the noodles. I also tried the Rigatoni which had the lobster and it was just soft and mushy. Really did not enjoy the meal whatsoever. The menu is one page very small with not many options. That did not bother me as much as the fact that it didn't taste good. I will never come back.Wine was reasonable at the standard range of 10-14 dollars a glass but it wasn't a good full bodied red that I wanted,,,. The service was horrible... Waiter was awkwardly antisocial, he also managed to hit my head with a plate when he bent over my head while holding dishes in his left hand to grab another dish, oddly I don't think he knew he hit me in the head. The desert selection was very small, and nothing that appealed to the eye after a horrible dinner. They rushed us out and handed is the check before we even finished eating. How rude? Before he even asked if we wanted desert. Hands down with the prices they charge(outrageous) they should bring the standard of food to the next level.HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE NEVER AGAIN.",1.0
"I came here to celebrate a friends birthday and everything was just a NO. There's always that place where you will always have the greatest time just talking and having conversations with your friends and this was just not one of them. The waiter continued to fill our cups of water over our head to the point where it was just annoying. He even hit one of my friends on the head with a plate while thinking he was this big awesome guy trying to carry more than one plate. He also brought out CHECKS BEFORE WE WERE DONE WITH OUR FOOD!! On top of that he offered to take a picture of the group and deliberately took them blurry. Very rude man. The rigatoni with lobster, tomato, and basil was OKAY. Definitely not worth the price. (Nothing there was worth the price.) This is just an overpriced place because of where it is located. The wine wasn't even as special as they presented it when I asked what was good. I would personally never go back there or recommend it to anyone. Unless you're okay with overpriced bland food and rude wait staff. Not memorable at all.",2.0
"Hands down one of my favorite brunch spots. I went on a Saturday morning around 11AM. The hostess asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), but there were still plenty of tables open. The decor inside is super cute and Instagram worthy! I got the croque monsieur and added a sunny side egg on top, and my friend got the eggs florentine and added the lobster. The lobster was perfectly cooked. We also got the smoked salmon crostini. If you're a lox lover, you'll definitely love this. I think the prices are reasonable for the content and quality of food. The waiters were accommodating and welcoming. Definitely will come back soon!",5.0

The drinks were very creative and expressive as well; I'd recommend the vanilla infused old fashioned.

I also don't like that the menu and the waiter didn't tell us where the oysters are from. Fortunately, they're briny and not the creamy type. Beef Tartare was quite good, not the usual where they mix it table side, but it was yummy. Icelandic Cod was wonderful! Although I thought the mushrooms and the Consomme were a tad too salty. The scallion looks pretty as a whole stalk but makes it kind of annoying to eat. Just saying. Market Squash & Pomegranate is okay...not much pomegranate. Most of the squash pieces were a bit too al dente for my preference. The tables around me all ordered the scallops and it smells divine! I must return and try those!",4.0

We paid $3 for a side portion of potato chips. There was about 12 chips. Really??? I eat more than that in one handful. The food was tasty but not worth the price.

"My husband and I came in for an impromptu, early date night this past Friday (around 6pm) and was quickly seated upstairs for dinner. The restaurant had not too long ago open and was quickly filling up. We were seated upstairs and had a nice view of the open kitchen and the downstairs dining area. The ambience and decor is very lovely, romantic and perfect for a date night or special occasion it seems. Food: Overall the food was delicious! Nice mix of American and French flare. We ordered the bread and muscles for starters and both were great. The muscles served well for two and the creamy sauce was to die for. We actually asked for more toast to enjoy some more of the sauce after the muscles were finished and this was no issue to do. For main course, we shared the chicken pot pie (though we usually shy away from chicken dinners when out) and it was delicious. The dish is served in two parts - the two breast halved and the remainder of the chicken parts cooked with veggies in the actual pot pie. The chicken was cooked perfectly tender (even with a crispy skin!) and very well seasoned. I could have done with the side wedges as they were a bit too crispy and didn't compliment the meal that well for me. Service: Our waiter and other staff were very warm, friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were always filled and if we needed something a staff member was not too far away. Overall great experience and would definitely return.",5.0

"Went on a cold night, place was quiet. Aesthetics is lovely, any minimalist would appreciate it. Open kitchen, thank you I have a view of the cute chef. Service- amazing, my waiter was super friendly. Food. NY Strip (aged)- Cooked perfectly, probably not the best quality (I've been spoiled dating someone who owned a steakhouse) but I ate all of it, including the fat... I'm so excited there's a place to grab a steak now in Dumbo. The pomme lyonnaise and bone marrow and swiss chard were perfect compliments.Escargot- Serve in bowl with sliced mushrooms and butte garlic sauce; I like my in shells; didnt need the other stuff. (Didn't serve it with croutons or bread so we asked and they happily obliged)Beef tartare - not the melt in your mouth I prefer, meat was firm and wanted to taste more shallot and feel the texture of yolk - it's a clean tartare i guess, I want a dirty one- gooey, lots of flavor, etcBrussel sprouts with bacon- tasted heavily of butter (but I'm a fan of butter), bacon is cubed itty bitty, so it more like bacon bits but soft... when i eat bacon, i like it in larger portions so it can play in my mouth.Management- runs a tight ship, dressed to the nine.I will definitely be coming here more often though.",4.0
Lovely mid-size restaurant in DUMBO Brooklyn. Industrial chic decor. I recommend the salmon crustini and eggs Florentine.Service was excellent. You won't be disappointed here,4.0
A bit conflicted on this place because I like it a lot but think its a little off. I started with the scallops appetizer which was perfect. I went with the duck entree which was served with the skin on and kind of tasted like it was deep fried. The side was like a deep fried egg roll of some sort. I don't want deep fried anything when I am ordering a top level dish. That being said the dessert was excellent and the staff the same. I am really at 3.5 stars but that isn't an option. I think I need to give this place another shot and see what happens.,3.0
"My girlfriend introduced me to this place.  The atmosphere of the place is very nice. We went there for brunch.  Think ""wood-sy."" and bungalow. Deviled Eggs: There were about 5 of them.  They were good. About par.Smoked Salmon Crostini: I liked this dish. Most places, the smoked flavor overtakes the taste buds, this had a hint of it. I enjoyed this one a lot.Buttermilk Biscuits: I enjoyed this with the butter and jam and my coffee. The coffee there was strong and I enjoyed it with these biscuits. Another point for the biscuits.soup of the day: tomato gazpacho? I can't remember the exact name. It was a chilled soup.  It was different at first, but then you keep on eating it and it grows on you.  It had a punch to it, like the dressing on a cold cut sandwich?!?! I liked it.Overall Impression:The atmosphere was nice. It was a beautiful place. The food was probably some of the best I've had in NYC so far.  Every dish was good, which is difficult. It was a chilly morning and the AC was blasting. We happened to sit under the draft (they said they lowered the AC, but it kept on running).  Other than this minor hiccup, the place is nice.

I popped in here for some white wine and oysters one rainy evening.They served me the house oyster -- Montauk Pearl -- a type I've never had before. It was in a teardrop shaped cup and was full of briny goodness. It was also very clean and served at the perfect temperature. Their wine choice complemented the oyster well.The service was a bit odd since I sat in the bar area. Two of the staff told me my oysters were from different areas of the Northeast. *Shrug*,4.0
"Very cute restaurant, I really enjoyed my visit. I went with my sister and we split two crustinis, the salmon one and the avocado egg one. Both were delicious, the egg one a little spicy but good too.I would definitely go here again!:) quick and good.",4.0
"My husband and I came in for an impromptu, early date night this past Friday (around 6pm) and was quickly seated upstairs for dinner. The restaurant had not too long ago open and was quickly filling up. We were seated upstairs and had a nice view of the open kitchen and the downstairs dining area. The ambience and decor is very lovely, romantic and perfect for a date night or special occasion it seems. Food: Overall the food was delicious! Nice mix of American and French flare. We ordered the bread and muscles for starters and both were great. The muscles served well for two and the creamy sauce was to die for. We actually asked for more toast to enjoy some more of the sauce after the muscles were finished and this was no issue to do. For main course, we shared the chicken pot pie (though we usually shy away from chicken dinners when out) and it was delicious. The dish is served in two parts - the two breast halved and the remainder of the chicken parts cooked with veggies in the actual pot pie. The chicken was cooked perfectly tender (even with a crispy skin!) and very well seasoned. I could have done with the side wedges as they were a bit too crispy and didn't compliment the meal that well for me. Service: Our waiter and other staff were very warm, friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were always filled and if we needed something a staff member was not too far away. Overall great experience and would definitely return.",5.0

"This place is definitely amazing . My bf and I drove here from my place 'cause we decided to explore this neighborhood more. I love the entire setting and atmosphere. We are seated at the second floor which has a view of first floor , clear glasses kitchen and vintage bookshelf and dinner table settings. The service is quite attentive and pleasant. I happen to have his DSLR with us . The photo came out really good . Love the oyster and the soup(cold potato cheddar) . For sure will come back .",5.0
This is a super cute restaurant with an open kitchen concept. I came here with two girlfriends so the three of us shared:Dozen oysters: a good starterRigatoni: the lobster pieces are very generous and the pasta is cooked wellBranzinoIcelandic CodSmoked LI Duck: my favorite dishPB&JMake sure to enjoy your meal with some wine or cocktails. The food is good and service is fantastic. After dinner make sure you take advantage of the view of the bridges.,4.0
"Went on a cold night, place was quiet. Aesthetics is lovely, any minimalist would appreciate it. Open kitchen, thank you I have a view of the cute chef. Service- amazing, my waiter was super friendly. Food. NY Strip (aged)- Cooked perfectly, probably not the best quality (I've been spoiled dating someone who owned a steakhouse) but I ate all of it, including the fat... I'm so excited there's a place to grab a steak now in Dumbo. The pomme lyonnaise and bone marrow and swiss chard were perfect compliments.Escargot- Serve in bowl with sliced mushrooms and butte garlic sauce; I like my in shells; didnt need the other stuff. (Didn't serve it with croutons or bread so we asked and they happily obliged)Beef tartare - not the melt in your mouth I prefer, meat was firm and wanted to taste more shallot and feel the texture of yolk - it's a clean tartare i guess, I want a dirty one- gooey, lots of flavor, etcBrussel sprouts with bacon- tasted heavily of butter (but I'm a fan of butter), bacon is cubed itty bitty, so it more like bacon bits but soft... when i eat bacon, i like it in larger portions so it can play in my mouth.Management- runs a tight ship, dressed to the nine.I will definitely be coming here more often though.",4.0
Lovely mid-size restaurant in DUMBO Brooklyn. Industrial chic decor. I recommend the salmon crustini and eggs Florentine.Service was excellent. You won't be disappointed here,4.0
A bit conflicted on this place because I like it a lot but think its a little off. I started with the scallops appetizer which was perfect. I went with the duck entree which was served with the skin on and kind of tasted like it was deep fried. The side was like a deep fried egg roll of some sort. I don't want deep fried anything when I am ordering a top level dish. That being said the dessert was excellent and the staff the same. I am really at 3.5 stars but that isn't an option. I think I need to give this place another shot and see what happens.,3.0
"My girlfriend introduced me to this place.  The atmosphere of the place is very nice. We went there for brunch.  Think ""wood-sy."" and bungalow. Deviled Eggs: There were about 5 of them.  They were good. About par.Smoked Salmon Crostini: I liked this dish. Most places, the smoked flavor overtakes the taste buds, this had a hint of it. I enjoyed this one a lot.Buttermilk Biscuits: I enjoyed this with the butter and jam and my coffee. The coffee there was strong and I enjoyed it with these biscuits. Another point for the biscuits.soup of the day: tomato gazpacho? I can't remember the exact name. It was a chilled soup.  It was different at first, but then you keep on eating it and it grows on you.  It had a punch to it, like the dressing on a cold cut sandwich?!?! I liked it.Overall Impression:The atmosphere was nice. It was a beautiful place. The food was probably some of the best I've had in NYC so far.  Every dish was good, which is difficult. It was a chilly morning and the AC was blasting. We happened to sit under the draft (they said they lowered the AC, but it kept on running).  Other than this minor hiccup, the place is nice. I'd probably go back, sometime in the evening next time to check out the lighting.",4.0

"Had a lovely outdoor brunch here over Labor Day weekend. Maybe it was quieter than usual due to the holiday, but DUMBO was calm and serene that morning and Atrium was a beautiful and welcoming place to sit outside and enjoy the amazing weather we were having.I arrived early and had my pick of stools by the bar inside. As others have mentioned the interior is lush and gorgeous, very clean and modern. However the weather that day was too nice to sit indoors. The bartender offered me a glass of water while I waited, which was a nice touch. You might think this is a given, but I have waited at many other bars inside restaurants where the staff didn't so much as take a second look at me.My friend and I kept it simple by both ordering egg dishes (she the scrambled eggs with charred kale, tomato, and sausage, and I the omelette with ham, mushroom, and gruyere) and were not disappointed. My omelette was fluffy, cooked perfectly, and came with a side of simple greens and toasted baguette. The salad was very generic, but light and tasty. Although my friend's eggs did not come with any toast, our waitress gladly brought some out for her as well. I'm not sure what would make me award Atrium the 5th star, but I would gladly come back for another meal and a longer stay to find out.",4.0

"I died a little inside when I went to this restaurant with its lovely atrium concept and had the most disappointing brunch of my life.Starter- The oysters were not properly cleaned and I could feel relatively large bits of the shell in the meat. Main- While the sear of the steak was on point, there was no flavor in the meat and it tasted like a cut of beef that perhaps needed to be cleaned better. Due to the lack of seasoning, that taste of excrement was pretty noticeable and definitely not palatable.

"Our trip to Atrium DUMBO started with a misguided bike ride- let me start by saying that biking over the BK bridge is in no way romantic.  It's a touristy, crowded mess made more stressful by aggressive bikers.  On to the restaurant....The atmosphere is beautiful.  The open kitchen, artistic lighting, spacious bar area, and living walls (plants everywhere) makes for an amazing feel.  The hostess was welcoming, as was the bar service - I've read the bartender is a PDT-ex.  The Herbs & Peppers is the best of the drinks - it has a rich bell pepper flavor and a bit of spice.  Skip the mezcal negroni - smoky, not in a good way.Appetizers are nice - oysters and beef tartare.  The mains were just so-so.  We ordered a lobster rigatoni, which sounds wildly indulgent, but was honestly a little dry. Plain pasta, breadcrumbs, and sparse lobster pieces - kind of felt like they just threw the 3 ingredients together, and called it a day.  We also had the duck, which was interesting - it had the same smoky flavor as the negroni.  Felt like it was flavored with Mezcal, which some people might enjoy, but wasn't what I was looking for.There's an extensive wine list, and service is great, as I mentioned.  Good date spot to enjoy the atmosphere and have a few light, shared bites, rather than a heavy meal.",3.0
Words can't explain how disappointed I'm in this place. I came for lunch however they refused to sit us down because I had an infant child and apparently they don't wanna be bothered with that. We did not come for dinner at night we came for lunch and requested to sit outside. My 2 months old child wouldn't bother anyone. So if you are planning to come with your child look for another place. Horrible experience!!!,1.0
"Came here on a Thur evening because 1)close to my friend's office 2)only a short cab ride from Manhattan 3) I heard they had good happy hour ;)  I was not disappointed.The vibe is very chill (background music is mostly indie and ambiance, right on); high ceiling and floor to ceiling windows invite in nature lights. While the clienteles are young and hip, a mix of creative and business type, it is no hispter-vile like Williamsburg or pretentious model-land like SoHo. Bingo!Wait, there is more. Cocktails and house wine are all $8 during HH!  I had the Tea & Kalamansi (Fourroses bourbon, Cocchi americano, house made black tea syrup)served in an fronzen margarita glass. It's tangy sweet & sour with a mild bitterness, reminding me of the hot summer in  South India. Friend went with the pimms cup and ventured with the tagleliatelle with rockshrimp lemon jalapeno decorated with pea leaves. Both are excellent.

"I've been here about three times (there's hardly any good places to eat in dumbo) and every time it's subpar. the host however, tall man with glasses, was outstandingly helpful and nice. the food is sooo average. you could easily make every single item menu yourself, for cheaper and definitely better. the service sucks also. don't waste $4.50 getting a flavored ice tea or any of the non alcoholic drinks for that matter, unless you want colored water. it's sad because the place is so cute. the food is just not worth the price whatsoever unless you're easily impressed. portions are also small and underwhelming.",2.0

"Beautiful restaurant!!Came here thanks to NY Mag's article of the best Sasso chickens in NYC. Apparently it's the new ""it"" poultry and Atrium does it exceptionally well. It's a chicken for two although their portion could easily feed three. They roast the breast and it has some amazing wild mushrooms and a gigantic truffled pot pie that's made from the dark meat. Their drinks are also really great here, the owner is a master sommelier and it shows with an exceptional wine list and a really creative cocktail list. Service was very detail oriented as well. Food came out quickly (but not too quick!) and my server was really helpful explaining their chicken and other random questions I had about their food.

"I died a little inside when I went to this restaurant with its lovely atrium concept and had the most disappointing brunch of my life.Starter- The oysters were not properly cleaned and I could feel relatively large bits of the shell in the meat.

"Solid food, especially the appetizers, and great ambiance.We stopped by as a party of 6 with a reservation on a weekend, and we split a variety of dishes between us. For starters, we ordered the bread, beef tartare, mussels, and the oxtail and crab linguine pastas. The bread was very good, as was the butter that accompanied it, while the pastas were both particularly good as well, although the pasta could have been prepared a bit more al dente; they both had nice flavors, however. For entrees, I split an order of the duck and the pork with a friend, and they were both fairly good. The duck was solid but not as flavorful as other ones I've had, while the pork was quite juicy and tender, not at all overcooked or dry. We split the brioche doughnuts and the quark cheesecake as desserts, and both were unique and very well prepared; the brioche in particular was very fluffy and light, accompanied by a nice butterscotch sauce.The food itself is somewhere between a three and four star, but the ambiance pushes it up a notch for me.

(What can I say, 5 hungry girls!)1. The chicken for two was amazing!!! Chicken was juicy but the star was really the chicken pot pie! It was savory, creamy, and comforting. The crust is not your usual hard crust, it's soft and flaky!!! Please try! (The potato wedges....were just potato wedges)f2. The house bread. PLEASE ORDER IT! It is the best potato bread ever! Fresh out of the oven, super soft, and it smells like bacon! hahaha. And that butter that comes with it...YUM3. The meat and cheese platter. Well this is really a meat platter with some cheese on it! It wasn't something too special per say...so unless you're really in the mood, I'd spend that $20 on some of the other food...like BREAD!*We went on a Thursday and was able to be seated right away but if you're going on the weekend, I would recommend making reservationNOTE TO GUYS(and women): it seems the workers here wear plaid shirts, so when you go wear something else unless you want to look like you work there!",5.0

"Five Things You Should Know About Atrium Dumbo:1. The space itself is almost dazzlingly attractive; with high ceilings, the living wall, and a splendid open kitchen, you will be happy to be here. It is both elegant and accessible. 2. The food is equally easy on the eyes. The lamb merguez, the fluke crudo, the pastas...all are colorful, polished plates worthy of any restaurant in this city. Thankfully, everything tastes as good as it looks. Except for the braised beef stew, which tastes much, much better than it looks.3. The service is flawless. They care, and it shows. 4. The bar program is very impressive. Specifically, the Tea & Kalamansai cocktail is fantastic. After a taste my date, not normally a bourbon drinker, called it the best cocktail she's had in recent memory (actually using the words ""bewitching"" and ""elixir"" to describe it), and continually tried to steal more from me. We were engaged to be married, but I was forced to break it off as a result.*5. Every time I even think about DUMBO, I want to eat here.

"My friends were hungry and looking for a place for dinner in the area, and we found Atrium Dumbo....best decision of the night!We got two chicken for two (roasted chicken, TRUFFLE chicken pot pie, potato wedges), two house bread, meat and cheese platter for $20, and a bottle of wine. (What can I say, 5 hungry girls!)1. The chicken for two was amazing!!! Chicken was juicy but the star was really the chicken pot pie! It was savory, creamy, and comforting. The crust is not your usual hard crust, it's soft and flaky!!! Please try! (The potato wedges....were just potato wedges)f2. The house bread. PLEASE ORDER IT! It is the best potato bread ever! Fresh out of the oven, super soft, and it smells like bacon! hahaha. And that butter that comes with it...YUM3. The meat and cheese platter. Well this is really a meat platter with some cheese on it! It wasn't something too special per say...so unless you're really in the mood, I'd spend that $20 on some of the other food...like BREAD!*We went on a Thursday and was able to be seated right away but if you're going on the weekend, I would recommend making reservationNOTE TO GUYS(and women): it seems the workers here wear plaid shirts, so when you go wear something else unless you want to look like you work there!",5.0

"Five Things You Should Know About Atrium Dumbo:1. The space itself is almost dazzlingly attractive; with high ceilings, the living wall, and a splendid open kitchen, you will be happy to be here. It is both elegant and accessible. 2. The food is equally easy on the eyes. The lamb merguez, the fluke crudo, the pastas...all are colorful, polished plates worthy of any restaurant in this city. Thankfully, everything tastes as good as it looks. Except for the braised beef stew, which tastes much, much better than it looks.3. The service is flawless. They care, and it shows. 4. The bar program is very impressive. Specifically, the Tea & Kalamansai cocktail is fantastic. After a taste my date, not normally a bourbon drinker, called it the best cocktail she's had in recent memory (actually using the words ""bewitching"" and ""elixir"" to describe it), and continually tried to steal more from me. We were engaged to be married, but I was forced to break it off as a result.*5. Every time I even think about DUMBO, I want to eat here. Try it, and you will too._____________*Not really (calm yourselves ladies), but it would have been reasonable to do so if I wasn't able to simply order another Tea & Kalamansai.",5.0

"Located right by the water and the Brooklyn Bridge, you'll find neighborhood gem, Atrium DUMBO in Brooklyn. The restaurant is set in a loft-like atmosphere with an upstairs overlooking the lower level and open kitchen. It's a mix of nature, a bit industrial and a romantic garden party with their ceiling-strung lights. I guess you could say you really do feel like you're dining in an atrium.I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (salsify, kale, hazelnut brown butter). It was delicious. The kale was cooked, slightly wilted and seasoned. It was my first time trying salsify, which is a root vegetable, tasting similar to a cross between a parsnip, carrot and yucca, and I really enjoyed it. The salmon was tender, savory, well seasoned and nicely portioned.",4.0
"Went there for their ""French week"" menu, promoted on their website - great menu which actually didn't exist. Good food but nothing exceptional. Picked a good Italian wine, reasonnably priced. As I expected they actually ""just ran out of it"" - I really hate restaurants which pretend they have an extensive wine list but do not - easy to spot as the good deals are always unavailable. Anyway we had a good time, their vegetal wall looks great, but this place is overpriced.",3.0

"I found myself at first giving Atrium Dumbo only four stars. Simply because I feel as though a ""perfect"" score is nearly impossible. However, looking back I simply cannot think of anything negative through out the entirety of my evening; at what may soon be one of my new favorite restaurants.Atrium DUMBO is firing on all cylinders when it comes to the congruence of food,wine, decor, service, etc.A thoughtful cocktail list will leave you pleasantly perplexed and asking for more. It's wine driven owner/ sommelier Alex LePratt is sure to wow you with his extensive knowledge and jaunty charisma. Serving fantastic wines that may otherwise go unnoticed. The chicken for two will leave you fully satisfied with its many components including a luscious truffle chicken pot pie and perfectly roasted chicken breast. The beautifully succulent cold corn soup of the day was perfectly seasoned with just enough complexity to impress, though simple enough to please the masses. I have yet to delve in to what I'm sure is an extensive and thoughtful wine list, but if the cocktails are any indication, I can assume it is nothing less than impressive. Atrium DUMBO is not to be missed!",5.0
"This is a good place. The main things it has going for it was the location and the decor. The space is really nice. The food itself was good. I liked the deviled eggs that I had the best, nothing special but a well made staple. The chicken and waffles was ok. Everything else seemed good, but not mind blowing. Overall a good place to chill for a bit with friends.",3.0
"I have been to Atrium both for a drink at their bar and a holiday dinner. The space is warm, and I especially love the open kitchen. They have an extensive wine and spirits list, with some interesting cocktails, including one with kalamansi, a citrus fruit used widely in the Philippines. We had a prix fixe for our holiday menu, and it was good. I started off with paté, served with a few slices of baguette and a couple of cornichons. My main course was a steak and fingerling potatoes. I asked for it medium rare and that's how it came to me. Delicious! For dessert, I had doughnuts with a salted caramel sauce. That was my favorite part of the meal. Service was okay, they got a few of our orders wrong, which was odd, considering the person whose orders they were, were the person who coordinated the whole thing. I'd come again for happy hour.",3.0
Food was amazing!! Went on a Monday evening at about 8 pm. Decided to dine outside. Amazing view of the Brooklyn Bridge over my dates shoulder. I had the lamb and he had the NY strip. I knew it was good because he always complains about his meal when we dine out. I didn't hear one peep. He said he really enjoyed it. I would definitely go back. Walking distance to Brooklyn Bridge park. A+,5.0
"I visited Atrium this past weekend and was very pleased with my experience.  We went for an early dinner so we walked into an empty restaurant, not for long though.  We were prompt greeted and sat.  The interior is very fresh and intimate.  Love the fern wall!The drink list is extensive and I decided on the Brooklynite (I'm a fan of the gin cocktails).  We shared the Dorade Crudo.  So delicious! The fish melted in your mouth and all the flavors were paired perfectly.  I had the pork chop.  It was slightly over done for my tastes but only because I had to push a little harder with my steak knife then I have to with a rare steak.  The roasted corn underneath was super sweet and complimented the dish perfectly.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Atrium and look forward to a return visit.",5.0
"Went here for Sunday brunch with my son and a friend. The manager quickly seated us and made sure we had a comfortable location. He moved us further away from a large party, without me having to ask, so we could have a little more space. The service was great. The waiter was very friendly and accommodating to my 1 yo. The food however was not as good as I hoped for. Not bad, by far, but just eh.. I ordered the waffle and fried chicken, the fried chicken was cooked perfectly as was the waffle it was just bland. Wish I had a salt shaker on the table. My friend ordered the fettuccine and cauliflower dish. Interesting combination but also bland. She asked for Parmesan cheese and it amped the flavor up a bit. Overall I will be returning. To try a few of the other dishes.",4.0

It was my first time trying salsify, which is a root vegetable, tasting similar to a cross between a parsnip, carrot and yucca, and I really enjoyed it. The salmon was tender, savory, well seasoned and nicely portioned.",4.0
"Went there for their ""French week"" menu, promoted on their website - great menu which actually didn't exist. Good food but nothing exceptional. Picked a good Italian wine, reasonnably priced. As I expected they actually ""just ran out of it"" - I really hate restaurants which pretend they have an extensive wine list but do not - easy to spot as the good deals are always unavailable. Anyway we had a good time, their vegetal wall looks great, but this place is overpriced.",3.0
Some of the best food I have ever had. I tried the macaroni and cheese side dish and the squash soup. Both were excellent. Everyone in our party ordered something different and each of us agreed it was all fantastic. Will definitely go again.,5.0
"I found myself at first giving Atrium Dumbo only four stars. Simply because I feel as though a ""perfect"" score is nearly impossible. However, looking back I simply cannot think of anything negative through out the entirety of my evening; at what may soon be one of my new favorite restaurants.Atrium DUMBO is firing on all cylinders when it comes to the congruence of food,wine, decor, service, etc.A thoughtful cocktail list will leave you pleasantly perplexed and asking for more. It's wine driven owner/ sommelier Alex LePratt is sure to wow you with his extensive knowledge and jaunty charisma. Serving fantastic wines that may otherwise go unnoticed. The chicken for two will leave you fully satisfied with its many components including a luscious truffle chicken pot pie and perfectly roasted chicken breast. The beautifully succulent cold corn soup of the day was perfectly seasoned with just enough complexity to impress, though simple enough to please the masses. I have yet to delve in to what I'm sure is an extensive and thoughtful wine list, but if the cocktails are any indication, I can assume it is nothing less than impressive. Atrium DUMBO is not to be missed!",5.0
"This is a good place. The main things it has going for it was the location and the decor. The space is really nice. The food itself was good. I liked the deviled eggs that I had the best, nothing special but a well made staple. The chicken and waffles was ok. Everything else seemed good, but not mind blowing. Overall a good place to chill for a bit with friends.",3.0
"I have been to Atrium both for a drink at their bar and a holiday dinner. The space is warm, and I especially love the open kitchen. They have an extensive wine and spirits list, with some interesting cocktails, including one with kalamansi, a citrus fruit used widely in the Philippines. We had a prix fixe for our holiday menu, and it was good. I started off with paté, served with a few slices of baguette and a couple of cornichons. My main course was a steak and fingerling potatoes. I asked for it medium rare and that's how it came to me. Delicious! For dessert, I had doughnuts with a salted caramel sauce. That was my favorite part of the meal. Service was okay, they got a few of our orders wrong, which was odd, considering the person whose orders they were, were the person who coordinated the whole thing. I'd come again for happy hour.",3.0
Food was amazing!! Went on a Monday evening at about 8 pm. Decided to dine outside. Amazing view of the Brooklyn Bridge over my dates shoulder. I had the lamb and he had the NY strip. I knew it was good because he always complains about his meal when we dine out. I didn't hear one peep. He said he really enjoyed it. I would definitely go back. Walking distance to Brooklyn Bridge park. A+,5.0
"I visited Atrium this past weekend and was very pleased with my experience.  We went for an early dinner so we walked into an empty restaurant, not for long though.  We were prompt greeted and sat.  The interior is very fresh and intimate.  Love the fern wall!The drink list is extensive and I decided on the Brooklynite (I'm a fan of the gin cocktails).  We shared the Dorade Crudo.  So delicious! The fish melted in your mouth and all the flavors were paired perfectly.  I had the pork chop.  It was slightly over done for my tastes but only because I had to push a little harder with my steak knife then I have to with a rare steak.  The roasted corn underneath was super sweet and complimented the dish perfectly.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Atrium and look forward to a return visit.",5.0
"Went here for Sunday brunch with my son and a friend. The manager quickly seated us and made sure we had a comfortable location. He moved us further away from a large party, without me having to ask, so we could have a little more space. The service was great. The waiter was very friendly and accommodating to my 1 yo. The food however was not as good as I hoped for. Not bad, by far, but just eh.. I ordered the waffle and fried chicken, the fried chicken was cooked perfectly as was the waffle it was just bland. Wish I had a salt shaker on the table. My friend ordered the fettuccine and cauliflower dish. Interesting combination but also bland. She asked for Parmesan cheese and it amped the flavor up a bit. Overall I will be returning. To try a few of the other dishes.",4.0

"Phenomenal food. The best wines. Great atmosphere.  A new must in DUMBO. The staff is all very knowledgable and friendly.  I had the smoked duck when I went in. The smokey flavor is matched perfectly with a good red wine. Our server paired the Cotes du Rhone with it and it was sensational. My friend had the agnolotti. While it wasn't a huge portion size the flavor was outstanding. We had it paired with the Bourgogne Blanc. I don't think I've ever had such a great white wine before. We got a side of the brussel sprouts which are made with apples and bacon. I could eat those everyday. With a great neighborhood and the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges surrounding this restaurant, I have found my new favorite place to eat and get a drink. They have great happy hour specials too!",5.0
"So you know how you scroll through yelp or open table and pick a restaurant. Well that's how I got to this place. My friends and I had dinner here one Sunday night. Unlike my fellow diners my steak was overcooked and dry. However the Mac & Cheese was tasty, as well as the spring salad. Drinks are pretty good. I'll try it again.",3.0
"The lamb sandwich is the way to go. Don't order it if you're out on a date, it's messy, but oh so worth it. The prices are pretty expensive (I think), my co-worker ordered the grilled shrimp and I got the lamb sandwich and it came up to about $33 (sans tip).All that aside. I love that they accept Amex (credit card at all, is awesome) and the service and ambiance are top notch. Now if they would just open up for happy hour around 5, I'd have another place to bring clients for drinks!",3.0
"I held my June wedding reception here and it was beyond everything I ever wanted! We wanted to have a wedding that was local, low key, and fun. Just a gathering for family and friends that was not held in a banquet hall (I think banquet weddings are great, but it wasn't for us). We were going to have our ceremony at Jane's Carousel and thought Atrium DUMBO was the perfect place to have the reception party. After all, we got engaged after we had dinner here so it made perfect sense. The restaurant is beautiful and needed minimal decor, has great food, and most importantly killer cocktails that you can't stop drinking. We did a full buyout of the place on a Saturday evening and everything turned out perfectly as planned. Andrew the manager and the entire team at Atrium were focused on making our night worry free and flawless. Andrew was also amazing during the planning process. He's very responsive, flexible, and really there to help you plan your dream wedding reception. All the guests raved about the food and cocktails and really enjoyed their time. Even special dietary options (vegan, gluten-free) were on point! My husband and I really could not have asked for a better party for our wedding. What we also love is that we can go back here anytime and enjoy all the wonderful memories we created at the restaurant.",5.0
"This place is an absolute gem. It is one of the few places that I am more than happy to leave Manhattan for, and I could spend a great deal of the day here just sipping on cocktails, drinking great wine, stuffing my face with yummy food, and bonding with friends (which I have done in the past!).The owners are phenomenal individuals and you can tell they really care about their clientele and the service they provide. The staff, from the hosts to the bar staff to the serving staff, are professional but engaging and personable. The atmosphere is elegant but warm and welcoming. The new outdoor seating only adds to the positives of this place. And the nearby view over the water of the Manhattan skyline is always breathtaking.The cocktails I've had have always been very well-balanced. One of the owners, Alex, who is also a Master Sommelier (which is ridiculous), always has a top-notch recommendation when it comes to wine (obviously). When the food is presented, it comes out looking like a piece of art (albeit an extremely DELICIOUS piece!). I've never been disappointed with the food since I've come here; as a result, I'm not going to recommend any one particular dish as I tend to pick new dishes each time since I know I won't be disappointed with the meal. I've eaten here for Sunday brunch, lunch, and dinner, and always have left extremely satisfied.Dumbo itself is a super cool spot to visit - if you do happen to find yourself in the area and are looking for a beautiful restaurant with extremely reasonable prices, delicious food and libations, down-to-earth people, and top-notch service, you won't be disappointed. Cheers.",5.0
"I went here twice recently and both times they crushed it.Starting in chronological order, the wife and I stopped by here for some early evening drinks. They have a 'happy hour' special that is kind of ridiculous. We ordered a dozen oysters and two, rather complex egg-white based drinks. The bartender seriously knows his sh*t and the oysters were as close to perfect as I've had. Tab total? $30. That's like stealing. Remember to tip your server on the non-discounted amount.Second time was dinner that we were treating friends of ours to. The meal was really amazing and we had a really nice bottle of CDP for ~$100. This is not our typical bottle range (would usually target something cheaper) but to have a bottle that good at that price was beyond reasonable. Also the service was great and, generally speaking, the food was amazing across the board. My wife and a friend had the bouillabaise (sp?), our other friend the pork chop (amazing) and myself the steak. I was not a huge fan of the potatoes au gratin that I thought were going to be french fries but we're splitting hairs at this point.For dessert we had the doughnuts and the PB & J (you'll know it when you see it) and two glasses of port. The port, especially for the price, was just fantastic. With this type of restaurant, for one, they deserve more stars but I'm really impressed with the care and attention they put into their menus (including liquor, happy hour, etc.). Hoping they stick around for a long time.",5.0
"I will boycotting this restaurant. I am highly disappointed at the host that was working Saturday night. The Host, Saturday night was extremely rude and inconsiderate. I understand the place was busy due to the festival of lights, but he did not have to be rude. He is lucky I was with a kid because I really wanted to smack him and get the manager. I walked up the host around 7:30 at night and asked if he had a table for 4, he said not till 10pm. I said thanks, that's ok. I was starving. I then asked do you mind if I use the bathroom, he said no they are for paying customers. I then pointed at my belly and said please, I am six months pregnant and really have to go. He clearly saw my belly and face. Mind you people think I am about 8-9 months pregnant because I am carrying so big. He then said with a sarcastic look on his face sorry no, the bathroom is for paying customers and there is already line for the bathroom, we are busy, excuse me I have people waiting. He was clearly annoyed because I asked to use the bathroom twice.I was so shocked, he is so lucky I was with a kid and I didn't want to the brown person make a scene in front of the whole restaurant. Atrium could of saved their 4 page letter. My intention was to be a patron of the restaurant. The one star rating is due to not extending common human courtesy. I did not ask to cut the line I simply asked if I can use the bathroom. A appropriate respond would of been there is a long you can wait if you like. Is good to know that your courtesy can not be extended for pregnant or disable people. Just so you know, most businesses if not all share that policy but they are usually ignored when a pregnant, disabled or a child ask to use the restroom.I find it amusing that the restaurant responds with details that did not happen and use an example of how it would of went down at another business. Further more I never mentioned race or the color of my skin as to why I will be boycotting. Thank You Atirum for being so classy.",1.0
I came here recently for brunch. The food was very yummy but a little on the pricey side. I had steak and eggs and my niece had an omelette. The portions could have been a little bigger for $14 and $22 (i.e. come with nicer sides.) The beverages were also interesting and refreshing. I did enjoy the decor and found the place very beautiful. (I kept wondering how they water the ferns that are growing out of the wall.) The staff was very friendly and attentive. We made a reservation but the place wasn't very busy when we went. It also helps that it's very close to the bridge so we were able to walk back to Manhattan very easily.,4.0

"I start by saying that the following review pertains to Thanksgiving.  For the past couple of years my family has decided to take a break from cooking upstate, but rather go out on Thanksgiving in the city.  This year we tried out Atrium in Dumbo.  While we did not get a chance to experience the full menu, I will say the options we all tasted on the Thanksgiving menu were out of this world.  Additionally the staff/service was oustanding, made the whole family feel welcomed which important on a day like Thanksgiving.  I think if an establishment can put so much heart/soul into a special day like this one than that says alot about the people who work there every day.  Two members of our party started with a charred Kale salad, one had the duck pate, and I had the fluke crudo.  The fluke, a bit small in portion, exceeded my expectation in taste.  All four of us had the turkey with a sausage stuffing, string beans and butter nut squash.  A cranberry compote was carefully placed on the generous portion of perfectly cooked turkey.  For dessert, the pumpkin tart which might have lasted about 10 seconds on my plate, so good.  So why not 5 stars?  The wine.  The pairings they offered with each choice on the holiday menu were outrageously priced.  I get it, this place knows its wine, but not everyone who eats there does.  Most don't care.  Yes we found some decently priced bottles on the menu, but I see where this place tries to make its money.  We just didnt feel very at home with that price point compared to what we paid for the exceptional meal.  I plan to go back to try the regular menu, I also plan to drink beforehand so I can enjoy a $13 glass of wine!",4.0

The scallops were the best I have ever been served.  They were served over a bed of corn that could have been an appetizer by itself.  The scallops were perfectly seasoned and melted in my mouth.  Other appetizers we shared were the carrots and the tomatoes with goat cheese.  Both of these were very flavorful and I would highly recommend them.  For the main course, we shared the smoked duck and the rigatoni with lobster.  The smoked duck was outstanding.  It had tremendous flavor and the smokiness was not over-powering.  The rigatoni was tremendous.  The lobster was fresh and it was served with a light covering of bread crumbs.  It was first-class and there was nothing left when we were done.  We also ordered a side of macaroni cheese with lobster.  It was perfectly done.  We did bring some of the mac and cheese home with us and it warmed up beautifully.  The last course was the dessert.  At first we didn't think we wanted it as we were full from the meal but opted for it as it looked wonderful.  It was better than we expected.  The key lime topped with strawberries was very flavorful.  The chocolate bar was definitely a highlight of the meal.  My girlfriend refused to share much with me as she informed me it was one of the best desserts she has ever had.  With only two bites that I was able to get from her, I agreed.  The chocolate melted in my mouth and I will be getting my own serving when we return.The service was top notch from the hostess who was extremely nice and pleasant.  The waiter was attentive and addressed all questions and provided solid recommendations.  The chef was tremendous as every dish we had tasted like a world-class meal.  The atmosphere was casual yet classy.  We felt comfortable and were very impressed with the architecture and décor.  The location was great as were able to work off some of our meal strolling by the Brooklyn bridge in a park that appears to be newly renovated.Now on to the sommelier, Alex.  I have never met someone so knowledgeable about wine.  His recommendations were spot-on throughout the night.  Not only did he share with us what wine would go with what course, he provided a quick background of the wine and explained the flavors we will experience.  Each glass we had made each course taste even better.  He matched a perfect white wine with the pasta and a delightful red with the duck.  His recommendations helped make this the best dining experience we had in NYC.  Whenever we come back to NYC, this will be one of our must go to places.",5.0
"Probably the best restaurant in dumbo. I love this place. Friendly staff and good food. I love the duck, steak and doughnut dessert. The potato bread is not my favorite. It had an odd texture to it. Brunch is fun and the food is good too. It gets busy so make a reservation in advance. I lived in dumbo for years now and it's clear that this place is the best. A bit pricey tho...",5.0
"Atrium never disappoints. My husband and I stumbled upon it randomly one day as we were walking through the Brooklyn Bridge park. We had the PEI mussels, tagliatelle pasta and 1 dessert each. The mussels were the best we've had and the pasta was delicious! The best part was the dessert though. I had the cheesecake and he had the chocolate bar. Each is so good! We even brought friends back to this restaurant and everyone has thoroughly enjoyed both the service and the yummy food. We will definitely be back again!",5.0

One of my favorite DUMBO restaurants. If you're with a friend or significant other - get the chicken for two. It's so tasty and the bread is so fluffy. The decor is very nice too.,4.0
Horrible service. Just terrible. Took a long to sit down although the place was half empty. The host was rude and apparently one of the owners. The food was such a small portion and not tasty at all. How does a place in NYC treat people badly and bad food. Recommendation: no way Jose. Do not go to Atrium Dumbo.,1.0
"LOVE THIS PLACE! Atrium made my birthday a very happy one and incredibly special by staying open way later then they should for my small dinner party. They never made us feel pressured to leave but instead continued to welcome our orders for rounds of drinks and deserts even with the kitchen closed! They provided us with excellent service and an unforgettable experience. (And thanks to the decor, we took great pictures too!)It has always been one of my Dumbo favorites, I bring friends and clients here a lot when I'm looking to impress.  Leslie is the first person I look for whenever I go, she always gives the warmest greetings and gets to know everyone I bring by name! Alex, the other owner, is a master Sommelier who is also welcoming and never disappoints when introducing me to their best drinks. The staff is friendly and personable and the head chef is always sending out the most appetizing things.  Atrium consistently has good food, great people, and amazing drinks, not much else I need to make me happy!",5.0
"3.5 stars. Only stopped in here for happy hour oysters, but it's a nice spot. The space is beautiful and has a beautiful dining area. The bar seating is tight and could use some more seating. The service is very slow, but's more the fault of the operation than the staff. Why is only one bartender servicing the entire restaurant? That's what it looked like. He was working really hard though. We ordered a couple beers and a dozen oysters. You don't get to choose the oysters. They were fresh and tasty. Nicely located by Brooklyn Bridge Park.",3.0
"I would have given this less than one star if I could. What can I say - it's a shame as we live in the neighborhood. We gave this a couple of chances because it looks good from the outside, but the staff (mainly the host) have been rude both times. The food is OK - but it's over-priced for the mediocre quality. Back to the staff: I have never been treated so rudely by a host before - he looked like he didn't care and made us wait for 5 minutes even though the place was empty. When he finally seated us, it was *conveniently* 7:01pm and he informed us that the happy hour offering advertised outside was no longer available. We left. His attitude was the worst. A tip for Atrium: the host is the first person you engage with when you come to a restaurant. If your host is going to be so rude that they make you feel uncomfortable, and so slow to serve that they put you off, then that will damage your brand and customer loyalty. We live in the area and will be telling others in Dumbo to AVOID until you improve your service.",1.0

However, I felt the wine selections were somewhat expensive (most wines were about $20 for a glass). Dessert was delicious as well; we had the brioche donuts.

Good not great. Cocktails are interesting but inconsistent. When made properly the Toast and Marmalade is excellent. I don't get why they have tiki drinks but they are on the menu. Best thing we ate was the deconstructed beef tartare. The beef was definitely hand chopped and fresh. I really liked how they had a devil egg purée on the side instead of  mixing in a raw egg yolk and the coarse sea salt crystals were a nice touch. Smoked duck entree was underseasoned but tender. Can't decide if I would get the Mac and cheese again - great flavor but needy to be gooier. It was a bit runny.The tagliatelle and spaghetti dishes were both anemic. Not worth the carbs.Service was hectic but they comped a round of drinks when they forgot to place our order for entrees.

Went in for a Saturday brunch at noon and had a wonderful experience. The restaurant itself is so pretty. I love the wood tables and stringed lights hanging from the ceiling. They also have a cool plant wall(I don't know how else to explain it).It was rather empty (which was weird since I had a hard time making a reservation for the time I wanted). The staff was super friendly and informative. I love that they all wear plaid - in case you needed reminding that you are in Brooklyn.My husband ordered the French toast with ricotta and berries. Some of the best french toast we have ever had. I ordered the duck confit sandwich at the suggestion of the waiter. The duck was amazing. The only down side was the bread was a little hard to bite into. I ate it as an open face sandwich instead. Will definitely be back to try their dinner menu!!!,5.0
"$1.00 per oyster and $8.00 cocktails during happy hour is a deal you can't miss. It's really close to the Brooklyn Bridge Park so you can walk around for a while and come in to enjoy a really good drink. We were seated immediately and our waiter made some drink suggestions.I ordered the Agave and Casis and got to try the Maple and rye. The cups were not filled to the top- actually had more ice than I would have liked, but the taste was perfect and not watered down. I personally thought the Maple and rye had a very strong kick, but left a very subtle aftertaste which was good. The Agave and Casis was smooth all around. I wish the drinks were a little larger, but for the price it sufficed. I normally don't like oysters, but tried one and it wasn't bad. I've tried them in other places and they haven't been as fresh as they were at this location.My only issue was that I like seats with backs- not bar stools which is what we had so I didn't like that. I would probably go to Guthrie Inn to get a good drink at a closer location.",3.0
"Never coming back!!!  Everything was wrong in this restaurant...  When we walked in without reservation this past Friday, the host informed us that there would be about 15-20 minutes wait.  So, we went to the bar for some drinks while we waited for a table.  It took us about another 30-45 minutes to get seated, though the host was nice and explained to us that the customers already paid, but were still sitting on the tables.There were several occasions that we tried to order appetizers when we were at the bar, but were ignored.  Until finally when we tried to talk to the host again that he informed us a table was getting set up momentarily.  After we were seated, we tried to ask the server questions about menu, but he responded by saying that he would come back to us.We got terrible attitudes from everyone in the restaurant.  We ended up ordering a bottle of wine while we waited for our entrees, which took another 30-45 minutes, when the restaurant was half empty.  After we asked the server to check on our food that the food arrived shortly.  We started eating, until a bus boy came by and replaced my entree because he gave me the wrong entree at the beginning.Though the food were amazing, the poor service and the attitude completely ruined our dining experience.  We are defnitely never coming back to this place again, ever...",1.0
"Beautiful location on a cobblestone street, with gorgeous views (from the front door, NOT inside) of the Manhattan Bridge and NYC skyline.- Decor is very downtown Brooklyn - clean, modern, slick.- Service was fantastic.- Food was amazing.  Not a huge selection, but what they offer is delish!- we started with the kale goat cheese salad - bit disappointed.  Kale was big'o leaves on top of hidden goat cheese which was skimpy.- i had the lobster roll which was also a bit skimpy, but not drenched in mayo which i can appreciate, and the flavoring was delish.  - potatoe chips are homemade, they melt on your tongue with the perfect amount of salt.  We were told that 99% of what they serve is homemade.- we got all 3 desserts.  To die for!- wish there was one in Manhattan, but i'll treck to DUMBO to eat here!",4.0
"I wanted to like Atrium a lot more than I did.  All of the food tasted fresh and was presented well but each dish was off in one way or another.  It was as if they left something out that was missing or added something in that didn't belong.The beef tartare didn't have that mustardy tang that I look for.  The marrow ravioli pasta was delicious but the escargot just didn't seem to jive with the green sauce they were served in.  The fluke crudo had grapefruit in it but was still missing acidity leaving it flat tasting.  I ordered the Pansotti pasta for my main course and the duck confit was tasty but the truffle flavor was seriously lacking.  If you're going to advertise truffles, I want to taste them.The vibe here is modern, airy and fresh.  You gotta love the wall of greens.  Service was unmemorable but that's fine.  As long as it's not memorable in a bad way.  I think the food would benefit greatly from a little more seasoning.  Everything I ate was just meh.  I wouldn't fight people if they wanted to come back here but I wouldn't choose Atrium if the decision was in my hands.STAR SIGHTING: Anne Hathaway (Dumbo resident) apparently dines here regularly.  As attractive in person as on the big screen though I'd choose Jennifer Lawrence in the pixie cut category.",3.0
"My brother-in-law and I stopped by this place for lunch on our way back to Manhattan after a meeting in Brooklyn.  I picked it from the Yelp ratings expecting a great meal.  While the food was good, nothing was outstanding but my rating really stems from the lack of service and our extremely unfriendly waiter.  He could not have been more unhelpful!   He was curt, provided no suggestions and looked like he would have rather been anywhere but there.  Was a real turnoff right from the beginning.  We ended up sharing the kale salad, beet tartare and I had the lamb sandwich and my BIL had the cobb salad.   My BIL did not enjoy his cobb salad at all but my lamb sandwich and the rest of the dishes were decent but not good enough to put up with the lack of service.  He weren't approached for even served water for a good 15 minutes after being seated!  Dumbo has too many great restaurants for me to ever go back here!",2.0
"I have eaten at Atrium multiples times for dinner (can't speak about the food or service during a different time of day) -- and almost always at the bar but also (sparingly) seated at tables when I have guest in town -- and the food is delicious, the service excellent.  The two major problems I have:  1.) It's expensive (but, it's duMBO -- what did I expect), and 2.) the food takes a TAD too long to come out for my taste (whether I'm seated at the bar or at a table).  I like going to them because they have a nice food selection on their dinner menu (something for everyone -- whether it's seafood, poultry or red meat) and I like their cocktail menu; there sort of like 'Sunshine' in Crown Heights.  Three other minor annoyances I have with them is that as expensive as some of their entrees are, it's not always filling (i.e. there needs to be more food on the plate or some of the dishes are simply over priced):  When you're ordering the duck, or the Branzino or Skate entree for $23 to $25 I expect to be satisfied after eating, not wondering whether or not I should order a 3rd entree.  The 2nd minor annoyance is (I've experienced multiple times now with friends who have ordered it) if you order a burger medium-rare, it tends to come out well to medium-to-well.  Now, these are '1st world problems' for sure and not a 'deal breaker', but I have noticed this multiple times with different parties I've take out to dinner -- unless you just order it rare, it comes out well (which could be annoying when you're paying almost $20 for a burger & 4 potato wedges).  3rd minor annoyance: vWish they had a broader selection of oysters, but maybe there's a reason behind that . . .With that said, it's still definitely a ""go to"" place of mine in the neighborhood since the dinner menu is solid for the most part.  I just wish it was a tad more affordable (given some of their portion sizes) and the food didn't take as long to come out . . . otherwise, no gripes about the service (love the servers/bartender/manager).P.S. -- Other posters are correct:  the Chef is c-u-t-e!  ;)",3.0
"Wasn't at all what I expected. We were looking for something quick and basic without the enormous lines of the touristy pizza places. I read the reviews and expected something decent but nothing to write home (or the yelp world) about. When we walked in, I was surprised by the decor. Really upscale and fresh without being too formal. We sat at the bar, then got a table and ultimately switched to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen. The team was like a well-oiled machine. Service was great, attentive and really friendly.  We watched the chef preparing brunch dishes, which aren't usually th most demanding from a prep standpoint, and he clearly had the technique to much more than inventive brunch food... So I started asking questions.  Turns out he trained for years under Ducasse and Bouloud, which explains some of the combinations and attention to detail. It's not a huge menu, so don't go there thinking that you will have an encyclopedia of diner foods. We looked at the dinner menu, which lo9ked awesome and will be back. Net net, an excellent brunch, looks stellar for dinner, great ambiance, great staff, and very underrated.  Definitely going back. Oh, and they had Zacapa, which didn't hurt either.",5.0

They also have a cool plant wall(I don't know how else to explain it).It was rather empty (which was weird since I had a hard time making a reservation for the time I wanted). The staff was super friendly and informative. I love that they all wear plaid - in case you needed reminding that you are in Brooklyn.My husband ordered the French toast with ricotta and berries. Some of the best french toast we have ever had. I ordered the duck confit sandwich at the suggestion of the waiter. The duck was amazing. The only down side was the bread was a little hard to bite into. I ate it as an open face sandwich instead. Will definitely be back to try their dinner menu!!!,5.0
"$1.00 per oyster and $8.00 cocktails during happy hour is a deal you can't miss. It's really close to the Brooklyn Bridge Park so you can walk around for a while and come in to enjoy a really good drink. We were seated immediately and our waiter made some drink suggestions.I ordered the Agave and Casis and got to try the Maple and rye. The cups were not filled to the top- actually had more ice than I would have liked, but the taste was perfect and not watered down. I personally thought the Maple and rye had a very strong kick, but left a very subtle aftertaste which was good. The Agave and Casis was smooth all around. I wish the drinks were a little larger, but for the price it sufficed. I normally don't like oysters, but tried one and it wasn't bad. I've tried them in other places and they haven't been as fresh as they were at this location.My only issue was that I like seats with backs- not bar stools which is what we had so I didn't like that. I would probably go to Guthrie Inn to get a good drink at a closer location.",3.0
"Never coming back!!!  Everything was wrong in this restaurant...  When we walked in without reservation this past Friday, the host informed us that there would be about 15-20 minutes wait.  So, we went to the bar for some drinks while we waited for a table.  It took us about another 30-45 minutes to get seated, though the host was nice and explained to us that the customers already paid, but were still sitting on the tables.There were several occasions that we tried to order appetizers when we were at the bar, but were ignored.  Until finally when we tried to talk to the host again that he informed us a table was getting set up momentarily.  After we were seated, we tried to ask the server questions about menu, but he responded by saying that he would come back to us.We got terrible attitudes from everyone in the restaurant.  We ended up ordering a bottle of wine while we waited for our entrees, which took another 30-45 minutes, when the restaurant was half empty.  After we asked the server to check on our food that the food arrived shortly.  We started eating, until a bus boy came by and replaced my entree because he gave me the wrong entree at the beginning.Though the food were amazing, the poor service and the attitude completely ruined our dining experience.  We are defnitely never coming back to this place again, ever...",1.0
"Beautiful location on a cobblestone street, with gorgeous views (from the front door, NOT inside) of the Manhattan Bridge and NYC skyline.- Decor is very downtown Brooklyn - clean, modern, slick.- Service was fantastic.- Food was amazing.  Not a huge selection, but what they offer is delish!- we started with the kale goat cheese salad - bit disappointed.  Kale was big'o leaves on top of hidden goat cheese which was skimpy.- i had the lobster roll which was also a bit skimpy, but not drenched in mayo which i can appreciate, and the flavoring was delish.  - potatoe chips are homemade, they melt on your tongue with the perfect amount of salt.  We were told that 99% of what they serve is homemade.- we got all 3 desserts.  To die for!- wish there was one in Manhattan, but i'll treck to DUMBO to eat here!",4.0
"I wanted to like Atrium a lot more than I did.  All of the food tasted fresh and was presented well but each dish was off in one way or another.  It was as if they left something out that was missing or added something in that didn't belong.The beef tartare didn't have that mustardy tang that I look for.  The marrow ravioli pasta was delicious but the escargot just didn't seem to jive with the green sauce they were served in.  The fluke crudo had grapefruit in it but was still missing acidity leaving it flat tasting.  I ordered the Pansotti pasta for my main course and the duck confit was tasty but the truffle flavor was seriously lacking.  If you're going to advertise truffles, I want to taste them.The vibe here is modern, airy and fresh.  You gotta love the wall of greens.  Service was unmemorable but that's fine.  As long as it's not memorable in a bad way.  I think the food would benefit greatly from a little more seasoning.  Everything I ate was just meh.  I wouldn't fight people if they wanted to come back here but I wouldn't choose Atrium if the decision was in my hands.STAR SIGHTING: Anne Hathaway (Dumbo resident) apparently dines here regularly.  As attractive in person as on the big screen though I'd choose Jennifer Lawrence in the pixie cut category.",3.0
"My brother-in-law and I stopped by this place for lunch on our way back to Manhattan after a meeting in Brooklyn.  I picked it from the Yelp ratings expecting a great meal.  While the food was good, nothing was outstanding but my rating really stems from the lack of service and our extremely unfriendly waiter.  He could not have been more unhelpful!   He was curt, provided no suggestions and looked like he would have rather been anywhere but there.  Was a real turnoff right from the beginning.  We ended up sharing the kale salad, beet tartare and I had the lamb sandwich and my BIL had the cobb salad.   My BIL did not enjoy his cobb salad at all but my lamb sandwich and the rest of the dishes were decent but not good enough to put up with the lack of service.  He weren't approached for even served water for a good 15 minutes after being seated!  Dumbo has too many great restaurants for me to ever go back here!",2.0
"I have eaten at Atrium multiples times for dinner (can't speak about the food or service during a different time of day) -- and almost always at the bar but also (sparingly) seated at tables when I have guest in town -- and the food is delicious, the service excellent.  The two major problems I have:  1.) It's expensive (but, it's duMBO -- what did I expect), and 2.) the food takes a TAD too long to come out for my taste (whether I'm seated at the bar or at a table).  I like going to them because they have a nice food selection on their dinner menu (something for everyone -- whether it's seafood, poultry or red meat) and I like their cocktail menu; there sort of like 'Sunshine' in Crown Heights.  Three other minor annoyances I have with them is that as expensive as some of their entrees are, it's not always filling (i.e. there needs to be more food on the plate or some of the dishes are simply over priced):  When you're ordering the duck, or the Branzino or Skate entree for $23 to $25 I expect to be satisfied after eating, not wondering whether or not I should order a 3rd entree.  The 2nd minor annoyance is (I've experienced multiple times now with friends who have ordered it) if you order a burger medium-rare, it tends to come out well to medium-to-well.  Now, these are '1st world problems' for sure and not a 'deal breaker', but I have noticed this multiple times with different parties I've take out to dinner -- unless you just order it rare, it comes out well (which could be annoying when you're paying almost $20 for a burger & 4 potato wedges).  3rd minor annoyance: vWish they had a broader selection of oysters, but maybe there's a reason behind that . . .With that said, it's still definitely a ""go to"" place of mine in the neighborhood since the dinner menu is solid for the most part.  I just wish it was a tad more affordable (given some of their portion sizes) and the food didn't take as long to come out . . . otherwise, no gripes about the service (love the servers/bartender/manager).P.S. -- Other posters are correct:  the Chef is c-u-t-e!  ;)",3.0
"Wasn't at all what I expected. We were looking for something quick and basic without the enormous lines of the touristy pizza places. I read the reviews and expected something decent but nothing to write home (or the yelp world) about. When we walked in, I was surprised by the decor. Really upscale and fresh without being too formal. We sat at the bar, then got a table and ultimately switched to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen. The team was like a well-oiled machine. Service was great, attentive and really friendly.  We watched the chef preparing brunch dishes, which aren't usually th most demanding from a prep standpoint, and he clearly had the technique to much more than inventive brunch food... So I started asking questions.  Turns out he trained for years under Ducasse and Bouloud, which explains some of the combinations and attention to detail. It's not a huge menu, so don't go there thinking that you will have an encyclopedia of diner foods. We looked at the dinner menu, which lo9ked awesome and will be back. Net net, an excellent brunch, looks stellar for dinner, great ambiance, great staff, and very underrated.  Definitely going back. Oh, and they had Zacapa, which didn't hurt either.",5.0

"Went for brunch on Saturday.  Nice space, great food, but the service pretty much sucked.  Had a reservation at 1:00 and the host kept us waiting almost 15 minutes, saying that there was another party finishing up at our table.  Okay, it happens. but when we finally got seated upstairs, there were 2 other tables we could have sat at that were empty!  The host explained that they were reserved for a large party, but by the time we left over 90 minutes later, they were just setting those tables for a large party.  Bogus.  There were also many 2 tops they could have pushed together.My food was fantastic (scrambled eggs, charred kale, roasted tomato), and the biscuits were terrific too.  But someone else in our party ordered a burger well done, with sauce on the side and extra lettuce and tomato, it came medium rare at best, no sauce on the side, and no extras.  Had to ask twice for them.  Another party member asked for his greens to be prepared with no garlic, and his food had visible flecks of garlic in it when it arrived.  I mean, I know special orders are a pain, but don't say it's possible and then not even try to make it happen, you know?Also had to keep asking repeatedly to get our water glasses refilled.  Shouldn't this happen automatically?  In general, our waiter seemed pretty inattentive.  Little things, but they left a bad impression.Too bad.  I would have only given 2 stars if my food wasn't so darn tasty.",3.0

My first time ordering a Moscow Mule which was very tasty. If I am back in the neighborhood at St. Anns or somewhere I would probably come back.,4.0
"My son and new daughter-in-law recently had their wedding here. The food and drinks were amazing and the ambiance was perfect. The chefs, waiters, waitresses and bartenders were attentive, patient and fun. The only issue we had was the verbal agreement that we would be able to set up for the wedding during the day. They took on another party a couple of weeks before which left us scrambling to get the decorations and everything else done in 45 minutes. If you have an occasion here just get everything in writing. All and all it was still totally worth it and created the memories of a lifetime! Thank you to all at the Atrium DUMBO!!!",5.0
I could live on their appetizers alone. From the apple smoked bread (sent from heaven) to the fresh oysters and the well thought out dishes like the crudo and the braised carrot quinoa + amazing cheeses you can't go wrong.. I usually love to sit in the bar area and enjoy one of their many the cocktails or a great glass of wine. Plus their bartender Luis is always super helpful and makes a mean hibiscus ginger.  I have yet to meet a dish I don't love or a drink I don't like at atrium and for somebody who is a pescatarian I don't feel limited.,5.0
"Wonderful food and service.  The bronzino was the best executed bronzino dish I ever have had.  The tomato appetizer with fresh cheese and pesto was a delicious rendition of a summer classic.  Kudos to the  chef, and hats off to the waitstaff for attentive, lovely service.  We will be back!",4.0
"I had an OUTSTANDING experience at Atrium Dumbo.

We had a raw oyster plate to start with that I still think about when I'm ordering oysters back home.  I usually try to find something I can say needs improvement for a review, but I was just completely satisfied with my dining experience here, I can't think of a single thing I'd change.",5.0

"I held my 20 person graduation party at Atrium Dumbo on Thursday evening. Everything from the pre-event planning to the event itself, was handled perfectly.

After our guests arrived, we sat down for an amazing dinner where guests could pick from several items including: beef tartar, salad, angus steak, skate, salmon crudo, quinoa pasta, brioche doughnuts, and chocolate cake. Everyone I have talked to commented on how incredible the meal and service was. I rarely take the time to write reviews but this was a truly exceptional experience.

"Not A Child Friendly Place. I do not mean to be an entitled parent but this is Brooklyn. Most restaurants here is child friendly and accepts children and their occasional outbursts. We went here for brunch. My two year old son had an accident and let out a few screams that lasted just seconds. To our surprise, the owner, Mr. Dallas, came to our table and in his own way told us to eat quick and leave. This is while my son was sitting on my lap, very calm, quiet and happy. At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. But on the way out I challenged him to clarify what he meant. He confirmed that when children cry, parents should take them outside. While this might be a good etiquette for children who throw tantrum or cry for a long time, our incident was a brief few-seconds event. I am still in disbelief how rude and unapologetic the owner was. What a pity! To be fair, the place has a nice ambiance and the food is above average.

"We had a reservation here and was about 20 minutes late by the time we got there. Despite being late, we were still seated immediately even though there were a bunch of people waiting for tables. We ordered the applewood smoked potato bread, the smoked LI duck, salmon carpaccio, and half a dozen oysters. I really enjoyed the bread and loved that it had smoked bacon flavor to it. I wish they offered this free for the table but it was well worth the $3 despite being a bit on the small side. The salmon carpaccio was OK, I liked the refreshing flavor of the grapefruit but wish there was another element to this dish that would make it stand out more. The oysters were fresh and at $2.75 for one, it was decently priced. I really wanted to love the duck and my friend really liked it but I felt that it was lacking flavor. It tasted very similar to roast duck that you get at a Chinese restaurant but without the savoriness that you taste when it is marinated with soy sauce. The duck was also a little tough and was not that special of a dish. I will be back to try other items on the menu though, just not the duck.",4.0
"We are locals and frequent Atrium 1-2x per month. Unfortunately we have to give Atrium one star after our experience on Sunday afternoon.

We sat by the window in a small 2-top, and had, what seemed to be the server/bartender's (his name was Brian) undivided attention. This guy was super sweet, completely on the ball, and basically just made us feel welcome. Turns out he was training?! He seemed like he had been working there for a while. He totally owned it! Anyway, the oysters were fresh and delicious, tuna tarter needed salt, soup good and cocktails on point. We reeeeaaaally like this place and will definitely be back. Solid!",5.0
"3.5 stars!! Didn't round up, because it's just a little bit too pricey. I wouldn't say Atrium is specifically worth the trip, but if you're not far from it, it's a good place to go (there aren't that many other options in Dumbo either). It's good. A friend and I split two sandwiches--the beer battered cod, and the lamb sandwich. The lamb was good because it was lamb and had a good combination of ingredients with the yogurt and the mint--but nothing special in the grand scheme of good lamb sandwiches. The beer battered cod, was GREAT. Highly recommend it. Bread in my opinion, is extraordinarily significant to a sandwich, and I feel like the bread didn't do the stuffing justice. The chips were pretty good.What makes me almost give this place a 4, more than the food, was the atmosphere. It's a cool place. Dumbo is a great area, it would be a really nice place to go for brunch or lunch I think--and then you can walk around to the bridge, and whatnot. Also, the lighting is awesome, and it's a beautifully designed interior where you can see the chefs cooking. It's a very pleasant experience, regardless of the food. Overall, a nice place to be. Seems like a very multipurpose place too, you could go solo and you could go just for the bar. All in all, I approve!Not formal, but I wouldn't say casual is the best word to describe it. It's definitely a 'trendy' place.",3.0
"My second dining experience at Atrium.  I have to say,  it gets better every time. The waiting staff is extremely friendly.  If you don't know what to order, or what to drink, just ask.  They are very knowledgeable and it makes the experience.  The beef tartar was amazeballs I could have made that my meal alone. The oysters were also amazing. My entree was cooked perfectly however it was a little fatty. Overall it was a good experience and I look forward to going and trying new dishes next time.",4.0
"I have to say I think I was harsh on making them miss a WHOLE star! I have gone back maybe 6-7 times now and each time my mouth thanks me (as does my belly).  I mean... I live in Brooklyn, a city that certainly does not lack culinary genius, yet my mind and mouth drags me back to Atrium... that speaks volumes! Anyway, 5 stars here all the way! BTW their bartender is a man after my heart... jus' sayin'Oh! and everyone that works there is a complete and utter sweetheart!Ok. That's all.PS: I am still dying over the smoked potato bread; but they have now won my heart with the potato wedges; their brunch menu features a smoked herring deliciousness AND their dinner menu included a chicken for 2 which per my carnivore friends, SHAMED NoMad's famous (and overpriced) chicken. Go.EAT.Now.",5.0

"Full disclosure - I know someone who's helping start up this place, but I promise the review is legit:Went in for dinner on a Friday night - this place is easy to get to on the train, but a little away from the few other things I know in Dumbo. GORGEOUS spot, with nice service, lots of space when you're in there, etc.Food and drink are all yummy, with really relaxed friendly service. We tried a couple of cocktails and the olive something bread which is legit. Also got the little ravioli which were really rich and unique.Dinner - I had the chicken, which was PHENOM, and boy had the steak which was a gorgeous cut and cooked perfectly. Like, really perfectly, he said it more than once during the meal. Wine selections were great too, even the by the glass was really really nice. Was too stuffed to dessert so maybe next time.Will be back for sure - this is an awesome place that's casual enough for any time, but nice enough that it's worthy of a special occasion. Hangs in the comfie middle, sort of like DUMBO.",5.0

Came here for brunch with my husband and daughter with a carriage and had no problems.  I sat upstairs where there were other children and even made a joke to the server that it was like the romper room.

We sat by the window in a small 2-top, and had, what seemed to be the server/bartender's (his name was Brian) undivided attention. This guy was super sweet, completely on the ball, and basically just made us feel welcome. Turns out he was training?! He seemed like he had been working there for a while. He totally owned it! Anyway, the oysters were fresh and delicious, tuna tarter needed salt, soup good and cocktails on point. We reeeeaaaally like this place and will definitely be back. Solid!",5.0
"3.5 stars!! Didn't round up, because it's just a little bit too pricey. I wouldn't say Atrium is specifically worth the trip, but if you're not far from it, it's a good place to go (there aren't that many other options in Dumbo either). It's good. A friend and I split two sandwiches--the beer battered cod, and the lamb sandwich. The lamb was good because it was lamb and had a good combination of ingredients with the yogurt and the mint--but nothing special in the grand scheme of good lamb sandwiches. The beer battered cod, was GREAT. Highly recommend it. Bread in my opinion, is extraordinarily significant to a sandwich, and I feel like the bread didn't do the stuffing justice. The chips were pretty good.What makes me almost give this place a 4, more than the food, was the atmosphere. It's a cool place. Dumbo is a great area, it would be a really nice place to go for brunch or lunch I think--and then you can walk around to the bridge, and whatnot. Also, the lighting is awesome, and it's a beautifully designed interior where you can see the chefs cooking. It's a very pleasant experience, regardless of the food. Overall, a nice place to be. Seems like a very multipurpose place too, you could go solo and you could go just for the bar. All in all, I approve!Not formal, but I wouldn't say casual is the best word to describe it. It's definitely a 'trendy' place.",3.0
"My second dining experience at Atrium.  I have to say,  it gets better every time. The waiting staff is extremely friendly.  If you don't know what to order, or what to drink, just ask.  They are very knowledgeable and it makes the experience.  The beef tartar was amazeballs I could have made that my meal alone. The oysters were also amazing. My entree was cooked perfectly however it was a little fatty. Overall it was a good experience and I look forward to going and trying new dishes next time.",4.0
"I have to say I think I was harsh on making them miss a WHOLE star! I have gone back maybe 6-7 times now and each time my mouth thanks me (as does my belly).  I mean... I live in Brooklyn, a city that certainly does not lack culinary genius, yet my mind and mouth drags me back to Atrium... that speaks volumes! Anyway, 5 stars here all the way! BTW their bartender is a man after my heart... jus' sayin'Oh! and everyone that works there is a complete and utter sweetheart!Ok. That's all.PS: I am still dying over the smoked potato bread; but they have now won my heart with the potato wedges; their brunch menu features a smoked herring deliciousness AND their dinner menu included a chicken for 2 which per my carnivore friends, SHAMED NoMad's famous (and overpriced) chicken. Go.EAT.Now.",5.0
"We ordered a couple appetizers, all the desert options, a couple cocktails, and I got to try everyone's entree, so I feel safe in saying you can't go wrong here. The food was delicious - a carefully curated menu with adventurous pairings that work. The space is lovely - I like the open kitchen - and the service is great. I'd suggest this as a date spot.",5.0
"Full disclosure - I know someone who's helping start up this place, but I promise the review is legit:Went in for dinner on a Friday night - this place is easy to get to on the train, but a little away from the few other things I know in Dumbo. GORGEOUS spot, with nice service, lots of space when you're in there, etc.Food and drink are all yummy, with really relaxed friendly service. We tried a couple of cocktails and the olive something bread which is legit. Also got the little ravioli which were really rich and unique.Dinner - I had the chicken, which was PHENOM, and boy had the steak which was a gorgeous cut and cooked perfectly. Like, really perfectly, he said it more than once during the meal. Wine selections were great too, even the by the glass was really really nice. Was too stuffed to dessert so maybe next time.Will be back for sure - this is an awesome place that's casual enough for any time, but nice enough that it's worthy of a special occasion. Hangs in the comfie middle, sort of like DUMBO.",5.0
"Okay food, but should be better for the price. Oysters weren't great, beer was good, hamburger bun stale, mac n cheese w/lobster came out without lobster. Service spilled water on my friend and had the gall after the series of bloopers to hustle us along.",2.0
Came here for brunch with my husband and daughter with a carriage and had no problems.  I sat upstairs where there were other children and even made a joke to the server that it was like the romper room.

"We were looking for a nice brunch place in DUMBO to take a friend from out of town and stumbled upon this place.  I made reservations, but they weren't necessary as we were the first ones there and were alone in the restaurant for quite some time.  That was a bit strange for 11am on a Sunday, but it was also a holiday weekend.  The waiter was very friendly and attentive.  We wanted the deviled eggs, but found out there is bacon in them and our friend does not eat pork.  We were told they could not make them without the bacon so we ordered the corn biscuits instead. Much to our surprise, the waiter brought out the eggs anyway, on the house and with one of the eggs sans bacon.  The corn biscuits were very small, but also very delicious. Also, I was a bit disappointed they did not have iced coffee.Our entrees were good, but nothing spectacular.  I got the mushroom and leek omlette and it was tasty.  My wife got the quinoa pasta dish which was nice as was our friend's french toast.  The portions were very generous on all three.  There was nothing overly adventurous on the menu.My biggest disappointment was the lighting.  I guess I expected a place like Atrium to be a bit brighter, but it was fairly dark and cold inside for what was an 80 degree day.  Of course, you can only do so much with a building, but the pictures and the name of the restaurant had me anticipating a more outdoorsy feel.",3.0

"We went to Atrium Dumbo after an cocktail event in the same neighborhood. The host pulled up my reservation right away and we were seated quickly. Unfortunately, we were able to pick out our drinks, meals, and wait a bit before any server came over to ask which kind of water we wanted. (Tap, please!) That same server then knocked a vase of lavender all over the couple next to us who were very polite about it, just shaken up from the crash of it all. The server was oblivious, but other staff saw it happen and were quick to clean everything up. The host came over to offer the couple anything they needed for the rest of the night.I had the pisco sour to drink and it was well blended and not too sweet. We shared the Salmon Crudo which I highly recommend as a fantastic, fresh starter. I had the Lamb Ragu pasta with summer peas, which was delicious and surprisingly light! We finished the meal with the peanut butter and jelly dessert, which consisted of rich peanut butter ice cream, raspberry sorbet, raspberries and strawberries scattered throughout, and a crisp cookie on top. When it first arrived, we thought we'd been given the strawberries and rhubarb dessert, because the presentation doesn't conjure PB&J at all, but our taste buds proved we'd been given the correct dessert because it tasted just like the real thing! I especially loved the peanut butter ice cream and wish I'd asked if it was made in-house or was available for purchase! Over all, I think Atrium Dumbo is a wonderful place to dine, and if their service was just a hair more attentive, this would've been five stars all the way!",4.0
Came here before venturing to the Brooklyn Bridge park for Brunch over the weekend. My first thoughts were that the menu was quite small and I was unsure of what to order. Our server was great and recommended the chicken and waffles to my fiance. This is their most popular brunch meal. I ordered the Eggs Florentine with Lobster. First time having lobster for breakfast and it was the greatest decision I could have made. The spinach on the eggs Florentine was sauteed delicately in a light butter sauce along with the lobster. The pieces of lobster were deliciously soft and flavorful. I tried the chicken and it was perfectly crunchy and and full of flavor. Inside the chicken was tender and juicy. i would definitely recommend this meal. The high review is mostly weighted on the great service we received. The host was pleasant and very welcoming and the waitstaff did not miss a beat. I can't remember the last time i went to a restaurant and my glass of water stayed full. And i drink A LOT of water with my meals but my glass never went below half. Only complaint is the mimosas were in a very small champagne flute and $13,4.0
"~~~~~{@What brought me and my gf to this place was the celebration of her birthday.  Badly she wanted to try oysters for her bday, so I wanted to make that happen for her.  I brought her to Atrium Dumbo for this sole purpose.  At Atrium Dumbo we were greeted by a kind waitress and were seated immediately.  We visited this establishment on a Thursday night at 9pm.  There was ample seating available, but it was still reasonably busy. At first we were seated facing each other at a small table where two other couples were just 12 inches away, one on each side.  For my taste we were too close and I dislike being so close where I can hear other conversations so clearly.  I kindly asked to be moved to another table and our waitress quickly made it happen.  Within 3 minutes we were seated at the bar area which was more private and had a wonderful view of the kitchen and the chefs cooking.  Watching the chefs cook was entertaining.  They were very precise and elegant in the way they prepared their dishes.  We ordered the oysters and two glasses of white wine for a starter, and the ravioli and duck as our main course.  A few minutes later though the waitress came to tell us that they had run out of oysters.  Boo!  That was the whole reason I had brought my gf here, for the oysters!  My gf did not make a scene (she is not the type to do that), but I could tell she was disappointed.  A waiter though noticed that disappointment and came to us with some home made bread and butter.  At first I was not impressed because it was just bread and butter, but once my gf and I tasted the bread our disappointment started to fade.  The disappointment completely faded when our main courses came out.  The ravioli was delicious and it was a moderate portion.  The duck though!  My goodness!!!  It was the best duck I have had and I am picky about my duck!  It was too good and it definitely put a smile on my girls' face.  After our meal was finished we began finishing off the bread and noticed that the waiter had forgot to serve us our wine.  Boo number two!  I asked the waitress for their wine list again and my girl noticed the second time around that one of her favorite white wines was available, the Riesling Kabinett.  That was not our original order so good thing the first order did not arrive.  We ordered two glasses of Riesling and the night turned beautiful filled with romantic flirty banter between a loving couple.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very calm, classy, and romantic as well to amplify the mood.   Overral my experience was filled with positives and negatives.  I give this a four star rating due to the duck, Riesling, and the fact that my gf was satisfied at the end of the night.  (TIPforYOU)  I suggest after eating to take a walk at the Brooklyn Bridge Park.  We walked around there at 11pm and we felt very safe despite it being late.  There were lots of other couples present enjoying the view of the Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, and the Manhattan Skyline at night.  The lights really set the mood ; )",4.0

"This restaurant was on my to-do list since it opened. The pictures of the ambiance looked amazing. The menu.. I couldn't wait! Tonight, I came with a girlfriend for a quick bite and a glass wine after picking up our bibs for Brooklyn Half. We asked for a table and were told that it would be 10-15 minutes wait. I was surprised, since I saw a table for 2 available. When I raised the question, the manager/hostess responded: It is available but you wouldn't get good service because we are at full capacity now. There are not enough waiters. What?! Not happy with the answer I said: what's the difference between sitting there (restaurant WITH a table available) or here (bar with a table available)?: Oh, the waiter is different. Ha!

"Made it to Atrium my last visit to NY and it was absolutely worth the trip across the bridge to Dumbo.

"Nice option for dining down in DUMBO, which despite the huge growth in tech businesses and residential lofts remains a bit of a dining wasteland. I went there for lunch on a Monday. Menu was not huge, but enough variety to find something. I went for shrimp with chickpeas, and my dining partner had the lobster roll. Both were quite good. The cauliflower soup, which we did not have, looked amazing. Service was efficient and unobtrusive. I will return, maybe at night next time.",4.0
Happy to have this in the hood! The cauliflower pasta is amazing.,4.0
"We went to Atrium Dumbo after an cocktail event in the same neighborhood. The host pulled up my reservation right away and we were seated quickly. Unfortunately, we were able to pick out our drinks, meals, and wait a bit before any server came over to ask which kind of water we wanted. (Tap, please!) That same server then knocked a vase of lavender all over the couple next to us who were very polite about it, just shaken up from the crash of it all. The server was oblivious, but other staff saw it happen and were quick to clean everything up. The host came over to offer the couple anything they needed for the rest of the night.I had the pisco sour to drink and it was well blended and not too sweet. We shared the Salmon Crudo which I highly recommend as a fantastic, fresh starter. I had the Lamb Ragu pasta with summer peas, which was delicious and surprisingly light! We finished the meal with the peanut butter and jelly dessert, which consisted of rich peanut butter ice cream, raspberry sorbet, raspberries and strawberries scattered throughout, and a crisp cookie on top. When it first arrived, we thought we'd been given the strawberries and rhubarb dessert, because the presentation doesn't conjure PB&J at all, but our taste buds proved we'd been given the correct dessert because it tasted just like the real thing! I especially loved the peanut butter ice cream and wish I'd asked if it was made in-house or was available for purchase! Over all, I think Atrium Dumbo is a wonderful place to dine, and if their service was just a hair more attentive, this would've been five stars all the way!",4.0
Came here before venturing to the Brooklyn Bridge park for Brunch over the weekend. My first thoughts were that the menu was quite small and I was unsure of what to order. Our server was great and recommended the chicken and waffles to my fiance. This is their most popular brunch meal. I ordered the Eggs Florentine with Lobster. First time having lobster for breakfast and it was the greatest decision I could have made. The spinach on the eggs Florentine was sauteed delicately in a light butter sauce along with the lobster. The pieces of lobster were deliciously soft and flavorful. I tried the chicken and it was perfectly crunchy and and full of flavor. Inside the chicken was tender and juicy. i would definitely recommend this meal. The high review is mostly weighted on the great service we received. The host was pleasant and very welcoming and the waitstaff did not miss a beat. I can't remember the last time i went to a restaurant and my glass of water stayed full. And i drink A LOT of water with my meals but my glass never went below half. Only complaint is the mimosas were in a very small champagne flute and $13,4.0
"~~~~~{@What brought me and my gf to this place was the celebration of her birthday.  Badly she wanted to try oysters for her bday, so I wanted to make that happen for her.  I brought her to Atrium Dumbo for this sole purpose.  At Atrium Dumbo we were greeted by a kind waitress and were seated immediately.  We visited this establishment on a Thursday night at 9pm.  There was ample seating available, but it was still reasonably busy. At first we were seated facing each other at a small table where two other couples were just 12 inches away, one on each side.  For my taste we were too close and I dislike being so close where I can hear other conversations so clearly.  I kindly asked to be moved to another table and our waitress quickly made it happen.  Within 3 minutes we were seated at the bar area which was more private and had a wonderful view of the kitchen and the chefs cooking.  Watching the chefs cook was entertaining.  They were very precise and elegant in the way they prepared their dishes.  We ordered the oysters and two glasses of white wine for a starter, and the ravioli and duck as our main course.  A few minutes later though the waitress came to tell us that they had run out of oysters.  Boo!  That was the whole reason I had brought my gf here, for the oysters!  My gf did not make a scene (she is not the type to do that), but I could tell she was disappointed.  A waiter though noticed that disappointment and came to us with some home made bread and butter.  At first I was not impressed because it was just bread and butter, but once my gf and I tasted the bread our disappointment started to fade.  The disappointment completely faded when our main courses came out.  The ravioli was delicious and it was a moderate portion.  The duck though!  My goodness!!!  It was the best duck I have had and I am picky about my duck!  It was too good and it definitely put a smile on my girls' face.  After our meal was finished we began finishing off the bread and noticed that the waiter had forgot to serve us our wine.  Boo number two!  I asked the waitress for their wine list again and my girl noticed the second time around that one of her favorite white wines was available, the Riesling Kabinett.  That was not our original order so good thing the first order did not arrive.  We ordered two glasses of Riesling and the night turned beautiful filled with romantic flirty banter between a loving couple.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very calm, classy, and romantic as well to amplify the mood.   Overral my experience was filled with positives and negatives.  I give this a four star rating due to the duck, Riesling, and the fact that my gf was satisfied at the end of the night.  (TIPforYOU)  I suggest after eating to take a walk at the Brooklyn Bridge Park.  We walked around there at 11pm and we felt very safe despite it being late.  There were lots of other couples present enjoying the view of the Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, and the Manhattan Skyline at night.  The lights really set the mood ; )",4.0

"This restaurant was on my to-do list since it opened. The pictures of the ambiance looked amazing. The menu.. I couldn't wait! Tonight, I came with a girlfriend for a quick bite and a glass wine after picking up our bibs for Brooklyn Half. We asked for a table and were told that it would be 10-15 minutes wait. I was surprised, since I saw a table for 2 available. When I raised the question, the manager/hostess responded: It is available but you wouldn't get good service because we are at full capacity now. There are not enough waiters. What?! Not happy with the answer I said: what's the difference between sitting there (restaurant WITH a table available) or here (bar with a table available)?: Oh, the waiter is different. Ha!

"Wow! Went there after seeing the beautiful decor online and was really impressed. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, but the service and food really make it 5 star worthy. I went with a party of 4 guests and we had so much fun. Right when we were seated, the Sommelier came over and spoke to us about wine. We spoke for a little while and finally decided on a delicious (and very interesting) Greek wine; my friends were floored! The wine was so good and still within our budget. I ordered the duck - fantastic. One of my friend had the steak, and those potatoes were amazing. Finally, dessert. wow.

"Came here for lunch with coworkers. We had a reservation and were seated right away. When ordering, I was informed that they were out of the only vegetarian sandwich on the menu. Luckily I am pescetarian and got the halibut sandwich instead. Our group of about eight waited nearly an hour for our sandwiches, and everyone else received theirs at the same time. I was the only one that opted for the halibut and the waitstaff apparently forgot my order, so it took an extra ten minutes to come out. My boss was not happy and complained about the service. I didn't care so much but it is awkward when you have seven other people holding off eating to wait for one last person's order to come out. Speaking for myself, I was not particularly impressed by my meal and do not think it was worth the high price nor the long wait.

"I have eaten here a few times prior to today's experience and I would say the food has always been average to good. Service the first few times was good but the last time I dined here it felt as though the waitress was turned off by the fact we had a 2 year old toddler.  Not that we had any specific problems but her mannerisms were a bit robotic and awkward with the fact that we had a small child at the table.  It felt as if we annoyed her when we asked for extra napkins. But to be honest, if you are a restaurant in DUMBO, it would he expected to be somewhat child friendly. However my stars or lack of stars was really for today's experience.  2 DUMBO moms with 2 sleeping newborns in strollers wanting to grab lunch. From the minute we entered the restaurant the hostess (Leslie) had a frown and without even so much as a smile said that there was no way she could fit us anywhere due to the busy restaurant and even if we waited it would be over an hour. I asked if we could sit near the front or the bar area and leave the strollers near the wall. She said that won't work because it would block the path to other people sitting at the bar. At that moment a kind lady offered to move her seat so that we could sit in one area and have the strollers near us without blocking the path. She offered a couple times but the hostess (who obviously did not want to deal with us) ignored her. Finally the lady just got up and gave us her seat. So I asked the hostess if this arrangement would be OK. Leslie said yes, then followed to tell me that it probably still wouldn't work. So I asked her if it would be ok or not since I was getting a mixed message. She then flat out said ""No"" and then blamed me for being difficult when she was trying to accommodate us.  The job of a hostess in a customer service industry is to try and be accommodating if possible, and be kind even if you need to turn someone away. Leslie was neither. She was rude, and could not make up her mind about accommodating us. Then to make matters worse, she blamed us for being difficult. Needless to say we did not stay and will never patron this restaurant again. The lady who offered us the seat saw the rude exchange and left the restaurant as well. Want a tip?

The food is truly a fusion of American and French cuisine, decent portions and reasonable prices. Definitely would go back!",4.0
"My husband booked this for our anniversary. Seemed like a nice atmosphere at first, but it was unbearably freezing upstairs on one of the nicest evenings of the year. Service was inattentive at best. Appetizers were decent, nothing special. Was waiting to order wine but no one ever asked if we'd like anything else. Spaghetti I ordered was so boring I couldn't stand to have the night ruined any further, and we just took the food to go. No apologies or inquiries if everything was OK from the staff. Thanks for ruining our anniversary dinner.",1.0
"I dropped by at Atrium, because I wanted to have a solo drink at a classy place..right by the beautiful locale at DUMBO. Had visited to attend a book reading session at Powerhouse books with Rayya Elias and Elizabeth Gilbert. So I go in, seat myself at the bar and order a neat cocktail called Maple and Rye. The bartender was cool. He knew his drinks and gave me an excellent recommendation on my entree. The linguini with pork ragu. It was delicious. An inside secret, their mac and cheese is simply yum and is called a side, but is definitely a meal in itself! I also had wonderful conversation with a friend I made at the bar and the bartender. He was gracious enough to write down detailed instructions for me to find the high street station. Lets just say bkln isnt as straightforward as manhattan but its swell regardless!Definitely recommend this classy corner located at a spot with one of the prettiest views of the city.",4.0
"Beautiful in here!!  The food was great and the service was friendly and wonderful.  I would definitely come back.  The layout of the restaurant is well designed and I loved the details to lighting: hanging bulbs make you almost feel like you're outdoors in the summer time and have a nice romantic glow.  They also had little candles everywhere, which was so pretty - on each stair, on top of cabinets - it gave the restaurant a very warm feel.  My husband ordered the duck which was cooked perfectly - medium rare.  And I had a pasta dish with mushrooms - so good!",4.0
"Went today for brunch and left very disappointed.Service was slow and not attentive.We walked in and asked to be seated on an available table for two which was located underneath the vertical garden.

It took very long for it to arrive ( many people that arrived after us, got served before).Quality of the food was mediocre. The pancake were dry and hard, we left them in the plate (and so did the two tables next to us). The quinoa tagliatelle tasted fine except for the amount of butter they were literally swimming in it.The waiter did not even come by to ask how food was and realized something was wrong only after I explicitly said that the pancakes were dry while he was cleaning up our table (what kind of waiter does not ask if something is wrong after seeing that you did not eat anything)?Anyway, we definitely won't go back.",2.0

"I came here on a Friday night for drinks and small plates after reading about Atrium and glancing at their menu. I was particularly interested in the Olive Oil cocktail. It was not very crowded and my girlfriend and I grabbed a seat at the bar. She ordered the Peach & Passionfruit and I ordered the Olive Oil cocktail. The bartender told us they were out of the Olive Oil cocktail (bummer!), so I ordered the Raspberry & Balsamic instead. My drink took a little while to make and I got a nervous that the bartender needed to taste it 3-4 times before serving it to me. I am by no means a cocktail snob, but the Raspberry & Balsamic was not good. I don't think my drink tasted the way it was supposed to. I know they recently opened up, but their bartenders should have been trained to make the cocktails before testing them on customers. I think most people would agree that if you are going to spend $30 on two 4-5 oz cocktails, they better be good! The Peach & Passionfruit was good though, sweet and smokey and worthy of the price tag. We ordered oysters and the bartender said they didn't have oysters yet (and they might have them tomorrow), and promptly took away our menus. We may have ordered some different small plates, and definitely would have welcomed suggestions from the menu, but after the curt service we decided to leave after our drinks. And then it took 15 minutes to cash out even though nobody else was at the bar. Not a fan and won't be back, but I can't speak about the food because we didn't get to try any. I'm giving it two stars because the host was nice, the restaurant was very clean and had nice decor, and the proximity to the park is convenient. I'd recommend Hillside, reBar or Henry's End if you are in the area for drinks and small plates over Atrium.",2.0

"I took three out of town friends to Atrium last night. We were looking forward to a great meal in a beautifully designed restaurant. Unfortunately, this was a pricey and utterly underwhelming experience. Atrium can be summarized in four simple statements: 1. Food is mediocre, at best. 2. Place is ridiculously over-priced, even for NYC standards (they charge $3 for a piece of bread and butter to start off with. I'm surprised they don't charge for the tap water served). 3. Service is slow and not very attentive (waited 40 minutes for a table when we were told the wait was ""15 minutes""). 4. Staff was negative and rude. Do yourself and your wallet a favour and shy away from this establishment.",1.0

"I had dinner at Atrium Dumbo on Saturday night and it was one of the best NYC dining experiences I can remember. The spacious two-level dining room is complemented with soft string lights and beautiful plants. We began with the cheese board. Our server helped us make three selections to go with the potato bread. This cheese board was so delicious that we fought over every last bite, including the chutney. The mussel appetizer was also excellent and the portion was big enough that I had trouble finishing my steak, which was served with a twice-baked potato that I would come back for alone. The staff was welcoming, attentive, and discreet from start to finish and the wine service and perfect timing made for a memorable dining experience. I already have my meal picked out for my next visit, which will be the roasted chicken and another cheese plate (and this time I'll be getting my own!).",5.0
"Was super excited to try this place out based on the reviews but was extremely disappointed.  Bf made reservations for us on New Years Eve- which was even more of a let down since we felt like we really overpaid with the premium based on the day.It was a 5 course prix fixe menu.cocktail I had was nice- it was the one with egg in it. First course was a few different items but what really threw me off was they presented an oyster custard on a salt block but no one told us it was a block of pure salt. It was browned on top so it looked like a biscuit.  Needless to say, bf and I bit into it and we're immediately appalled since I just ate a block of salt!!!! Initially we were embarrassed to have made such a mistake but the 3 couples (all separate tables surrounding us) did the exact same thing and had the exact same reaction.  The servers should have done a better job informing us what items were on the plate.  Clearly this started the evening off on the wrong foot.Every course there after was the same unimpressing food.  It seemed like the chef literally just threw a random menu together.  Pickled items were too aggressively pickled,  the beginner salad was way too salty and vinegary- I couldn't even finish it.Scallops were the best and only good part of the meal.  Main entree was veal.  In fairness it has been a few years since I've had veal but I thought the wholePoint of a calf is that their meat is more tender, no??  It was alright but I've had better steak.On a positive, the servers were nice even if they did a poor job communicating the different dishes.  I would say management should've trained them better.On to the next one... Unfortunately I will not be back.",2.0
"Very hip and elegant restaurant...I live around the area and this is the best restaurant we have. The food is exquisite, definitively for anyone who enjoys food. The place is very cozy and welcoming and the chef really knows how to present his plates. I goggled chef Laurent Kalkotour and he is a star chef who have worked with famous chef Alain Ducasse and until recently worked at db bistro moderne with famous chef Daniel Boulud. It's a shame that db bistro moderne loss such a great chef but it's a win for us in Dumbo. It's definitively going to be the new favorite among the community. I just hope they open for brunch and lunch soon, can't wait for what delicious dish they will be offering",5.0
"i'd give it 3.5 stars for food and 4.5 for ambience and music, which was superb throughout the evening. we had some oysters and drinks to kick-off. the drinks, esp. the brooklynite, were really good. the bone marrow ravioli didnt quite make the cut. marrow is very delicate, but that subtlety was completely lost in the pillow. it just turned out to be a salt pasta substance. there were also too many flavours competing for attention on the plate, although the presentation itself was good. the duck mains were also good, but lacking depth of flavour. i also found the portion somewhat big: five big slices plus veg. (i think the main portions are generally too big in the us, but i know some disagee). our guest had linguini, which she didnt like and couldnt finish. we shared a bottle of american pinot noir (the hitch?), but it was too cheap and lacked complexity. i skipped dessert for a suprisingly decent espresso while our guest had something that reminded her of a frozen snickers bar. professional and friendly waitstaff. our meal came to 300 inc tip for 6 oysters, 2 drinks, 3x2 courses, 1 dessert, 1 bottle wine and 3 coffees. will probably come back for drinks and the soundtrack.",4.0
