"Coming off the amazing Traif experience we decided to give Xixa a try. Would give this place 4.5 stars (since Traif is a bit better in my opinion) but I'll round up.d9nt get me wrong, the food was amazing and I will be coming back, but it just does not beat Traif. However being able to get through the meal without unbuttoning my pants was a big plus. We got the chef's selection, which here is available to every party of 2 or larger. We decided . go for a ""adventurous"" option when given . choose and . Not regret it. We got about 8 dishes and 2 desserts to go with it. Everything was amazing except for the Foie Gras. Wasn't a huge fan of it at Traif, not a big fan here either. The taste is a bit stale and the toast it is served on was too sweet. But one dish does not a meal make.The two highlights of the meal for me were the Bone Marrow and the LA Familia Short rib which were absolutely amazing. If you come here you have to try them. They come with small tortillas and fixings so you can make your own little taco.If you love Traif you will be a big fan of Xixa as well. Two of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn by far.",5.0
"I don't think there is anything that I can say about Xixa that hasn't been said already, but this is far and away my favorite restaurant in Williamsburg (and maybe anywhere).I absolutely love small shared plates, as I am a sucker for trying a bit of everything, but it is often hard to find gluten free friendly spots that fit that bill. I came here with a large group for my birthday recently, and their chef's tasting menu was AMAZING, a fantastic value for the amount and quality of food, and they were able to happily accommodate my gluten free request. I was able to eat everything, and they had back-up options for anything that I couldn't eat.I don't even remember everything we ate, but there wasn't a single dish that I wouldn't want to eat again. Some highlights I do remember: guacamole, queso fundido, carrots elote, and th emake your own tacos were amazing as well Plus, their sangria was really incredible, it was fruity and strong, but didn't give me the instant sugar headache that most sangrias do.",5.0
"Beet tortilla's? I think? Who would have thought that they would taste so so so so good. Also, the short ribs were so tender, so juicy, they fell off the bone. I'd skip the carrots and the venison tartare was slightly under salted. Of the cocktails, I loved hibiscus pomengranate and the tomatillo limeade. Dessert wise, I'd suggest the churros and the ice-cream sundae. The service was excellent (too). My only small gripe was how loud it got at times. But all in all, this a solid restaurant. OH, I almost forgot, you absolutely, must, without a doubt, order the bone marrow.",4.0
This is my second time at xixa.. This place is unique. Both times I've been here have been outstanding.. We started with the spicy shrimp tostada which was flavorful and delicious and the sauce was amazing.. We got the seasonal guac with pomegranate and it was on another level. I'm actually going to start putting pomegranate in my guac from now on thanks to xixa.. Next we got the octopus with chorizo which was also memorable.. The octopus was so tender and the taste was great. Lastly we got the la familia short rib which was cooked to perfection and had the perfect combination of things to make the tacos with. Will be back soon.,5.0
"Hot damn that was an awesome meal. After searching through the various options that might accommodate a party of 7 at a time other than 5 pm or 10 pm, we were thrilled that Xixa was able to give us a table. Could they possibly match the great experience we had a Traif?  I'm delighted to say they did. In spades.We did the Chef's Table, a ridiculous bargain that would be a pity not to experience for the mere price of $50 per person. You just aren't going to get anything better, more varied, more interesting or more satisfying anywhere else for anything close to that price.The food was stellar. From the transcendent foie gras al pastor to the incredible rib tacos with all the trimmings and the carnitas, so savory; we were in heaven. The biggest surprise was the carrot dish - served a la mexican corn style, it was a revelation.Were there a few forgettable dishes and missteps? Of course. The fact that the bar only serves tequila or mezcal variations is a mistake. Some folks have an aversion to either or both and I don't think it would hurt to offer a little rum in the mix.  The glasses for water are far too small and that they don't leave bottles on the table makes it hard to stay hydrated with all that food coming on.  The service was a bit rushed - we were JUST starting a plate when the next would come. At one point, we had 3 courses at the same time on the table. We weren't terribly slow and it was overwhelming.  Several of the dishes should have been served with more tortillas, more chips, or were honestly just not that great. Hummus? I don't want hummus in a Mexican restaurant.  I also don't want that particular flan dish.  It was a lackluster end to the meal.All that said, we would return again and again, and even with the paragraph of missteps above, it still is in the top 3 Brooklyn spots we won't hesitate to recommend or revisit.  That Xixa is one hot number.",5.0
"Came here with a group of friends on a Saturday evening to celebrate a couple's recent marriage.The food was not as good as the last time I came, when it has less than 80 reviews, it feels like more Mexican now than before, most of dishes have tortillas served with Mexican style sauces. However, I appreciate the fact that the creativity is continuos and encouraging.My favorite is still pan seared foie gras, then comes pork belly, and the the special of the day ""garlic shrimp with sea urchin"", not able to taste the freshness and sweetness, however the shrimp with garlic sauce is good. The fish taco, spiced marrow, and carnitas were good too:)The waiter recommended another special to us, the beef ribs, however, it's too huge for 5 girls, I hope he could suggest something after we ordered 12 other small plates.The restaurant became really full after 7:30pm, so make sure to make your reservation ahead.If you drive, parking is not easy to find, my friends spent half an hour to get the spot, be prepared.",4.0
"Xixa is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Unquestionably great food, service, and experience. Everything on the menu is extremely thoughtful and well developed from the food to the drinks. They also offer a $50 ten course tasting menu with dishes based on your preferences. Simply superb.We started with the guacamole which came with five different types of chips including beet, plantain, and cheese chips amongst the group. I liked the creativity and the subtle uniqueness that each embodied. Let's not lie, guac and chips are all about the guac, and this guac did not disappoint. I'd put it on par with my own. It's as fresh as can be and perfectly seasoned. It was topped with  pomegranate seeds which made for an interesting juxtaposition of color and flavor.Next, we shared this extremely rich pozole. The pork was perfectly tender. The dish had a smokey flavor which was contrasted by fruitiness of the chunks of (I believe) pear. There was a deep sense of earthiness which was augmented by the beans. All of this dark brown homeyness was pleasantly garnished by cilantro and white sauce.For our main course, we had the short rib tacos. These were by far the most creative tacos I've ever had. I love using leftovers and supermarket specials to make unusual tacos. I have to admit, I have never reached the level of ingenuity these tacos exemplified. The dish was setup so that you construct your own taco. At first, I was put off that the dish cost $30; however, it was quickly justified when I saw an entire short rib plated. The short rib came straight off the bone; It pulled apart easily too. The fat and the lean parts married incredibly well. It was a fantastic cut. It was even chard perfectly. The burnt ends were some of the best I've had. It came with beet tortillas which were an interesting twist. There were still some chunks of beet in the tortillas which allowed their flavor to prevail. There was also a beet and corn salsa to make sure the hearty beets could stand with the dominant flavors of the short rib. To top it all off, the dish included another heaping of the delicious guacamole from our starter. Frankly, the ingredients came together to form some damn good tacos.We finished up with some churros for dessert. They came with a crabapple habanero sorbet and (I believe) a passion fruit sauce (though it was have been a grapefruit or another orange fruit with hints of bitterness and sourness). The sorbet was complex. My best analogy would be a dry and spicy red wine. It was an interesting contrast to the fruit dessert sauce which was sweet, sour, and creamy. The churro helped stretch across the array of flavors and textures; it brought vibrant cinnamon spice with abundant soothing sugar. The outside of the churro was crunchy while the inside was soft and airy. The flavor and texture profile of the dessert was expansive!I was impressed with how knowledgeable the staff was. Every employee was knowledgeable about the spice and flavor profile of dishes and was able to make prudent suggestions. The experience here is top notch. I found myself very satisfied after every course yet unable to turn away the following one.",5.0
"I've eaten at Xixa a number of times since it first opened and both the food and the service remain consistently excellent. It's clear that the staff is proud of the food they serve and are happy to give recommendations and let you know their personal favorites. And the kitchen and servers coordinate well on this front, as I'm not sure if we've had a meal here without being sent complimentary plates to try, especially if we had difficulty deciding between dishes when we ordered. And in each case we were grateful, because we definitely would've missed out on some truly excellent dishes had they not sent them our way. (Thanks, Xixa!)Sitting down for a meal here means having delicious and adventurous food served to you by a caring and attentive staff and always getting more than you expected.",5.0
"Before I write this review, let me preface by saying that I had second thoughts about doing this since I kind of want to keep Xixa the hidden gem Brooklyn that it is, lol.But now that I've been twice (once in October and once in January), I have to give them and Chef Jason Marcus the props they deserve.  Firstly, I can honestly say that I have had the best dining/service experiences at Xixa.  It might just be my favorite restaurant in all of nyc.  If you go, definitely get the chef's tasting menu, it'll be the best $50 you've ever spent (always, always get the foie as well as the tortilla-less soup, as a couple of your options).  If you're lucky enough, Chef Jason Marcus will be there to prepare your meal for you; the guy is an effing genius, haha.  Our meal was so good, none of our party of six wanted to go out after dinner and sully the night of dining we had just experienced.  I think the final/best quote of the night was, 'why would I want to go out and drink shitty well vodka and talk to strangers, after this??'Moving on, the deconstructed drinks... I really have no words for, they were all amazing.  It was incredible how the flavor of your drink changed as the 'ice cubes' melted.  If you're looking for a recommendation, get the iced tea (I forget the full name of the drink, but it definitely says iced tea).I would write more, but honestly, words do not do Xixa justice, just go there and you'll see.",5.0
"If there's one take-away from this review it's that you should stop reading now and make a reservation at Xixa regardless of any of my criticisms. You'll be blown away here by the same mastery of flavors and texture you've come to expect from sister spot Traif just a few doors down. Whether shunning kosher at Traif or embracing Mexican at Xixa, Chef Jason Marcus casts a large shadow over the Williamsburg culinary scene.Last year while ringing in another new year at Traif I wondered what might be happening at Xixa. This year Kim and I decided to break tradition. I don't regret it for a second, although, truth be told, New Year's Eve may not be the best time to truly experience any restaurant.Kim and I had reservations at the bar. We belly up and peruse drink and dinner menus. Our Bartender steers us in the right direction, and my Bourbon Tequila with Old Fashioned ice cube was my favorite cocktail of the year. I order another.""How much you wanna bet they don't know we're here for dinner,"" Kim says after about 40 minutes drinking.""They gotta know. We gave our name at the door. And we sent them an email with our La Famiglia choice last week.""""How much?""""Three dollars?""We shake on it.I order another Bourbon Tequila. ""And you guys know we're getting food, right?""""Oh, no. I thought you were just here for drinks.""I hand my girl three singles.After some apologies, the dishes come out quickly. Too quickly. Three right away, with loose explanations made in haste. I like to hear what's in each dish before I dig in. Managing my expectations is all part of service, if you ask me.We started with the Mexico City style sauteed Edamame with chili and jícama. Was it the best Edamame I've ever had? Sho 'nuff!! Should I have eaten it before the subtly flavored Mahi-Mahi? Probably not.I took a few breaths and dug into the Mahi-Mahi and the Guacamole dish. Delectable, soft and fresh. Peppers, hummus, vegetables, tortillas made of cheese, others made of corn, all competing for the spotlight. ""A first world problem,"" I thought to myself, dragging an index finger through that fiery Edamame sauce.Next up the Salmon Sopes. I don't normally dig salmon, but these were delicious. Not sure of the entire composition as they were placed down without much of an explanation. At this point they were still trying to catch us up. Delicious anyway, for sure, albiet something of a larger amuse-bouche. I could eat nine of them.The Foie Gras with Roasted Pineapple, torrejas, costeno honey, chipotle-pineapple reminded us why Jason should be Knighted. Even better than the amazing foie dish at Traif. I lifted the ingredients from their website because, again, I'm not sure that info was adequately conveyed.Half in the bag at this point, I had no idea what spices were in that Grilled Corn, but I knew I could sink my teeth into it forever. The Seafood Pozole with lobster and squid was also delicious, with a side of submersibles like crispy tortilla chips.When tortillas with dipping sauces and cheese hit the table, I wasn't sure if it was a stand alone dish or part of the La Famiglia tacos, the main dish of the night. As instructed, we emailed our choice of Confit Short Ribs a week in advance, though we were close to trying the Crispy Goat Neck.By now midnight had come and gone and many folks were leaving the place. I think we reminded one other person about the short ribs and they eventually made their way to the table. In retrospect, I think the previous plate may have been stand alone. I hope so, I ate most of it waiting for the short ribs.Kim and I looked at each other and pretended to type on the bartop, mimicking, as we sometimes do, asshole hipsters complaining on Yelp.When the confit short ribs finally arrived the heavens cracked open and blessed two foodie atheists at the bar. We cut into the super crispy surface, through an unctuous layer of fat, into succulent beef we then wrapped in soft (beet?) taco shells sprinkled with corn and lime. Of course, the sauces provided were worth bottling, just like those at Traif. It was the dictionary definition of umami. Halfway through we were so full we got the rest to go. It was excellent the next day, too.Two desserts followed. Nothing as earth shattering as some I've had on non-holidays at Traif, but sweet and delectable in their own right. A soft and luscious Strawberry Flan was followed by Churros with two dipping sauces, one citrus and the other a sinful dark chocolate. Scrummy.We paid the bill and lamented that restaurants are not at their very best on holidays. Balancing altered menus with with large crowds often results in sacrifices here and there. Yet, I don't see myself changing up this particular tradition, and in particular I can't wait to get back to Xixa on a boring weeknight when I'm more likely to get the full attention my fat ass desires.--------------------------------------Read the unedited review with pictures at jealousfoodies.com/xixa",4.0

"This place was very easy to miss. On the corner of 2 streets, the door blends so well because it is dark. Once inside, the place is dimly lit with some light to guide guests to their tables.The place had a nice selections of drinks, something for everyone. They had a wide array of different tequilas to choose from as well as some special virgin drinks. The food: We started off with the guacamole which was pretty good, but not mind blowing. It had a bunch of different ingredients like sunflower seeds, jalapenos, topped of with beautiful watermelon radishes. We went on with a shrimp crudo with winter citrus segments which was somewhat disappointing and just sounded more special that it was. The selections that did jump out at us were the duck tacos, the octopus and the cauliflower. Each of these dishes were packed with lots of flavor and we could not stop eating them until we finished everything. If you are feeling adventurous, definitely seek out this place for a try.",4.0
"I loved Xixa (pronounced Chicksa) so much that I visited twice in one week. And had the tasting menu twice.We were aiming for Traif which had over an hour wait and they told us to check out their sister restaurant down the street, which probably had some space at the bar to kill time. We grabbed some seats the the bartender immediately charmed us. She was so friendly and told us all about the restaurant and their food/drinks. The decor was really pretty, semi rustic with lots of wood but not overwhelming. And so we decided to avoid the wait and stay for dinner.We opted for the $50 tasting menu and they were nice enough to accommodate our food restrictions and limitations (ie no chicken liver please). Every single thing they brought out was out of this world amazing, from the sweet potato chips all the way to the churros with passion fruit. I especially loved the pulled duck salad wrap and the burrata with quince and cookies. The tostada was a pleasant surprise as well. We left stuffed at the brim and very satisfied by the impressive variety of food and deliciousness. Honestly, everything was amazing and how cool that we got two desserts to share!I will be back many a time because of this great restaurant experience, which doesn't come too often anymore.

Also had churros and chocolate lava cake for dessert- both excellent and quenched that sweet tooth. Thanks for a wonderful birthday Xixa- I highly recommend this to anyone !",4.0
"Food here was really surprising.For a party of 3 walking in weeknight, getting a table was pretty easy.Started off with drinks. I made mistake of getting the Sangrita drink. Spicy and tasted very watered down, not sweet. Attempt to add more agave syrup didn't help so luckily those unsatisfied were able to order another drink.I got the fresh juice variety (Pineapple-something).

"Traif, Xixa's sister restaurant, is my favorite restaurant in NYC. I had high expectations for this restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. We found a shard of sharp plastic in our sangria, which would have been super detrimental had my husband swallowed it. It was a super dangerous situation, and they still charged us for it. I felt like they should have taken it off our bill. As for the food, it was hit or miss. I'd say half of the items on our pre fixe menu was great, the other half was more experimental on the restaurant's part and I didn't really like them.",2.0
"Few places offer food quite as imaginative and surprisingly complex in flavor as Xixa. I first heard about it from a friend who knows how much I love tequila/mezcal based drinks. For those who enjoy the pure smoke flavor of Mezcal, I recommend trying their ""old fashioned"" deconstructed cocktail with your choice of mezcal. Each sip is a new experience, as the ice cube melts into your shot of mezcal. I was here recently for a birthday party where we ordered a variety of tapas. We had a wide range of eaters: gluten free, vegetarian, try-everything, etc. and everyone had a great time. I especially recommend the queso fundido with chorizo, the duck lettuce wraps, and the chilaquiles. The service is very attentive and responsive to any/all requests and questions you might have. They are especially good at describing the intriguing cocktail offerings and encouraging you to try things you may not have noticed on the menu. Take their advice, it's all very good.",5.0
If you're eating at xixa then I highly recommend going all in with the tasting menu for only $50. You get to try a variety of different dishes for a very cheap price. When we dined we opted to add a supplement of goat neck for $20. This was in my opinion the best decision of the night and my favorite dish. I only wish the dish had come out earlier as our table was too full to really enjoy it. They have an interesting forward thinking drink menu. When we dined our group had mixed feelings about it. So just be warned if you're looking for a vodka or scotch that xixa won't serve it to you. Their wine selection was really good and bottles were also reasonably priced. Xixa would be great for any special occasion as the food is great and the service was fantastic. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other options. When visiting I would definitely recommend grabbing a reservation as the location is small.,4.0
"Suggestion: go with a small party ~2-3 peepsWent in with 4 other people about 1.5 years ago and the food was really good! Since it's been so long, I can only say what I remember. The tapas were delicious and the drinks were interesting. We chose the tapas option and was charged per person. According to one of our friend who ate there before, the amount of tapas we received was pretty much the same compared to when she went with one other person. Therefore I felt like we were on the short end of the stick since 5 people got the same amount of food as 2 people. We didn't leave hungry at least.  Some highlights were the mexican chocolate dessert, foie gras over a soaked corn cake, and bone marrow. The ice ball alcoholic drinks were strong and interesting. Beware that it takes quite awhile for it to melt. It's basically a big ball of flavored ice (possibly with alcohol) and a small shot of liquor in a big whiskey cup.

"Bad Jew Award goes to ME for bringing a goyishe date to a restaurant called ""shiksa"" and practically licking the pork belly off of the plate. Sorry, Creator, but it was so worth it. Date was gorgeous and food was outstanding!!! Echoing everybody else: do the tasting menu if you can. Standouts for me were the creamy, sweet/savory burrata and delectable pork belly. But really there were no misses. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious. The drinks menu is bananas but my advice would be to take your server's recommendations. They know their ish.

"This is my current favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. Traife (the sister restaurant),my number 2, seems to get all the love. But, in my humble opinion: Xixa is the star!The good: Our waitress Jennifer was a like a poet with her food descriptions. Very helpful in our decision making process. Her quick moves compensated very well for a lethargic bus boy.The Food; Delicious shared dishes. Tonight was the first time I had a dish I did not like but, my dinner companion adored it. Food & drink details written below. But overall, the food is delicious. Seriously, eat here!Reservations: unlike Traife you are more likely to be able to stroll in & get a table. The Bad; To be clear there were 2 bus boy. One was very clearly working hard, and the other was busy kind of slowly pacing back & forth empty-handed. Could not answer a question or bring water. But really no bad.Last night we had the Seared Scallops which came with this bright citrus elixir called Kosho. So yummy. The Foie Gras: we've had this several times, sometimes different, always amazing. Masa crusted soft shelled crabs: loved the brussels sprouts, Gucamole, aioli, & beet tortillas,  Lobster Pozole: not my favorite, i.e., my least favorite dish ever in my limited history with both Traife & Xixa. Very heavy, muddy flavor. Almost like a traditional mole. Served with some raw selections; onions, Brussel spouts, radish, avocado, & tortilla chips. They did not blend well. Raw brussel sprouts & onions, harsh & rough in a harsh mosaic of flavors.  I am not a fan of mole but if you like them then this is the dish for you. Thai Tea Flan with Coconut sorbet & cashews: So good. Wonderful, rich & creamy thai spiced flan with the taste of creamy coconut sorbet and bits of roasted cashew provide a periodic welcome crunch. Delicious.Last but not least; The Drinks! They have these housemade Fresca mixers that can be paired with tequila.  (FYI - They only have tequila or mezcal, you like bourbon; bourbon flavored tequila, gin; gin flavored tequila, etc.) We love the cucumber mint jalapeño  & the pomegranate cranberry habanero. Love! We added straight tequila  (you know to keep the fruits from spoiling) Both spicy & wonderful. The cucumber is more refreshing than sweet. Drunk & in love!",4.0

"Went to Xixa last night (3/13) - the decor is pleasant, as is the service. The cocktail ""cubes"" (basically a serving of tequila in a glass with an ice cube of sour mix, a cube of pomagranate puree, two small salt cubes, and an ice cube for the margarite) is a clever idea that does not work at all in practice - you'd have to wait like a half hour for the cubes to melt before you even really get a hint of margarita flavor. Ended up just drinking the mescal and sucking on the cubes. Stick to the regular cocktails.The food (small plates) is above average. Seasonal guacamole is good, and the added fruit (grapes, figs) add to the flavor, but the sunflower seeds weren't a particularly inspired addition. The carrots were well-prepared, with crema and studded with booby traps of hard coriander. Lamb meatballs was a pretty giant portion of very good meatballs with bread (I am a sucker for tons of bread, and Xixa basically gets an extra star just for being a heavy hand with bread and chips of many varieties), the burrata was a little tough (for burrata), but again, SO MUCH BREAD. The pork belly and cheek ""carnitas"" was a well-done version of the pretty vogue style of braising pork, shredding it, and reconstituting it into a brick that is going around small plates joints right now. I had no complaints with their take on it.I am not a big dessert person, but the little squares of fudge they gave with the check were a nice move.Basically, Xixa is an above average small plates joint with fair prices that tries that little bit extra to make it stand out from the tapas crowd. I'd go back.",4.0

He created our cocktails for us like he really knew us and it turned out great! The food was just amazing. This place is more of tapas so for 6 people, I believe we got 13 tapas and also dessert. The price was just right. I can't say it was cheap but it wasn't crazy expensive either. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5, if I could I would give 4.5 that no one checked in our winter coats. Our booth was tight as it was and our jackets made it worse, only to come to find out before we were leaving that they had a coat check in.

"When Traif opened, with its high price-point and deliberately provocative name, it came with a narrative. Was South Williamsburg ready for this type of place? Was it respective to waive a gentrification, porcine-eating flag so blatantly in the direction of the Hasidism on the other side of Broadway?With a few years distance, answers emerged - the inventive food, like the cinnamon-sugar ribs, justified the price point, and many other restaurants, boutiques and condo developments ensure this was place was no outlier. And a string of morally-abhorrent incidents in the Orthodox community, including discriminatory buses, divorce-seeking goon squads and sexual abuse cases, makes it much easier to not feel guilty about a very gentle joke inside a restaurant name.Xixa is a victory lap from the same team - more small plates, more silly Jewish-inspired names. But with concerns about the place asked and answered, Xixa came with much less hype than its predecessor. I'd loved the few meals at had at Traif, but let months and months pass by before heading to the restaurant. And seven months have passed from the meal to filing this review. How can quite well done, ambitious food be greeted with such a shrug?I think Xixa's cardinal mistake is mashing up two genres that will strike many at first blush as being as appealing as that pregnancy craving standby the pickle ice-cream. The main wrap on New York Mexican food is that chefs simultaneously flatten the cuisine with concessions to the American palate while making it too fussy. And there's no better way to make food simultaneously more American and fussy by turning it into ""small plates.""Xixa even had the bad fortune to arrive about two years ahead of several ambitious Mexican places - Mission Cantina, Empellon al Pastor - so couldn't even be ""on trend.""But whatever - past the think-pieces and concern with trends, a meal here (""we recommend ordering between two and three plates per person""; ""I'd be happy to help you assemble a meal if this is your first time dining with us"") is a solid experience. Our party of five - celebrating the imminent departure of a friend for London - didn't mean liberally spending and sampling from all over the extensive menu. It's been so long since the meal and the menu continues to rotate that it wouldn't be terribly useful to describe most of what we had, which included restaurant staples like the carrot elite and al pastor foie gras and other things long since departed from the menu. Needless to say, lingering over cocktails pushed the meal past three hours, and the place never was so full that anyone had to eat on a Friday night. Perhaps the other diners in this fair city realize that while you can get a decent meal here, the city's story is being written elsewhere.",3.0
"This place was fun but for the price we paid including a mandatory 20% gratuity came in just a bit under expectations. We had a party of 5 hungry people, got a corner booth that was bursting at the seams once we all got in.  Met some friends there and were advised not to go for the chefs recommendations, all dishes served are very tiny and we ended up ordering half the menu. Food was fresh but lacked the oomph.  The waitstaff were all friendly and nice, dishes small and very expensive. Basically all dishes are sides at $8-14 per side. Top dishes for me personally were carrots, Brussel sprouts, Cornish hen, fish tacos, and the blue crab tamale.Least favorite dishes were the foie gras, goats neck, calamari, and the most disappointing was the warm chocolate cake with tasteless almond crema. Cooked to order took too long, and was way overdone, had to chisel it off the dish that it was backed in and served in which was scolding hot, thanks to the waitresses warning I didn't loose a layer of skin. Top dishes: carrots, sangria, and shots of Tequila.Worst dishes, if that was even possible, most of the desserts.Solid 3.5 stars Keep living, keep eating",4.0

But with concerns about the place asked and answered, Xixa came with much less hype than its predecessor. I'd loved the few meals at had at Traif, but let months and months pass by before heading to the restaurant. And seven months have passed from the meal to filing this review. How can quite well done, ambitious food be greeted with such a shrug?I think Xixa's cardinal mistake is mashing up two genres that will strike many at first blush as being as appealing as that pregnancy craving standby the pickle ice-cream. The main wrap on New York Mexican food is that chefs simultaneously flatten the cuisine with concessions to the American palate while making it too fussy. And there's no better way to make food simultaneously more American and fussy by turning it into ""small plates.""Xixa even had the bad fortune to arrive about two years ahead of several ambitious Mexican places - Mission Cantina, Empellon al Pastor - so couldn't even be ""on trend.""But whatever - past the think-pieces and concern with trends, a meal here (""we recommend ordering between two and three plates per person""; ""I'd be happy to help you assemble a meal if this is your first time dining with us"") is a solid experience. Our party of five - celebrating the imminent departure of a friend for London - didn't mean liberally spending and sampling from all over the extensive menu. It's been so long since the meal and the menu continues to rotate that it wouldn't be terribly useful to describe most of what we had, which included restaurant staples like the carrot elite and al pastor foie gras and other things long since departed from the menu. Needless to say, lingering over cocktails pushed the meal past three hours, and the place never was so full that anyone had to eat on a Friday night. Perhaps the other diners in this fair city realize that while you can get a decent meal here, the city's story is being written elsewhere.",3.0
"This place was fun but for the price we paid including a mandatory 20% gratuity came in just a bit under expectations. We had a party of 5 hungry people, got a corner booth that was bursting at the seams once we all got in.  Met some friends there and were advised not to go for the chefs recommendations, all dishes served are very tiny and we ended up ordering half the menu. Food was fresh but lacked the oomph.  The waitstaff were all friendly and nice, dishes small and very expensive. Basically all dishes are sides at $8-14 per side. Top dishes for me personally were carrots, Brussel sprouts, Cornish hen, fish tacos, and the blue crab tamale.Least favorite dishes were the foie gras, goats neck, calamari, and the most disappointing was the warm chocolate cake with tasteless almond crema. Cooked to order took too long, and was way overdone, had to chisel it off the dish that it was backed in and served in which was scolding hot, thanks to the waitresses warning I didn't loose a layer of skin. Top dishes: carrots, sangria, and shots of Tequila.Worst dishes, if that was even possible, most of the desserts.Solid 3.5 stars Keep living, keep eating",4.0
This place supplied literally the best meal I've had in a very long time. Amazing. And it wasn't crowded at the time.,5.0
"I met my friend for dinner here on a Wednesday night. I arrived before him so while I waited at the bar, the super knowledgeable bartender went through the drink menu with me, explaining that all that drinks are tequila or mezcal-based. I ended up going with a (non-alcoholic) strawberry ginger lime agua fresca, which was spicy! A lot of the agua frescas had some kind of peppery spice to them, such as jalapeno or habanero. As for the food, our dinner started off some chips and salsa for the table. The two of us ordered:1) Baked sea urchin, snow crab, truffle, mushrooms, masa cakes - This was SO good, like a cheesy dip with mushroom and sea urchin. The masa cakes were delicious.2) Fall guacamole, avocado, butternut squash, pomegranate, clementine - Tasted like normal guac with but a fresher, zingier taste from the clementine. It came with three types of chips: tortilla, parmesan, and plantain.3) Spicy shrimp tostada, sriracha, nori, shiso, scallion, sesame sikil pak - Also pretty good, though a bit mayo-y.4) Baby back berkshire black mole bbq pork ribs, peanut, sesame, chocolate- I thought these were just ok, though I don't usually like ribs so take that with a grain of salt.5) Garlic-butter octopus, italian sausage, fideus, bacon vodka sauce - Bite-size pieces of octopus in that sauce = amazing.6) Steak tacos, roasted bone marrow, brisket deshebrada, chilmole tortillas - Came with two sauces: tomatilla hot sauce and chipotle aioli. The bone marrow came in this ginormous bone but there was very little marrow actually in it. 7) Banana tres leches cake- Moist and sweet like banana pudding, and served with spicy chai ice cream on the side. Eating this was akin to having died and gone to dessert heaven, it was that good.Dinner ended with two chocolates, which was a nice touch. Overall our dinner was great, though the pacing of the food was a bit slow.I have to give major props to Xixa's quality of service - everyone there was SO nice. It happened to be pouring rain when we left the restaurant, so the bartender offered to call a cab for us. We decided to just wait it out, so our server came over to us as we were waiting by the door and asked if we wanted an umbrella that someone had left behind... turns out it was broken (lol) but it's the thought that counts!",5.0
"Xixa was fine, but I don't think it lives up to the raving yelp reviews. We had some interesting and creative dishes (most of them in a good way) but none of them were so amazing individually that I'll be dreaming of coming back for them. The food also did not strike me as traditional Mexican, but I may just not know enough about it - I would have described it as Mexican-inspired tapas. The kicker was that my two friends each had 2 margaritas, and they are both lightweights, and they felt literally no buzz at all... which seems to imply that there was very little tequila in them. Who knows, maybe it was just all the food soaking up the alcohol. Overall our experience was good and I would come back with someone else who wanted to go but would probably not suggest this place myself with the vast array of options in New York.",3.0
"Third or fourth time coming to Xixa but the last was definitely the charmed one, especially because the company was not a picky eater.

The cocktails were strong and tasty, the service was very nice, a bit rushed since I went around 10pm, but it didn't matter. The waiter remembered me from my previous visit and was friendly. Who doesn't like to be remembered at a favored spot.",4.0
"Went with a few friends 2-3 weeks ago.  The restaurant is hard to find, once inside the ambiance/decor is great.  The food is delicious but the portions are small.  I get its tapas style but give us some more of that good food!  Our waitress was a little forgetful but nothing that ruined the experience for me.  I might give it another shot, with a smaller group so I can hoard more of the food for myself.",4.0
"Xixa is probably my favorite restaurant in NYC. Having moved to brooklyn from the borderland, I occasionally find myself craving a taste of my home culture. As great as New York is for being able to taste the world, the City, perhaps more than any other major city in America, suffers from something of a dearth of great authentic Mexican food (perhaps having to do the relative invisibility of Mexicans amid the great preponderance of other sorts of Latinos here). Ironically, the best Mexican food that I've had in new York has been served by the hipsters at Xixa. Far too often Mexican food, for the American palate, just means simply tacos, burritos,  salsa, and whatever else our corporate masters at Taco Bell and Chipotle have trained us to recognize as everything Mexican food can and should be. When, in reality, Mexico boasts an extensive tradition of fine cuisine that just gets swept under the rug. It's as if we took the Sonic menu and assumed it to be exemplary of everything American food has to offer. For that reason, I'm tremendously grateful to Xixa for giving the hip brooklyn foodie community a real taste of my culture that they might have never otherwise encountered.  The beautifully plated small portions bare little resemblences to the heaping platters overflowing with melted cheese and sour cream that one might find at Paco's Greasy Spoon Cantina or whatever, but the flavors are all always right on point and authentically delicious; even when they experiment with uncoventional ingredients and exotic infusions,  they usually manage to stay true to the spirit of the dish they're trying to capture.Pretty much everything I've ever ordered at Xixa has been unbelievably delicious. Literally not a single bad dish, which is especially impressive considering we order around a dozen things each time. The menu seems to change daily, so you can count on every experience being truly unique. Standout items include the parmesean-dusted tostadas they serve with a bunch of dishes (best idea ever!); the ceviche (they always have some kind on the menu and it's always amazing and paired with some sort of quirky and inventive dipping device); the various ""fondues"" with chroizo -- queso fundido, as we call it (it's salty and greasy and decadent and they always manage to put a twist on what is a very comforting and nostalgic dish for me); the Mexico City-style edamame (an unconventional application of traditional Mexican chilli-lime that is seemingly simple yet devastatingly delicious. Have tried, unsuccessfully, to recreate it on several occasions) and the Pork Belly carnitas (Perfectly crispy exterior surrounding a juicy, fall-apart-tender interior -- the heavenly combination of textures should be a scientific impossibility,  but they manage to get it right every time. I don't even like pork belly!). I'm not a big drinker, but their ""deconstructed"" margaritas are very fun, interesting and delicious -- not to mention pretty! Everything here is highly instagram-able.Having eaten at the much-celebrated Traif next door (I understand that the same people are behind both restaurants), I have to say that for me, Xixa is by far the superior of the two. My three experiences at Xixa have all been vastly more enjoyable than my time at its overhyped sister-restaurant. Every time I've been to Xixa, even on a Friday night, the place has been quiet, spacious and generally pretty empty. Consequently, the service has always been friendly, helpful, and very attentive; and the atmosphere, despite the dim lighting and too-cool decor, has been warm and inviting (unlike at the bustling Traif, where our waitress, as seems all to common at hip and popular places like this, treated us more like a pestering annoyance than a valued guest). One time the chef even came out to our table personally greet us and bring us a free dessert! Usually an empty restaurant is a big red flag (In Xixa case I suspect that the seeming lack of customers might have something to do with the complete absence of the restaurant's name, menu, or any other indication that this might be a place of business from the streetfront or awning), but this is one secret I wouldn't mind staying hidden. As long as Traif stays as popular as it is, the owners will never be hurting for rent money and the good people at Xixa can keep having the freedom to do what they want and dreaming up amazing food.PS: Of special note is their super awesome restroom! The transition to it is super jarring compared to how dark and understated the rest of the decor is. I would not recommend wandering in their after drinking a lot of mezcal if you had never seen it before!",5.0
"This place is going down hill and it is a shame to see, since I used to love coming here, but now I think I will only be back for their edamame.I have been telling E that I prefer this restaurant more than Traif, because I tasted more exciting things here like my favourite are the edamame (I know, but they're the best thing ever - super well seasoned) and the grilled carrots ""elote,"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, dill. This time around the edamame were just as good as before, except on my birthday. Carrots failed this time around, it wasn't good and I felt like I am losing my credibility when restaurants are not consistent with their food.We got the tasting menu, and soon I regret it, because we weren't getting great food and E is probably wondering why is this place better than Traif.CHARRED octopus, pluots, asparagus, carrot-coriander, guajillo, spicy quinoa salad - this was good and refreshing.carnitas of pork belly & cheeks, Fava beans, black trumpets, pasilla-pulque-prune - the pork belly was a bit dry and it made it too heavy to eat.Braised duck lettuce wraps, mushrooms, picadillo, raisins, peanuts, roasted banana - goodfoie gras al pastor, roasted pineapple, torrejas, costeno honey, chipotle-pineapple - still my favourite, but last time the foie gras was really gamey during my birthday meal that people couldn't even eat it.scallop ceviche, tomatillo-habanero aguachile, hearts of palm, avocado, iced tomato - I really think they should take this off of the menu, the way the scallops are done, it's just not good. I miss the good charring of a well cooked scallop. This taste is just unsettling and it is just a waste to keep it around.We also got this chicken dish, it wasn't bad, but it didn't speak to me and thank god it wasn't dry.Then we had this other noodles with sausage dish that I have never had before, it looked like a hot mess, but it was decent.I need to remind myself to stick to the reconstructed cocktails, never get the de-constructed cocktails here, because E got the pomegranate and I got the cucumber, and jalapeno one and they both were disgusting. Seriously, my tasted like a green juice with no alcohol and so our second drink, E got the Blueberry Swizzle and I got the Watermelon margarita.They haven't been consistent with delivering out great food when I first came here back when they first opened - they should definitely fix this.",2.0

This place is absolutely amazing.  We went to Traif at first but didn't quite feel the vibe in there.  So we all got up to leave when the hostess asked us to walk a couple of steps down to their new sister restaurant named Xixa.  To our amazement it was exactly what we were looking for sorta old Hollywood glam.  Beautiful decor and ambience and to say the least the food was outstanding.  The owner also took the time to meet and greet you.  Wonderful place to go for a special occasion as well,5.0
"Amazing and creative drinks! & their food was delicious! Their basic drinks come with the main ingredients in ice cube format with a shot of choice tequilla. It's a neat idea because the drink is ever evolving, but also means the first sip is strong, but also means the last sips can be strong in terms of spices (aka the margarita). Their mixed drinks were great as well, and the food complemented well. The place can be easy to miss, but keep your eyes open and its a gem!",5.0

We had everything from bone marrow to lamb, to braised duck, charred octopus, carnitas of pork belly and cheeks, Grilled quail etc etc and everything was outstanding. The Carnitas were pretty exceptional and the lamb meatballs were incredibly delicious. We obviously got the famous cubed drinks. You do have to wait for them to melt or you cant entirely enjoy it if you try to drink it too soon. Overall an awesome experience.

"After hearing a ton of people tell me to try this place I finally went on Weds night .The place is a great space but  the booth is a little uncomfortable . 5 men from the UK don't want to be that close to each other and its a little stiff on the back .Now down to the food . We ordered the chefs tasting menu for 40 usd a head I honestly have no idea how many courses came out maybe 10 maybe 15 , there was 3 desert dishes alone,  but by the time we left there was not an inch of space in any ones belly .The food is good , I personally prefer La superior for traditional Mexican  but this is far more decadent than theirs.Stand outs were the shrimp with black seaweed buns , the scallops in sweet corn, crispy calamari and the sliders.The only disappointment was the grand finale with the ' chile bread pudding ' . It looked amazing like a crème Brule but something wasn't right . None of the table liked it.However the server refused to end it like this a brought out another dessert and rocked it . By this time I was in a food coma . Fairplay to that server though for going the extra mile .Seriously if you love Mexican with a twist and have the appetite of hippo this place is a winner .Next stop - its sister ' Traif' round the corner , but that's after a few weeks in the gym .",4.0
"Birthday dinner #3 with two of my best girlfriends and our better halves.Xixa is sister to Traif which is a few stores down. Their food menu was pretty long and I have to admit no one in my party looked at it. Coming in, we already knew we are getting their $40 tasting menu.We were seated in a booth as a Party of 6. That booth was so uncomfortable especially with the current weather. We wefe all wearung our winter coats and it felt like we couldnt move in there. Everyone was gettig a little irtitated. Great thing that the host offered to take all our coats and keep it somewhere. That would have been a disaster lol.We started the meal off with a bottle of Colombard. A toast to a great dinner ahead. I counted a total of 15 plates including 2 amuse bouche, 2 desserts and a plate of small chocolate squares. All that for $40??? Totally worth it!!!As each dish was brought to our table, the men exclaims ""oh, this by far is the best"". Lol. Funny how they kept on saying how Xixa was a great pick that night. Must've been the Colombard talking or the old fashion mezcal they each wefe drinking. LolStandouts of that night were the goat sliders and the carrots. The sliders hit that ""oh my this is good"" spot right on. And the carrots were unexpected. Sweet and just plain tasty.By plate #10, we were already expecting to get one dessert and be done with it. We were surprised that we actually still had more to come. ""How much is this again?"" Bill came out to $411 for 6 with a bottle of wine and 3 old fashion mezcals. And tax and tip. Not bad.",5.0
"I'm actually torn as to whether I prefer Traif over Xixa. I know they are different specialties, but the experience is equally ridiculous! I have to say that Xixa won on the drinks. I don't even like tequila and I was OBSESSED with their selections. To serve mixers in the form of ice cubes is 2 parts genius!

"I had such high expectations for Traif's little sister. I truly did. Perhaps too high. This is not at all to deter anyone from going to Xixa.  In their own way, it is very charming, service wonderful and their food is good, but to me, yes, it was only just okay. We opted for the chef's tasting menu, and I sat patiently oozing excitement and for every dish we were served, I was just a little disappointed and for every dish we awaited, I told myself ""the next one is going to be great!"" and it just never quite made it there. I am all for things fusion but there were just too many flavors going on that didn't quite pair well for my palate. There were some dishes that were good and I think if I were to go back, I would stick with their a la carte menu.",3.0
"What an incredible restaurant and not only was the food outstanding, our waiter Cal made our experience that much more incredible! He was so attentive and even over heard us talking that it was my birthday but we were to full for dessert and surprised us with churros and a candle! Made my day!! Each dish was more unique as they came out and the taste was perfection.  Thank you for a wonderful experience and we will for sure be back to eat soon!",5.0
"As a Traif fan, we were super excited to try out xixa on our visit to NYC. The new sister restaurant did not disappoint. We were seated in a nearly empty restaurant which was a bit concerning, but it was a holiday weekend and pretty early for New York standards.The food was all super delicious and the service was impeccable. Our dishes were well timed coming out of the kitchen. Our favorites were the scallops and chiliquilas. The rib was a great finale and big enough to feed our  party of four.",5.0
"i really like Xixa. even though its a little ways out for the Manhattan dweller, but so very worth it. I came here for dinner on a snowy evening with four of my guy friends and immediately there was a food frenzy because - boys. We had everything from bone marrow to lamb, to braised duck, charred octopus, carnitas of pork belly and cheeks, Grilled quail etc etc and everything was outstanding. The Carnitas were pretty exceptional and the lamb meatballs were incredibly delicious. We obviously got the famous cubed drinks. You do have to wait for them to melt or you cant entirely enjoy it if you try to drink it too soon. Overall an awesome experience. Wish they'd turn up the lights just a little bit in the place, it gets a little eerie. But the food is exceptional!",4.0
"After hearing a ton of people tell me to try this place I finally went on Weds night .The place is a great space but  the booth is a little uncomfortable . 5 men from the UK don't want to be that close to each other and its a little stiff on the back .Now down to the food . We ordered the chefs tasting menu for 40 usd a head I honestly have no idea how many courses came out maybe 10 maybe 15 , there was 3 desert dishes alone,  but by the time we left there was not an inch of space in any ones belly .The food is good , I personally prefer La superior for traditional Mexican  but this is far more decadent than theirs.Stand outs were the shrimp with black seaweed buns , the scallops in sweet corn, crispy calamari and the sliders.The only disappointment was the grand finale with the ' chile bread pudding ' . It looked amazing like a crème Brule but something wasn't right . None of the table liked it.However the server refused to end it like this a brought out another dessert and rocked it . By this time I was in a food coma . Fairplay to that server though for going the extra mile .Seriously if you love Mexican with a twist and have the appetite of hippo this place is a winner .Next stop - its sister ' Traif' round the corner , but that's after a few weeks in the gym .",4.0
"Birthday dinner #3 with two of my best girlfriends and our better halves.Xixa is sister to Traif which is a few stores down. Their food menu was pretty long and I have to admit no one in my party looked at it. Coming in, we already knew we are getting their $40 tasting menu.We were seated in a booth as a Party of 6. That booth was so uncomfortable especially with the current weather. We wefe all wearung our winter coats and it felt like we couldnt move in there. Everyone was gettig a little irtitated. Great thing that the host offered to take all our coats and keep it somewhere. That would have been a disaster lol.We started the meal off with a bottle of Colombard. A toast to a great dinner ahead. I counted a total of 15 plates including 2 amuse bouche, 2 desserts and a plate of small chocolate squares. All that for $40??? Totally worth it!!!As each dish was brought to our table, the men exclaims ""oh, this by far is the best"". Lol. Funny how they kept on saying how Xixa was a great pick that night. Must've been the Colombard talking or the old fashion mezcal they each wefe drinking. LolStandouts of that night were the goat sliders and the carrots. The sliders hit that ""oh my this is good"" spot right on. And the carrots were unexpected. Sweet and just plain tasty.By plate #10, we were already expecting to get one dessert and be done with it. We were surprised that we actually still had more to come. ""How much is this again?"" Bill came out to $411 for 6 with a bottle of wine and 3 old fashion mezcals. And tax and tip. Not bad.",5.0
"I'm actually torn as to whether I prefer Traif over Xixa. I know they are different specialties, but the experience is equally ridiculous! I have to say that Xixa won on the drinks. I don't even like tequila and I was OBSESSED with their selections. To serve mixers in the form of ice cubes is 2 parts genius! The food was amazing (small portions for the most part, but the flavors were spot-on). You can't go wrong with this restaurant. I cannot wait to come back!",5.0

"Valentine's surprise for the first time at XIXA, $65 a person on one of  the most expensive nights for dinning of the year.  Ambiance was fun and eclectic,  mixology creations and the use of tequila was brilliant!  But we didnt come for the bar! We were told that our 6-8 servings were a ""secret"" which was Ok, why then were we offered additional choices of entre? Let me tell you that we ordered the $20",4.0
Easily my favorite restaurant for multiple reasons.  The friendly atmosphere is just the tip of a very deep iceberg.  We have been numerous times and get great service.  my favorite thing to do is go with 3 or 4 people and try the Tasting Menu.  For the price it is by far the best way to take a trip around the Xixa globe.  Don't miss their unique cocktails - and I mean that in the most crafted and artistic way.,5.0
"So hopeful. I might have had better luck at Traif. I think the trick to this place is to order the right items OR have the right connections because we waiting a quite a bit between dishes. The couple next to us got their dishes one after another. That was not the case for us.They do have an incredibly extensive wine list. It's impressively thorough.The better dishes of the night:Beans and Rice- each bite was flavorful and I wished I had ordered two because the chorizo sausage was mouth wateringFried Brussel sprouts- there were fried soft shelled crabs which added to the crispiness Fundido of Taleggio and Chihuahua- good but extremely heavy Only order if you have at least 3 people present to help you consume it. The texture of the cheese was really cool. It was almost rubbery.Avoid:The bone marrow tacos. I like bone marrow but I feel like there should be something to help soak up the fat. In a corn tortilla, the fatty marrow just kind of slid into your mouth. :shudders:Scallop ceviche was okayyy. The flavors didn't marry together and I really think this dish was an afterthought.Foie Gras is a dish a typically love but I didn't love it here. It wasn't very good. The ratio of good dishes to bad is too low to recommend this place to a friend. If you love your wine- feel free to come here. Other than that, you might leave here disappointed because I had really high hopes for this place.",2.0
"Great deal if you're looking for a 10 course! This is Traif's sister restaurant, and it's just as good. I love love love Tapas! Traif is my top choice but Xixa is also great! Get the tasting menu for $40 per person. The foie gras al pastor and pineapple was one of my favorite dishes of the night. You're able to request a dish for the tasting.The rib, duck lettuce wrap, shrimp taco, were all one of my top choices. The edamame was GREAT too! Great snack, spicy and great flavor. The last dish we had was the octopus which I did not enjoy. They shouldn't have had that as the last dish! Other then that everything else was a win. We had two desserts as well. The carrot cake was amazing. I'm not a carrot cake fan either, but this carrot cake had me coming back for more. Our second dessert was some sort of green tea with coffee ice cream. At the end they also gave us all a piece of chocolate to finish the meal. Such a great deal for all this food, definitely can't get this within Manhattan.",4.0
"Erm. I feel bad for not liking this place as much as Traif. I'm rounding down from 3.5 stars. I made a reservation via phone about a week in advance for Saturday. Not too hard and based on the traffic at the entrance when we got there at 8, I definitely recommend reservations. Despite a res, we had to wait a bit for our table. Luckily, two seats opened at the bar. What I loved: - Very large wine menu- Very large food menu. Options are great, right?- Service wasn't bad. Our water glasses were constantly refilled as was our wine. They kept our bottle at the bar. Our table was kept fairly clean since it can only accommodate so much. Our last dish took a while and the busboy almost cleared our silverware. - Prices are reasonable. They recommend 6 dishes for 2 people. We ordered 7. I think everything was about $8-15/dish. See my pics. What I didn't love so much: - There are multiple seating options. We sat in the section between the bar and bathroom. Round tables are cuter than square tables, but the table is so tiny, it's hard to fit the plates! They are also easy to wobble.- Overall, I thought the dishes were either over sauced and/or over salted. It started with the amuse bouche which tasted like potato chips drenched in sweet BBQ sauce and sprinkled with cheese. What we ate (in order of what I loved to what I didn't love):- Corn flan tamale with crab. I loved this. Basically a corn pudding. Would eat this again.- Foie gras al pastor. I love seared foie gras and this was delicious. The torrejas and sweet notes of honey and pineapple were a good balance. There are two pieces so sharing is a must as it is rich. - Thai esquites salad. I love corn and the standard Mexican corn on the cob. I liked this. - Spicy shrimp gorditas. These were pretty small, but I liked them. I pretty much love most things with crispy rice.- Braised duck lettuce wraps. Not too bad. I liked the side of roasted banana. I didn't love this but didn't hate it.- Fried brussel sprouts. Eek. This was drenched in a sweet/spicy sauce. Do not recommend.- Charred octopus. Eek. Another drenched in sauce that masked the flavor. Do not recommend. Poor octopus.",3.0

"I have mixed feelings about Xixa. It had been on my 'to visit' list for months, and I was finally able to make it out there last week. I liked half of the food and not so much the other half. Service was pretty slow - I finished one drink about halfway through the meal and wanted another one, but our server never came back to check on us until the end of the meal. The drink though was pretty good - be warned that the only hard liquor they serve is tequila, but there are so many different choices of infusions that I'm sure you will find something you like. And this is coming from someone who didn't drink tequila for 12 years after a bad experience in college!On to the food, we ordered six small plates between two people at the suggestion of the server. Way too much food! I would recommend 2 per person - or maybe a total of 5 between two people if you're really hungry. We left there stuffed! Anyway, they give you about 3 chips as an amuse bouche for the table, which is a bit funny - might as well just not serve anything. For the rest of the meal, we ordered the following:Chicken sopes: I'm not a huge fan of liver, and this definitely tasted like and had the texture of liver. It was quite dry and didn't have much flavor.Lamb meatballs: Not my favorite. It was fairly dry, lacked flavor, and had a weird texture from the seeds or whatever the meat was mixed with.Bone marrow: This was interesting and surprisingly not too bad but sooo greasy! I definitely think I might have clogged some arteries with that one.Gnocchi with seafood (I can't remember if it was shrimp or scallops): Either way, it was quite good!Duck lettuce wraps: This was super yummy and a fairly large portion. The duck was really flavorful!Fricodilla: Tasty and a tad spicy, just how I like it, but, as our last dish, it was just a bit too much. We couldn't even finish it!Everything came with SO much bread - way too much. Anyway, as my review states, this place was A-OK. We did get yummy lil chocolates with our check. I probably won't be back, but I enjoyed my evening nonetheless. I just don't think I'm a fan - nothing really blew me away except for maybe the duck. I wish I hadn't been too full to try one of the desserts though.",3.0

"I love big sister, Traif, a few shops down so I decided to check out what little Xixa has to offer.  I really like the variety of tequilas and beers on the beverage menu because it had a little something for me and then a little something for my boyfriend. Another noteworthy part of our meal was definitely the panna cotta dessert with blackberry compote.  Then there were a series of flops.  The ""steak tacos"" tartare and bone marrow was difficult to eat, and everything had the same texture- which was blubbery and slimy (raw beef, fatty marrow).  The tortillas that this dish came with were thick and gummy; there was just no balance in terms of textures or flavors here.  The parade of heavy dishes continued to reign as we got the fundido which was super heavy and rich.  This was followed closely by the carrots elote, which were again blanketed by a thick, heavy crema and cheese.  I don't mind these dishes at all, but I just kept hoping the next item would be something bright and refreshing to cut through the grease and it never came. ((Some of the later entree dishes we had were the steak and a whole pheasant leg...)  We ended up leaving the restaurant feeling like beached whales, which is a sensation that should only be felt after eating at a Popeye's.All in all, I still can't give this establishment anything less than 3.5 stars for the quantity and quality of food it offers at such a reasonable price point in a trendy environment.  Sorry Xixa, major props for trying hard to impress, but I think you've got some growing up to do before you join big sis in the major leagues.",4.0
"So let me just begin by saying, I am new to reviewing places.. but I needed to let everyone know how amazing Xixa is.We had a pretty large party (7)  on Wednesday night and were quickly accommodated even after a few people in our party were late. The drinks were stellar, their ""cubes"" have such distinct aromas and tastes that it does not even feel like you are drinking something on the rocks.Since we were a party of 7 we ordered about 15 plates along with the 2/3 which were given to us as specials and the last two which were the desserts. Honestly, I was expecting them to be great but could not believe that I left the place loving each and every dish I had. The Spicy Shrimp Tostadas, Black Risotto with Scallops, and ""Frico Dilla"" had to be my favorites but god, was everything amazing.LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST,Regina our server made this experience literally the best I've ever had thus far (and I'm a big foodie) She was extremely helpful, friendly and knew how to explain the menu to us down to a ""tee"".We will for sure be coming back fairly soon.",5.0
"As widely known, Xixa is a sister restaurant of the extremely popular Traif. For those who don't know the chef/owner is Jewish and his wife is non-Jew or Xixa (pronounced as Shiksa) which is a continuation of his first restaurant name (Traif means non kosher food). Subtle dose of humor people!The owner/chef extended the small pates concept of Traif to Mexican food based on his travels abroad and this is how Xixa was born. The menu is created going from smallest plates to largest. I am not going to tell you what to order. I'll just say you should order evenly across the menu and have about 4 plates per person. The dishes are creative takes on Mexican/Latino stapes which a distinguishable chef's touch. Their drinks  superbly complement the dishes. They have frozen tequila cube with various additions in them. Interesting concept - definitely try those, especially the one with a pepper.Service is attentive and stuff is knowledgeable. You can probably score a seat at the bar without reservation but I do recommend calling in advance.",4.0

"Came here for our anniversary and was very disappointed. The only reason why I am giving this 2 stars is because the bartender was great as was their cool spin on cocktails.We ordered the ""Chefs Option"" I believe it was called. 7 courses of savory bites blah blah blah.We felt so incredibly rushed to eat because they just kept bringing the food out. There was a point where we had 4 separate dishes on the table and they didn't even think to themselves ""maybe we should slow this down?"". We didn't even get a chance to enjoy the food that was being served to us.Some courses were good, most left much to be desired.Then we received one of those ""Thanks for coming"" desserts  that were 2 small pieces of chocolate. I love when restaurants do this, but not when i still have 2 other plates of food on the table.Our waitress gave us the check, as we were still eating, and then took the check from us, as we were still eating.I also want to add that the restaurant was is no way busy. The bar was completely empty as were the tables in the front of the restaurant.We will not be dining here again.It's a shame, because I thought Traif was great and had high hopes for Xixa.",2.0
"After two incredible experiences at Traif, I was very excited to try their Mexican cousin down the street.  An 8:30 reservation was made for Friday and we were seated right away.  As soon as we sat down a bubbly waitress welcomed us and handed us the menu's.  She explained everything (lot's of crazy cocktails here) and the food menu and took our drink order.  She came back a couple minutes later and took our food order and said the drinks would be right out.  So far so good.  Turned out that the best service we received all night was the gentleman filling up our water.  Whenever I looked down, I had a full glass and didn't even notice him coming by to fill me up.  Had he been our waiter, we would have been much happier.15 minutes after placing our drink order we noticed that the people who sat next to us already got their drinks and they sat down about 5-10 minutes after us.  We ate a couple dishes, waited another 15 minutes and still didn't have our drinks.  They finally came after waiting a half hour but we received no apologies or acknowledgement from the waitress of the error.  About halfway through the meal, we were ready for another drink.  I asked the best server in the restaurant (the water boy) for the drink menu because our waitress was no where to be found.  We would have ordered another drink but by the time our waitress got to us, we were finishing up our last dish.  No thanks at this point.  I don't want to be waiting another half hour without any food to keep me busy.  As for the food, it was all pretty good, but nothing that wow'd, except the carrots.  The foie gras was pretty damn tasty as was the burrata but everything else was pretty unmemorable.  I would definitely get the carrots again.  Those were exceptional and maybe the best carrots I've ever had.  The food at Xixa was worthy of a return visit but the service was terrible.  Maybe we just got forgotten in the corner but the water boy didn't seem to forget!  I may come back to give it another try but I'll be going back to Traif before I do.",3.0
"Went here in the beginning of November -- Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had.My husband, a friend and I actually ate here by mistake. We had thought we had a reservation at the more well know sister restaurant, Traif. When we arrived at Traif, after having made reservations a month in advance, we were told we had reservations at Xixa (a restaurant we didn't even know existed). We were understandably pissed, but since a table at Traif was no longer possible, the maitre 'd gave us a free cocktail and then escorted us over to Xixa. By the end of our meal, we were so happy for the mix up that I wouldn't even fault the reservationist for the mistake. We got the chefs tasting menu -- 12 courses for $45pp. Incredible amount of food and SO GOOD. We all wanted to be rolled out of the restaurant we were so full by the end. We also all got their cocktails -- a very interested concoction that involves a cube of a cocktail with different liqueur of your choosing poured on top. The waitress also treated us all to a complimentary glass of champagne after finding out my husband and I were recently married. So sweet!After our first time there, we already have a second reservation to go back with 2 different friends. Very much looking forward to it!",5.0
"I love big sister, Traif, a few shops down so I decided to check out what little Xixa has to offer.  I really like the variety of tequilas and beers on the beverage menu because it had a little something for me and then a little something for my boyfriend. Another noteworthy part of our meal was definitely the panna cotta dessert with blackberry compote.  Then there were a series of flops.  The ""steak tacos"" tartare and bone marrow was difficult to eat, and everything had the same texture- which was blubbery and slimy (raw beef, fatty marrow).  The tortillas that this dish came with were thick and gummy; there was just no balance in terms of textures or flavors here.  The parade of heavy dishes continued to reign as we got the fundido which was super heavy and rich.  This was followed closely by the carrots elote, which were again blanketed by a thick, heavy crema and cheese.  I don't mind these dishes at all, but I just kept hoping the next item would be something bright and refreshing to cut through the grease and it never came. ((Some of the later entree dishes we had were the steak and a whole pheasant leg...)  We ended up leaving the restaurant feeling like beached whales, which is a sensation that should only be felt after eating at a Popeye's.All in all, I still can't give this establishment anything less than 3.5 stars for the quantity and quality of food it offers at such a reasonable price point in a trendy environment.  Sorry Xixa, major props for trying hard to impress, but I think you've got some growing up to do before you join big sis in the major leagues.",4.0
"So let me just begin by saying, I am new to reviewing places.. but I needed to let everyone know how amazing Xixa is.We had a pretty large party (7)  on Wednesday night and were quickly accommodated even after a few people in our party were late. The drinks were stellar, their ""cubes"" have such distinct aromas and tastes that it does not even feel like you are drinking something on the rocks.Since we were a party of 7 we ordered about 15 plates along with the 2/3 which were given to us as specials and the last two which were the desserts. Honestly, I was expecting them to be great but could not believe that I left the place loving each and every dish I had. The Spicy Shrimp Tostadas, Black Risotto with Scallops, and ""Frico Dilla"" had to be my favorites but god, was everything amazing.LAST BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST,Regina our server made this experience literally the best I've ever had thus far (and I'm a big foodie) She was extremely helpful, friendly and knew how to explain the menu to us down to a ""tee"".We will for sure be coming back fairly soon.",5.0
"As widely known, Xixa is a sister restaurant of the extremely popular Traif. For those who don't know the chef/owner is Jewish and his wife is non-Jew or Xixa (pronounced as Shiksa) which is a continuation of his first restaurant name (Traif means non kosher food). Subtle dose of humor people!The owner/chef extended the small pates concept of Traif to Mexican food based on his travels abroad and this is how Xixa was born. The menu is created going from smallest plates to largest. I am not going to tell you what to order. I'll just say you should order evenly across the menu and have about 4 plates per person. The dishes are creative takes on Mexican/Latino stapes which a distinguishable chef's touch. Their drinks  superbly complement the dishes. They have frozen tequila cube with various additions in them. Interesting concept - definitely try those, especially the one with a pepper.Service is attentive and stuff is knowledgeable. You can probably score a seat at the bar without reservation but I do recommend calling in advance.",4.0
"You know, all the food was really, really good, but the service was weird. We tried the tasting menu and they never changed our flatware, only the plates. I would go back for the carrots!",4.0
"Xixa! pronounced like the Nepali word Shikshya :) What should I say?You must go, seriously just drop everything you are doing, even reading this review and run to Xixa now. This Mexican inspired gastronomical temple is outstanding. I cannot remember all of the dishes from the tasting menu, but we had that and it was excellent. We plan on trying their sister restaurant Traif down the block from Xixa next.",5.0
"Let's get straight to it. Brussel sprouts are a must. Sweet, crunchy perfection. Scallops with risotto were also a winner. Wish they had recommended a better wine. The beef rib loaf, we could've done without. Spicy tuna tostada wasn't anything special. Overall a good dining experience! Wouldn't mind coming back. I am curious to compare this place with Traif!",4.0
This restaurant is amazing! Consistently great food and vibe. Exceptional service. Very friendly. Innovative top quality dishes. Highly recommend this place.,5.0
"Came here for our anniversary and was very disappointed. The only reason why I am giving this 2 stars is because the bartender was great as was their cool spin on cocktails.We ordered the ""Chefs Option"" I believe it was called. 7 courses of savory bites blah blah blah.We felt so incredibly rushed to eat because they just kept bringing the food out. There was a point where we had 4 separate dishes on the table and they didn't even think to themselves ""maybe we should slow this down?"". We didn't even get a chance to enjoy the food that was being served to us.Some courses were good, most left much to be desired.Then we received one of those ""Thanks for coming"" desserts  that were 2 small pieces of chocolate. I love when restaurants do this, but not when i still have 2 other plates of food on the table.Our waitress gave us the check, as we were still eating, and then took the check from us, as we were still eating.I also want to add that the restaurant was is no way busy.

"Traif is the best restaurant in Williamsburg -- far more interesting than the other close contenders. Xixa, their Mexico City-themed offshoot, follows Traif's playbook of unusual, genre-bending takes on dishes, but focusing solely on Mexican rather than the wider-ranging Traif menu. If, conceptually, you like for chefs to take risks, to make dishes that aren't like what you're used to, you'll be drawn into Xixa's world, from the winter guacamole with butternut squash alongside the avocados to the garlic shrimp strewn across a halved bone, dripping marrow, to the use of ""cubes"" to flavor the cocktails. If you just want some tacos with the same ingredients that every taco place in New York uses, this neighborhood has plenty of that, and there's more BMW parking over in the direction of the Edge. Xixa's service style is casual and competent. The room, with its rope ceiling and considered artwork, is much prettier than Traif. There's really no reason it's an easier table to obtain than Traif, except that it's larger in size and less-hyped in the press. Highly recommended.",5.0
"Xixa has an awesome cocktail list that features many infused tequilas. I asked our awesome server, Allison, for the best way to enjoy the Thai Tea Tequila - she recommended having it on the rocks. Christine got the Apricot Tequila (90% sure...) with the Margarita Cubes - as they melt, they add complex flavors to the Tequila. AWESOME.The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. I didn't snap a photo of our seating, but the table we sat in was super comfortable - it allows you to relax as you're served dish after dish! I did notice that some of the stool seating looks uncomfortable. I'm not sure I'd want to be in a wrought iron stool - my butt would hurt!We requested the Chef's Tasting ($45 per person) - typically, you should have 3 or more people to do it, BUT our server was super awesome and let us do it just for 2! Get ready to be blown away by my description of our 13 (!!!) courses!Our first course was pickled veggies, light, crunchy and served with a tasty sauce. This was a great way to prepare our palates for the richer dishes to come.Our second course was a wonderfully spiced edamame.I loved it! I think it may have been grilled - it really changed my perception of the veggie from just having them steamed in Asian restaurants.Our third course was a ceviche course - it was phenomenal! The seafood (shrimp and Hamachi) were super fresh and complimented by the fruits and sauces.Our fourth course was duck lettuce wraps - I LOVED the duck but wasn't a huge fan of the banana on the side. This is my own issue as I'm not a fan of the flavor (unless it is in Banana Bread, I know. I'm weird).The fifth course was tempura fried Blowfish - it had a bone in it, so we ate around it like a rib. If you haven't had this, you must try it if you see it on a menu. The fish is moist, meaty and flaky - so good.Our sixth course was chicken wings - I totally forget the preparation. Can you blame me? At this point, it was all a delicious blur and had to keep track of (the menu updates a lot and I couldn't find all descriptions online). This was the least impressive dish. Still tasty, but not a knockout like the others.At this point, we needed a new beverage. We both got the Bourbon'd Tequila with Old Fashion Cubes. This was so tasty! I will warn you though, if you take your time on the drink (like we did), the last sip is very very aggressive (all the spices in the cube have melted, so the drink is highly seasoned).Course seven was a cheese fundido with parmesan chips and shisito peppers - what is there not to love about melted cheese?Course eight was one of the most adventurous. When you order the Chef's Tasting, you can specific your dietary needs (if you are a vegetarian, etc.) and what you don't like (we were open to bone marrow but didn't want organ meat). The flexibility makes it great to have a different experience each time you go (which I plan to do again!) This course was bone marrow with steak tartare. I've never had bone marrow before and it was lovely! If anything, it is very rich and reminds me of butter. The presentation was beautiful. If you are a vegetarian, it would be horrifying. #meatCourse nine was the highly Yelped! about carrots - they were unlike any carrots I've ever had. It was the combination of the cheeses and lime that really stood out. Delicious!Course ten was pork belly and pork cheeks. So delicious! The pork had great texture and taste. Absolutely lovely.Course eleven took us out of savory and into sweet! The churros were awesome and the sorbet served with them was spicy! I enjoyed this one, but not as much as the other dessert.Course twelve was a carrot tres leches cake with cumin (!!!) ice cream. This was incredible. I wish I could have another one right now. SO GOOD.Course thirteen was a nibble of almond brittle (I believe). The perfection conclusion!This restaurant is incredible. The value ($45 for 13 courses!) and quality of food (expensive ingredients!) is unmatched by any tasting menu I've done before - especially in New York City where prices can be very high! Also, the timing was perfect - all dishes arrived at an appropriate time and we didn't feel rushed. The temperature on the food was great - it was hot, so it wasn't sitting.

Xixa - you are almost as good as your bigger sister Traif. And almost as good is still a 5 star review in my book. Booths are small for a party of six but we managed to snuggle in quite comfortably. Thank you hippy servers for making our stay enjoyable. We opted for the tasting menu and it was the most bang for the buck. $40 for a million dishes. It was really about 15 I including the fancy chips and chili edamame. Goat sliders - one of the highlights of the night. The bread was so good and the goat was so tender and savory.Carrots - farmers market carrots. The fancy little seasonal carrots laid out with a blue cheese dressing. Very good. Duck wrapped lettuce was good. Okay.... I'm not going down this list for the rest of the 10 but you get the idea. Four words. Just go. Trust me.,5.0
"After a phenomenal meal at Traif several months back, it was only a matter of time before I made my way to its sister restaurant just down the block. There's a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about Xixa, apparent in just the restaurant's name (pronounced shik-sa). It is, as my Jewish coworkers would explain, what their grandmothers would call a non-Jewish girl that they brought to their families, and a humorous nod to the relationship between the two co-owners, Jason Marcus and Heather Heuser.Similar to Traif, Xixa offers a diverse kind of cuisine, difficult to capture in just one or even several recognizable genres. Where these two restaurants diverge, however, is in the way Xixa pulls in influences from Mexican, Spanish, and Latin American cuisine. Thankfully, they offer a tasting menu for parties of four or more, in which the chef has the freedom to send out plates at whim, a few of which are part of the regular menu as well as several off-menu creations. At at mere $40, this is quite the steal and is a great introduction to the food offered here.Almost everything that was brought to the table was tasty; this includes a fresh scallop ceviche dotted with mandarin oranges, jalapeno peppers, and lightly fried plantain chips; grilled hamachi collar that was served with plantain tortillas, brussels, and pickled onions; and a plate of perfectly cooked prawns that will require you to get your hands dirty. But the dishes that I can still remember to this day were:- Skirt Steak: Cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a side of red onions and corn, it was the romesco sauce that really brought out the flavor of this dish.- Brussel Sprouts: These are quite possibly the most delicious brussel sprouts I have yet to taste in NYC. They're doused in a spicy-sweet vin, lightly fried, and mixed with strawberries, currants, and sunflower seeds. They're crisp but not too crunchy, covering the spectrum of spicy to salty to sweet, and disappeared within seconds from our table.- Foie Gras Al Pastor: This was the first time I tried foie gras paired with fruit, and it was a combination that worked startlingly well. The foie gras is perfectly seared and tender, and the sweetness from the pineapple and torrejas (a Mexican version of the traditional French Toast) adds even more richness and dimension to each bite.- Churros: Served as the dessert at the end of our meal, they're warm, crisp on the outside, yet still somewhat doughy in the center. The best part was digging into the raspberry sorbet it came with and realizing that it had been made with a healthy dose of chilies in the mix as well.While I still believe that Traif delivered an overall better experience, Xixa is very much capable of standing by itself, showcasing a modern and creative take on Mexican cuisine. If possible, get a group of friends and make a reservation for the tasting menu - your taste buds will be in for quite the adventure.",4.0
"Obsessed. The tequila and mescal menu and inventive combinations alone will bring me back here in quick order. Add to that some of the best flavors in food I've ever tasted, and some I've never quite tasted before and loved, and you have one very happy Kate. A beautiful space to bring a date, your family, or yourself. Lighting, décor, service all impeccable, fun, and comfortable.The highlights of our meal were everything on the vegetable menu (think you've had edamame? you have not had edamame), the burrata, the carrots, the corn tom yum thing, and the ribs. The guacamole was great especially with the varied crunchy bits served to accompany it. But seriously, dem drinks. The pumpkin chai mescal is the best drink I've ever had. The idea of mixing flavored ice cubes (eg: 1 pomegranate, 1 lime, 2 small salt) with flavored tequila to make a cocktail that changes from bold liquor forward to smooth sipping over time was a game changer for me.

"I hate to rain on the parade here, but Xixa is as overrated as they come. From the moment I sat down at the bar and was attacked with hyper-friendliness by the bartender (w/ faux interest and a lazy smile: ""Is this your first time dining at Xixa?!""), I knew I was in for a blah experience. Before ordering, the bartender suggested we get at least 4 of the small dishes and one of the ""family"" style large dishes. (Slow down, girl!) We opted to start with three small dishes and then go from there. Suffice to say, we stopped after eating the following:Shrimp tostada: flavorless and uninspired. Fried oysters: Way too much breading. Carnitas: good, but far from transcendent.Three tapas-sized dishes, one very small shot of tequila and two bad beers, and we walked out still hungry, unhappy, and down 70+ bucks. Weak. It's not the portion size that matters, of course. We knew what we were getting into. It's that the flavors just weren't there. There was no love put into this food, and that's what you should be getting at these prices.One final note to the staff: Customers can tell when you're being insincere. A good server will be attentive without needing to hover. The forced friendliness is unnecessary and won't make me forget about the subpar food I'm being served.",2.0
"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in NYCWhen I try to describe it to people, the best I can do is, ""Okay... have you ever watched Iron Chef?  Yeah, expect dishes like that.""One thing I find amazing about Xixa is the price.  I mean, it's not cheap - but for the quality of food, it's a *ridiculous* value.  The tasting menu, which is portioned perfectly, is $45 / person.  I've eaten at restaurants that cost 6x that, and the quality hasn't even come close to Xixa.So what makes it amazing?  The ingredients are super-fresh, wonderful quality... but the artistry of how the flavors, textures etc. combine is unparalleled.  I can't possibly speak highly enough: this is art in the form of food.The menu changes constantly; the reprint it every day with rotating dishes and new concoctions.  However, some regulars that you *need* to try:Salmon Sashimi w/ Shirodashi (in whatever form they have it, if they have it)Grilled Carrots ""Elote""Foie Gras Al PastorCorn Flan ""Tamale"" (w/ Crab)Braised Duck Lettuce WrapsThat's the five that are unskippable.  Seriously.  They are orgasms in your mouth.I know how that sounds... but it's really, really true.  If you appreciate meals with intricate palates - or just enjoy having your senses played with in unique and powerful ways... you have to go here, and try these dishesSeriously, though - try the chef's tasting menu!  If you're super nice to the waitress, they might let you select a handful of dishes... so get the four regular I mentioned and let the chef choose the rest ^_^Oh, did I mention they're open until at *least* midnight every night?  And the music choices are always great?  And the ambiance is perfect?",5.0
"4.5 stars. I was here twice.The first time with three friends of mine, and ordered their tasting menu, mostly seafood. Although they bring you bites, we were served a total of 13 small dishes, and got up stuff. The $40 deal is absurdly good. Spicy edamame: very interesting. Duck: very good. Sea urchin with mushroom sauce: I'm not a fan of sea urchin, but this bite was heavenly. My favorite dish of the dinner. Pork belly: even people who don't appreciate pork belly will love this, because it's not too fatty, and deliciously crisp.Ceviche (can't remember which type): just a spoonful, but very good. Vegetarian melted cheese: I wish we had chosen the meat tasting menu, because it would have beautifully complemented this dish, which was great even by itself. Octopus: the sauce was tasty, but the octopus itself very bland. Brussel sprouts: awesome. They came in a sweet sauce with grapes and were truly memorable. Merluzzo fish (not sure) in white wine sauce: super flavorful. Loved the sauce so much I wanted to lick the dish. Fried fish: the weak dish of the dinner. The fish itself was too heavy and not particularly memorabl; and it made me a little nauseous. Churros: delicious. Pan con chile and chocolate: not my thing, but it's just a matter of taste. Many people don't like the combo of tastes, so maybe they should choose a different dessert. Spicy chocolate bites: the bite from God you want to have to end a dinner in style. Overall, an amazing deal. Not everything was delicious, but the price makes it for the imperfections. Totally worth another trip, also because the service was awesome, very professional, and the place itself is very cute. My second time was epic. My gf and I were served 15 dishes, this time meat-oriented: most of them were much bigger than just tastes.Chips with cheese and hot sauce: simple, but tasty. Shrimp ceviche: kinda tasteless. Gordita with goat meat: fabulous. Duck wrapped in lettuce: deliciuosFoie gras: unreal; truly memorable; never had anything like it. Lamb tongue: so tender it could melt in your mouth. Meatballs: yummy. Corn soup: ok. Sweetbreads: together with the ceviche, the only dish that wasn't up to the level of everything else. Octopus: very tasty. Braised short rib: amazingly soft, and wonderfully complemented by the tortilla-based spread. Pork belly: fantabulous. flan with raspberry sauce: the perfect dessert to change and revive the palate; delicate, light and refreshing. Churros: fluffy and perfectly fried. Chile chocolate: great closure to an outstanding meal. We were absolutely stuffed, but as happy as we could be. Unbelievable value, especially because of the variety of meats, many of which really exotic. I can't wait to go back for more. This place is real! :)",4.0
"Big sister Traif sets the bar WAY too high. XIXA is a Junior in College while Traif is just about to complete her second PhD! However, she will soon catch up without a doubt. So I'm going to start with 4 stars because I will go back soon enough ready to have more on the menu and upgrade to 5.I didn't get to try the tasting menu this time. It was more of an experiment because I could convince people from far off places in the tri-state to make the journey. The menu is vast and exciting. It took me a good 5 minutes to wrap my head around all the dishes. Since it was the first time I asked Sam to recommend her favs. I started with a ceviche, then the duck lettuce wraps, pork belly and the grand finale was the foie gras al pastor. All of them were super delicious and around mid range on the i'm stuffed scale. The idea was to eat a few dishes so they had to be light enough. All in all a great selection. The decor modern and trendy and just to my liking. It's a great idea to come early if you don't have a reservation since it gets crowded as the evening gets on.So check back with my update.",4.0

"The food here is exceptional but don't try to go at 8 pm on a Friday night. Apparently you won't even be able to ask how long the wait is bc right before you walk in a party of 8 fat middle aged women wearing plastic tiaras will waddle out of a white limo that would put Liberace to shame and crowd the entrance with their loudness, just raving about this doctor on the upper east side who's apparently fabulous and can take your tummy fat and inject it in more your lips, cheeks and butt. That said, I've been here before on a weeknight and had an excellent experience.",4.0
"I would follow Jason and Heather to The Ends of the Earth, if that's where they decided to place their next restaurant. I'd probably prefer somewhere in South Brooklyn, but I really am willing to travel because both of their current spots have taken up firm residence atop my list of favorite restaurants.The brand-new Xixa is Traif's sexy sister, and although I don't want to have to choose between them, I must admit I am partial to the ladies. This gorgeous female is ethnically ambiguous; mostly Mexican, to be sure, but there is a cosmopolitan air about her that makes her irresistible. (A Xixappeal, if you will.) Wherever her flavors hail from, the food is fantastic.We've had at least 10 different dishes, and I haven't had a bad bite. That said, I do find myself partial to a few favorites thus far:The grilled carrot ""elote"" is absolute insanity. With honey butter, a lime crema and little bits of dill floating about, it is not just the best vegetable dish I've ever had, it is up there with the best anything I've ever had. That includes meat, people. Rivaling the carrots are the Thai esquites with sweet corn and cotija cheese. At the bottom of this small bowl is a tom yum broth, and I mean tom fucking YUM.* I drank it, shamelessly.If you like eating food that will make you hate all other food for its blatant inferiority, get the corn flan tamale. Spread with a garlic-poblano cream (that tastes better even than a garlic-poblano cream sounds) and stacked with blue crab, it's warm and comforting and ARGH...I'm getting actually angry that I'm not eating it at this moment. And of course, the foie gras al pastor. Al pastor is my taco of choice, and there was never a chance that I'd pass this up. Ancho honey? Roasted pineapple perfection? I don't even know what torrejas** are, I just know that I dream about this dish. It is an elevated al pastor; as pretty a plate as can be, and one I have no problem destroying for my own hedonistic desires.Essentially, the entire menu is mouthwatering. Each item has a slew of ingredients (how do they fit them all in the kitchen?), with at least a couple you might not recognize. Don't be scared. Chef Jason Marcus has a way of blending flavors together in ways you never considered. Even if you don't like a component on its own, chances are you'll love the dish as a whole. If you wish to indulge in adult beverages as you dine, there is a comprehensive wine list arranged by the lovely lady they most resemble (e.g. Marilyn Monroe) along with a description of how they correlate (e.g. schizophrenic wines fall under our old friend, Courtney Love). For something heavier, there is an excellent selection of tequilas, mezcals and housemade baconara (bartender Randy infuses things like a champ). And although I do wish they had a cocktail or two, I must admit that I love the Banderas. These are pours of your spirit of choice bookended by a tart lemony liquid and a pomegranate chile arbol chaser that has excellent heat. Whether or not you drink, I insist you finish your meal off with the salty churros which, and I am not exaggerating, are the best churros that ever existed. This cinnamony, crispy fried dough is so delectable that the last time I saw the churro lady on the subway platform I was forced to spit in her face. I didn't want to; she's perfectly sweet (and was quite confused)...but it was necessary.Such is the danger of eating food this good. ___________*Please excuse the profanity, but I don't know if without it I can convey the true love and admiration I have for this dish.**OK, I just looked it up. Turns out they are like Mexican French toast. And how could that be bad.",5.0
"Decided to try this place out on my first night out in Brooklyn. Service was great, ambiance is nice, it was around 10pm so there was some hip hop playing in the background. Tried a Watermelon cocktail that was really good.  The Corn Elotes is to die for. Corn on the cob with Buffalo sauce and cheese. Yum. Excellent prices as a similar meal in Manhattan would cost way more.  Will definitely come back",5.0
"Attempted to go to Traif last Friday on a date but was informed it would be a three hour wait. Have they read my review? I synced it with classic music from The Sound of Music. Where is the appreciation in the world today? So we decided to hit up Traif's sister restaurant Xixa. I've heard great things about it and the place was recommended, so I wasn't really bummed. They took us immediately and we sat down, which was the most part of the night. SITTING DOWN. Who selected these chairs? I felt forced to either lean all the way forward or lean back as some proud king in a thrown, putting his arms on the rests. Not really good for dinner conversation. They have a $40 dollar tasting menu which I highly recommend. The first few plates were alright, nothing great which for Traif's sister restaurant is kind of disappointing. I even mentioned to my date how I wasn't really thrilled with the experience so far but then the show began.  Lamb meatballs over black beans and pasta. Lettuce wrapped duck. Beef tartare tacos with cilantro and bone marrow! Shrimp in a spicy sauces and peppers. WOW. Then came desert. When you combine chocolate and bananas you already won my heart, make it into ice cream and I might propose. Jason marry me! (That's the chef ::wink wink::) Churros with a dipping sauce and raspberry jalapeno sorbet, is this man high when he comes up with these ideas? If so I will gladly fund his addictions. Not sure how this is Mexican in any way shape or form but it's delicious. So if you want to try another amazing tapas restaurant hit up Xixa. Just sit in the back. Those damn chairs ruined everything!",4.0

Although they bring you bites, we were served a total of 13 small dishes, and got up stuff. The $40 deal is absurdly good. Spicy edamame: very interesting. Duck: very good. Sea urchin with mushroom sauce: I'm not a fan of sea urchin, but this bite was heavenly. My favorite dish of the dinner. Pork belly: even people who don't appreciate pork belly will love this, because it's not too fatty, and deliciously crisp.Ceviche (can't remember which type): just a spoonful, but very good. Vegetarian melted cheese: I wish we had chosen the meat tasting menu, because it would have beautifully complemented this dish, which was great even by itself. Octopus: the sauce was tasty, but the octopus itself very bland. Brussel sprouts: awesome. They came in a sweet sauce with grapes and were truly memorable. Merluzzo fish (not sure) in white wine sauce: super flavorful. Loved the sauce so much I wanted to lick the dish. Fried fish: the weak dish of the dinner. The fish itself was too heavy and not particularly memorabl; and it made me a little nauseous. Churros: delicious. Pan con chile and chocolate: not my thing, but it's just a matter of taste. Many people don't like the combo of tastes, so maybe they should choose a different dessert. Spicy chocolate bites: the bite from God you want to have to end a dinner in style. Overall, an amazing deal. Not everything was delicious, but the price makes it for the imperfections. Totally worth another trip, also because the service was awesome, very professional, and the place itself is very cute. My second time was epic. My gf and I were served 15 dishes, this time meat-oriented: most of them were much bigger than just tastes.Chips with cheese and hot sauce: simple, but tasty. Shrimp ceviche: kinda tasteless. Gordita with goat meat: fabulous. Duck wrapped in lettuce: deliciuosFoie gras: unreal; truly memorable; never had anything like it. Lamb tongue: so tender it could melt in your mouth. Meatballs: yummy. Corn soup: ok. Sweetbreads: together with the ceviche, the only dish that wasn't up to the level of everything else. Octopus: very tasty. Braised short rib: amazingly soft, and wonderfully complemented by the tortilla-based spread. Pork belly: fantabulous. flan with raspberry sauce: the perfect dessert to change and revive the palate; delicate, light and refreshing. Churros: fluffy and perfectly fried. Chile chocolate: great closure to an outstanding meal. We were absolutely stuffed, but as happy as we could be. Unbelievable value, especially because of the variety of meats, many of which really exotic. I can't wait to go back for more. This place is real! :)",4.0
"Big sister Traif sets the bar WAY too high. XIXA is a Junior in College while Traif is just about to complete her second PhD! However, she will soon catch up without a doubt. So I'm going to start with 4 stars because I will go back soon enough ready to have more on the menu and upgrade to 5.I didn't get to try the tasting menu this time. It was more of an experiment because I could convince people from far off places in the tri-state to make the journey. The menu is vast and exciting. It took me a good 5 minutes to wrap my head around all the dishes. Since it was the first time I asked Sam to recommend her favs. I started with a ceviche, then the duck lettuce wraps, pork belly and the grand finale was the foie gras al pastor. All of them were super delicious and around mid range on the i'm stuffed scale. The idea was to eat a few dishes so they had to be light enough. All in all a great selection. The decor modern and trendy and just to my liking. It's a great idea to come early if you don't have a reservation since it gets crowded as the evening gets on.So check back with my update.",4.0
Sister restaurant to Traif with a Mexican flair. Deeeelicious food. I might slightly prefer Traif but great alternative and creative drinks.,5.0
"The food here is exceptional but don't try to go at 8 pm on a Friday night. Apparently you won't even be able to ask how long the wait is bc right before you walk in a party of 8 fat middle aged women wearing plastic tiaras will waddle out of a white limo that would put Liberace to shame and crowd the entrance with their loudness, just raving about this doctor on the upper east side who's apparently fabulous and can take your tummy fat and inject it in more your lips, cheeks and butt. That said, I've been here before on a weeknight and had an excellent experience.",4.0
"I would follow Jason and Heather to The Ends of the Earth, if that's where they decided to place their next restaurant. I'd probably prefer somewhere in South Brooklyn, but I really am willing to travel because both of their current spots have taken up firm residence atop my list of favorite restaurants.The brand-new Xixa is Traif's sexy sister, and although I don't want to have to choose between them, I must admit I am partial to the ladies. This gorgeous female is ethnically ambiguous; mostly Mexican, to be sure, but there is a cosmopolitan air about her that makes her irresistible. (A Xixappeal, if you will.) Wherever her flavors hail from, the food is fantastic.We've had at least 10 different dishes, and I haven't had a bad bite. That said, I do find myself partial to a few favorites thus far:The grilled carrot ""elote"" is absolute insanity. With honey butter, a lime crema and little bits of dill floating about, it is not just the best vegetable dish I've ever had, it is up there with the best anything I've ever had. That includes meat, people. Rivaling the carrots are the Thai esquites with sweet corn and cotija cheese. At the bottom of this small bowl is a tom yum broth, and I mean tom fucking YUM.* I drank it, shamelessly.If you like eating food that will make you hate all other food for its blatant inferiority, get the corn flan tamale. Spread with a garlic-poblano cream (that tastes better even than a garlic-poblano cream sounds) and stacked with blue crab, it's warm and comforting and ARGH...I'm getting actually angry that I'm not eating it at this moment. And of course, the foie gras al pastor. Al pastor is my taco of choice, and there was never a chance that I'd pass this up. Ancho honey? Roasted pineapple perfection? I don't even know what torrejas** are, I just know that I dream about this dish. It is an elevated al pastor; as pretty a plate as can be, and one I have no problem destroying for my own hedonistic desires.Essentially, the entire menu is mouthwatering. Each item has a slew of ingredients (how do they fit them all in the kitchen?), with at least a couple you might not recognize. Don't be scared. Chef Jason Marcus has a way of blending flavors together in ways you never considered. Even if you don't like a component on its own, chances are you'll love the dish as a whole. If you wish to indulge in adult beverages as you dine, there is a comprehensive wine list arranged by the lovely lady they most resemble (e.g. Marilyn Monroe) along with a description of how they correlate (e.g. schizophrenic wines fall under our old friend, Courtney Love). For something heavier, there is an excellent selection of tequilas, mezcals and housemade baconara (bartender Randy infuses things like a champ). And although I do wish they had a cocktail or two, I must admit that I love the Banderas. These are pours of your spirit of choice bookended by a tart lemony liquid and a pomegranate chile arbol chaser that has excellent heat. Whether or not you drink, I insist you finish your meal off with the salty churros which, and I am not exaggerating, are the best churros that ever existed. This cinnamony, crispy fried dough is so delectable that the last time I saw the churro lady on the subway platform I was forced to spit in her face. I didn't want to; she's perfectly sweet (and was quite confused)...but it was necessary.Such is the danger of eating food this good. ___________*Please excuse the profanity, but I don't know if without it I can convey the true love and admiration I have for this dish.**OK, I just looked it up. Turns out they are like Mexican French toast. And how could that be bad.",5.0
"Decided to try this place out on my first night out in Brooklyn. Service was great, ambiance is nice, it was around 10pm so there was some hip hop playing in the background. Tried a Watermelon cocktail that was really good.  The Corn Elotes is to die for. Corn on the cob with Buffalo sauce and cheese. Yum. Excellent prices as a similar meal in Manhattan would cost way more.  Will definitely come back",5.0
"Attempted to go to Traif last Friday on a date but was informed it would be a three hour wait. Have they read my review? I synced it with classic music from The Sound of Music. Where is the appreciation in the world today? So we decided to hit up Traif's sister restaurant Xixa. I've heard great things about it and the place was recommended, so I wasn't really bummed. They took us immediately and we sat down, which was the most part of the night. SITTING DOWN. Who selected these chairs? I felt forced to either lean all the way forward or lean back as some proud king in a thrown, putting his arms on the rests. Not really good for dinner conversation. They have a $40 dollar tasting menu which I highly recommend. The first few plates were alright, nothing great which for Traif's sister restaurant is kind of disappointing. I even mentioned to my date how I wasn't really thrilled with the experience so far but then the show began.  Lamb meatballs over black beans and pasta. Lettuce wrapped duck. Beef tartare tacos with cilantro and bone marrow! Shrimp in a spicy sauces and peppers. WOW. Then came desert. When you combine chocolate and bananas you already won my heart, make it into ice cream and I might propose. Jason marry me! (That's the chef ::wink wink::) Churros with a dipping sauce and raspberry jalapeno sorbet, is this man high when he comes up with these ideas? If so I will gladly fund his addictions. Not sure how this is Mexican in any way shape or form but it's delicious. So if you want to try another amazing tapas restaurant hit up Xixa. Just sit in the back. Those damn chairs ruined everything!",4.0
Such a cute and trendy place! Been there twice and can't get enough. What I really love about this place is the non-alcoholic drinks. I had a banana drink with a bit of habanero or jalapeno and it was awesome. Tasted delicious and complex then it burned a little in the back of your throat. I had 3 of them. The food is great! The cuttlefish with squid ink was amazing. The fried brussel sprouts was out of this world! IT was mixed with sunflower seeds and cranberries and who knows what else. It was fun to eat and kept me entertained. But the sexiest dish I've had so far was the foie gras. Now I've had foie gras before and I hate it. I hate the smell and the texture and the taste and especially the smell. It literally smells like seared blood.  Since all the food I've had here has been great I decided to order the foie gras and what a treat it was. I dare say it was orgasmic. The foie gras was super tender and buttery and the slice of pineapple on the bottom added texture and acid and sweetness and the bread and lord I just had to close my eyes and savor it. If I was not so stuffed at the end of the night I would have ordered 2. I can't wait till my next visit.,5.0

"Xixa is definitely on my top three list! I've been to Traif and fell in love,so I was hoping Xixa would do the same. It truly did. My boyfriend and I were going to pick out a couple of things on the menu, but then decided why don't we leave it in the chefs hands to throw out some of his amazing dishes at us. We got the chefs special and I was so happy we did. Everything that was brought out to us was amazing. The play on flavors and how well they work together is what made every dish. I have to say that my favorite was the sea urchin risotto and the carrots. Definitely will be back to both Traif and Xixa soon!",5.0

"We trekked here from Manhattan on a VERY snowy evening this past weekend. By the time we arrived, we were soaking wet and absolutely freezing. This cozy place definitely made up for it!Typically the chef's tasting menu (40/person) is only available if you have 3 or more people, but as business was slow due to the weather they accommodated us - and oh my, were we glad they did. I would estimate we got about 10 different courses that were likely $125 worth of food altogether. I can't even begin to remember what all we had (the menu changes almost daily anyway) but everything was phenomenal. If we had been ordering plates individually, the portions were perfect for two. We had a thai tea flan dessert particularly stood out for me.The drink menu was a little perplexing for me initially (I am more prone to a cocktail than straight and it is not particularly conducive to that). However, my date had the bourbon'd tequila and loved it. They also have a very extensive wine selection. It was worth the trip across to Brooklyn and I would absolutely recommend it!",5.0
"This place is so good that I went there two nights in a row. I first went for a Yelp event and was blown away by the food, so I went back the next night with a friend to get the full experience. We arrived around 7 (great time to come since no one was there), got seated, and perused the extensive drink menu. We each ended up getting a margarita of sorts. You can pick the kind of juice you want and match it with a tequila. I had strawberry with a white tequila, which was great.The server suggested that we order 6 plates between the two of us, but we ended up going with 5, which was more than enough. The 5 plates we got were:--a chilaquiles thing with egg (not on the online menu, so I can't remember exactly what was in it)--grilled carrots ""elote,"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, dill--fried Brussels sprouts, strawberries, currants, sunflower seeds, sweet-spicy vin--corn flan ""tamale,"" blue crab, poblano-garlic cream, bell pepper--Braised duck lettuce wraps, mushrooms, picadillo, raisins, peanuts, roasted bananaI could probably subsist on the corn flan and carrots alone, but every dish was truly phenomenal.

Both were winners.The only problem with the menu was trying to choose what to order. This what I think we went with--Mexico city edamame---a nice grill and and just a tad bit spicy.Steak tacos---this was with some sort of pibil, I believe, and not tartare. Whatever, it was delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again Thai guacamole---couldn't believe how well apple slices pair with guacamole. Basic and genius.scallop dish---the least exciting of all the dishes but still good.lamb meatballs---perfectly delicious---more please. (the guys who run the Meatball Shop need to take notes)artichoke and spinach something or other than came with chips, disappeared quickly and will definitely be ordered again.passion fruit churros---we were full but it was  my birthday and desert was in order. We were happy that we managed to force the dish into our already swollen bellies. The only thing I'm sorry about is that I didn't order the carrot dish but we had already ordered enough food so please keep this on the menu until I return.",5.0
"My husband and I had a great experience on a Saturday night. Even though we came early, the place was packed! So the only available seats were at the bar. The bartender was genuinely kind, knowledgable and professional. The food was delicious and was presented beautifully. Will be back!",5.0
"We trekked here from Manhattan on a VERY snowy evening this past weekend. By the time we arrived, we were soaking wet and absolutely freezing. This cozy place definitely made up for it!Typically the chef's tasting menu (40/person) is only available if you have 3 or more people, but as business was slow due to the weather they accommodated us - and oh my, were we glad they did. I would estimate we got about 10 different courses that were likely $125 worth of food altogether. I can't even begin to remember what all we had (the menu changes almost daily anyway) but everything was phenomenal. If we had been ordering plates individually, the portions were perfect for two. We had a thai tea flan dessert particularly stood out for me.The drink menu was a little perplexing for me initially (I am more prone to a cocktail than straight and it is not particularly conducive to that). However, my date had the bourbon'd tequila and loved it. They also have a very extensive wine selection. It was worth the trip across to Brooklyn and I would absolutely recommend it!",5.0
"This place is so good that I went there two nights in a row. I first went for a Yelp event and was blown away by the food, so I went back the next night with a friend to get the full experience. We arrived around 7 (great time to come since no one was there), got seated, and perused the extensive drink menu. We each ended up getting a margarita of sorts. You can pick the kind of juice you want and match it with a tequila. I had strawberry with a white tequila, which was great.The server suggested that we order 6 plates between the two of us, but we ended up going with 5, which was more than enough. The 5 plates we got were:--a chilaquiles thing with egg (not on the online menu, so I can't remember exactly what was in it)--grilled carrots ""elote,"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, dill--fried Brussels sprouts, strawberries, currants, sunflower seeds, sweet-spicy vin--corn flan ""tamale,"" blue crab, poblano-garlic cream, bell pepper--Braised duck lettuce wraps, mushrooms, picadillo, raisins, peanuts, roasted bananaI could probably subsist on the corn flan and carrots alone, but every dish was truly phenomenal. We were too full for dessert, but I'd like to try that some other time. I'm sure I'll be back here soon!",5.0
"Insanely delicious and inventive - I'm sure I will run out of adjectives before this review is done.  Our meal (the tasting menu) was a waltz from start to finish - with not a sour note in the full performance.  We are a group that rarely 100% agrees on any restaurant or experience - this meal left us speechless.On this adventurous night we decide to try the Chef's Choice Tasting Menu - for this group of type A personalities - letting someone else make those choices is really an adventure.  Our waitress, Allison, asked us a series of questions and we presented a couple of challenges - like our vegetarian and me the meat lover - and then we said go for it.Our first course was the gazpacho - and we thought - this is a mistake - I would never order gazpacho.  But I took a sip, as the spoon was so small - and my mouth exploded with the fresh - clean flavors of summer - it was not what I expected - it was amazing.  From that first bit ... our meal became an adventure like no other food experience ... course after course were amazing dishes that took familiar ingredients and added unexpected twists ... that left us giddy with anticipation for the next bit.  Everything was cooked to perfection ... nothing left any of us saying ... I had something similar or I could make that ... it was one flawless stream of food love ... and most surprising were the items I would never have ordered were the items I loved the most --- the shrimp cevetes and the grilled carrots.And then came the deserts - omg I died and went to heaven (and desert is not my thing).  The Mexican donuts with the ""habanero"" ice cream - insane - insane - insane - only to be followed by the chocolate molten cake with cilantro ice cream (we fought over the last bite) - and the chocolate fudge --- I found a new love for deserts.As we left everyone agreed that this was one of, if not the best, meals of all time (yes all time).  We love you Xixa - and we will be back.  Hint, hint the chef's choice tasting menu is the way to go.  And yes Allison - I didn't forget that you told me to tell everyone you are the best waitress ever!",5.0
"Wow! I have to say wow at how good this place is. Here's the thing, I'm never to fond of places that serve food tapas style because you walk away hungry with an empty wallet. If go to Xixa and order a la carte then you might. My suggestion to you is to go with the tasting menu. For $40 a person you will get an amazing meal!I took my 4 month pregnant fiancé for a date night. The place was perfect, laid back, trendy and intimate. When we read the menu we were intrigued by the tasting menu. It comes with 9 plates to share picked by the chef and in addition, you also get 2 desserts. Our waitress was awesome! We explained to her that we had some concerns about any raw or undercooked items for my fiancé and she made sure to communicate this to the chef.Now let me get down to the plates that stuck out the most. First the shrimp ceviche with pineapple was awesome (shrimp was poached for us so that it wasn't raw). Then there was a Carnitas pork-belly that was just so tasty and soft. Oh and there were carrots (I can't remember the exact name) that were cooked like corn with cheese. These were the most delicious carrots I have ever had in my life. They must have been cooked in until they were slightly roasted and then cooked further in a sweet butter and topped with cheese and spices. The duck wrapped in lettuce was also very good. Then came the BLT sliders which were so rich and savory. At this point I was hitting a wall but then came the Queso Fundido which was basically 4 or 5 melted cheeses with chips and green chillies or peppers in the middle. That was just fantastic. Then when I thought it couldn't get better and I couldn't take anymore food the deserts came out. We had a Tres Leches cake and Churros with passion fruit sauce and strawberry sorbet. The Tres Leches was good but the Churros were epic! They tastes like they were freshly made right out of the oven or fryer (which ever way their made).I definitely want to go back!",5.0
"I did the Chef's tasting menu. It was delicious, though I think some of the plates may have come out too quickly, not giving us enough time to enjoy.I'll be coming back to have more of the lamb meatballs and the absolutely delicious cocktails.Gorgeous interior. Incredibly designed!",4.0
"Rating is a 3.5.Randomly found this place on Yelp so my fiancee and I stopped in for dinner on a Friday night at 930. We were able to grab two seats right away at the long communal table which was great cause we were starving!Between the two of us we ordered 6 dishes as recommended by the waitress who was really nice (albeit not so great at explaining the food):Delicata squash salad - YUM! 4 starsGrilled carrots - YUM! 4 stars Local burrata - BOO! 1 star, the biggest miss of the night. Flavors didn't come together for me. Too many ingredients.Duck lettuce wraps - 3 stars. Loved the mashed banana sauce. Duck was a little salty.Pork belly - 5 stars. Ridiculously good. Crispy exterior and meaty, buttery goodness.Chilaquiles - 3 stars. Flavors were delicious but was really salty.Tomatillo limeade - 3.5 stars. Tasty but too sweet for my palate. I watered it down a bit and it was perfect.My gripes about this place:- Timing of food was totally off. We got our first 4 dishes pretty quickly and then there was a long lag before we got the pork belly.  It would be nice if everything was paced better.- Service was pretty good but something felt off about the way many different people served the food and cleared the plates.- Communal table is awesome in theory but the seats against the wall were so close that the people around me had to get up and out in order for me to squeeze past.- Water glasses are too small! One cup is one gulp. I'm a thirsty girl, I need a bigger cup!I think those are all things that can be worked out and the food was interesting enough for me to want to go back at a later point.",3.0
"It's all about the tasting menu (FYI you have to have 3 ppl minimum, $40 a piece, and everybody has to get it)Don't let the $40 price tag. I have no idea how three menus and two drinks turned into ~$150, but it did.It's about ten or so courses, with one replacement. I can't possibly tell you what everything was, but you cannot go wrong. Two things Im not particularly fond of, ceviche, and octopus were served, and I ate them up like a baby to a mother's nipple.The ambiance is very rustic. It looks like the kind of place that you would want to drink whiskey and tequila. Speaking of which, I got the margarita. Its weird, with the different cubes and all. It does take getting used to, and it's very strong at first, but when it all combines together, it's one of the most delicious drinks of the summer.The soundtrack is very hip as well. And, it's not overpowering to takeover the conversation.",5.0
"I have been to Traif and absolutely loved it.  The food and service of xixa is nowhere near it.My 2 stars for Xixa is because:The food was okThe price was high ($65 per person special tasting menu and MANDATORY 23% tip that night)The service was AWFULMy 5 stars for Traif was because:The food was very goodThe price was great ($40 per person for their full tasting menu)Spectacular serviceOur experience that night at Xixa:I decided to take my wife here for their valentine's day tasting menu (yes I should have known better, but I had such faith in Traif that I was convinced it would be a great experience)My wife I are very adverse to communal tables (especially on valentine's day).  We made sure to NOT be seated there and were assured a seat at the bar for our reservation.Upon arrival, we are told that all seats at the bar are full and we have a choice of the dreaded communal table or the couch (the couch?!) which they INSISTED was part of the bar.  I was not about to drop $170 on a dinner to eat it sitting on a couch off a wooden block.  And after 30 minutes the couch was FULL of people sitting on it waiting and more people hovering above standing.  I have no idea what the hostess was thinking even offering it.  We take the communal table seat and figure we should put it behind us and try to enjoy.  After 20 minutes, places at the bar open up and we ask to be moved to the bar.

"My friend and I came here on a weeknight and we were both deliriously tired.  It was pretty empty but as soon as you walk in you are hit with charm to boot.  It's a beautiful mix of rustic and modern all blended to make a fantastic combo.When we sat down we were both a little disappointed that the menu offered small plates. We had big appetites that night.  Well every night really.  Then the waitress gave us complimentary ""chips and salsa.""  When she put the plate down we busted out laughing.  Two tiny lil' tomatoes were staring in our faces, but dang when we popped them in our mouths we quickly realized that Xixa would be having the last laugh that evening.   So hungry gals do what hungry gals do best.  We ordered lots and lots of small plates that left us more than satiated.  Our tummies were full and excited about coming back. We ordered the guacamole nam prik num, corn flan, scallop ceviche and all kinds of tasty treats that I can't even remember. What I do remember is that they were all flavorful and packed a mean punch. I also tried their spin on the margarita where you have frozen cubes of fresh fruit juice in a glass of tequila that is not for the faint of heart. Brilliant menu and brilliant ambiance makes for a great evening out.",4.0
"huge huge huge fan..Great food, interesting and unique menu and everything is great. This is a great place to take your foodie friends visiting NYC.  It will give you the  New York vibe and feeling.. the outside of the restaurant even has graffiti around the front door and its in a transitional looking section of Williamsburg. The service and the decor are also five star.  I had a question about an ingredient and the chef popped out and chatted with us.  His passion for cuisine is truly infectious.  I'll pop in next time when I have people visiting and I'll recommend the Chef selection menu which I believe is like 40 or 45 pp.  Its worth it,  I'd like to be surprised as everything is really great.",5.0
"Pretty solid. I don't think I would make a trip out of manhattan for this place, but I live around the area, so I can imagine myself coming back. Under what circumstances would I come here again? If my guest was in the mood for something different, creative, and not looking for a 'last supper' type meal.  Alcohol wise, there is beer and a nice selection of wine, but be warned that they only have tequila for spirits. They have really interesting infused tequilas. I had tequila with a margarita ice cube. I love this! As it melts into your tequila, it flavors it. They also have infused tequila that mimic different types of spirits. I think this is actually really cool. I would certainly come to the bar. The food was pretty good, but don't come here if you want a super hearty meal. They have really interesting tapas concoctions that are pretty good, but I don't really remember anything that I ate which means it wasn't too memorable. The infused and different take on tequila is certainly memorable. They have a lot of pretty good meat and vegetarian options here. I recommend!",3.0
"So Xixa is awesome.  I had high expectations (as I am a huge Traif fan) and my meal here definitely exceeded them.  The atmosphere was unexpectedly sexy, cool, and intimate.  The four of us split a booth and it was plenty of space and we were all quite comfortable.Now on to the food:Wow.  It was as if each dish was better than the next.  The standouts were definitely: the foie gras el pastor, the carrot (definitely should have gotten multiples of this), the bone marrow and steak tartare tacos, and the grilled hamachi collar.  The waitstaff was competent and friendly.  The courses were adequately spaced which is always a huge plus (and we didn't even have to ask).  The one bit of criticism I have revolves around the drinks.  I get their whole philosophy listed on their website, but a fun Mexican dinner is not complete without a solid margarita.  Given the restaurant's ability to create interesting and surprising flavors with the food, I have a feeling such cocktails would be equally as innovative and delicious.  I appreciate things like the duck fat washed mezcal, but there's nothing like throwing back rounds of margaritas with friends.  Drinking a bottle of wine with this kind of meal just doesn't feel right.Overall, the food and atmosphere is great.  I really wish this were closer to home for me.",5.0
"I walked past this place while staring into the glass windows. I thought to myself, I want to come here. But I was heading to Traif, so I pushed the thought aside. When they told me the reservation was moved to half an hour later and suggested I go to their sister restaurant Xixa, pronounced ""Shik-sha"", the place down the block with the black awning and no sign, I did a little jump of joy. Sitting at the bar, my bartender showed me the wine list. I love that they separated them into girly categories. Yes, Coco Chanel, I will drink you. Ordered a few appetizers,  nothing too extraordinary, but enough for me to decide that I would have to come back soon.",5.0
"Xixa is pronounced Shiksa. Like the word for a non-jewish temptress who steals away a mensch. That's because one of the owners is technically a Xixa. (or Shiksa) This husband and wife team have quite possibly the best restaurant in Williamsburg. The food here is creative, original and borderlines on fancy. But the prices are reasonable. A dinner for 2 would run at most $80 and for that money you will taste things like bone marrow steak tacos (amazingly fatteningly delicious) or the best piece of braised short rib that you can recall eating. The menu can be as adventurous as you want... but none of it is weird exactly. It's hard to explain but you'll see when you get here. This place just has the right mix of food executed at a very high level with a lot of creativity paired at average prices. The Elm might be fancier, Amacen might have more bang for the buck, but if you had to eat only one meal in Williamsburg... nothing beats Xixa for it's creativity and value.",5.0

"We love love loved Xixa. As a huge fan of Traif I was a little skeptical about how it's sister restaurant would compare, but little sis exceeded expectations and is as good, if not even a little better!!! Each dish we had was better than the last.

"This place is absolutely worth a visit. Not too pricey with a fantastic menu full of hits or near hits (and not too pricey either!). The space is pretty small and the wait staff can be overly attentive (to the point where it feels like they are trying to rush you through the meal), but the food is worth it. Here's what we had:1. Appetizer ceviche: this was good not great, a little light on spice and flavor, I wouldn't order this again2. Burrata with strawberry and sopes: this was a must order, lightly roasted burrata with a sweet jam and hot sopes3. Scallops with black risotto: also a must order, perfectly seared scallops with a spicy broth4. Carrots elote: one of the most popular menu items for a reason, delightfully sweet carrots 5. Buffalo corn: my favorite of the night, spicy messy and perfectly original 6. Bone marrow: not my favorite, the marrow was overshadowed by the anchovy and the toast points were a little too soft7. Fundido with asparagus: melted cheese over homemade chips, can't really go wrong with this one8. Passion fruit churros: absolutely delicious with a great dipping sauce on the sideI highly recommend this restaurant, it's also extremely easy to get to from the subway or if you want a nice walk over the bridge from Manhattan.",5.0
"My friend and I came here on a weeknight and we were both deliriously tired.  It was pretty empty but as soon as you walk in you are hit with charm to boot.  It's a beautiful mix of rustic and modern all blended to make a fantastic combo.When we sat down we were both a little disappointed that the menu offered small plates. We had big appetites that night.  Well every night really.  Then the waitress gave us complimentary ""chips and salsa.""  When she put the plate down we busted out laughing.  Two tiny lil' tomatoes were staring in our faces, but dang when we popped them in our mouths we quickly realized that Xixa would be having the last laugh that evening.   So hungry gals do what hungry gals do best.  We ordered lots and lots of small plates that left us more than satiated.  Our tummies were full and excited about coming back. We ordered the guacamole nam prik num, corn flan, scallop ceviche and all kinds of tasty treats that I can't even remember. What I do remember is that they were all flavorful and packed a mean punch. I also tried their spin on the margarita where you have frozen cubes of fresh fruit juice in a glass of tequila that is not for the faint of heart. Brilliant menu and brilliant ambiance makes for a great evening out.",4.0
"huge huge huge fan..Great food, interesting and unique menu and everything is great. This is a great place to take your foodie friends visiting NYC.  It will give you the  New York vibe and feeling.. the outside of the restaurant even has graffiti around the front door and its in a transitional looking section of Williamsburg. The service and the decor are also five star.  I had a question about an ingredient and the chef popped out and chatted with us.  His passion for cuisine is truly infectious.  I'll pop in next time when I have people visiting and I'll recommend the Chef selection menu which I believe is like 40 or 45 pp.  Its worth it,  I'd like to be surprised as everything is really great.",5.0
"Pretty solid. I don't think I would make a trip out of manhattan for this place, but I live around the area, so I can imagine myself coming back. Under what circumstances would I come here again? If my guest was in the mood for something different, creative, and not looking for a 'last supper' type meal.  Alcohol wise, there is beer and a nice selection of wine, but be warned that they only have tequila for spirits. They have really interesting infused tequilas. I had tequila with a margarita ice cube. I love this! As it melts into your tequila, it flavors it. They also have infused tequila that mimic different types of spirits. I think this is actually really cool. I would certainly come to the bar. The food was pretty good, but don't come here if you want a super hearty meal. They have really interesting tapas concoctions that are pretty good, but I don't really remember anything that I ate which means it wasn't too memorable. The infused and different take on tequila is certainly memorable. They have a lot of pretty good meat and vegetarian options here. I recommend!",3.0
"So Xixa is awesome.  I had high expectations (as I am a huge Traif fan) and my meal here definitely exceeded them.  The atmosphere was unexpectedly sexy, cool, and intimate.  The four of us split a booth and it was plenty of space and we were all quite comfortable.Now on to the food:Wow.  It was as if each dish was better than the next.  The standouts were definitely: the foie gras el pastor, the carrot (definitely should have gotten multiples of this), the bone marrow and steak tartare tacos, and the grilled hamachi collar.  The waitstaff was competent and friendly.  The courses were adequately spaced which is always a huge plus (and we didn't even have to ask).  The one bit of criticism I have revolves around the drinks.  I get their whole philosophy listed on their website, but a fun Mexican dinner is not complete without a solid margarita.  Given the restaurant's ability to create interesting and surprising flavors with the food, I have a feeling such cocktails would be equally as innovative and delicious.  I appreciate things like the duck fat washed mezcal, but there's nothing like throwing back rounds of margaritas with friends.  Drinking a bottle of wine with this kind of meal just doesn't feel right.Overall, the food and atmosphere is great.  I really wish this were closer to home for me.",5.0
"I walked past this place while staring into the glass windows. I thought to myself, I want to come here. But I was heading to Traif, so I pushed the thought aside. When they told me the reservation was moved to half an hour later and suggested I go to their sister restaurant Xixa, pronounced ""Shik-sha"", the place down the block with the black awning and no sign, I did a little jump of joy. Sitting at the bar, my bartender showed me the wine list. I love that they separated them into girly categories. Yes, Coco Chanel, I will drink you. Ordered a few appetizers,  nothing too extraordinary, but enough for me to decide that I would have to come back soon.",5.0
"Xixa is pronounced Shiksa. Like the word for a non-jewish temptress who steals away a mensch. That's because one of the owners is technically a Xixa. (or Shiksa) This husband and wife team have quite possibly the best restaurant in Williamsburg. The food here is creative, original and borderlines on fancy. But the prices are reasonable. A dinner for 2 would run at most $80 and for that money you will taste things like bone marrow steak tacos (amazingly fatteningly delicious) or the best piece of braised short rib that you can recall eating. The menu can be as adventurous as you want... but none of it is weird exactly. It's hard to explain but you'll see when you get here. This place just has the right mix of food executed at a very high level with a lot of creativity paired at average prices. The Elm might be fancier, Amacen might have more bang for the buck, but if you had to eat only one meal in Williamsburg... nothing beats Xixa for it's creativity and value.",5.0
"Outrageous, impressive, and innovative food.",4.0
"We love love loved Xixa.

"My party settled here after seeing Traif was full, and honestly I preferred Xixa. Apparently they are owned by the same person/people, and very similar in concept. This was a more low key atmosphere in my opinion, and the lighting less harsh.The food was delicious, Tapas style with a few plates (appetizer and desert) thrown in free of charge.

"Quietly tucked under the BQE, Xixa is cozy and delicious. The theme is sharing plates that are all very unique and surprisingly affordable (~$8/dish). The wine selection is impressive.

The menu is eclectic Mexican in tapas form - everything we had was fresh and tasty (I especially enjoyed the blue crab tamales in poblano cream and carrots with honey butter, feta, and dill....)The food was fantastic and there was no wait on a Friday night at 10.

"I generally hate hype, but in this case, the hype is on point. I went here with a friend one rainy Wednesday evening when the rest of the world decided to stay home- fine by me. I think Xixa hits the mark from so many different perspectives: uniqueness, ambiance (sexy enough for a special date), food flavor and personality. The one thing is not for is if you were looking forward to dining on a large entree. It's definitely not that type of party kids, so be sure to order several plates for you and your dining partner to share. Think tapa size if not smaller. We purchased approximately 6 total plates and 1 drink each. Our bill was $80 and well worth it. They have an interesting play on cocktails as they specialize in tequila. If  you're thinking, I'll keep it basic and just order a margarita then you are in for a twist. They serve you a glass with tequila and frozen margarita balls, so if you don't like a strong cocktail, order this early in the evening to give it time to thaw out. The service was great and quite frankly I have no complaints. Thankfully I didn't let the greedy hunger monster dictate my restaurant  decision that night, because on the surface I was beginning to think that I would never get full with these very small plates, but alas it was all GREAT! In fact, I was stuffed once it was time to leave. I highly recommend this restaurant.",5.0

"I'm reviewing this restaurant as a vegan, so I gave it a 2.  My husband, who eats meat, says he would have rated it a 3.  First, the way the meal is served, it comes as a series of small plates.  That's a good thing, but it did affect the service.  It's good because you get to taste and share a lot of different flavors.  But what we found was that if they didn't clear plates rapidly, the plates would build up on the table.  So they clearly make an effort to avoid that mess, but the constant clearling became overwhelming to the point of annoyance.  It felt as if there was always a waiter hovering over our table to clear plates; we had to ask them to leave dips and sauces behind, and one time they even grabbed an almost full plate of food right from under my husband's fork!  He was quick enough to ask for it back before they slapped another dish on top of his food, but it was a very close call.  They also use very small (very cute) water glasses.  The good news is that they have TWO waiters just walking around refilling water glasses; the bad news is that we always had one of those two waiters hovering over our table to refill someone's glass.  So we were almost constantly interrupted by the servers, for one reason or another - hard to sustain a conversation.From a food perspective, there is a surprising lack of vegan options.  They made me a vegan winter guacamole - I believe that meant they left out a parmesan chip as one of the dipping options.  And the brussel sprouts are vegan.  Maybe there were one or two other items, but not anything that I cared to order, or that our friends wanted to order.  Out of an extensive menu of small plates, at a very trendy restaurant, that's very surprising nowadays.  (Our waitress did come back, after speaking with the chef, and offered an off-menu sauteed mushroom dish served with lettuce for wrapping.  That was quite good, but it came with a banana sauce that just did not work with the mushrooms - they were better eaten plain.)  The brussel sprouts were yummy, but really overly sweet - I felt as if I was eating dessert.  The winter guacamole was fine but plain.  (We had a strong, smoky sauce left over from another appetizer - it didn't come with the guacamole - but it helped punch up the flavor of the guacamole when we combined them!) Hope they add some more vegan options.  Despite the issues with the service, I'd consider going back if I saw a few changes to the menu!",2.0
"Came to xixa very quickly after hearing it was from the same people as Traif and they had a tasting menu for $40!Found it very easy (perhaps too easy) to make a reservation at 8 on a Saturday night. While the place was crowded it was not packed.  We had the tasting menu, hardly looking over the menu due to its small font and endless possiblities. My favorite dishes were the scallops, tom yum sweet corn, corn flan with blue crab, seared scallops, braised duck wrap. Foie gras was in the middle for me and the least favorite was the guac and chips. I could've made it better tbh. Desserts were inventive but not enough chocolate!While xixa is good, it still cannot compare to its older, better sister Traif.  From reading other reviews it seems that the tasting menu varies by the day so I may try again and test my luck!",4.0
"After other plans fell through because of terrible train delays, we were thankful to get a seat at the bar at Xixa. The space was a bit cramped, but not bad for no reservations on a Saturday. If the review was just about the food, it would be 3.5-4 stars. We had the tasting menu and everything was pretty great. My favorites were the skirt steak and mackerel ceviche. The churros for dessert with lemon custard were delicious! All in all, the food is good but there is room for improvement. Go and try a few things but I'd avoid the tasting menu. The problem was service execution. First, some dishes were brought two or three at a time. It would have been crowded at a table and with our bar seats, it was just uncomfortable. Second, the serving sizes for many dishes were too large for a tasting menu. The last course being bone marrow and steak tartare followed by two heavy desserts seemed like poor timing.  The five layer dulce de leche cake was far too heavy to end such a large meal. My boyfriend and I both left feeling heavy and gross and we did not eat everything. I have never left after a tasting menu feeling horrible about life!",3.0
"Xixa has a lot going for it, but it still needs a couple extra touches before truly becoming great.The first is a website. Or at least an online menu. It's a lot easier to figure out what you ate, after the fact, if you can look at it in writing. Or at least it is for me. So I'm going to have to go by my mezcal-impared memory...And speaking of which, they're doing mezcal right. A dining companion got Del Maguey Espadin Especial. I'm a mezcal newb, but I loved it. Then I looked it up and read: ""The first release of Del Maguey Mezcal Espadin Especial will consist of only fifty-five, six bottle cases, limited to New York, Boston and California.""Wow. Now I need to get my hands on some, and pronto.Their barrel-aged Sombra was also good, but I can only imagine what it will be like in six months, or a year...The food ranged mostly from good to very good. The taleggio fundido was really good. The shrimp gordita tasted old. The artichoke heart ""guacamole"" was fun and tasty. And the pozole was also good, but the foie gras seemed like a flourish that didn't need to be there.Quick side note to the pozole. I went with three other people, and when we ordered the pozole, it came out with one spoon. I asked a waiter for three spoons to eat the soup with, as it wasn't brought out with them, and he flashed a really disgusted look at me upon walking away. Later in the meal, I asked if we could get some more water, and I got the same look. I asked my co-diners about this, and they agreed that it was out of left field and strange.I don't want to be one of those annoying customers who ask for the world and demand it granted with a smile. But spoons for soup and water are very reasonable requests. The dinner was still very good, but this still slightly tainted the experience.",4.0

"Xixa offers an affordable tasting menu at $40 where I felt like the food kept on coming.  I felt satisfied with the amount of food for the price, it is a tapas spot after all and for two people about two plates came out at a time. The cuisine is described as Mexican, but I feel like they are definitely trying to do something more, starting off perhaps with a Mexican concept then twisted with modern, American, and several other global influences. The meal started out with an amuse bouche of room temperature butternut squash cubes. Cute, tiny and sweet start to the meal. I liked most of the courses, especially the duck (my favorite-duck lettuce wraps). I thought it was a creative menu, very well thought out and composed. The drunken shrimp were cooked well in a deliciously spicy sauce that reminded me of the flavors of New Orleans. The lamb meatballs were an interesting concoction-a mixture of what tasted like middle eastern flavored lamb, served in marinara sauce on top of a spaghetti-like-pasta tossed with black beans. I thought this dish might have been a little over the top, incorporating too many components put together, although it was flavorful.  I'm not a fan of beef tartare but thought the marrow that complemented it was good, although the blue corn tortilla shells tasted burnt. The two desserts were the best of both worlds, a fruity option of jalapeno sorbet with churros  and banana chocolate ice cream with a black sesame paste on top. I didn't think the black sesame went with the other parts of the dish, but I am happy whenever black sesames is in my meal.The tasting menu meant constant interruptions of food descriptions, and I thought the one question I asked came with a little attitude, unless I was paranoid. Otherwise the wait staff quite friendly and on the ball; while they chose small glasses for the water, it was hardly ever left empty which was well appreciated (but that dude's job would be easier if they were larger!)I am sure sitting in the booths is great, but I don't recommend the tables in the front left, because the chairs just didn't seem fit for comfortable dining.",4.0

"Went here again on Friday night and nothing's changed - hooray! Still the same great service and great food. I'm not that much of a fan of Mexican food but this is not your average taqueria, this is very good food. Places like this deserve to stay in business so go there!",4.0

"I'm reviewing this restaurant as a vegan, so I gave it a 2.  My husband, who eats meat, says he would have rated it a 3.  First, the way the meal is served, it comes as a series of small plates.  That's a good thing, but it did affect the service.  It's good because you get to taste and share a lot of different flavors.  But what we found was that if they didn't clear plates rapidly, the plates would build up on the table.  So they clearly make an effort to avoid that mess, but the constant clearling became overwhelming to the point of annoyance.  It felt as if there was always a waiter hovering over our table to clear plates; we had to ask them to leave dips and sauces behind, and one time they even grabbed an almost full plate of food right from under my husband's fork!  He was quick enough to ask for it back before they slapped another dish on top of his food, but it was a very close call.  They also use very small (very cute) water glasses.  The good news is that they have TWO waiters just walking around refilling water glasses; the bad news is that we always had one of those two waiters hovering over our table to refill someone's glass.  So we were almost constantly interrupted by the servers, for one reason or another - hard to sustain a conversation.From a food perspective, there is a surprising lack of vegan options.  They made me a vegan winter guacamole - I believe that meant they left out a parmesan chip as one of the dipping options.  And the brussel sprouts are vegan.  Maybe there were one or two other items, but not anything that I cared to order, or that our friends wanted to order.  Out of an extensive menu of small plates, at a very trendy restaurant, that's very surprising nowadays.  (Our waitress did come back, after speaking with the chef, and offered an off-menu sauteed mushroom dish served with lettuce for wrapping.  That was quite good, but it came with a banana sauce that just did not work with the mushrooms - they were better eaten plain.)  The brussel sprouts were yummy, but really overly sweet - I felt as if I was eating dessert.  The winter guacamole was fine but plain.  (We had a strong, smoky sauce left over from another appetizer - it didn't come with the guacamole - but it helped punch up the flavor of the guacamole when we combined them!) Hope they add some more vegan options.  Despite the issues with the service, I'd consider going back if I saw a few changes to the menu!",2.0
"Came to xixa very quickly after hearing it was from the same people as Traif and they had a tasting menu for $40!Found it very easy (perhaps too easy) to make a reservation at 8 on a Saturday night. While the place was crowded it was not packed.  We had the tasting menu, hardly looking over the menu due to its small font and endless possiblities. My favorite dishes were the scallops, tom yum sweet corn, corn flan with blue crab, seared scallops, braised duck wrap. Foie gras was in the middle for me and the least favorite was the guac and chips. I could've made it better tbh. Desserts were inventive but not enough chocolate!While xixa is good, it still cannot compare to its older, better sister Traif.  From reading other reviews it seems that the tasting menu varies by the day so I may try again and test my luck!",4.0
"After other plans fell through because of terrible train delays, we were thankful to get a seat at the bar at Xixa. The space was a bit cramped, but not bad for no reservations on a Saturday. If the review was just about the food, it would be 3.5-4 stars. We had the tasting menu and everything was pretty great. My favorites were the skirt steak and mackerel ceviche. The churros for dessert with lemon custard were delicious! All in all, the food is good but there is room for improvement. Go and try a few things but I'd avoid the tasting menu. The problem was service execution. First, some dishes were brought two or three at a time. It would have been crowded at a table and with our bar seats, it was just uncomfortable. Second, the serving sizes for many dishes were too large for a tasting menu. The last course being bone marrow and steak tartare followed by two heavy desserts seemed like poor timing.  The five layer dulce de leche cake was far too heavy to end such a large meal. My boyfriend and I both left feeling heavy and gross and we did not eat everything. I have never left after a tasting menu feeling horrible about life!",3.0
"Xixa has a lot going for it, but it still needs a couple extra touches before truly becoming great.The first is a website. Or at least an online menu. It's a lot easier to figure out what you ate, after the fact, if you can look at it in writing. Or at least it is for me. So I'm going to have to go by my mezcal-impared memory...And speaking of which, they're doing mezcal right. A dining companion got Del Maguey Espadin Especial. I'm a mezcal newb, but I loved it. Then I looked it up and read: ""The first release of Del Maguey Mezcal Espadin Especial will consist of only fifty-five, six bottle cases, limited to New York, Boston and California.""Wow. Now I need to get my hands on some, and pronto.Their barrel-aged Sombra was also good, but I can only imagine what it will be like in six months, or a year...The food ranged mostly from good to very good. The taleggio fundido was really good. The shrimp gordita tasted old. The artichoke heart ""guacamole"" was fun and tasty. And the pozole was also good, but the foie gras seemed like a flourish that didn't need to be there.Quick side note to the pozole. I went with three other people, and when we ordered the pozole, it came out with one spoon. I asked a waiter for three spoons to eat the soup with, as it wasn't brought out with them, and he flashed a really disgusted look at me upon walking away. Later in the meal, I asked if we could get some more water, and I got the same look. I asked my co-diners about this, and they agreed that it was out of left field and strange.I don't want to be one of those annoying customers who ask for the world and demand it granted with a smile. But spoons for soup and water are very reasonable requests. The dinner was still very good, but this still slightly tainted the experience.",4.0
"Pretty solid. Went for the brussels sprouts, fall guacamole, some tasty carrots, and tried the artichoke cheese dip. All good. The flavored ice cube add-ins feel a little gimmicky, and the place overall is a little Brooklandia, but what can you do.",3.0
"Had one of my favorite meals here - this may be my new favorite restaurant.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but not overpriced.  Each course is brought out in a specific order with enough time in between each one, so that you really get to enjoy the experience.  The service is on par with the food - it's attentive without being overbearing.  My husband ordered another glass of wine, and they refilled my glass without as well, on the house.  It's the kind of restaurant that you can feel go about going to and bringing people to, as you know you're going to have a consistently excellent experience.",5.0

"We went for New Year's Eve for the first time & what a great way to celebrate! If you've ever been to the sister restaurant, Traif, you know you won't be disappointed. The food was delicious & the decor was intimate & unique. The space is small, but cute & cozy. The items on the menu are for sharing, so selecting one from each section of the menu will suffice. The lettuce wraps & the corn tamale were great! We ordered the ""steak tacos"", which I didn't realize would involve an actual bone to scoop out the marrow. It was greasy & too much on the stomach. Cool concept, but we could've did without it. The salty churros were a great way to end our meal. There is a lot to choose from on the menu.

Felt like we were being held hostage. First - the food was amazing. My husband and I went for the 8-course tasting menu for V-day. So we were in a great mood and excited to try this place. We went to Traif last year and LOVED it. BUT 1 hour and a half in we had 4 plates. The first plate was 4 veggie chips. No joke. At one point we waited 45 mins in-between plates. Then they brought out a plate they had already brought out earlier. I made jokes about it with the server - and we were trying to make the most of the situation but COME ON. In the end the meal was 2.5 hours long and we managed to have 6 out of the 8 plates. They gave us a glass of wine and a coffee for free. But despite loving the food I don't think I'll ever go back. Even once I said something - they acted like it was our fault somehow. Pretty annoying. Butchered the evening.,1.0
"I personally really liked this place, and had high hopes considering this is the sister restaurant to Traif. We did the prix fixe menu here and had around 10 different dishes, some more unique and appealing than others, but all in all quite delicious.

It was still, at the end of the day, very New American and Traif-like, which, for me, is still fab.",4.0

"How can you go wrong with a place called ""Shiksah""? This play on the Yiddish word refers to the Jewish owner's partner, who is a goy. Such clever naming suggests you're in for a treat. The decidedly non-Kosher restaurant from an outstanding Jewish chef continues the theme with a mix of Mexican/Latin, Asian, and American flavors. We seriously ordered almost the entire menu for our table of 8 and it's hard to say which was the best. The duck, short ribs, and foie gras were probably tops, but it all runs together a simply delicious. Drink list could be better ... I'd recommend draft beer. A nice light Mexican lager would go so well with the rich dishes. The single star deduction was for an overly fussy hostess who didn't seem capable of making decisions on her own when setting up our table. Perhaps she was new. Either way she needed to relax and make the customers feel welcomed rather than a threat to her harmony. The place wasn't even that busy, though it was by the time we left.

Arctic Char ceviche - I am a sucker for good ceviche, I admit - and this was one of the best I ever had.

"After Elite event here a while ago I just had to come back for more food.Xixa is just as amazing as I remember it.Plush decor, top-notch service and delicious food. In fact, the service is the best I ever experienced. There is always someone around to clear out the plates, refill your glass and attend to every request or question.Plates here are shared, and I love that - means I can try a bit of everything.Best of the best: Guacamole is to die for - served with veggies and puffed rice. Chilaquiles Carbonara - sunnyside up egg, cheese, pancetta and tomatillos over tortilla chips is pinnacle of snacks. Arctic Char ceviche - I am a sucker for good ceviche, I admit - and this was one of the best I ever had. And of course, delicious, finger-licking-good pork belly - I hoarded that plate and refused to share, it was that goooooooood (forgive me, my friends!). If you know me, I can never leave without dessert... Rosemary-vanilla flan with sunflower seeds and green apple sorbet... I died and went to heaven at that point. Freaking delish!!!Last word: drinks are very good.Fantastic place.",5.0
"What can I say XIXA?  Other than I love you.  I miss you. I  can't wait to see you again. The tasting menu was incredible and the service spectacular as always.An amazing bottle of wine and an awesome evening.  We were not rushed and every amazing dish was served with love and flair.  Yes , this is my favorite restaurant.  Te quiero mi amor.",5.0
"Amazing flavors is what defines this place. While this is Mexican inspired, it doesn't come close to any Mexican food. This is the place to go if you want to impress and have some extra dollars to do so. Do not pass on dessert either because the flavor tour continues. Everything is so light but still filling if you get 2-3 dishes per person. Really great wine list but wish they highlighted their tequila and mezcal list with a cocktail menu.",4.0
"(Come early.. and by that I mean before 8) I eat a lot. And, I've gotten this recurring fear that I'll run out of delicious, new places to go. It's with great relief that Xixa is wonderful... down to the smoke filled, cramped bar esque seating. I can't even begin to tell you what I had. Mainly because I was drinking, but also because we had the tasting menu. I love tasting menus. Good food comes to you without you putting out any effort at all. So anyway, come early. come hungry. try the tasting menu. and then come back again for more.",4.0
"I tried to make a holiday reservation for a party of 8 at Traiff. They were completely booked and suggested we try their sister restaurant with the same chefs Xixa. The entire experience from top to bottom made this such a treat. I lost track of how many dishes they brought out for the perfectly priced chefs tasting. We ate had fois gras, mole ribs and an exquisite hamachi. We also opted to add on the additional cornish hen for the table. The service was top notch and I want Alison our server to be my new BFF!Thanks again for the delightful experience. We will be back!",5.0
"Tried to walk into Traif but with a 2 hour wait time went down the street to their sister restaurant.  Solid chef tasting for $45. Excellent ceviche, duck lettuce tacos, braised beef, 2 solid desserts and more.  Love Mexican, loved this meal with friends and service & chef execution were great.",5.0
*Most delicious food ever tasted*The chef does an amazing job at creating experimental dishes with savoring taste that will just leave you flabbergasted.The ice cubed tequilas are a must try as well.Everything there was just super awesome. Can't wait to go there again.,5.0
"XIXA was amazing. At $50 the tasting menu was a steal! When we went we sampled over 11 items and we loved every single one. The wait staff was very friendly, and the chef was even kind enough to accommodate for a food restriction and allergy. The drinks were also pretty fantastic. All around a great experience. Will defiantly be telling my friends about this place and will hopefully come back soon.",5.0
"I must say, Williamsburg has the best restaurants in ALL 5 boroughs. However, XIXA(and Traif-sister restaurant) exceed all expectations. The chef here is creative, imaginative and knows how to make unlikely ingredients work. The wait staff is super cool and beyond accommodating. I can eat everything on the menu. We are adventurous eaters this place will give you that. It is beyond one up from any restaurant we've been to. We have been to top Michelin restaurants. Guys, this is the place to be! Last, get the drinks!!! Watch the mixologist at he bar as she makes the drinks. It's a work of art!  Come here and try it all.",5.0
"I guess I'm going to be bucking the trend of 5 star reviews and while I do understand them (the food was definitely good), the service was fairly terrible. Our server seemed extremely flustered and definitely inattentive. I mean, they're busy but this was beyond that. My biggest annoyance, once any of us had finished a drink, she would collect the glass without asking if we wanted another, meaning we basically had to flag her down to get one. I could be wrong but it seemed like an intentional 'get them out the door so we can get someone else in' tactic because they're so popular and want to do as many covers as humanly possible. I guess it's fair enough for them to want to maximize their revenue but it certainly doesn't make a person feel welcome.I also have to go along with the pretentiousness arguments. As an opener, every table receives something a server described as 'an amuse bouche, our play on chips and salsa'. It was a grape tomato with a tiny sprinkle of corn masa on top. I actually like the school of playing with food and molecular gastronomy, but this just seemed like seriously overplaying you hand. I mean hey, thanks for the free grape tomato but additionally, give me f-ing break!At one point I ordered a beer and it hadn't arrived 10 minutes later, so I (after a few fruitless efforts) caught the server's attention and asked if my beer was on the way. She replied 'the bar is kind of backed up right now' and walked off. A couple of observations about that statement:-I ordered a bottle of beer, all they had to do was crack it open-I turned around and the bartender was standing there doing not much-There was a bottle of beer sitting on the bar. Watching the server, it turned out to be mine and from its drinking temperature had probably been there for a while. -The moral: You might want to drop the completely transparent excuse and go with an apology for forgetting next time. So those were the crappy service highlights but there were a couple of other less quotable ones. The food was tasty, but I can't see myself returning. Should have gone to Rye!",2.0
"I was super excited to try Xixa - their sister restaurant Traif (just a few doors down) is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn!It is a similar concept to Traif - small plates to share and combining flavors and styles that you would never think would work together, but they do and they do so deliciously.The Crab Flan was mind blowing! and unexpected. I  wasn't sure how they would pull off a crab flan but they did tremendously! The scallop Ceviche was super tasty as well.The service was great, but a little too handsy (constantly grabbing the plates too quickly, and this is a place you kind of want to take your time and eat every last little morsel).The only thing is that the drinks were disappointing. I'm a margarita fanatic and I thought being a Mexican-fusion restaurant, that they would have some crazy margaritas to try, but no. Unlike Traif, who has amazing cocktails, Xixa only has wine/beer (but a phenomenally long, diverse selection of it) and tequila to sip on. I LOVE tequila but only when it is mixed, it's a little too heavy on it's own and reminds me of college year shots (that always got a little out of hand). So that is the only reason for the non-five-star review. I hope they figure it out and put some yummy cocktails on the menu, so I can come back and give it five stars !Keep up the good work guys!!",4.0
"One word: unimpressed... Actually, also...confused...really confused. Came here with my husband early on a Friday evening. We initially wanted to go to xixa's sister restaurant traif but unfortunately realized it was reservation only and there were only counter seats for walk ins. The hostess recommended we try xixa. I had read about it before and had pretty high expectations based on all of the excellent reviews so we figured we would try it. The restaurant appeared nearly empty aside from a few private tables that were occupied in the back. In the front is a long communal table; the purpose of this defeats me as you could easily place at least eight two tops along that same wall. This is the first issue I take up with this place. This pretentious ""we couldn't care less about our customers personal space"" attitude didn't sit well. If you have the nerve to charge $24 dollars for tapas style dining options, you best believe I want to enjoy it without the neighbor to my left and right staring down my throat. With each patron that came in we were all piled atop one another at the table and had to navigate this awkward dance of apologies and discomfort, I felt sorry for the girl that had to be elbowed by my left handed husband and for once was regretful that I wasn't the one sitting by his side. At some point I'm pretty certain I drank my neighbors water. Sitting here writing this, I'm mustering up a list of saliva transmittable diseases and hoping he wasn't a carrier of any, Dear God I really don't want herpes. FYI- the other side of the table was empty (and stayed empty after we left) they could have just spaced us out.. like seriously...The drink menu: over complicated, very fussy, little explanation and servers have this passive assumption that patrons are tequila and mezcal savants and came solely for their albeit impressive selection of such. When my hubby asked for alternate options the question wasn't very well received. He was redirected to beer but more or less coerced into getting some tequila infusion with one too many ingredients that translated into an unpalatable lighter fluid tasting disaster. The fresh juice was delicious. Not even arguing that one. The food menu: I've been around the block and I'm not even going to lie, I have a pretty discerning palate. I'm also incredibly spoiled and come from a culinary family, the food here was mediocre and over complicated to masquerade itself as creative. We had the following: BLT sliders with blistered shisito peppers- over all tasted good, a little salty but I'm all about bacon so I can't complain. I could have done with out the peppers. Slow roasted short rib over spaetzle was fall apart and overall done well, one of the better dishes for sure. Dayboat scallops over sea urchin risotto: scallops smelled fishy but were cooked well. What ever spice was on top killed any notes of fishiness and numbed my mouth for what ever followed after. The sea urchin risotto was alright. Not a favorite dish. Lamb meatballs plate was completely forgettable, the tomato sauce was too acidic and pasty, it felt completely out of place on this menu. I think I developed ulcers after that one. Probably need a visit a gastroenterologist some time soon. Overall it was alright but I don't imagine I would every ""crave"" coming back for anything on this menu. Service: I have only this to say, I never leave reviews, this may even be my first one ever on here or anywhere really, but this was enough of a peeve that it warrants a comment, I don't appreciate being called ""babe"". I come from the service industry and I get how one might think that this creates a relationship of openness and trust, but one must also understand that it's annoying and patronizing and some people, especially those miffed by your stupid communal tables, unimpressive dining, and presumptuous laid back 'burg attitude, do not care for your ""babe"" every time you squeeze between me and ol' Chuck to the left to serve me a $14 drink or  $24 dollar tapa. I get the cushy atmosphere might encourage you to believe we are best buds, after laying up there like sardines, it might just be the ultimate bonding experience for you, but no ""babe""... when I tried to cancel  my order after the first two crappy ones,  your completely unaccommodating ""babe"" almost compelled me to hurl a meatball at your face. So that's that. Enjoy your dining experience if your are into getting cozy on your friday nights. This was a poor experience for a well deserved date night away from two toddlers :(   Wasn't my cup of tea to say the least.",3.0
"XIXA is pronounced 'shiksa', as in the Yiddish word for a non-Jewish woman. How ironic! It's not your ordinary 'Mexican food'.It's remixed, sampled, twisted and updated, and I do love the result.

Pozole: A! very flavorful broth and meatDuck lettuce wrap: A! my favorite here!Korean short ribs: B for the tiny portion and I am biased because I'm comparing it to Traif's ribs (same owner so I'm allowed lol)Passion fruit churros: A+++ don't know what else to say. it's passion fruit habanero sorbet with a warm delicious churro.

"Similar to its' sister restaurant Xixa did not disappoint.  At first I did not know what to expect.  I guess I was expecting more like Traif in terms of ambiance.  Xixa felt colder, while Traif is more cozier with its garden seating area. Sorry if I'm comparing the two, I can't help it. There's no wait for a Wednesday evening.  Not sure if that's typical or maybe we went on a damp and cold October evening.  We were seated at a fairly small table with large chairs, in contrast to most restaurants with small chairs and larger tables. I was starting to worry until our waitress came over. She was cheerful and attentive. She handed us the menus which included a very long and confusing list of cocktail drinks. Luckily our waitress was nice enough to take the time to explain everything on the menu.  In the end we had her select our drinks for us.  I had the old fashion cube and my friend had the margarita cube.  The cocktails looked beautiful. Similar to the cocktails, the list of small plates were also overwhelming. Not wanting to waste time and risk of ordering the wrong dish, we opted for the tasting menu. My friend requested the roasted sea urchin to be part of the tasting menu and it was the least favorite dish of the evening. Here's what we had:1.    Sweet potato chips with spicy/sweet dipping sauce2.    Tuna and shrimp ceviche3.    Corn soup top with Mexican cheese (more corn that soup) delish!4.    Roasted sea urchin risotto with corn biscuit5.    Roasted Pork belly and cheeks 6.    Foie gras with  pineapple and bread sponge7.    Bone marrow and shredded beef tacos8.    Churros with passion fruit dipping sauce 9.    Banana Tres Leches with Cumin ice cream10.    Mole chocolate barI hope I didn't miss anything.  I was full but not overly full.  It was a great experience beginning to end. I won't get the roasted sea urchin again.  Only thing I wish the establishment would consider is dimming the lights a little more. I will certainly come back for more, especially for the drinks.",5.0
"It's really hard not to compare this to Traif, since its right next door and have the same owners, and are focused on small plates, but I will try my hardest to be totally unbiased.The important part, the Food:They have a great mezcal offering and an even more impressive wine list.Duck fat Mezcal - I don't love mezcal but had to get it, since I wanted to try something different.It was definitely just as awesome as it sounded, smelled smokey, but tasted like Agave. Spicy shrimp gordita - 5/5 - Far from your typical gordita, this looked more like a small gordita whoopie pie, the taste was on point in every wayBlue crab tamale - 4/5 - Loved the blue crab, didn't love the flan like tamale it was served on, but the crab was beyond fresh and flavorful which totally made up for the flanPozole 5/5: The broth was delicious, and flavorful, the meat was fall of the boneKorean Short ribs 5/5 - Cooked to a medium, sauce was ridiculously goodDuck Lettuce wrap 5/5 - The duck was flavorful, and the combination of Pineapple, banana puree and tomato and duck on the lettuce wrap was like a kick in my mouthGoat Ricotta and Mango dessert 4/5- I expected this dish to look slightly different, but was definitely surprised by how amazing the combination of pistachio, honey, goat ricotta and mango were together.....Wouldn't choose over the churros, but with a cup of coffee this was perfect Passion Fruit Churros 5/5 - Ummmmm, woww!! The churros were great, and the sauce they were served with was amazing, but the real kicker, the habanero sorbet....seriously who would have thought that would taste so good. You can taste the habanero but it is automatically chilled in your mouth by the sorbet, need i say more.Decor:Not stuffy and more spacious then Traif, have a lot of awesome paintings around the place, and a cool bar. The lighting is also better then traif, so you can see the people your with well, and the place has a great vibe to it.The service was awesome, the waitress and the hostess were both accommodating and made their presence known the perfect amount.The tough part will be where do I go now that I had Xixa....Traif or Xixa, either way can't go wrong.....I'm only partial to traif because I have been their way to many times and have awesome memories from their.",5.0

"Well if you have read my previous reviews you know I loved Traif so when searching for my next dining adventure I was excited to give Xixa a try. They did not disappoint! One really cool thing they do that I wish Traif did was the 10 course prefix for $40 per person. I was a bit nervous to try it at first because hey they could give you anything and maybe we wouldn't get to try the stuff we wanted the most. They were great and happily took our request when I asked for no fish. I even mentioned that the only fish option I would be up for trying is the ""fish and chips"". They were so great he even had them bring us that as one of the 10 courses. When we saw the 1st course they brought out we were confident we would be full after 10 - they do look small but well planned to make sure you are nice and stuffed by the end. Also, we definitely got 12 dishes, not 10. AMAZING! 2 desserts - hell yes. Here are a few things we tried that stand out in my mind: chicken sopes - tasty little tortillas with chicken liver which was surprisingly delish (I've never had liver!)foie gras - DELICIOUS - very sweet/savory type dish I adored it but it was a bit sweet for the BFfish & chips - it was not as I was expecting, kind of ceviche likeduck lettuce wraps - SO good, this is how duck was mean to be tasted. The lettuce was crisp and the duck so juicycarnitas of pork belly - I am so torn about pork belly as it is usually too fatty for me but this was my dream come true.. perfectly succulent meat.churros with jalapeno sorbet - separate the sorbet was weird but all together it was amazing and very freshOne thing I am really sad about is no carrots for us to try!

Chef Jason Marcus did it again! I've been a regular at his restaurant Traif just down the block from Xixa. The food is absolutely delicious. The decor is top notch. It's a great place to come to on a date or with a group of friends. I'm going to be coming back here for years!,5.0

"Xixa offers brilliant food, a great atmosphere, and a very extensive selection of aged wines at reasonable prices that I consider unique. If you are an oenophile or if you just want to experience the effect of age on wines, I highly recommend stopping by at Xixa. As great as the wines are, the main attraction remains the outstanding food. We had a 1996 Barbaresco that was incredibly balanced and light, followed by an equally balanced but much bolder Ridge Cabernet from 2000. For desert, the chef brought us a spectacular French desert wine that had matured for at least a decade and a half and was deliciously concentrated. Now there is no shortage of good and aged wine in the city, but I don't recall having seen a wine list as accessible as Xixa's with this amount of wines in their prime maturity. I would come back just for that.The four of us had about 12 dishes from the menu which we shared. All of them were nuanced, interesting, creative, and very enjoyable. The highlights for me were the Hamachi ceviche, short ribs, brussels sprouts (which I had failed to enjoy prior to this dinner), and the carrots. It would take me too long to describe all the different ways in which those were not your standard Mexican dishes with exciting flavor and texture combinations that thrilled us. Every one of our dishes was executed perfectly. We all enjoyed our evening greatly and though our expectations were high, Xixa exceeded them with an impressive ease.  We've liked Xixa a lot more than many of the more well-known eateries in the city and we will most definitely be back often. Highly recommended.",5.0
"Well if you have read my previous reviews you know I loved Traif so when searching for my next dining adventure I was excited to give Xixa a try. They did not disappoint! One really cool thing they do that I wish Traif did was the 10 course prefix for $40 per person. I was a bit nervous to try it at first because hey they could give you anything and maybe we wouldn't get to try the stuff we wanted the most. They were great and happily took our request when I asked for no fish. I even mentioned that the only fish option I would be up for trying is the ""fish and chips"". They were so great he even had them bring us that as one of the 10 courses. When we saw the 1st course they brought out we were confident we would be full after 10 - they do look small but well planned to make sure you are nice and stuffed by the end.

"I'm normally not much of a fan of fancy Mexican food, but Xixa does it pretty well. We were here for a friend's birthday dinner, and so the entire table participated in a sort of tasting menu put together by the chef - taking away the hassle of having to decide what to order for the group to share. Highlights:Mexican-style edamame - This was good - spicy and appetizing.Skate - This was also good - lightly breaded, fried and cooked in a sweet red sauce.Duck lettuce wraps - It was kind of fun to put this together, but the banana puree was a strange complement.Carne asada - Perfectly cooked meat, but not quite enough of it.Carrots ""elote"" - This was simply strips of grilled carrot adorned with cheese, a really weird take on the classic Mexican corn.At the recommendation of our very knowledgeable bartender, I had a couple of glasses of the Elbling, which was light and crisp, and really good.

"Great spot! Came here the other night for a Yelp Elite event and was really impressed. Upon walking in, I was handed a delicious little tomatillo cocktail shooter - I had no idea you could make a cocktail out of tomatillo without it tasting like salsa verde. It was sweet but unlike anything else I've ever had. Good start to the night! Next drink was the deconstructed margarita: I think this was more of a presentation play - as others have mentioned, it looks crazy cool - three big cubes of frozen juice with a shot of tequila artfully poured over it. But there were some logistical issues I had with this drink - the cubes didn't melt fast enough so most of the time you were drinking straight up tequila, and once they did start melting, they melted at different paces. The final drink helped finished the cocktails on a stronger note - a shot of tequila with a nice refreshing apple purée smoothie. Just plain good and simple.But the food was really the star at Xixa. I tried a little bit of everything, and these little bites just make me want more. - Guacamole: They even managed to make something so standard taste so good. It was chock full of chunks of various marinated veggies, and served with awesome rice puff crackers.- Coconut crusted frog legs: There are only a few places I've found that will serve you frog legs. Crusting them with coconut flakes was pretty genius because it kept all the tasty juices locked inside. And yes, it tasted kinda like chicken.- Shrimp ceviche: Served on a little tortilla chip and topped with a delicious heart of palm, crema and roe. Mmmm.- Duck liver: Rich and savory sweet, but there were some textural issues here, as in, there was no texture. Soft duck liver on some sort of spongy bread pudding-like thingie (actual culinary term). Tasty though but it really needed some sort of crunch or fresh veggie to brighten it up.- Lamb meatballs: I think I had about 4 of these! They were so good! Tender and spiced with cumin and nutmeg and topped with crema. - Carrot elotes: I am a huge fan of corn elotes and these were a nice spin on the original. Not sure how I feel about it as a baby carrot though - I think I would have liked these more if it was on a more full sized carrot. Maybe they do serve it this way regularly but just opted for the baby carrots for this mass feeding Yelp event.- Quesadilla: Unique in that it used gouda cheese and some sort of cured meat. Maybe too much gouda though - it kept getting stuck in my teeth. Not cute.- Nachos: More cheese issues with this one! Poor chunks of meat and maybe beans (couldn't tell what was under there really) were basically suffocated by a thick congealed layer of cheese. There was no way any chip was going to be able to dip in there. - Green pozole: This was by far the best dish all night. Creamy soup with fresh peas, hominy and fava beans. Sounds simple but it was so complex and savory that it was taking everything in me not to lick the bowl clean. Some kinks but this place knows what it's doing. I'll certainly be back for a full meal!",4.0

"I've been to this place twice, and both times I absolutely loved the food.  It is inventive and tasty.  The most recent time, my friends and I were encouraged to order the tasting menu, which seemed in the end to be a really good idea, especially if you are an adventurous eater.Love the ambiance and the music. It's sexy!  A great place to come on a date.  I also got to make out with my date in the unisex bathroom, always an added bonus.The only negative I have to report (and this is why I'm giving 4 stars) was this weird vibe we got from a couple of dueling hipster servers, who seemed to be at odds with each other and seemed to be competing to wait on us.  One server would come and take our order, and then another would arrive and take our order again, insisting that the first server didn't know what he was doing.  It freaked us out a little, what with the tequila and all, and made for some confusion. It was pretty funny though, watching the frantic hipsters run around and hate on each other. Guys! Lighten up! You work at a Mexican restaurant.",4.0
"Having two weeks post meal to think about my experience here, I have gotten even angrier . I wrote the manager of Traiff to complain (XiXa has no contact info) and never even got a reply back. We spent over $700 for the smallest amount of food. We were charged a 23% tip and we had no waiter or waitress. The busboys were the only ones who came by. The food was just decent, the little we had. I mean come on, 8 scallops for 8 people, 6 chips and a small amount of guacamole, again chips and melted cheese, a rib each, a sliver of carrot each, and a few other items that I can't even remember. Tiny morsels of food.  The only part of the meal that was more substantial was dessert. By then we were all disgusted and still starving. This restaurant stinks and the management obviously doesn't care enough to reply to a very unhappy group of people.",1.0
"update -gave Xixa a second chance, went in late one night for cocktails and a few small plates.. 1st - the place was not very busy.. has the mega-hype subsided?  Or just an off night?  I have no idea.2nd - as noted before, the cocktail/bar/wine program here is the bomb.  bartender was great, she wasn't very busy, so had time to chat, recommend (which is necessary, drink menu requires explanation)..   I opted for one of the cocktail cubes mixed with a nice Joven Mezcal.  The drinks were excellent.3rd - the food was very good, although we only tried two dishes.  we had guacamole with chicharrón de queso and mole scallops with corn risotto.  Both were delicious.  they definitely redeemed themselves a bit, but we only popped in for drinks and a snack, so I'm not ready to give them full forgiveness for the clusterfuck that was our first attempt.  we'll be back.",4.0

"came for dinner with friends (total 4) when we realized making reservations for Traif was just a mission too much for us to handle..we had the chef's tasting menu option to make ordering a little easier...now to be fair, 2 of the 4 people (hubs and i) are not very daring eaters, so maybe we should have foreseen not LOVING the menu options..some of the dishes i remember having (or at least eye-ing...)Mexico-City Style Sauteed Edamame arbol chile, lime, toasted garlic.   easily delicious, because well, i can make this at home too :) Grilled Carrots ""Elote"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, dill.   perfectly cooked without being mushy and baby-food like..full of flavorFoie Gras & Pork Belly Pozole roast tomatoes, hominy, ancho-guajillo broth.   a bit mush for my sensory palate..""Steak Tacos"" chimole tortillas, roasted bone marrow, steak tartare, marmalade.    the bone marrow was spectacular...being preggo, i was not allowed to try the tartare, but it looked promisingGuacamole ""Nam Prik Num"" avocado, roasted tomato, poblano, puffed rice, jicama, carrot, etc.    a little spicy, but also a little refreshing..weird.don't remember dessert..but there were also ribs in some chocolate sauce - too weird of a combination for our taste buds.overall - the ambiance is very appropriate for the area and hippied out..a great place for groups if people in the group are willing to try a little of everything..the portioning is done just right, everyone has enough to not get full off one particular dish",3.0
"This is probably the most perfect meal I have had in New York in a couple of years.It was my birthday, had enough mescal to make margaritas out of my sweat, and decided to do the tasting menu.To start off, this place is an unmarked door along the BQE/Havemeyer intersection of South Williamsburg, and damn you are a sexy beast of a restaurant. Crowd is hip, smart, and within the 25-35 year old range.Highlights of the night are:1) Corn-flan tamales, amazing and topped with king crab. A beautiful dish to say the least.2)Foie Gras, two perfectly seared pieces of foie atop some kind of grilled chipotle pineapple. There's other stuff in there, but I think I blacked out after a few bites. 3) Rock Shrimp Gorditas, spicy, umami, amazing fried little pieces of awesomeness!Basically anything you order will be good and will have you thinking of the next time you want to come back, cause you can't eat it all in one sitting.",5.0
"I wanted to take my girlfriend to Traif for our 4 year anniversary tonight (Happy Anniversary Sweety x3) but it was near impossible to get a decent timed dinner reservation on a Friday night. So instead I tried their sister restaurant down the street Xixa and was able to book a table right away. Our server instructed us that everything on the menu was small plates meant to be shared so around 2-4 plate per person was the norm. We ordered a total of six plates and soon everything arriving at the table 2 plates at a time. First to come was Blistered Shishito Peppers atop a bed of Spicy Watermelon followed by the Guacamole ""Nam Prik Num."" The shishito peppers were good but the accompanying watermelon provided the spice and was refreshing. The guacamole was good too but it took some getting used too. It was loaded with veggies and didn't have lime juice in it. The dish came with an assortment of veggies to dip.Next were the Spicy Shrimp Gorditas and then Scallop Ceviche. Both were incredible! The shrimp gorditas resembled a shrimp ceviche inside deep fried rice cake. The scallop ceviche was accompanied with mashed avocados and heart of palm. Delish!Finally came the meats. We had the Lamb Meatballs and the Duck Lettuce Wraps. The meatballs really reminded me of a middle eastern dish with intense flavors of cumin and mint. I wasn't a big fan of the duck lettuce wraps. I didn't particularly like the strong flavors of the raisins and/or roasted bananas that accompanied the duck. The sweetness threw off the taste for me.For dessert we ordered the Bunuelo Sundae which came with banana and cajeta ice creams and a black sesame mousse. This was sooooo delicious. I t was easily my favorite part of the meal.Based off my experience at Xixa, I would really like to experience Traif and see if it's just as good. Given the opportunity, I'd definitely come back and try some other dishes. There was a squash blossom dish that I really wanted to try but unfortunately they had run out.",4.0
"OMG SO GOOD.everything here was amazIng.  like, everything.  also, the decor was super cute.  not much else to say (in a good way) bc literally every dish was like gold.  everyone who gave this place 4 or less stars is an asshole.for those who live in manhattan and think brooklyn is bullshit, maybe, maybe not, but go to xixa, it's worth it.",5.0
"Lightning strikes twice only four doors down on S. 4th Street.  The food at both Traif and its new sister restaurant Xixa (pronounced Shiksa, as in the ever so slightly condescending Yiddish word for non-Jewish young girl) are both some of the most innovative in Brooklyn, heck, in NYC, and I daresay the Western Hemisphere.  It was with great anticipation that we walked into Xixa, having had a love affair with Traif for the past few years.  How would it compare?  Let me tell you boychick, Shayna Medelas and all you goys and shiksas out there, Xixa is superb.Whereas Traif leans toward glorification of the pig flesh, Xixa is more of a Traif meets haute Mexican cuisine with traces of Thai, Chinese, French and several other world cultures mixed in.  Less of an emphasis on pork, though the Carnitas was sublime.Nice vibe, more laid back than Traif, lower noise level, nicely lit and designed--still with the Billyburg feel, but a bit more upscale, and without the open kitchen.Small plates, and some of the standouts include:- Braised duck in lettuce leaf, so succulent and tasty- The grilled carrot elote blew me away. This has got to be one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. Long slender steamed and grilled carrots with a crema and cheese.  So, so, so delicious! - The corn flan tamale with blue crab changed my life for the better.- The beef tartare taco with fresh bone marrow.- Foi Gras with pineapple is outstanding.- Rice and beans (definitely not typical).- The drunken shrimp in any other restaurant would be a standout, but is the mere mortal here. Very good, but not insanely terrific like all the other dishes.- Excellent scallop cevice.- Delicious guacamole with rice crisps and vegetables.Dessert only gets better:- Salted churros with passion fruit crema and jalapeño sorbet- A ""sundae"" with banana and peanut flavor-The pumpkinseed cake was so flavorful, it left me wondering how the brainchild and chef behind such incredible food can coax such flavors.No cocktails, but instead an excellent wine list (many by the glass). And a top selection of mezcals. I couldn't help but try the duck fat rendered mezcal. It's served with fried duck fat and you pop a few granules in your mouth, followed by a sip of tequila, followed by a small slice of grapefruit.  Oh yes.Be sure Xixa is on your short list, and very high up.  There's no sign on the door, it's practically under the Williamsburg Bridge on ramp, a few doors down from Traif, and perhaps one of the best new restaurants in NYC. Oh, and excellent prices for such food mastery.",5.0
"You know that feeling you get when you see something so cute you just want to squeeze it to death or punch it? (no?) Anyway, that's how I felt after every single bite of food at Xixa. I seriously wanted to punch myself in the mouth because it was so good I didn't know what to do with myself.I went with 3 other friends, and instead of doing the tasting menu, we decided to pick 12(?) or so dishes ourselves and share. EVERY SINGLE dish was delicious. There was nothing I didn't like. Alcohol consists of a slightly overwhelming and vast wine list  (server will help you decide),  tequilas & mezcals. Highlights as far as food goes included:Drunken Shrimp (my absolute favorite)Foie gras al pastorBaby OctopusGrilled carrots elote (!!!!!)Guacamole of artichokesSpicy rock shrimp gorditas (this dish had scallions, something I hate. Yet I happily put a crapload in my mouth and didn't give a hoot)Everyone at the table raved about the Fundido (Truffles, cheese, and chorizo). The cheeze/chorizo was absolutely amazing - but I am one of the only people who isn't too fond of truffles. Despite this, I took a huge heaping forkload of the cheese/chorizo and thought I'd cry it was so good. We didn't have time to try a dessert as a reservation was coming in as we were finishing, but we were so stuffed that it was probably a good thing. I'll be back. And I'm taking everyone I know here and if they don't like it, I will question why they are in my life.",5.0
"I've been to this place twice, and both times I absolutely loved the food.  It is inventive and tasty.  The most recent time, my friends and I were encouraged to order the tasting menu, which seemed in the end to be a really good idea, especially if you are an adventurous eater.Love the ambiance and the music. It's sexy!  A great place to come on a date.  I also got to make out with my date in the unisex bathroom, always an added bonus.The only negative I have to report (and this is why I'm giving 4 stars) was this weird vibe we got from a couple of dueling hipster servers, who seemed to be at odds with each other and seemed to be competing to wait on us.  One server would come and take our order, and then another would arrive and take our order again, insisting that the first server didn't know what he was doing.  It freaked us out a little, what with the tequila and all, and made for some confusion. It was pretty funny though, watching the frantic hipsters run around and hate on each other. Guys! Lighten up! You work at a Mexican restaurant.",4.0
"Having two weeks post meal to think about my experience here, I have gotten even angrier . I wrote the manager of Traiff to complain (XiXa has no contact info) and never even got a reply back. We spent over $700 for the smallest amount of food. We were charged a 23% tip and we had no waiter or waitress. The busboys were the only ones who came by. The food was just decent, the little we had. I mean come on, 8 scallops for 8 people, 6 chips and a small amount of guacamole, again chips and melted cheese, a rib each, a sliver of carrot each, and a few other items that I can't even remember. Tiny morsels of food.  The only part of the meal that was more substantial was dessert. By then we were all disgusted and still starving. This restaurant stinks and the management obviously doesn't care enough to reply to a very unhappy group of people.",1.0
"update -gave Xixa a second chance, went in late one night for cocktails and a few small plates.. 1st - the place was not very busy.. has the mega-hype subsided?  Or just an off night?  I have no idea.2nd - as noted before, the cocktail/bar/wine program here is the bomb.  bartender was great, she wasn't very busy, so had time to chat, recommend (which is necessary, drink menu requires explanation)..   I opted for one of the cocktail cubes mixed with a nice Joven Mezcal.  The drinks were excellent.3rd - the food was very good, although we only tried two dishes.  we had guacamole with chicharrón de queso and mole scallops with corn risotto.  Both were delicious.  they definitely redeemed themselves a bit, but we only popped in for drinks and a snack, so I'm not ready to give them full forgiveness for the clusterfuck that was our first attempt.  we'll be back.",4.0
"Cocktails: The chipotle ""old fashioned"" was an epic fail... Overpowering and pungent... It dominates the entire experience. Had to order a cava to wash the nightmare away! Dinner:Duck Lettuce wraps, QuesoFundido, Chicken Sopes - absolutely phenomenal!! Great service and ambiance!",4.0
"came for dinner with friends (total 4) when we realized making reservations for Traif was just a mission too much for us to handle..we had the chef's tasting menu option to make ordering a little easier...now to be fair, 2 of the 4 people (hubs and i) are not very daring eaters, so maybe we should have foreseen not LOVING the menu options..some of the dishes i remember having (or at least eye-ing...)Mexico-City Style Sauteed Edamame arbol chile, lime, toasted garlic.   easily delicious, because well, i can make this at home too :) Grilled Carrots ""Elote"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, dill.   perfectly cooked without being mushy and baby-food like..full of flavorFoie Gras & Pork Belly Pozole roast tomatoes, hominy, ancho-guajillo broth.   a bit mush for my sensory palate..""Steak Tacos"" chimole tortillas, roasted bone marrow, steak tartare, marmalade.    the bone marrow was spectacular...being preggo, i was not allowed to try the tartare, but it looked promisingGuacamole ""Nam Prik Num"" avocado, roasted tomato, poblano, puffed rice, jicama, carrot, etc.    a little spicy, but also a little refreshing..weird.don't remember dessert..but there were also ribs in some chocolate sauce - too weird of a combination for our taste buds.overall - the ambiance is very appropriate for the area and hippied out..a great place for groups if people in the group are willing to try a little of everything..the portioning is done just right, everyone has enough to not get full off one particular dish",3.0
"This is probably the most perfect meal I have had in New York in a couple of years.It was my birthday, had enough mescal to make margaritas out of my sweat, and decided to do the tasting menu.To start off, this place is an unmarked door along the BQE/Havemeyer intersection of South Williamsburg, and damn you are a sexy beast of a restaurant. Crowd is hip, smart, and within the 25-35 year old range.Highlights of the night are:1) Corn-flan tamales, amazing and topped with king crab. A beautiful dish to say the least.2)Foie Gras, two perfectly seared pieces of foie atop some kind of grilled chipotle pineapple. There's other stuff in there, but I think I blacked out after a few bites. 3) Rock Shrimp Gorditas, spicy, umami, amazing fried little pieces of awesomeness!Basically anything you order will be good and will have you thinking of the next time you want to come back, cause you can't eat it all in one sitting.",5.0

"A hasidic Jew and a shiksa walk into a bar... called Xixa. Xixa, which is apparently the Spanish spelling of ""shiksa,"" is a gorgeous new Mexican restaurant (I know right??? Spanish/shiksa... other than the link to traif, it makes no sense) in a dusty corner of hipster Williamsburg. It is aesthetically beautiful, the food is the best I've ever had in Brooklyn... but the service... oy vey! It was really busy when we (yes, hasidic Jew and shiksa) came in last night. The hostess told us we could sit while she cleared off a two-top for us, so we hung out on the couch for a few minutes. The aesthetic of this place is seriously beautiful - warm and cozy and almost-rustic-ish. I love the wild cotton sprigs in vases, and the warm blue-ish color of the walls I'd really like to steal for my room. The hostess was oddly over-accomodating as we waited (and didn't know at this point, due to winter weather gear, about our soon-to-be-revealed identities - so in no way do I think her behavior was prejudicial) and kept updating us about every minute as to the status of our table. My dining companion noted that it seemed like the waitstaff were all acting (and over-acting) - and this became more and more clear as the night went on. So, the table clears off and the hostess tells us that it's a tight squeeze to get back past the bar (it is slightly cramped, but have you been to Bario Chino in the LES? THAT'S tight - this was fine) and like starts telling people at the bar to move (wtfff). Okay, maybe she does that to everyone and not just curvy shiksas - so I let that it go, and basically ignored her as I slipped just fine through the crowded space that no one had budged in (eye roll). But when we sat down, she also made a big show of saying how ""comfortable"" the chairs were (they are bigger and more plush than the ones in the front for the Beautiful People). I decided to completely ignore her comments about this ridiculousness, but instead started composing Yelp review notes in my head. I mean, really? Anyway, they give you the wine/tequila menu first, it's true. We weren't about to get fershikkert so the by-the-bottle-only wine list wasn't on our agenda for the evening. They do have a few beer selections, but oddly enough there's no cocktail menu. I totally get that the focus is tequila and mezcal, and I love me some mezcal - but I was really hoping for a nice, well-crafted tequila cocktail. Jew boo would have had a drink too, had there been cocktails - but as it was I ordered a mezcal, recommended by our equally-as-awkward server, which was totally delicious regardless. Thennnnn they let us order. Oish. So, about our server. It was the weirdest thing ever, definitely the most forced and awkward serving experience I've ever had... it was like every question I asked, he assumed I asked because I was in some way displeased. I asked about cocktails, and he said something to the affect of an apology for me not liking tequila (I love good tequila! WTF! I was just asking if you had cocktails). When he asked how we were doing with the menu and I said that between the two of us, we don't eat meat or shellfish, he basically couldn't function. Just chill, seriously, people. We will figure it out. At Xixa, they want you to order all your plates at once - which seems like an inappropriate request me. With tapas usually you usually can't tell how full you're going to be after just a few... especially here, where the tapas are extraordinary minuscule (but seriously delicious and beautifully plated). But, we'll go back to the continuing weird service in a minute. THE FOOD HERE IS AMAZING! More than five stars!!! Holy mother of God (or not! haha), what was happening in my mouth?! Admittedly snobbishly small portions, I have to say it was completely worth it. The ""nachos"" were the only miss. I wouldn't order them again. The esquites dish was excellent, the edamame was the most flavorful I have ever had, and the melted cheese dish with tortillas (ironically not the nachos!) was our favourite. We also got dessert - the churros, which were out of control with the cranberry sorbet and a creme brule dipping sauce. But, sorry, I still can't get past the service. Our server dropped my fork and my credit card on the floor... and every time he asked me how I liked something, I told him, ""omg it's so good."" He then proceeded to apologize and tell me he was sorry I didn't like it?! Dude, either you are so caught up in your act that you're not listening... or you really are not very smart. It's too bad the service at Xixa is so awkward - as noted by other reviewers, because otherwise this place would be five stars. Oh and, just sayin, this place needs a new name. It's just confusing, and like the service, it's pushing it to make it work.",3.0
"I came across Xixa because my friends and I were waiting to dine at Triaf and boy am I glad we stumbled upon this place. As we sat down to get ready to order our drinks I was bewildered at their drink selection. I noticed two things, one, I didn't recognize any of the bottle selection they had and secondly, it was ALL TEQUILA. As a bourbon drinker, I almost ran for the hills. It was a good thing I didn't. The bartenders there are extremely sweet and knowledgeable, after telling them about my love for all things bourbon she is knew exactly what I would like. After a few minutes, she made my drink and said this is an old fashioned with a twist. Apparently they are able to infuse an old fashioned ice cube with an orange peel, two chilli peppers, and bitters. She slowly poured the mezcal over the ice and gave it a couple of good stirs. I took the first sip and looked at her saying this tastes like a campfire. She told me to wait a few minutes as the mezcal melts the ice, the flavors will start to change. After a few minutes of chatting she told me to try the cocktail again. ***MIND BLOWN*** I don't know if it was magic or drugs because this drink was amazing! She said as the ice melted it will infuse with the mescal, at a certain point you the sweetness from the ice cube will balance out the smokiness of the mezcal. I am NOT a tequila drinker but I will change just for this drink. One of the best old fashions.",4.0
"I went there on a Tues night with my hubby and the place was a bit empty (to be expected, I guess) but we both loved the food! The white fish tartare was tasty but still refreshing, the mole ribs were delicious and the cheese dish was surprisingly multi dimensional.

Just hope it gets more packed on the weekends, because there were only 2 other groups when we came in..",4.0

I noticed two things, one, I didn't recognize any of the bottle selection they had and secondly, it was ALL TEQUILA. As a bourbon drinker, I almost ran for the hills. It was a good thing I didn't. The bartenders there are extremely sweet and knowledgeable, after telling them about my love for all things bourbon she is knew exactly what I would like. After a few minutes, she made my drink and said this is an old fashioned with a twist. Apparently they are able to infuse an old fashioned ice cube with an orange peel, two chilli peppers, and bitters. She slowly poured the mezcal over the ice and gave it a couple of good stirs. I took the first sip and looked at her saying this tastes like a campfire. She told me to wait a few minutes as the mezcal melts the ice, the flavors will start to change. After a few minutes of chatting she told me to try the cocktail again. ***MIND BLOWN*** I don't know if it was magic or drugs because this drink was amazing! She said as the ice melted it will infuse with the mescal, at a certain point you the sweetness from the ice cube will balance out the smokiness of the mezcal. I am NOT a tequila drinker but I will change just for this drink. One of the best old fashions.",4.0
"I went there on a Tues night with my hubby and the place was a bit empty (to be expected, I guess) but we both loved the food! The white fish tartare was tasty but still refreshing, the mole ribs were delicious and the cheese dish was surprisingly multi dimensional. The braised duck in lettuce wrap felt a little too meaty without enough texture or depth, I was a little disappointed. Our server was great, knew his stuff and appreciated his honesty. Just hope it gets more packed on the weekends, because there were only 2 other groups when we came in..",4.0
"Excellent tapas, the steak tacos with bone marrow butter are incredible. Drinks are par, atmosphere is Brooklyn's version of upscale.",4.0
Favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. Can't go wrong with any choices. Perfect place for an intimate dinner with friends. INCREDIBLE DRINKS! I wish I could buy their bourboned whiskey by the bottle.,5.0
"Beautifully crafted tasting menu and for the money well worth it (10 dishes, evenly sized), even if I wasn't ready to eat bone marrow per se their presentation made me want to try anything they put on the plate. Of course this is a sister restaurant to Traif which does spectacularly wel and so it's no surprise this restaurant is hitting the spot. HIghly recommend both places. You won't be disappointed.",4.0
"I hate to be one of those guys, but that's who I am. I'm one of those beer geek types. They did not seem to know where the Davidson IPA was from. They told me, ""Oregon"".

I did not like it. Carrots were ok but duck overcooked. Rest of the dishes I do not even remember.The margarita cubes are gimmicky. The hostess was not very pleasant.

The table behind my back was occupied so the hostess who had to pass me on the way to the kitchen suggested I move closer to the bar. Sorry mami...

"Xixa is one of the best tapas restaurant I've eaten at! From the atmosphere to the food, I give it an A+! I wish I could come here more often but it's a little out of the way for me, however, totally worth the trip when I do make it over there. The food is exquisite and very original. The presentation of it, as well as the mix of ingredients, is spectacular. Their wine selection is excellent, too, although you better know what to order because the wait staff didn't seem very knowledgeable when it came to the wines. The prices are very reasonable for a tapas restaurant and you are guaranteed a great meal!",5.0

Standouts for me included the honey butter coated carrots, duck wraps, and lamb meatballs. What I like about Xixa (and Traif) the most is where they are.

Had my birthday here this year . Party of just over 20 and we had the tasting menu . Everything that was brought out was delicious . The scallops and lamb meatballs were some of my favorites.

"There is nothing in the world like a high-end, small-plate place that delivers. Xixa is such a place.We went with the chef's selection, and were not disappointed. We ended up eating something like $150 worth of food for $80. These guys play on the adventurous side with flavor combinations, hitting the bullseye almost every time. Rhubarb-jalapeno sorbet registers most strongly in my memory. Charred octopus had the fantastic cleavage that (apparently) comes from good prep, along with the savory, tangy taste of great barbecue. Shrimp-salad-esque in a fried cornbread something-or-other was perfect, the crunch of the shell giving way to the blocky tenderness of the shrimp.One negative recommendation: avoid the skate in mole sauce. Sauce is too gritty/bitter, and the skate gets completely lost.Overall, blissful. Service was friendly and charming, and the price was very right for what it was.",5.0

Concentrate more on the food than the cocktails!  Maybe cocktail is not the right word actually when you serve a liquor straight and some accoutrements on the side.3.More waiters, less food runners, idk just a thought - i'd like to not wait 15 minutes to order another drink, i don't care how nice the waiter is.4.

"We tried to go to Traif last night and were diverted by the hostess to Xixa, despite the fact that I'm pretty sure that empty two-top did not have a reservation on it. I was skeptical, since my companion is a vegetarian, and going to Traif already stretches the limit of the menu. However, the service at at Traif previously accommodated our veg needs, so we decided to trust the hostess. But I was kinda pissed because they are not the same kind of cuisine and I think they were just trying to make the place look full for opening week.We were right next to the cash register where servers kept congregating and not taking our drink order, confusingly chosen from the wine menu organized by women instead of types. I get it's a concept, I just apparently am not savvy enough to find the things I like on it. The service after we put our drinks in was okay, I felt like the server was confused that we wanted to order just five things and see how full we were, then maybe order more, because you never know with veg dishes! again I wanted to say you made us come here, work with me.The carrot elote and chilaquiles were great, would totally order again if I chanced to return. Wouldn't say the same for the artichoke guac (but I liked the cheese chips), definitely not for the chilled nachos (too much quince), and the brussel sprouts were okay. There were other veg options we didn't try but they seemed less entree-y and more side-y, and I didn't want more insubstantial tiny plates. We skipped dessert, but got a tasty chocolate bit as a parting gift.The interior is cool, but takes itself a bit too seriously, maybe it's the paintings. The chairs at the two person tables make you sit far away form your companion if you don't want to put your elbows on the table. The bathroom looks lame from the 90s trying to be the future.Anyway, this is for the vegetarians out there: chilaquiles and carrot elote.",3.0
"Damn. I went back to Xixa last night, since I had enjoyed it so much when I went last Tuesday. Everything we had there was amazing, and although the service was a little bit off, it was still a great meal and experience. Upon returning, my experience was inconsistent with the first time. Perhaps they are working out some kinks, I think there is definitely a lot of potential here but this time they didn't quite hit the nail on the head. First off, one thing that is consistent is the bizarre service. I mean just truly strange. The staff at Xixa just seem a little bit like they're all in the twilight zone. From blank looks to someone sitting at our table to talk to us, it's just been kind of wierd everytime. Over the course of the night last night, the chair at the table next to us was left out (not pushed in), every staff member bumped into it every time they left our table, yet no one pushed it in.They also brought us some food we didn't even order, but as a mistake, not an on-the-house like last time. Some other less-favorable elements of the dinner: the bandera-style tequila I had so raved about has been changed. Previously it was a large helping of a delicious pomegranate puree that I couldn't stop thinking of. This time around it was a pomegranate-tomato mixture about half the size. It wasn't nearly as good and I found myself having to ration the puree and lime to last through my tequila. Additionally, any of the new dishes we had tried, such as the drunken shrimp and the scallop ceviche just tasted like they were swimming in a salty store-bought teriyaki sauce, I didn't enjoy them. And lastly, the tallegio fundido that we ordered was hardly a fundido and more like a solidified chunck of cheese, totally hard. If they were going for anything similar to the provoletta at Tabare, there is much work to be done. That being said, that first bite of the fois gras al pastor was still heavenly, and so I hope that Xixa is able to fine-tune their game a bit. I want to love it here based on my first experience, but was a little thrown by the second time around. Dinner still came out to $48 each including tip, for two tequilas and 7 tapas, so overall it was still worth it.",3.0

We opted for the unknown and headed to XiXa.XiXa was quite dead -- and I have a feeling that won't be for much longer. We ordered 5 plates and got a treat from the kitchen added to the order.1. Charred green onions & potatoes in some ridonkulus sauce. We licked it up with our fingers...2. Short ribs -- we sucked the bones clean.3. The corn (elote off the cob; it has a name that slips me). It was cooked in tom yum soup. We fought over this dish and drank the broth until it was gone. We said ""Next time we're ordering two of these."" And for only $5, why not?4. The surprise dish came out from the kitchen. I believe they said it was the carnitas? Pork, pineapple, on top a tamale or sweet bread of some sort. It was sweet and spicy. Not our favorite but happy to have the taste.5. Rice & beans with green chorizo. Definitely a higher end risotto vs. your typical/traditional rice & beans. I recommend it because we also wiped this dish clean but it wasn't our favorite overall. It was very filling for a small plate which is a good dish to have with a small plate exclusive dinner, right? You want to leave hungry.6. Fundido was saved for last. Truffles, cheese, and chorizo... Have you seen the Simpsons episode where Lisa goes crazy over truffles? That was us.

Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable of the food.  This is sister restaurant to Traif( which is also outstanding) but I prefer xixa.  The food is so well cooked and presented.  The dishes have so much though and effort put into them.  You can taste in every bit.   I have been here a minimum of four times. Have tried something different each time. Not one even okay dish.  All above average.  The carnita may be top five favorite things I have ever eaten.     I will go back again and again.,5.0

The carrots elote are sick!!!!! The tres leches dessert was also very good. I would say two people should go with six dishes minimum. Nice place, comfortable and not too tight. Service was good and friendly. Overall i am looking forward to going back and trying more dishes.",4.0
Let me start by saying this is my favorite restaurant to eat.  I have been here multiple times and never fails to amaze me.   The staff and service are great. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable of the food.  This is sister restaurant to Traif( which is also outstanding) but I prefer xixa.  The food is so well cooked and presented.  The dishes have so much though and effort put into them.  You can taste in every bit.   I have been here a minimum of four times. Have tried something different each time. Not one even okay dish.  All above average.  The carnita may be top five favorite things I have ever eaten.     I will go back again and again.,5.0
"Walked in Saturday night with my roommate with no reservation. The hostess was very accommodating and said she had a reservation at 8:30pm, but we could sit now and then move once the reservation of 4 showed up. Long story short by the time the part of 4 showed up another table was available for them, so we didn't have to move. Either way the communication between the hostess and waiter was impeccable as our waiter was preparing us for ""the move."" On top of that, the entire wait staff was attentive and kind. The food was remarkable. Ordered the guacamole, shrimp gorditas, steak tacos, and duck lettuce wraps. Steak tacos were not what we expected but were delicious. Yes, you are going to get a big piece of bone marrow on the plate. My roommate and I agreed the shrimp gorditas were are favorite. Drinks were fine, not very strong but good. Overall, I'd definitely come back to this place.",5.0
"A group of 10 of us had the group dinner and the food was fantastic, especially for $40 a head. Only problem was what we perceived as a bit of deception in the drinks menu: the beers that they list as being from Denmark are actually brewed elsewhere (ours was from South Carolina). Their stance was that because the brewing company (Evil Twin) is Danish, it's OK to say that the beer is from Denmark on the menu and charge $22 for a big bottle. But Evil Twin brews each of their many beers in lots of breweries, including SC like the one we ordered. We expressed disappointment and they comped it but without much grace or apology.",4.0
"Definitely get the chef's tasting menu. For $40, you get to sample the most popular dishes but if there's something that catches your eye on the menu, you can make a request to include that dish if possible. Completely worth it!After having an awesome experience at Traif, we were not let down by Xixa, the more adventurous and laid back brother :) I can say that I loved each and every dish that was served - the combinations seemed crazy (like tom yum with cheese - i know, disgusting sounding but completely a stroke of genius!)Obviously due to taste preferences, I enjoyed some more than others but there was no dish that was not a party in my mouth. We sat in plush chairs and took our time with the meal - an awesome date night for sure!",5.0
"Traif is good but Xixa takes it one more level, I had one delicious drink there but left completely intoxicated from the flavors. I couldn't stop, I wanted to order every single dish on the menu, My Fiance had to stop me!!!

Thank you Xixa for completely blowing my mind!!!!!",5.0
"Introduced here by Traif. The food is truly amazing and the 40$ chef selection definitely worths it. My favorite one is a dish with duck and mushroom, everyone at my table was impressed by that.Wine selection is plenty but a little pricy.Service is a small dent of the whole experience. We waited a really long time for ordering foods. However the pace of courses were just fine.",4.0
"Went here last week for the first tiime and had a great experience.Order the chef's tasting menu, amazing deal. It included 10 savory dishes, 2 desserts and a bite of chocolate, all for $40 a person. You can make 1 or 2 requests on which dishes you want included. Definitely try the ""steak tacos"" which include bone marrow, steak tartare and some tasty sauces.",5.0

"What has two thumbs and went to Traif on Saturday night without reservations? This guy!Well, talk about a happy accident, because Xixa is awesome.We sat at the bar because 1) it was the only immediately available seating and 2) it didn't look any less comfortable than the somewhat cramped dining space. That said, the ambiance is really nice, with low lighting, iron stools and reclaimed wood accents. Hello, new date spot.We started with duck fat-washed mezcal, which was smoky, complex and exactly what I needed to thaw from an icy walk. Next came bacanora two ways - plain and infused with currants and almonds. I've neved had bacanora before, and I was happy to discover that it's smooth and floral.The infused version was slightly sweeter, almost buttery. Yum!Then came the food menu. It's extensive and felt overwhelming at first. Thankfully, it's organized into ingredient categories, which then are organized from lighter to heavier fare. I have to admit that picking what I wanted was a challenge - everything sounded good. We initially ordered 10 dishes, only to have our server politely suggest that we would be full halfway through (I appreciate the honesty). Regretfully, we narrowed it down to 7.First came two tiny butternut squash cubes. Served at room temperature, they were soft and sweet with hints of spice. Awesome.Then braised artichoke guacamole with peanut salsa. Good stuff - creamy and flavorful, but the real star of this course was chicharron de queso. Cheese chips. You know the crunchy, cheesy stuff that sometimes forms around the edges of a good grilled cheese sandwich? Yeah, well. That. I wish all potato chips in the world would magically turn into chicharrons...Korean chipotle-lime short ribs were delicious. They came with a side of bulghur and mango; very refreshing and complemented the ribs wonderfully.Thai esquites = ridiculous. Probably my favorite dish of the night. Sweet corn floating in a red curry/tom yum broth, generously topped with cotija cheese. I could eat this every day for weeks.The fricadilla was a rich, delicious mess of cheese, chorizo (I think), potatoes, eggs and salsa verde. Just when we thought we couldn't possibly eat another bite, out came the fundido.  After the first bite I looked at my companion and mouthed ""holy shit"", which pretty much sums it up. Unsurprisingly, if you combine cheese, truffles and chorizo, you get something far greater than the sum of its parts. It's the kind of food that makes you tear up out of sheer joy. I think it came with tasty beet pico, but I wasn't 100% sober at that point.For dessert I had banana and chocolate ice cream with black sesame paste. The paste added a slight grittiness to the overall texture, but it wasn't unpleasant by any means. The flavors were mind blowing and I wanted to lick my bowl.All this for around $100? You can't do better. I only regret not having tried the elotes, the scallop dish, the shrimp dish, the salty churros or the tartare tacos. Needless to say, I will be back soon, preferably after fasting for a day or two.",5.0
"Very hip Mexican-inspired tequila / mezcal bar and restaurant in Williamsburg. We ordered the Chef's selection. I think it was around 6 savory dishes, 2 desserts, and 2 amuse-bouches. All the dishes were good. My two favorites were the ceviche and carne asada. I had a very good smokey mezcal...unfortunately I can't remember the name of it. Don't expect to order Don Julio and Patron, they only offer small batch, house infused, or lesser known brands, which I liked a lot.The menu is themed yet adventurous, so you stretch your palate while preserving a home base to return to. I highly recommend this place.",5.0

My bf got there first and tried to put his card down to beat me to the punch (we wrestle over treating the other all the time- I know, gag!) but everyone refused him because they didn't know where he'd sit or who'd serve him. I made a reservation over the phone and the host insisted she couldn't book it until 10pm. When I got there, she knew who I was, I guess I was the only reservation left. My bf had ordered us drinks and I made the mistake of sitting on the low couches by the hosts in the front of the bar while we waited. The poor server for this table came rushing to us and asked if we needed anything. I explained we were just waiting and she walked away, I think annoyed. I think she loses these tables to people waiting all the time, which made me feel kinda bad for her. So we got up and stood by the door with our drinks. While we waited my bf said the bartender insisted he pay for his drink because they don't transfer their tabs to the servers. This is not their fault, but a fluke with the tipping culture, I know. No one wants to help you with anything unless they're getting paid directly for it. And can we blame them? I certainly don't want to work for free. The server was proper, but kind of stern, unapproachable. Not looking for my new best bud when I go out to eat but he was not friendly. But that's ok, sometimes servers can be too friendly so I didn't hold it against him that he never smiled, even when I cracked a joke. I don't smile on command either so why should he? He also immediately took the drink lists away because we'd ordered at the bar, but I really wanted to treat my bf to a whole experience so I had to ask him to bring it back so we could get the tequila flights with our food. I'd read that the tasting menu is where it's at, but my bf is veggie. I asked if we could have half of the options be veggie on the tasting to which he sternly responded with ""No."" There was no explanation as to why or any apology that that couldn't be done. I still didn't hold that against them because I too have worked for tyrant chefs that will not budge on their perfect ""babies"" and lash out on a server if they ask if something can be changed. I would never insist but even a fake ""Sorry, we can't"" would have softened the blow. We kind of make shifted our own tasting by just ordering ALL of the dishes he could eat, which were plenty.We had a sense of humor about it because I insisted it be a special night. My bf looked like he wanted to roll his eyes. He took my cue and we joked about it later as if our servers lived in ""Portlandia."" He did mention on our way out that he felt sometimes like Manhattan felt too close to Brooklyn these days, which made me a little sad. I like that ""the boroughs"" as people annoyingly call it, are getting a bit of their own scene and businesses are thriving so people don't have to spend their money in ""the city."" They can spend it at home for the same awesome food, drinks, and ambiance. I did wish some of these places would retain a little of the old school Brooklyn charm and cut out the over-formalities. Our table was crumbed which is nice but I would have exchanged that for a little warmth.But really, nothing was too obtrusive to deal with. I think it's a must go. If you're undecided, go! You won't regret it. It'll be delicious! But you don't have to go more than once. I'm glad we did! But I don't plan on going back anytime soon.",3.0
"I tried Xixa before I tried Traif and I found the portions at Traif a little bigger.  The dishes/ingredients are very similar though.  I came with my boyfriend without a reservation and were seated at the bar upon arrival.  I don't mind bar seating especially when the bartender is as attentive and personable as the one we had that night.  We ordered a bottle of wine, soft shell crab, ceviche, bone marrow steak tacos, ribs, brussels sprouts and definitely something else I can't remember.  (The menu changes often so I can't even refer back to the menu to jog my memory.)  I really enjoyed every single dish especially the brussels sprouts and very greasy bone marrow steak tacos.  I do like that Xixa's menu is organized by sections unlike Traif that is just a running list in no order.  I like that they give you a palette cleanser before you eat and a complimentary piece of chocolate with the check.  The decor is definitely prettier and more intimate than Traif.  I'm so glad I was able to try both restaurants, very unique and delicious!",5.0
"If you can get past the extreme level of pretension of Xixa, you will have an amazing meal.  To start the evening off, we were greeted by a hostess who on our way to the table explained to us that we had a two hour LIMIT on our table.  They had a large party coming in after us but she said typically we only allow anyone to occupy a table for two hours.  I have never heard a hostess say such a thing before you even sit down.  We almost walked out right then.Next, we were given only drink menus and not food menus.  The food menus did not appear for 20 minutes into our two hour time limit on the table. The menu was amazing.  It was so good we had a hard time deciding what to order and ended up ordering more than we knew we could probably eat because of all the enticing options.Next, an excellent glass of wine appears.  As I am taking about my third sip, our first plate of food arrives.  As the server (not our main server) whips down the plate, he knocks into my wine glass spilling wine on my arm and blouse.  His response is ""whoa whoa"" with a nasty look in my direction like I was somehow suppose to predict he was going to whip down a plate of food at that exact moment I took a sip of wine.  He never apologized and proceeded like I had offended HIM.  I used the word ""whipped"" down a plate of food twice because it was not placed but literally whipped onto our table as fast as he could to get himself out of there and onto the next task.The food overall was amazing.  Each new dish was better than the next.  I will mostly likely go back to Xixa but with all the new restaurants and places to try in Williamsburg, I will most likely find a new place within a week or so with the same quality of food but with hosts/hostesses and waiters/waitresses that understand the value of customer service and understand that we could have chosen 100 other restaurants in the area that evening but chose theirs. I truly hope the chefs and owners of this restaurant continue to produce the amazing and innovative food I experienced tonight, but perhaps change whoever trains their staff and encourages the new person to treat the patrons like welcomed guests and not annoyances.",2.0
"My fiance and I had a fantastic experience at Xixa. We had the chef's tasting and each dish had a unique combination of flavors. Couple the tasty meal with surprisingly enjoyable mezcal and great beers, and needless to say, I was sold. Xixa provided one of my most memorable dining experiences - right up there with dinner at Xixa's sister restaurant, Traif.We had superb service, great food, great beverages, and enjoyed the atmosphere and decor. We'll definitely go back.",5.0

"Creative, yes - filling, no. Arrive hungry and you'll leave hungry (or broke).  Portions, while nicely designed and displayed are insultingly small considering the price tag.  The wine list also leaves something to be desired as most bottles are far too expensive for restaurant standards.The ambiance is smooth, chic, and reminds me of East Village yuppie spillover.  Until their cost drops or portions increase, I recommend other nearby restaurants of similar caliber (Mesa Coyoacan comes to mind) where you can find value.",2.0
"My new favorite spot in wburg. A little pricy, but you get what you pay for. The booths are rad - overall really cool interior design. Super creative dishes, on the small size though.

"Xixa doesn't need my review, but I can't resist. We went for my birthday and opted for the chef's tasting menu, which was AWESOME.

The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food, and the drinks were pretty weird in a good way.",5.0

Spicy Rock Shrimp Gorditas... just the name should have you salivating OMG. Also a dish of scallops and lastly Carne Asada. Everything was absolutely AMAZING.

"Obsessed with this place. We go here when we're happy, sad, or both. They change their menu to include seasonal items (pumpkin enchiladas--was personally not a huge fan of them), but also keep their staple items such as the elote carrots (prob one of the best things I've had in my life...EVER!!), Brussel sprouts (amazing) and passion fruit churros (can't end your meal without trying these)!

"Being the world's pickiest eater this is not a place I recommend and trust me I would know, I am one.

And when his dad recommends the tasting menu, following it up with ""I know you're picky, are you okay with that?"" you kind of can't say no either.So I dove in head first. I tried everything but the duck. My two favoritea were the carrots and mahi-mahi. I wasn't a huge fan of the lamb but I can't judge too much since as I stated earlier, I am a picky eater. The wait staff was great. The waiter was very knowledgeable on everything. He seemed to be training someone that night and yet that didn't slow anything down. Overall wonderful place.",5.0
"Xixa is awesome. So is Traif. You definitely have to be a bit adventurous though. The tasting menu is the way to go! Usually you can request two items in your tasting menu and you absolutely have to get the Carrots Elote and the Frica-dilla. Full 11 course break down here: theunitedstatesofk.wordp…The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the pacing of the tasting menu was really fast. This is something I think the staff will work out in time. Otherwise the service is helpful, nice, and very trendy.",4.0
"This place is awesome. Wonderful, inventive food and fantastic service. Our server helped us choose a great meal and we loved almost every dish. The one dish I didn't love - the roasted carrots - I was still very intrigued by. I started with a pina colada ice cube with rum for my cocktail - really cool idea - the cube melts down into the liquor and becomes a delicious amalgamation. We had the shrimp gorditas, the guacamole nam prik num, the thai sweet corn, the corn flan with crab, the scallops and the roasted carrots. I would eat any of them again in a heartbeat. The service was homey and professional at the same time. It was just a relaxed, lovely meal that my husband and I really treasured.",5.0

"At $40, the 13 course tasting menu is a great value and you get to try a ton of different creations.  I thought all of the dishes were pretty good and a handful of them just blew me away. Funny enough, my two favorite dishes were both vegetarian, even though I am a huge fan of seafood and meat.  The deep fried zucchini flower with burrata and the roasted carrots were two dishes that really stood out.  Also, the desserts were absolutely superb, especially the spicy ice cream.  I could eat that dish over and over again. Sort of like the bacon donuts at Traif.",4.0
"It was the perfect spot for our Saturday night birthday party. With a twelve person party, it is hard to find the right mix of intoxicating drinks and unique cuisine. But Xixa pulled through with some amazing duck lettuce wraps and Brie cheese dips and sea urchin. I never even knew you could eat sea urchin! We will be heading back soon after that great meal.",5.0
"I ended up at Xixa's after the poor service of the hostess at Tarif. Nonetheless, I'm not disappointed that that happened because I loved Xixa. All the dishes were superb! I just left the place and I already want to go back for another meal :). Will definitely come back.",5.0
"Very fun place in South Williamsburg. I wouldn't really call it Mexican, perhaps Mexican inspired. Either way, the food is great, the ambiance is very nice, and the service was awesome. I don't remember half of what he had, though it was all very enjoyable. There was some kind of carrot dish that was off the hook. Also, some fish appetizer, that was very tasty. Our server also recommended us some outstanding wine to accompany our tasting menu. Bring a date, or come with a group, works either way. Food is reasonably priced, wine is pretty expensive.",4.0
"Not your traditional Mexican fair that you expect but if you're game, this is a really good opportunity for something new and delicious. I had the best experience here. Portions are served like tapas, small plates for sharing. The Broccoli Jalapeno Guacamole was AMAZING. The Steak tacos with the bone marrow is very unique, rich and delicious. Spicy Rock Shrimp Gorditas... just the name should have you salivating OMG. Also a dish of scallops and lastly Carne Asada. Everything was absolutely AMAZING. Intimate setting and wait staff very attentive. Will definitely go back. The only con was the area the restaurant is located in.. up and coming but not the Williamsburg I expected to be in but food is worth the trek.",4.0
"Obsessed with this place. We go here when we're happy, sad, or both. They change their menu to include seasonal items (pumpkin enchiladas--was personally not a huge fan of them), but also keep their staple items such as the elote carrots (prob one of the best things I've had in my life...EVER!!), Brussel sprouts (amazing) and passion fruit churros (can't end your meal without trying these)! Drinks are awesome too!",5.0
"Being the world's pickiest eater this is not a place I recommend and trust me I would know, I am one. But when your boyfriend's parents want to take you out to dinner here for his birthday, you can't say no. And when his dad recommends the tasting menu, following it up with ""I know you're picky, are you okay with that?"" you kind of can't say no either.So I dove in head first. I tried everything but the duck. My two favoritea were the carrots and mahi-mahi. I wasn't a huge fan of the lamb but I can't judge too much since as I stated earlier, I am a picky eater. The wait staff was great. The waiter was very knowledgeable on everything. He seemed to be training someone that night and yet that didn't slow anything down. Overall wonderful place.",5.0
"Xixa is awesome. So is Traif. You definitely have to be a bit adventurous though. The tasting menu is the way to go! Usually you can request two items in your tasting menu and you absolutely have to get the Carrots Elote and the Frica-dilla. Full 11 course break down here: theunitedstatesofk.wordp…The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the pacing of the tasting menu was really fast. This is something I think the staff will work out in time. Otherwise the service is helpful, nice, and very trendy.",4.0
"This place is awesome. Wonderful, inventive food and fantastic service. Our server helped us choose a great meal and we loved almost every dish. The one dish I didn't love - the roasted carrots - I was still very intrigued by. I started with a pina colada ice cube with rum for my cocktail - really cool idea - the cube melts down into the liquor and becomes a delicious amalgamation. We had the shrimp gorditas, the guacamole nam prik num, the thai sweet corn, the corn flan with crab, the scallops and the roasted carrots. I would eat any of them again in a heartbeat. The service was homey and professional at the same time. It was just a relaxed, lovely meal that my husband and I really treasured.",5.0

"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants hands down! I find myself going back so often. The menu changes frequently which is so refreshing and the chef always adds something new when he's in the mood.They recommend like 6 dishes between 2 people but my husband and I can't help ourselves and order about 13 dishes LOLOLSome of my FAVORITES: 1.Thai Esquites corn soup; it's literally to die for.2.The duck lettuce wraps are amazing, the meat is pulled and has a very tender consistency. There is a banana purée on the side and it adds the perfect sweetness to the wrap. 3. The pork belly carnitas is unbelievable, it's crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. 4. The Brussel sprouts with strawberries and currents is soooo yummy. 5. The fish and chips are amazing as well. 6. All the raw dishes (ceviche) is melt in your mouth type of delicous.EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD!!!Tip: stay away from both of the guacamales on the menu. They're a waste of space in your belly and not that tasty in my opinion. Save room for all of the other amazing stuff, trust me.",5.0
"My husband and I visited Xixa recently and thoroughly enjoyed the chef's tasting menu. (We left the selections to the chef). Every plate was delicious and they came out timed perfectly! The flavors of each plate were amazing! It would be difficult to pick a favorite dish....they were all good! I definitely thing the tasting is the way to go here. Just order, sit back and relax knowing that each plate will be at least as good as the last. All the way to dessert....Delish! Service and atmosphere were also great. So glad we went!",5.0
"This place is just amazing. I came here in a group of 8, we were quite late for our reservation but they still made it possible to get us seated pretty quickly.

"If you're having a bad day,  go to XIXA. If you are having a good day, go to XIXA. Sigh, I always want to go to Xixa.  It's hard for me not to go to this Traif spin-off. I even hesitate writing this review because I want it to be my secret and I want to sit in the same spot every time I want to eat there. But that's just selfish so...The FOOD is carefully crafted, with quality ingredients and amazing flavor combinations that can only help but bring up anyones mood. Some dishes have a Thai flavor influence other times French, but across the board the flavors are all south of the border. These flavors literally come from dreams I've never dreamed. (Thanks to Chef Jason Marcus)  And the menu is similarly organized to Traif ie. Lighter Small dishes (5-10$) to a richer entree style($12-29).  Now these are ideally meant to share but sometimes, aka when I've had a crap day and already eaten, I'll pop in just for a glass of wine and a small dish.  A therapeutic apertif, if you will, but you could certainly make it a full solo meal if you wanted. I've definitely thought about it. So price wise you could spend a little or you could spend a lot . Now I've had a lot of things but I'm not going to talk about all of them right now, but I am very fond of the Esquites, a mini thai-mexi blend soup, the Pozole Stew-hearty and I could eat this all by myself and die happy and incredibly full (recommended for a solo meat lovers meal), Foie Gras Al Pastor-very rich entree style but I would share.. it's a lot of foie for one person, the Crab Flan Tamale-oh yes!, and the Bunelo Sundae and the Churros I've always had a great time with the SERVICE here. The servers were attentive and knowledgeable and Heather, owner has always been there. I don't know if she's always there but she checks in on everyone when she is and makes sure everything is going great. Another example of great service leads me to their BAR, They do not have a crazy cocktail list. I don't know if this is a soft opening thing or whatever. But its okay, trust these people & try something new because they specialize in Tequila, and Mezcal and have an extensive wine list. They have a tasting of Bacanora that I liked reminded me a bit of grappa. But my eating companion order some tequila and was hoping for something to drink along with it, as straight tequila is not her thing. And Voila! They accommodated her with two little shooters, one of sweetened lime juice and the other of this house made spicy sangralito? oh I don't know I tasted it thou, a sour of sweet sour spicy thingThe space is very nice, it sort of blends that south of the border bar where all the locals hang out with nice dining in the back. It's all very nice, lots of reclaimed wood and iron. I never eat in the back, by choice, I eat at a along table near the bar with surprisingly comfy iron stools, so I can look out the window. But the back looks nice with booths and tables. Maybe I'll venture to a booth sometime, the seats are more plush in the back. I also like the lamp choices. To be honest it was what brought me in the first time. When I first came here I had not idea what was going on. I had just been checking out the progress of the place that had amazing lamps Everytime I've been here I've tried to order something else completely new and I haven't been disappointed.The food is always a fun delicious adventure. Since they opened, I have been here three times, with different types of people and we've always had a great time. So GO already! Try it before everyone else know about it. It's quieter than Traif because it's still secret and there's no wait . Just try not to take my spot.",5.0

"Having not really heard anything about this place  or done a ton of research but judging primarily on the menu posted on their website, hubs and I made a reservation here for our anniversary. WOAH! Were we ever in for a treat! My foodie wanderlust has been satisfied for at least the near future!Even though not listed on their website, I had heard that there was a tasting menu available, which was confirmed once we were seated and received our menus. We opted for that because, well, it seemed like the right thing to do and because it was a special occasion. For two people, it was more food than we could have ever imagined needing or wanting! Toward the end, we thought the waitstaff was pranking us when more savory courses continued to appear at our table. But every course (10 savory, 2 dessert, to be specific) was super delicious (and I mean, SUPER delicious), and I think it was all very well-paced. Heavier courses seemed to be offset by a lighter course following it. And even as I try to think of a reason to deduct points on the food, I can't. The last dessert course wasn't my favorite, and even then, it was still pretty good! Some of the highlights: Shrimp gorditas, Steak tacos, a soft-shell crab dish that appears to have been off-menu, Foie gras al pastor (puts Do or Dine's foie gras donut to shame), Thai esquites, and the passion fruit churros. The damage for the food was only $40 a person. $40. per. person. Did I mention that it was a total of 12 shared (though not skimpy) courses for $40 a person? Ok, good. So before this places blows up any more, run, don't walk and get in on this meal. The waitstaff was very pleasant and attentive and so happy to watch us pig out. My only complaint, and it really isn't a fault of the restaurant but a matter of personal taste: they don't do traditional cocktails. If you really want something to drink during your meal, stick with beer or wine. I love tequila as much as the next person, and Xixa's offerings are beyond awesome, but I love a nice big juicy cocktail with my meal and that just doesn't exist here. A bummer for me, but again the mezcal and tequila offerings, particularly the ones I sampled, are on point! I will most certainly be back once I've fasted and prepared my stomach for the occasion. What a great find!",5.0
"OK so -- I don't know what's wrong with the people who are rating this place below 5 stars. We are Traif devotees, and have been there at least 20 times. We know that menu inside and out, and we know what to expect from Jason and Heather. Let me tell you, Xixa did NOT disappoint even in the slightest. The food simply has a different flavor profile from Traif - it's lighter with completely different elements thrown in. That being said, it's equally as good, no question. One thing we noticed is that each of the dishes we had contained elements that one of us ordinarily doesn't like (avocado, cilantro, ceviche, and bone marrow, specifically). But, they came together with the other elements on their respective plates so insanely well that we both absolutely adored every dish that came out. The ""Steak Tacos"" are totally incredible, and the dessert we had (the banana ice cream sundae - which is underselling it like whoa) was one of the best desserts either of us has ever had. Hands down, GO. HERE.What's more, Heather happened to be in the restaurant tonight and was INCREDIBLY sweet to us, having recognized us from our repeated visits to Traif, and made sure we were always well taken care of and looked after.

Great tequilas (we had the anejo flights) to go along with the eclectic menu. And what a sexy space! Highlights were the foie gras, butterfish ceviche, the fundido cheese dip, bone marrow (score) and the churro dessert. Jalapeno cranberry sorbet? Yes please!

"Overall Rating: 4-4.5 Stars.""Do you know what Xixa (pronounced: shkisa) means?"" our friendly hostess inquired of us. As two lapsed Jews, wise in the ways of elementary Yiddish, we answered with an emphatic, ""Yes."" Well, the dear hostess was heartbroken for it appeared as though she had a whole narrative to recount regarding the irony of the name. Truth be told, that's precisely why this destination was chosen. That, combined with the fact that its sister restaurant - Traif -  has treated me well in the past. We had booked a table for 9 p.m. and - having just returned from a softcore pornography exhibit at Die Neue Galerie (oh those German expressionists...) - we needed a palate cleanser sooner rather than later. Enter Xixa.The ambiance is what one would expect from a restaurant of its ilk and - like Traif - candles and dim lighting set the tenor for this simple yet tastefully assembled backdrop for one's eating endeavors. We were here to get down to some serious eating and, though the task was monumental, we are nothing if not brave. After several minutes of deep breathing and transcendental meditation, we were up to the challenge. At least that's what we thought.Apparently Xixa is supposed to embody deconstructed Mexican cuisine, which is my favorite type of Mexican cuisine, as it happens, and so we were in business. This is a tapas-style restaurant and - like Traif - the eater is confronted with several categories of food from which to choose, each dish sounding better than the last. Our charming waiter, John, advised us that 5-6 dishes was the norm for two people and who were we to question his insider knowledge? (Pro tip: 6 dishes = ravenous). We did as we were told and got down to intensive discussions where, at one point, I had cause to recommend resorting to a notepad to ensure we were making the optimal eating decisions. Well, my eating companion was very emphatic in her choices and I had very little say in the matter. -The first thing to pop onto our table was the guacamole of artichokes. While we both agreed that is was really tasty, I don't know whether this was a particularly noteworthy dish. I mean, there are few of us who haven't sought comfort in the warm embrace of a bowl of guacamole after a taxing day, but - compared to the other dishes on the menu - you can safely skip this item.-Next out, there was a dish that entailed foie gras and pork of some variety.The executive summary is that it was a rich and hearty soupy concoction which we took to spooning in earnest. It is not uncommon for me to threaten my eating companions by knocking my knife and fork over while greedily spooning delicious broths into my person and, you'll be pleased to know, that my skills in the art of cutlery distraction and intimidation caused my eating comrade to back away from this dish so I could dabble in earnest. -The next few dishes were a blur of ecstasy and, while there was much moaning and groaning going on at the table (mostly the anguish voiced by my eating companion after having spent three hours in my presence), my ""When Harry Met Sally"" moments made guest appearances in the cacophony. We had ribs of some variety, which were delightful and duck lettuce wraps which were delicious. For those of you familiar with Traif, you will know that they generally time the arrival of the dishes so that one is not inundated with ungodly quantities of food at a time. We were not so lucky this time, though the professional staff came over to apologize and gave us another glass of wine on the house. I'm no historian, but I believe that worse things have happened than being confronted with five delicious items on one's table concurrently.-The grilled carrots ""elote,"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta were outstanding and, given the opportunity, I would order six plates of that - creamy, sweet, delicious. Order them. Regrettably, the burrata which was stuffed in a sweet pepper was a bit disappointing: while sweet and soft, the burrata got lost in the sweet pepper and resulted in a dish that was rather unexceptional though, by this point, food orgasms had been reached several times already and so there were no hard feelings.It was one of those rare occasions in which there was no room for dessert. At 1 a.m., we had spent 4 hours eating and it is a credit to Xixa that we never felt rushed. Regrettably, there was no room for dessert and, as I lamented not opting for my jeans with an elasticized waistline, we squeezed through the doors.Conclusion: 4/6 of the dishes were outstanding. While Traif limits itself to fewer dishes which are all faultlessly executed, Xixa has gone with greater breadth and, in doing so, misses the mark of perfection in some spots. That said, it is a laid-back setting in which meandering conversations may be enjoyed while excellent cuisine and drink may be consumed. With each dish setting you back approximately $10, it is a perfectly reasonable spot for a wholly exceptional meal.",4.0
"My grandma told me that she would stab herself in the heart if I brought home a shiksa so instead I went to her place (not my grandma's, the shiksa's). Obviously she was traif with a Mexican accent. We ordered the $40 chef's choice and literally everything we ate was really delicious and a few dishes were truly excellent ex. the duck, carrots, fish, crab etc. My grandma is not alive anymore so I don't have to worry about her killing herself.

"Like any fairly new and inventive restaurant, Xixa has its hits and misses, but, in this case, the hits far outweigh the misses.

"This is an example of restaurant that tries too hard to be hip and misses the goal altogether. First of all, they don't serve anything ""Mexican"".  The restaurant put so much effort into making bizarre dishes with odd ingredients that everything sucks. And don't believe their Vegetable dished are vegetarian. One of the 4 dishes has anchovies.  When I asked the waiter how that could be a vegetarian dish, she told me it was because the anchovies are just lightly sprinkled on top?? Since there were only 3 very small dishes that were vegetarian, I asked for a cup of black beans to supplement my meal. The waitress told me the kitchen was too busy for a special order like that. Wow. My other friends are not vegetarian but there were also very disappointed with the food. If you want Mexican food, or even a margarita, try somewhere else.",1.0

"I don't know what's crazier, the fact that I went to this place twice in one weekend, or the fact that I'm not there RIGHT NOW.  This is my new favorite place - honestly, it's as good as fusion gets.I highly recommend the carnitas and the elote, but at this point I've had almost all of their small plates and haven't had one bad dish yet.Desserts and drinks are fantastic; this place is a home run.",5.0
"So, this little gem opened up this week, and chef Jason, of Traif fame, is absolutely killing it again with xixa. Such unique flavor combos, hard to even explain. Great tequilas (we had the anejo flights) to go along with the eclectic menu. And what a sexy space! Highlights were the foie gras, butterfish ceviche, the fundido cheese dip, bone marrow (score) and the churro dessert. Jalapeno cranberry sorbet? Yes please! Lots more we didnt try, will be back pronto to dig deeper into that menu! Even writing this review the morning after im thinking ""should we just go back tonight?""",5.0
"Overall Rating: 4-4.5 Stars.""Do you know what Xixa (pronounced: shkisa) means?"" our friendly hostess inquired of us. As two lapsed Jews, wise in the ways of elementary Yiddish, we answered with an emphatic, ""Yes."" Well, the dear hostess was heartbroken for it appeared as though she had a whole narrative to recount regarding the irony of the name. Truth be told, that's precisely why this destination was chosen. That, combined with the fact that its sister restaurant - Traif -  has treated me well in the past. We had booked a table for 9 p.m. and - having just returned from a softcore pornography exhibit at Die Neue Galerie (oh those German expressionists...) - we needed a palate cleanser sooner rather than later. Enter Xixa.The ambiance is what one would expect from a restaurant of its ilk and - like Traif - candles and dim lighting set the tenor for this simple yet tastefully assembled backdrop for one's eating endeavors. We were here to get down to some serious eating and, though the task was monumental, we are nothing if not brave. After several minutes of deep breathing and transcendental meditation, we were up to the challenge. At least that's what we thought.Apparently Xixa is supposed to embody deconstructed Mexican cuisine, which is my favorite type of Mexican cuisine, as it happens, and so we were in business. This is a tapas-style restaurant and - like Traif - the eater is confronted with several categories of food from which to choose, each dish sounding better than the last. Our charming waiter, John, advised us that 5-6 dishes was the norm for two people and who were we to question his insider knowledge? (Pro tip: 6 dishes = ravenous). We did as we were told and got down to intensive discussions where, at one point, I had cause to recommend resorting to a notepad to ensure we were making the optimal eating decisions. Well, my eating companion was very emphatic in her choices and I had very little say in the matter. -The first thing to pop onto our table was the guacamole of artichokes. While we both agreed that is was really tasty, I don't know whether this was a particularly noteworthy dish. I mean, there are few of us who haven't sought comfort in the warm embrace of a bowl of guacamole after a taxing day, but - compared to the other dishes on the menu - you can safely skip this item.-Next out, there was a dish that entailed foie gras and pork of some variety.The executive summary is that it was a rich and hearty soupy concoction which we took to spooning in earnest. It is not uncommon for me to threaten my eating companions by knocking my knife and fork over while greedily spooning delicious broths into my person and, you'll be pleased to know, that my skills in the art of cutlery distraction and intimidation caused my eating comrade to back away from this dish so I could dabble in earnest. -The next few dishes were a blur of ecstasy and, while there was much moaning and groaning going on at the table (mostly the anguish voiced by my eating companion after having spent three hours in my presence), my ""When Harry Met Sally"" moments made guest appearances in the cacophony. We had ribs of some variety, which were delightful and duck lettuce wraps which were delicious. For those of you familiar with Traif, you will know that they generally time the arrival of the dishes so that one is not inundated with ungodly quantities of food at a time. We were not so lucky this time, though the professional staff came over to apologize and gave us another glass of wine on the house. I'm no historian, but I believe that worse things have happened than being confronted with five delicious items on one's table concurrently.-The grilled carrots ""elote,"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta were outstanding and, given the opportunity, I would order six plates of that - creamy, sweet, delicious. Order them. Regrettably, the burrata which was stuffed in a sweet pepper was a bit disappointing: while sweet and soft, the burrata got lost in the sweet pepper and resulted in a dish that was rather unexceptional though, by this point, food orgasms had been reached several times already and so there were no hard feelings.It was one of those rare occasions in which there was no room for dessert. At 1 a.m., we had spent 4 hours eating and it is a credit to Xixa that we never felt rushed. Regrettably, there was no room for dessert and, as I lamented not opting for my jeans with an elasticized waistline, we squeezed through the doors.Conclusion: 4/6 of the dishes were outstanding. While Traif limits itself to fewer dishes which are all faultlessly executed, Xixa has gone with greater breadth and, in doing so, misses the mark of perfection in some spots. That said, it is a laid-back setting in which meandering conversations may be enjoyed while excellent cuisine and drink may be consumed. With each dish setting you back approximately $10, it is a perfectly reasonable spot for a wholly exceptional meal.",4.0
"My grandma told me that she would stab herself in the heart if I brought home a shiksa so instead I went to her place (not my grandma's, the shiksa's). Obviously she was traif with a Mexican accent. We ordered the $40 chef's choice and literally everything we ate was really delicious and a few dishes were truly excellent ex. the duck, carrots, fish, crab etc. My grandma is not alive anymore so I don't have to worry about her killing herself. That means that I'll be heading back to South 4th to my two favorite places in Williamsburg.",5.0

"I really wanted to like this place. That said, this review isn't about the food but rather the experience in its entirely, namely the $40pp tasting menu.I've been to Traif several times before and never had a bad experience, so when I called to make a reservation and was redirected to Xixa, I figured it'd be a good alternative. One person in our party of six wasn't planning on eating bc of stomach issues, but the rest of us were interested in the tasting menu so our server checked with the kitchen to make sure it was OK. It was.The thing with the tasting menu, is that the dishes aren't proportioned out for however many ppl are involved. TRES ANNOYING. With the exception of one dish, they all came as they would if you'd ordered it a la carte (one individual-sized serving). One plate, no serving utensil, one small serving. When you have five hungry people sitting at opposite ends of the table = no bueno. AND not only that, but I counted the dishes... 8. 8 small dishes to serve five people, three of them full-grown, hungry men. Oh, plus three desserts plus a tiny bite of some chocolate chili thing. Since two of the five don't even eat desserts, that was pretty much a waste. ALL THE WHILE, let's not forget that we're paying $40 each. That's $200 for 8 individual-sized dishes, WHICH, as I calculated this morning, is around $96 (if you average each dish is about $12 - DEF the case as two of our dishes were the cheapest vegetable dishes on the menu). Plus desserts (about $24 total) and you're looking at a grand total of $120.That's $80 we could've put towards more food to feed our hungry party. Or at least, back in our pocket. Grrr. Let me just say that the food we did manage to take a bite of (literally, a BITE) was pretty good. But if we return, we definitely won't be ordering the tasting menu again. If that's your plan, think twice. Seriously. You're much better off just ordering a bunch of stuff you actually want straight off the menu.",2.0
"there's something i really have with the traif/xixa people: i trust them. i would literally eat or drink anything they served me. even if it's made with crazy ingredients that i have never liked before or combinations that sound highly suspicious, i just KNOW it is going to blow my fucking mind. it doesn't matter what i order, it's going to be intense and i am going to literally grab the last bite out of my dining-mate's hand (sorry, baby, but who saves one last bite to carry home?! too tempting.)i see other people have written about bad service, but i've never experienced that with either place. in fact, when i called xixa on friday night at 7:30 they gave me a res for 8:30 over the phone. that's pretty rare for a recently opened, williamsburg hot spot type of place (or has it some how managed not to be that even though it clearly is?).honestly, even if the service was shit, i would go to both restaurants, because the food is just always incredible. i feel like someone spent many days in a test kitchen trying combinations that sound counter-intuitive but shock and please your tongue in ways that can't even be articulated (by me). loved the fois gras al pastor, lamb meatballs, cornmeal flan with blue crab, and the octopus especially. it all melted in my mouth. it was all somehow firm but creamy. sweet but savory, but not salty. god, i want to go back right now.the agave-based drink menu is really unique, and i think because i know xixa/traif will never do me wrong, i was willing to try it. i had never had high quality tequila like this before. literally feels like you're just swallowing air, and a few long seconds later, warmth and smoke all the way down. like drinking a glass of good bourbon. and the way they set up their neat drinks with lime juice/sangrita/infused tequila as chasers/combiners is just genius. the sangrita itself is really complex and delicious-- sweet at first, then super spicy after it goes down. how did they even do that?!",5.0

"Mexican inspired small plates at this sister restaurant to Traif.  Doesn't disappoint. Similar to Traif, creative and flavorful dishes. We walked in on a weekend and were seated right away. Service was good. I probably don't need to say much more.",5.0
"This is an easy 5-star review. The tasting menu is as good as anything you'll find in the city, and at half the price.  The plates we had were somewhat small, but at 7 courses plus dessert, it was perfect.",5.0
The best tasting menu deal in NYC period. Excellent food and value. Mezcal cocktails are also great.,5.0
"So beautiful! I loved the decor and architectural design that makes the ceilings seem really high! It's very hidden and stashed on a corner of Havemeyer under the BQE, but I am definitely in love with this place. First thing I must say is the portions are small for everything EXCEPT the meat dishes, I learned this because I ordered 3 dishes of either vegetables or fish and my boyfriend ordered 2 meat dishes. His two meat dishes were twice the amount of food as my three combined. The wine! oh, the wine! there is so much to be had from so many glorious regions! Wished I had room for dessert because it also looked amazing! Xixa (pronounced Shiksa) is a delightful little treat hidden under the BQE. :)",4.0
"It was fairly genius for the Traif people to open up another place on the same block. We wandered down to Traif a little before 10 last night and they had a one hour wait, but sent us four doors down to Xixa where there was abouta  5 minute wait while they cleared a table for us. It's quite busy for a place that has only been open for a month, probably largely because of this clever overflow scheme. The food was wonderful! We ordered 7 small plates, a bottle of wine, dessert, and two tequilas.  Everything was delicious, services was great, and the price was very reasonable for the quality of the food. In short, they have everything one wants from a South Williamsburg establishment including a lack of sign on the front door and a carefully curated selection of tequilas and mezcals. Treat yourself! You'll love it!",5.0
Have only been here for drinks. I do not know much about tequila and the waiter had to explain the different options a few times to our table. He seemed to know his stuff and was very patient. It was either too complicated or too loud in there for is to hear him. Will have to come back to try the food,3.0
"just like traif, this place hits all the right notes. interesting flavor combinations without being overwrought or pretentious",5.0
"Currently the best restaurant in New York City, hands down. The food is... Well, it's the closest I've ever been to Heaven :-) Difficult to describe, you have to taste it to get it. I also love the ambience/interior design. Everything was PERFECT, except for the fact that the place was empty. Past by there a couple of times after that - same thing: empty. While Traif is always packed. I don't understand this - love Traif, but I feel Xixa is even better, A LOT better. I just pray the God they don't close down this masterpiece of a restaurant. GO TO XIXA, PEOPLE. :-)",5.0
"If you don't have reservations, you get stuck in the middle which is like eating in the middle of subway car with people pushing into your back. They have an extensive wine list if you're willing to pay buy the bottle, otherwise by the glass you've extremely limited options. Portions are small and uneven (we had a party of 4, sometimes we only had 2 or 3 servings of a particular dish). The food was good but overprice, I wouldn't go here on an empty stomach or for 'dinner'. Better just for snacks or appetizers. The service was great and warn me whether I could eat something or not because of my seafood allergy.",2.0
"The bartender this past Friday night was absolutely adorable and such a great server.  She obviously has a passion for food and liquor and it really showed.  Yes, this place does take itself too seriously but it's Williamsburg so it's to be expected. Out of the 5 dishes we loved 2 of them (foie gras al pastor syle & the curry corn, just outstanding) and liked the rest.  Now the alcohol menu was a little annoying if I'm going to be honest.  The wine menu was divided into different types of women, and yes I get the concept, but just list the wine for Christ's sake.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned there are a lot of tequila and mezcal options but not a lot of cocktails.  I had a deconstructed margarita which was so cool to look at, and tasted fine after the cubes had melted.  More cocktail options please.  And the bartender had to explain so much about the drink menu... it's like, just print it straight out.  There shouldn't have to be so much that needs to be explained, you know?  If the food and drinks are quality- which they definitely are- it will speak for itself.",4.0
"Went with a party of 12 to celebrate a birthday. The food was very tasty, one ingredient I tasted recurrently however was cumin, seemed to be overused.. aside from that though all the dishes were great as well as the cocktails. Xixa has a great selection of tequilas as well. However, Xixa seemed unprepared to handle large parties such as ours. The seating took roughly 40 minutes after the reservation was made, though in their defense I did add 2 more people on arrival, but still 40 minutes seems excessive...There seemed to be a bit of confusion on drinks and timing of plates for the table as well. The worst part of the night though, was Xixa's unwillingness to accommodate a pescatarian we had at our table. I had informed them in advance of this and they said they would accommodate, however, once dining, whenever they sent out meat dishes, they didn't sent out something for the pescatarian. When we asked that this please be done, as Xixa forces the chef's selection for every member of the table at $40 per person, due to the fact that the pescatarian of the group was paying the same as everyone else yet only getting to enjoy less than half of the food, the server informed us that this could not be done. We tried explaining this concept again but management refused to accommodate.  I might return one day with 3-4 people, but was genuinely shocked that they couldn't help our pescatarian and instead seemed to have the ""too bad"" attitude.",3.0
"I came here last night with three girlfriends. We arrived at 7 and the place was nearly empty. A super sweet but hurried bartender whipped up a few simple cocktails (agua frescas with a shot of tequila from their impressive agave menu) while we waited for everyone in the party to arrive. We were seated at a booth in back and within a half hour the place was packed with beautiful, stylish people. It didn't have a too-cool-for-school vibe, and it wasn't TOO Williamsburg hipster even for 4 very non-hipster moms from Manhattan. It was perfect. We ordered about 10 tapas for dinner and each thing was more impressive than the last. It was an inspired, ""interpretive"" menu full of interesting flavors - carmelized brussels sprouts with strawberries, spicy octopus in a pasta dish, lamb meatballs, shrimp ceviche, corn tamale flan with blue crab in a cilantro sauce. We had a cajeta ice cream sundae with bananas and black sesame foam, and a Thai iced tea flan with some kind of granita on the side (pineapple maybe?) and a shot of mezcal with oranges and smoked salt. It was super fun trying all of the food and the staff was helpful in telling us how to order, what to order, and even how to eat it in some cases.",5.0

"Don't bother.  The food is not good, not even mediocre nor is it filling.  I've never had such small dishes before.  When I left I stopped at the Mexican place by my house and got a burrito, I was starving when I left.  I personally don't like tequila and that is the only liquor they serve, so I was super bummed.  The appetizer was just gross, some baked cheese thing that was completely unappetizing.  Just because something has beans or rice doesn't make it Mexican, this is not a Mexican restaurant, it's far from it.  It feels like they are trying to make fetch happen and it just isn't.  The dessert they brought us was a very very very small mini bite of chocolate that was the size of a dime.  There isn't a comfortable place to sit in the entire place.  The booths are wood, hard wood, and if you are coming for a relaxing dinner, it's not going to be.  The bar stools are all metal.  The decor couldn't make up it's mind what it was, cheap for sure, but the mish mash of style was an eye sore, thank goodness the light were very dim.  Traif is way better and just a few steps away.",1.0

"My wife, Irene and I joined my daughter, Kim and son-in-law Jason for dinner out last Saturday Night at XiXa (prounced Shiksa and if your Jewish, you know what it means!).  Well I have to tell you, the place is very eclectic and funky, from my point of view, with subdued lighting and tight knit rows of connected boat rope hanging from the ceiling, most unusual!  The crowd was young and we seemed like the oldest couple there!  Now this is a Mexican Restaurant, but I believe a Fusion style restaurant, blending in Asian touches of culinary treats.  So we looked at the menu and ordered 12 dishes!!!  Yes, 12!  I came to understand earlier that this was a tapas type venue (small portions), so I assumed that I would be hungry when done.  We started with an amazing bottle of fruity and crisp wine and we could have easily had a 2nd one, except for the fact we had to drive back to Bayside and Great Neck.  Our dishes started to come, one at a time and they were made up of chicken, shrimp and Mexican and Asian Fusion style cooking.  We started to taste this food and our taste buds began to say WOW!!!!!  Tastes that my ""buds"" had never experienced!  We were served one dish after another and were floored as to the stupendous and varied flavors that we experienced.  Although I cannot remember the names of any dishes, I can rest assure you that whatever you order will be an amazing and one of a kind tasting event.  This is a must go to hot spot, which has only been open a few months and they own another restaurant a hop, skip and a jump away, called Traip (229 S. 4th st between Driggs & Roebling St 347-844-9578,traifny.com), which we will surely try in the near future, maybe this weekend!  All I can say, is if you to have a food experience and an out of body experience, go to Xisa.  Yes, I was still hungry when we left, but it was worth every penny!!!",5.0
"Delicious!  Reviewers have said they go to Xixa expecting Traif II and are disappointed.  Xixa stands on its own.  Yes, same owners, same attention to detail in creating interesting dishes and flavors, but Xixa is a whole different experience.  Four of us ate there, we ordered 9 plates between us.  We tried to get two things from every area of the menu, somehow a ninth dish snuck in.  I wish I took a menu so I could remember everything.  We had a duck dish, short rib dish, a shrimp dish, maybe a veggie dish?, two salads, something with cheese (a few more chips please), some other things.  Next time I will take a menu and update my review.  The food was amazing.  The wine menu is humorously and cleverly arranged and has a great variety.  We were going to pass on dessert but the kitchen sent out 3 dishes.  Churros with cranberry jalapeño sorbet was yummy, can't remember the other two, because we didn't do the ordering.   Also amazing.  The decor is a little rustic, very comfortable.  The staff friendly.  The music fun.  Next time we go out I don't know how we will decide which restaurant to go to.  I guess we will have to alternate.  There are very few restaurants where I have eaten more than once, but Xixa and Traif are not on that list.  We travel quiet a distance, and the trip is well worth it.",5.0
