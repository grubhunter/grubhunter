"Blank Cafe is a hidden gem in Williamsburg. Located further away from the L/G line, Blank Cafe is well worth the trek if you have the time to roam a little south. It is a lovely space with a lot of table room for various parties, however, keep your voices low as people work more than socialize (at least human contact). Lots of outlets for electronic usage and free wi-fi with password. I haven't tried the actual food, but they seem to have a solid menu of Japanese dishes, definitely worth a try as the aroma filled the air.Staff is very friendly and will take your order to your table. They only accept cash, however there is an ATM next door if need be. Coffee was good and reasonably priced. Looking forward to my visits to Blank Cafe again!",5.0
Blank cafe is tucked off of Broadway in the lower part of Williamsburg. It has a charm to its design. There always seems to be a space available to sit and write or work. You can choose a table or they have these bungalows tucked against the wall. It's ambiance is awesome.It's a Japanese coffee shop. I've notice a few Japanese shops with libraries. Not sure if that's part the course or just a coincidence.I've only had the cold brew which is don't in tradition Japanese fashion. It's good but it does have a distinct flavor. Haven't quite pegged it. I'll be back.,4.0
"I love this adorable and peaceful cafe. They seem to get plenty of business but it's not obnoxiously packed and loud at all. There's always a table available, though sometimes you might end up sitting at one of the large communal tables. I've had tea, a croissant sandwich, and their curry lunch there. All were delicious! There's a very large selection of your typical coffee shop fare and some Asian goodies (like the aforementioned curry). It's a great deal and a perfect light-ish lunch. What would make it a perfect experience: accept credit cards, and maybe pay a bit more attention to the temperature... it was very stuffy the last time I was in there. Also, though I definitely wouldn't say that any of the staff was rude or mean, there definitely wasn't a neighborly friendliness that I guess I expected in such a cozy, charming local spot. The person behind the counter doesn't seem to like to give recommendations and isn't very helpful if you're not ready with your order. Minor setbacks though, and Blank Cafe is still one of my favorites in the neighborhood!",4.0
"One star for atrocious coffee and sweet.  Extra star for being handsome, groovy, and playing good music.In a neighborhood bursting with terrible coffee, this place takes the cake.  Speaking of cake, the little, expensive green tea cake tastes like soap.  The coffee was so bad I had nothing to wash the cake flavor out with. Left a full cup and cake on the table and left to spend another $5 at Oslo.  Shouldn't be so hard.",2.0
"I love, love, love the decor in Blank Cafe. It's so comfy in there, it's the type of cafe you want in your neighborhood. Feels like my own central perk. I love their cute little nooks that you can snuggle into to drink your latte and read your book. The staff is very welcoming and attentive and I love that they have a full menu and a lots of yummy pastry options. Oh and the best part? ...They have Asahi on tap, WHAT!!!!!",4.0
"Okay, first a big complaint about NYC in general - why is it so dog-unfriendly?  Such a nice day and there are very few patio seating anywhere, and lot of those are not set up very well for accompanying 4-legged family members to join in.  There are very little grass even in parks, and majority of buildings that do have grass posts ""no dogs on grass"" signs up. It's really a shame because there are so many dogs in the city!Anyway I digress.  I stopped here for a late breakfast/brunch after taking Domino to the vet, because it was really the only appropriate place we found during our 1-hour walk back from the vet.  Yes, we walked for 1-hour (half of that on the bridge but let's stick with it for effect) and this was the only fitting place for a dog.  Now mind you, fitting means they had 2 small, round patio tables with 4 chairs right outside next to the neighbor's trashcan, so it's not exactly ""ambiance"".But the proper cafe itself, what a space!  I love the interior, ample plugs for charging stuff, and the general layout of the place.  They serve everything from coffee shop type breakfasts to sandwiches small dishes, and drinks from coffee to alcohol.  It's quite unusual in the sense that you can come here for light breakfast AND late night lounging.  Maybe that's how they do it in Japan?  The workers (includes owner?) were all Asian, and it does remind me of that atmosphere you would get in Japan.I ordered a cup of coffee and a Smoked Salmon Croissant sandwich.  Coffee was just okay, nothing interesting flavor-wise but of good quality.  The sandwich was fantastic.  It's a cold sandwich so they just basically cut the croissant in half and put the ingredients inside.  This could be middling if the croissant is not good, which is usually why they heat these up.  But the croissant here was on-point, and mixed in with the delicious & fresh salmon & other ingredients, it is really a fabulous sandwich.  Staff were nice, service was fast, and I can see myself sitting here, laptop open, for couple of hours either in the morning or during those after-hours by yourself.  Without my dog, that is.",4.0
"I love this place. I don't want to tell you how much because I don't want it to be flooded. But I'm too nice not to tell you. So as much as it pains me to tell you, this is the best cafe in wburg. Well done blank cafe team.",5.0
"Did not expect to find such a stylish, cozy and pleasant cafe in this part of town. I just love its ambience. It's the perfect place for writers or students to sit down with their laptop and work away the whole day. (Bless they have wifi)FOOD:     *Chicken Curry: Japanese home-style. The curry came with a salad and a bite-sized brownie. The curry itself was delish, and very filling; I highly recommemd it. Also THE BROWNIE WAS AMAZING. It was only bite-sized, but next time I'm definitely getting a whole thing.     *Nutella Banana Croissant: Warm, gooey nutella and banana sandwiched between crispy layers of croissant pressed in a panini presser. I had to stop myself from getting another one.AMBIENCE:      *Relatively quiet and cozy. There was a nice jazz playlist on. It was a place for getting work done, and everyone in the cafe seemed to have come with the same idea in mind. SERVICE:      *Spot on. I usually don't have much to say about the service at coffee shops, but the barista here was so nice and polite. You don't see this sort of customer-positive attitude anywhere, especially at places in New York. Basically the food's good, the coffee's good, the staff are nice and most importantly, there's wifi. I could sit here all day.",5.0
Best cold brew I've ever had. And all the food is ridiculously good - esp the miso soup and whatever that baked chicken/cheese/rice thing is I got last time. And it's adorable inside! What more could you really want?,5.0
"Good food, good drinks.  WIFI is lacking. Fix the wifi, dont use a cheap time warner account, get a good business one that can handle all of the laptops. I can't log on half the time and the internet keeps needing to be re-set. Get the most expensive internet you can get and people will pay for the coffees and food.  Good ambiance, if it wasn't for the spotty wifi, 5 stars.",4.0

"Cozy cafe with plenty of seating, a couple leather couches, and books/records on display. It's fairly quiet in here during the day time, so a good place to get some work done but maybe not  so much for taking calls or group projects. Solid coffee, draft beer, and wine. The food is also great, from the curries to the baked goods. My only complaint is that its cash only!",5.0
Happy hour! half off all wine and beers. $2.50 sappora drafts. 4-8pm. Mon-Friday. I like the table outside. Look at the east river with my wine. Amazing.Also the curry dish is sooo good! And cheap. But great quality.,5.0
"Super friendly staff, yummy food, clean bathroom, and amazing interior! I've only been to Blank Cafe once so far, but I can't wait to go back. Ever since my first visit, I've seriously contemplated ditching my usual haunts in Manhattan in favor of Blank, but I just haven't had the time to venture out to Williamsburg.I was at nearby Devocion earlier in the day, but unfortunately, I was having difficulties with their wifi and actually really needed Internet access. After staying there for a couple hours, I decided to look for a new coffee shop in the area. Good ol' Yelp suggested Blank to me. Thank you, Yelp!The shop is easy to miss if you're not paying attention, but once you step inside, you'll feel welcomed by the cozy furnishings and decorations. There was a mix of Korean and Japanese staff, and all of them were very nice to me. I stayed for a couple hours and didn't have any problems with the wifi. Plus, I loved the music that they played. Lots of jazz. They happened to be playing lots of Jamie Cullum that day.As for food and drink, I got an iced coffee and a turkey croissant sandwich. The coffee was decent, but not the best that I've had. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich. All the ingredients were fresh, and they weren't skimpy with the fixings.Looking forward to trying more of their food and sticking around for happy hour, too!",5.0

I didn't get a chance to order curry but will definitely be coming back to try!Also, this place offers $2 draft beer, $3 appetizers, $5 dinner specials every Friday starting at 6pm! I will most definitely be back for this. I'm giving this place a 4 star until I've tried their food menu. Super excited too since they offer sesame ice cream for dessert :D I can't believe this place doesn't have more great reviews!",4.0

"Great place for you like-minded freelancey folk to grab a cup of coffee and the illusive table to work. Free wi-fi and a friendly staff, plus great coffee make this a lovely spot to graphic-design to your heart's desire. Not great music, so you may want to bring your headphones.The cafe has a familiar Brooklyn-esqe dark wood, charcoal walled appearance, however, Blank has a Japanese / French vibe reminiscent of many little Tokyo cafes. Think french pastries, sandwiches with katsu, sesame ice cream and green tea cookie sandwiches. I haven't tried any of the food, but there is an ample lunchtime menu of crossant sandwiches as well as evening menu of curry.

"I'm delighted to become the first ELITE YELPER from Manhattan to review this awesome new HIPSTER coffeeshop in Williamsburg!!Stumbled upon this place by accident. After a quick lunch at Pigs N Thigs nearby, I decided to go for a walk to burn off those calories as well as in search of street art (I'm a HUGE FAN: Check out my instagram/brianoppa) and a place for a Java fix when all of a sudden ""BOOM!"" this coffeeshop appears out of nowhere and I just had to enter this place.As you enter, you'll notice that the place is very hipster and trendy. The decor has that ANTHROPOLOGIE-esque decor with lots of wood, antiques, and vintage items on the walls. It reminded me of one of those hip cafes with vintage decor that you can only see in both Seoul and Tokyo where they are known for superior vintage cafe interior and decor. Surprisingly there are lots of places to sit. Tables, Desks, Communal Tables, Sofas towards the back, and it even has a bar area where they also serve wine and other alcoholic drinks in addition to coffee and tea.Staff are friendly and service is quick. Don't worry about communication problems because they speak enough English to not mess up your drink. I think this place is owned by a partnership between Korean and Japanese people as I heard both Korean and Japanese being spoken behind the counter by the staff and I'm fluent in both languages.As for drinks, I posted a picture of the menu so be sure to check it out but here are some of the items that they offer: Coffee-Espresso-Macchiato-Americano-Capuccino-Latte (Caramel, Hazelnut, Mocha, Vanilla)-Chai Tea Latte-Hot Chocolate-Tea-Freshly Squeezed Lemonade-Orange Juice-Cirtusade to name a few. There are a couple of food items from Balthazar Bakery like croissants (Plain, Chocolate, Almond) and pastries like Black Olive Brownie and fruit muffins which looks pretty good. Oh, and they also serve Japanese Curry for lunch which isn't bad but you'll hear a White guy occasionally complaining about how it's too saucy or what not...yeah what does a White guy know about Asian Food unless they're Anime freakshow with Yellow fever LMAO.There's Free WiFi and electric outlets on the walls and there is a clean restroom!Place is CASH ONLY and prices are reasonable even for Williamsburg. I would compare this place to Black Brick just a few blocks up north as a coffeeshop with superior vintage hipster vibe, great coffee, and reliable WIFI (Black Brick's WiFi has been acting funny lately!!)Great place to get some work done, meet up with a friend to have some Java or some wine in a great vibe with great music!!
