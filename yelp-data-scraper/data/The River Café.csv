"Every girl has her dream of getting proposed after a perfect meal at a perfect place. The River café is one of them. I dined in this place with my mom and I thanked her for giving me amazing time. Before entering the restaurant, i was amazed by their garden decorations. Lightings were romantically arranged and the flowers were beautifully ornamented. We sat by the window area for dinner, looking at the downtown area of Manhattan, the river, and brooklyn bridge. The view was so beautiful. My mom and I looked  outside the window for a long time and enjoyed our drink. I ordered ox tail ravioli with truffle for starter and lobster for the main course followed by the Brooklyn Bridge dessert. Honestly, ox tail ravioli was some what mediocre, but the lobster and desserts were AMAZING.",5.0
"i wanted to check out the river cafe for years and finally came across a last minute reservation on a crisp winter afternoon (blue skies but freeeeeezing). we hustled over just in time for our saturday lunch and i loved the entryway which was covered in fresh flowers even in the depths of winter. there was a live piano player and we were quickly seated in a table 1 row off of the window (though the window side seats were empty so we had a nice view). i was pleasantly surprised at the food. i had average expectations but found the food quality to be impressive. i had the crab and branzino both of which were very fresh and nicely composed. i also tried the the special pasta with truffle, which was excellent, and the duck breast which was my least favorite item mostly because of the strange texture of the spaetzle. service was very odd here. they certainly have a formal air about them but we found the service to actually be quite poor. lots of empty glasses, dirty plates lingering on our table, and having to look for someone to ask for our check long after we finished. perhaps less pomp and more actual attention would result in a better overall service. overall a nice, special occasion restaurant with a great view.",4.0
"first time here, went with my boyfriend for a belated bday dinner. we came early and had a drink at the bar around 5 then had our reservation for 6. we watched the sunset over the city which was beautiful. dinner was INCREDIBLE. the service was impeccable and the ambience was so romantic. I had the Cobia as my app, DELICIOUS and so fresh. he had the rabbit which was equally amazing. for our entrees, I had the steak and he had the rabbit. exceptional. paired perfectly with a bottle of Chianti. chocolate soufflé and sorbet plate for dessert. Let me add that I had a severe dairy and egg allergy and the waitress told me I could still have anything on the menu & the chef would work around it. my boyfriend and I agreed that this was definitely one of the best meals we've ever had. So delicious and outstanding service",5.0
"Ambience: AMAZING. I was expecting it to be all uppity and snobby, but was pleasantly proven wrong. The crowd does tend to be older and dining room was fairly hush for a full restaurant on a Friday night. They have an elegant bar overlooking the river and beautiful live piano playing in the background. No matter where you get seated, you have a pretty solid view of the Brooklyn Bridge and gorgeous city lights. Staff: Very respectful and kind. They all work together very well to make this an elegant and romantic experience. Everyone from the doorman to the waitress/waiters to coatcheck staff were poised and informative if we had any questions at all about the restaurant or menu. FOOD: OKAY SO MY FAVORITE PART! The food was EXQUISITE! Everything was prepared with lots of attention and the unique flavors came together to have a party in my mouth. Super pleased. Appetizers: crab cake & avocado vs. buttered shrimp = hands down, the shrimp won! There were two jumbo shrimp glazed with a perfectly sweet and savory buttery cream. Main course: Lamb chops vs. salmon = ding ding ding - winner goes to lamb chops! They were perfectly moist and savory, full of flavor. The salmon was just eh-ok, although it was served with a delicious mushroom sauce and rice which made it worth it. Dessert: S'mores chocolate mousse vs. Brooklyn Bridge raspberry and chocolate mousse = TIE. We really couldn't decide, I found myself digging at both my Brooklyn Bridge and the S'mores chocolate mousse. Price: Okay, here's the big kicker. They have a pre-fixed menu of $120 and then extra for any drinks/wine/coffee. For the experience and well-cooked food, it's worth it and I definitely left feeling full :)Will I be back? YES! So much more on that delicious menu that is just waiting to be tried. ;)",5.0
"Had such a beautiful time at this breathtaking restaurant! Perfect for special events! Celebrated our one year at River Cafe and everything from the staff to the food was on point. If you are planning a special dinner do not hesitate and make the reservation. Although a bit expensive, the views the live piano will be worth everything! Love love love",5.0
"Gentlemen, attire is strictly enforced. Came on friday evening and everyone is well groomed and elegantly dressed. The waters are very friendly and accommodating. I was very pleased with all the dishes. A beautiful display and full of differwnt flavors. Nothing too overbearing. Definitely a romantic place and expect to stay for atleast 2 hrs they do not rush you out the door which i love. Thank you river cafe for making it a night to remember for the bday girl.",5.0
"Had the most memorable birthday dinner here with BF on Friday night.. I loved the entrance with romantic garden lights. The view was breathtaking and the food was the most delicious-I had Sea Scallop and Foie Gras for appetizer, Lamb for entree and Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge for dessert. BF had Octopus for appetizer, Duck breast for entree and Apple Almond Pave for dessert.. It was the most perfect night!",5.0
"Any place by the water is already starting from 3 stars on my book. And when you combine it with good food and summery atmosphere, they don't need to do much to get 5 stars. And they did not fail. I am not a restaurant reviewer, I will leave that to people who know better about food (Or think that they are?) I will say that I had a great afternoon at the River cafe. From the service through the food, this place is good.And the view. Oh the view...",5.0
"Oh man! River cafe was absolutely having the best view in Brooklyn and probably in all Manhattan area. Looking outside the window, you got the full view of Brooklyn bridge and the other side of the city! How nice and how chill!Me and my friend were having a relaxing brunch here on a sunny Saturday morning. River cafe offered a prep fixe brunch set with one appetizer and one entree, apparently with many more complementary dishes that would send you full. Out of all their dishes, I enjoyed the grilled duck the most. You must try the Brooklyn bridge dessert which was literally the bridge made of chocolate with raspberry sorbet on the side! Absolutely my favorite dish for the day!Our waiter was also nice enough to bring us complementary wines for pairing. I would definitely coming back for their dinner tasting!",5.0
"There's always pressure for Gents to arrange a memorable evening on a day like Valentine's -- and I couldn't be happier with my experience at The River Cafe.This place had been highly recommended to me a few times, so I set out to make reservations. Took me 2 weeks of persistence, placing a card on file, and filling out a form just in case... They're serious about their reservations!The first details we noticed were the privately tucked away cobblestone drive-in, the attentive Valet staff directing traffic, and the well-done landscaping. Immediately sets the tone for a romantic dinner.Upon entry, staff is courteous and competent. They smile, they greet us, and proceed to seat us promptly after taking our coats.The attention to detail on this evening was lovely. As we made our way to the main dining room, the thin corridor was lined with flowers and other decorations -- really a nice touch.It's not until after you emerge from the corridor that you get a glimpse of the breathtaking views. A smile comes over my face as we make our way to our table. I'm already very pleased at this point.All of the couples look fantastic, the staff is well dressed, there was a live violinist, the lighting and temperature was perfect.A glass of champagne was poured for us while we reviewed the menu. Our server Lee and his runner Shannon made a great duo. They knew just when to check-in. Not too frequently so as to smother, yet remaining attentive from an accessible distance.The four-course meal was scrumptious. I chose the Wellington Filet Mignon and my lady the Duck. (The Duck was a better dish) Ordered a couple half-bottles of Wine, and the wine expert (the proper term slips me) had phenomenal pairing suggestions. It's probably the first time I've had a pairing suggestion be of any good use -- well done, sir.A classic night of laughs, romantic gazes, fine dining, and plenty of wining ensued all while overlooking the city skyline from what seems like an IMAX theatre view.On our way out, the staff gifted each lady with a souvenir to take home. A nice closing touch.All in all -- an exquisite experience! As a true service aficionado, my hat goes off to the entire team at The River Cafe. Highly recommended for a special occasion dinner of any kind.JH",5.0
"This place is special.. the food is worth the price tag ($150 pre fixe), the view is quite pretty, and the service is fantastic. They give you a chair for your handbag, that says it all, lol.  It's an excellent choice for a special occasion. They do a great job putting together fairly normal dinner choices like scallop, lobster, by adding some culinary genius flavoring magic to amuse your taste buds.  Such attention to detail and presentation! Seriously the food taste as good as the pictures look.  I was trolling Yelp prior to my dinner trying to figure out what to get, but really, just order what YOU like. If you want to eat lobster, you damn go ahead and get the lobster. There is a tasting menu option, which is a great choice the seriously undecided for just a bit more than the 3 course menu.  For apps, I loved the scallops, but don't care too much for foie gras. The lobster main course was very good. Portion sizes are just perfect so you don't feel disgusting after all 3 rounds.  I must say though, dessert was hands down the best course.  The chocolate/raspberry bridge was very good.. but as soon as I tasted my pistachio dessert, I hardcore fell in love.  That was the most unique and wonderfully paired dessert I've ever had!!! I'm just salivating thinking back.......  Sigh! Other than that, I really enjoyed my expensive but delicously crafted cocktail (I got the floral one, sorry forgot the name!).  I would definitely come back here to celebrate a special occasion.  How romantic would it be to be proposed here?? Guys in serious relationships, take notes here! It's a beautiful, classy and upscale place. Valet parking and twinkling lights outside the garden. Totally in love! Highly recommend.",5.0
"I've been wanting to go here for a while, and while I'm glad I did, I probably won't go back. The food is fine but for the price you can get much higher quality fine dining food and service at say Bouley. I guess you are paying for the view. Service felt rushed and a little ad hoc. We had to ask for a wine menu as well as bread (we had a late sitting and were starving!). We also seemed to have many different people serving us. Overall though the setting is lovely and given its history it's still worth a visit to make up your own mind.",3.0

"Went here recently with the family for an Xmas day dinner. The view of lower Manhattan is breathtaking and the atmosphere of the dining rooms is elegant without being too ""white table cloth"". The service was good without being pretentious or too stiff. The food was great but if you are going to be paying the extreme prices of this place you are probably better off trading the views for a better meal at a place like Le Bernardin, Per Se, or other multi michelin star restaurants in the city. But if amazing views are your thing this is absolutely a good place to get a memorable meal.",4.0
"This place is adorable, albeit it was a cold night when we ventured in. Although it's a bit pricey, the staff seemed attentive and friendly; regardless it might seem like snooty joint.

On an autumn day or summer night, would be ideal sit on the patio and watch the passerby's.",4.0
"Date night here was PERFECT. We chose the fixed menu over the tasting menu because im a really picky eater and dont eat red meats, certain veggies (haha, im difficult).The food was very very good, but i cant say that i was focused on the food because i was so entranced by the atmosphere and gorgeous views. The live piano player was also an excellent touch. Oh and saw a couple get engaged here! The servers are beyond attentive. I set my purse on the floor under mh chair because i really dont care about it that much, and 5 minutes later a server brought out a small stool for me to place my purse on. A server also offered to move us to a table right by the window when a table cleared up.As great as this experience was, i dont know that i will return because i dont want to tarnish the perfect memory i have of my dinner here.

Both were mouth watering and we both shared from each other's plates. For the main course I had the poached Nova Scotia Lobster, squid ink cavatelli pasta, lobster infused marinara, lobster claw and spinach gratin. My man had the Colorado rack of lamb, grilled Merguez Lamb Sausage, fondant potatoes, mint and mustard seed glaze. Both the lobster and the lamb melted in your mouth. He ordered the lamb medium rare and it was as smooth and tender as butter. The lobster had my eyes rolling into the back of my head and my toes curling!We were both celebrating our birthdays, which are 2 days apart, and for dessert I had the Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge and he had the Apple Almond Pave'. Both were delicious and excellent and the staff was extremely friendly and attentive.

From our table we could see panoramic views of lower Manhattan. Even the napkins were personalized with the River Cafe logo on them! This place did not cut any corners anywhere. Everything they displayed, everything they did, and everything they said was perfect in all the right ways. It was formal, but not stuffy. One of the things that Ben did not love about the idea of coming to the River Cafe is that he was required to wear a sports jacket. We are a pretty casual couple (him more than me), but sometimes it is exciting to have an excuse to dress up and go all out! This place certainly felt special and I didn't mind the dress code because it made the experience that much more special! I would do it every night if I could afford it :)The amuse bouche was simple, but so tasty! It was gazpacho accompanied by a melon medallion with shaved feta and mint on top. Since it was the end of May, this was a perfect summertime treat! It was refreshing and tangy as gazpacho should be. The feta was sprinkled lightly on the plate, and not really a main part of the amuse bouche, but definitely helped add come creaminess to the otherwise very refreshing flavors.The Wild Shrimp appetizer was highly suggested by our waiter. It was served ""Oscar Style,"" which is topped with asparagus, crab, and Maltaise sauce. The shrimp were large and meaty and acted as a great base to soak up the extra citrusy Maltaise sauce. The crab meat added so much flavor to this dish and was an extra added bonus to a shrimp dish. The white asparagus was very unique to this dish, it was lighter in flavor than green asparagus and kept the dish very light and summery.The Octopus appetizer was delicious! The octopus was char-grilled with the edges being nice and crispy, while the inside was meaty and tender. The octopus pieces were served atop Yukon potato slices with fresh radishes and a light chimichurri sauce. The octopus was so flavorful that it didn't need to be dipped into the chimichurri sauce, which was great because we got to save the sauce for all the vegetables on the plate! The vegetables went very well with the chimichurri sauce and added a delicious herbal tangy flavor to each bite.The Lobster entree was to die for! This dish was the item on the menu I was most excited for. I think I may have died and gone to heaven when I took a bite of this dish. It was much for filling than it appeared in size, and it was so full of flavor that each bite was worth a million. It was served in the most unique way I have ever seen lobster served where the tail and the claw of the lobster were served in two very different preparations. The lobster tail was served over squid ink cavatelli pasta with lobster infused marinara, while the claw was cut up and prepared spinach gratin style and stuffed back inside part of the lobster shell. The lobster tail was so meaty and fresh, while the lobster claw was creamy and cheesy. I really enjoyed the top layer of the lobster spinach gratin because it was nice and crispy. The squid ink cavatelli pasta was homemade, most likely by hand, cooked perfectly and great for soaking up the lobster infused marinara, which had a nice slightly spicy but sweet and tangy flavor!The Lamb entree was an equally as impressive dish. The portion of this dish was huge with 2 slices of lamb with 2 ribs each which were extra meaty and tender. The lamb was cooked to perfection with a beautiful pink center. It was oozing with flavor and was so moist. The lamb was served atop a portion of fondant potatoes, which were extra crispy on the edges and nice and soft in the center. The mint sauce on the dish was extra light and added a hint of freshness to the otherwise very savory dish.The milk chocolate shuffle was extra gooey and creamy as can be! It was light and fluffy and reminded me of a s'more! The cream on the side was definitely whipped in-house! However, I wouldn't have minded if the dish was a touch more chocolatey, since it was milk chocolate vs. dark chocolate! Although, I can't complain, it was pretty amazing!The Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge was the highlight of the desserts! It was beautiful, rich, and amazing! It was almost too beautiful to eat! This dessert was ultra chocolatey! I loved that there was ice cream, sorbet, and meringue to satisfy my sweet tooth, and also my need for textural interest, with there being creamy and crunchy textures! I also loved the sweet and tartness of the raspberry paired with the richness of the chocolate and the creaminess of the ice cream! I can't wait to go back to the River Cafe!",5.0
"I took my wife here for her birthday, we were in NY on holiday and this was following a Broadway show. I'll start with the good. The view is beautiful, albeit it was a rainy day. The food was nice, not spectacular but 4* for sure. Now as to why it got 2*. Firstly I got a call to see if I'd be able to arrive earlier, i got the latest reservation of 10:30 on open table since it coincided with the show times. On arrival I see why. There were about 3 tables finishing up and soon enough we were the last table there. Throughout the whole meal i felt rushed to the point that my wife noticed and it dampened the mood. At various points where some privacy was appreciated there were people hovering, not to serve but to get us whatever we wanted to get us the hell outta there. They couldn't have given us and collected the check faster.On exiting I even regretted leaving only 10% tip given the farewell received. We've been going to many nice restaurants and this fell short off the potential. All in all,  I bet the service would have been better at an earlier time, but then why offer the time to book? I could have gone uptown somewhere in Manhattan for a view at that time and it'd be full. The food was not worth this at all,  and if i wanted that view there's an ice cream parlor and a seaside bench next door that'd have been just as effective.",2.0
"Upon arrival for dinner celebrating valentines, there was no wait at all for a table-- need reservations! The service was wonderful, was always attended whenever and the booth seats were really comfortable where I was able to sit next to my love instead of across. They do that so you can enjoy the SPECTACULAR view of the NYC skyline and Brooklyn bridge! FOOD WAS ON POINT! From appetizers entree dessert... HOLY SNAP THIS WAS ROMANTIC yet deliciously worth $$$$! Thinking of going in summer again for brunch!",5.0
"This place is fabulous. We arrived about 20 minute early( we had an 8pm reservation). We were told that we could be seated immediately or wait at the bar for a better table. We sat at the bar and ordered a few cocktails. They were ok. About 30 minutes later, we were escorted to a prime table right by the window. Yes!!! This place is expensive because Of the view of Manhattan. Beautiful!I love the fact that they brought out a stool to put my luxury purse on. Nice touch!We chose the 3 course meal because the 6 course chef tasting had a lot of unappealing dishes. For appetizers we had the wild shrimp Oscar style. Wonderful!For an entree we both had the lobster with the squid ink pasta. That was delicious as well.Finally for dessert I ordered the brooklyn bridge. It came with a candle and an edible happy birthday chocolate sign. Yummy!Overall this place is worth the price. The only thing I would change would be the chairs. They should be cushioned instead of picnic lawn chairs.",5.0
"The view is what makes this place but then again you can just grab an ice cream nearby and sit on a bench or better yet go to the famous pizzeria and take a stroll afterwards. That way you won't feel rushed. The food was actually tasty but considering we were on a mission to sample New York's finest, the service at the river cafe fell very short compared to everywhere else we have been to. The night started with more stars and quickly enough deteriorated when the host rushed to take the orders, I asked for an extra minute to decide on the entree, was reluctant to leave the table and pointed out that the kitchen was closing. At that point a suggestion could have come handier.The live music stopped as the group at one of the few tables left. The staff went into cleaning mode all the while chatting amongst themselves. The check appeared before we had a moment to sip our tea, ironically it was left on the table with the mandatory 'take your time' but they wanted to pick it up before we finished signing it. When you have the rainbow room experience the day before, I felt cheated out of a possibly great dinner. I guess the main point is Don't take late reservations if you can't follow through...",2.0
"First real chance to be out this spring and decided to walk around Brooklyn waterfront. We walked into the River Cafe and asked for an outdoor table.The Hostess actually told us that there was no table service outside but luckily the Maitre d' caught us on our way out and agreed that it was so beautiful out that he would accommodate us. We were really glad he did. Our waiter was EXCELLENT and the chef sent complimentary amuse bouche that was simply perfect!The lunch menu was a fixed price pairing of a choice of appetizer and entree. Every dish was perfect and delicious. As we sat enjoying the sun and our drinks, a sea lion surfaced just off the pier. A perfect end to a perfect lunch.",5.0
"We were here for a wedding and the venue was quaint and intimate.  We really liked the food BUT .. the staff was not very professional .. so if you are reading this review for a dinner experience, it's probably worth it if you are willing to splurge on the tasting menu.  However, if you are reading this for wedding venue review, make sure you are on top of it!!What we liked-  Both the angus beef and tuna tartar were delicious.  Wedding cake was also yummy-  Romantic ambiance with beautiful Manhattan skyline .. What we disliked-  The staff tossed out everyone's party favor while we were all on the dance floor.  The party favors were expensive whiskey bottles.  They were in a hurry to clean up the tables and rushed through the clean up.  Very unprofessional.  As a guest, we are extremely annoyed that the well prepared party favors were just tossedI would NOT recommend this place for a wedding .. unless you want to pay this type of fees in exchange for the sloppy service.",3.0
"I recently held a private event for my company here. Walking out extremely disappointed is putting it mildly for what we experienced. I was aware before walking in that this venue has a reputation of being pretentious and rude.  Well, I would say they 100% back up these accusations. This is going to be a long one!This all started off great!  The planning stage was fine, the private events coordinator being easy to work with and such.  We mentioned we wanted a DJ and their usual DJ contacted us right away. I arrived about 20-30 mins prior to my event to set up the seating cards and to make sure everything was set up according to plan.  Everything was pretty much perfect and the waiters and waitresses were helpful in making sure I was happy with everything thus far.Here is were it starts to go down hill.  Guests arrive and we are having our cocktail hour.  I am approached by one of the waiters giving me a heads up to start having our guests take their seats.  I ask for a few more minutes since we had guests still arriving.  Not even a minute later, I am chatting with my boss and was approached again.  Both myself and my boss ask again for a few more minutes for a few people to get settled.  Without warning, they being telling our guests to sit down.  I did not give the ok for anyone to begin doing that.  It was embarrassing and very rude.Moving on to the main event..dinner.   A number of my guests were disappointed in quality and serving size.  For the money that was spent, I was expecting top notch and what we received was something I could have paid a lot less for in a place where we would have been treated a lot nicer.Here is the real kicker!  According to the contract the party was to end at 11:30PM.  Also mentioned in that same contract was the option to extend the party and the pricing was listed for each allotment of time.  We are in the middle of dancing and enjoying the music when all of a sudden everything just stops.  I look over and the DJ left his table.  It looked like he set the last song and disappeared.  They begin to shut the lights on the terrace outside of the private room.  Then they begin to take the patio umbrellas in!!  I look at the time and it is 11:30PM.  My boss and I were so upset.  No one had even approached us to ask if we would like to extend the party.  Everything was just ended so abruptly it was mortifying.  Everyone was looking around and asking what was going on.  We were being rushed out!!  I ask for the bill and my boss asks if all parties here end so abruptly.  His answer was ""well 11:30PM was your end time and no one expressed they wanted to extend""  My boss's reply was ""Well we were never even asked, we were in the middle of dancing and things just shut down""  No one was sitting on their watches, we were enjoying the party!!  I have hosted events at other venues where I was approach about 15-20mins prior to the expected end time and I WAS ASKED if I wanted to extend since people were enjoying themselves.One of waiters then proceeds to announce in the middle of the room to please proceed to the front if anyone needs a cab.  I mentioned my car was valeted and he took my ticket before I even had a chance to get my coat.  We had people visiting from as far as Dallas, TX and I felt terrible that this was what they traveled for.Then to end our night I finally make my wobbly way in heels down the cobble stone walk way to get my car to see it drive down past me way down the driveway, what was the point of even valeting when I have to go chase my car down their driveway.  I am assuming they did this because they were allowing cabs to come in and I am almost hit by one trying to get to my car.  You have a bunch of valets with vests and walkie talkies directing traffic but yet it was still a mess. I then received more attitude when I approach the valet for my keys.  UNBELIEVABLE!",1.0
"Proposed to my gf here on her b-day.Food-wise: lamb was better than steak. Foie gras was bad (not sure it's just supposed to taste bad). Everything else was great.Service: i made a reservation 6 or 8 weeks in advance and wrote to them i'm proposing to my gf in the reservation note on opentable and tried to ask them for a good seat (near the river, windows seat) when i visited the restaurant a week before our reservation. But they declined saying windows seats are only for the loyal customers... Kind of disappointing that they do not honor people who make such an advance reservation...But the overall atmosphere is amazing with the pianist actually playing the instrument and it feels good to be there.Tips: order a half bottle of wine than a glass since it's likely you're there to celebrate something and you would want more than a glass. Their glass portion felt small. It's cheaper to get a half bottle.Also, most guys were wearing shirt and jackets while no ties. I wore my tie and suit and felt over-dressed since not too many were wearing actual suits. It was my first time having dinner at michelin star restaurant and it does feel good to go out to a nice restaurant like river cafe and feel like you've made some achievements in life.",4.0
"What a beautiful restaurant. This is one of the more expensive places that I've ever eaten in, but also one of the more majestic. The view while you are eating is incredible. The place itself is beautiful. Stand at that bar, have a cocktail and just try not to be overwhelmed by the view. Richard Kimball on the piano will make an evening in of itself. I've eaten here twice, once for brunch and once for dinner. Both were amazing. The desserts are just as good as the entrees. You have to try the Brooklyn Bridge Cake. A jacket is required.",5.0

"2 stars for the location, bread and dessert....First you arrive in a nice lobby where a hostess take your coat. We made reservations the day before and weren't informed about the ""Jacket mandatory for the gentlemen"" The good thing is that they provided one. Wife had a bad sprained ankle, had to wear very comfy boots (she wasn't dressed up, but looked casual nice with dress and flat boots)When making the reservation, we asked for a table next to the window, given that we were celebrating a birthday. We were assured that ""all tables were next to the window and had a view"". Guess what! we were seating in a remote corner, not at all next to the windows! NO view at all! We felt it was before we weren't ""pretty enough"" for the place, that they hid us. We saw at least 3 unoccupied tables by the windows, and none of them had people all through our meal.Dinner: here is another thing that we weren't made aware of: It's a pre-fixe menu, at $120 (excluding gratuity and drinks). You have to choose one appetizer, one entrée and one dessert. When we looked up online, my wife wanted to order a couple of appetizers instead of an appetizer and an entrée. She usually orders that way.Bread was goodSo appetizers: foie gras for her, crab for me. Crab was good, tasty. Foie gras was unedible. You know how foie gras is supposed to ""melt"" on warm toast. She is French, she knows foie gras. This foie gras was undercooked, with half of it being slimy pieces of almost raw liver. Just gaggin at the thought of it. She had to test every bite, mashing it with the fork, to make sure it was edible!! half of the foie was send back, nobody asked us why!ENtrees: strip steak and lobster. Yeah... while the strip steak was bland, the lobster was too salty! Desserts were good: The brooklyn bridge and some dessert with sherbet.Bill was something like $350 before gratuity.

"I've been wanting to try out The River Cafe, a 1-Michelin-starred restaurant, for quite some time, and on our recent NYC trip, we were able to try them out for brunch!  This Cafe has been around since '77, and is attributed in redeveloping the Brooklyn waterfront.  Hurricane Sandy flooded this restaurant with 4 feet of water, so after 15 months of renovation, it finally re-opened in early February of '14.  For Brunch, they only offer a pre-fixe menu, in which items like Chilled East and West Coast Oysters, Caviar Service, Wagyu Steak Tartare, Duck Breast, and Waffle Eggs Benedict are offered.  There were also some chef's compliments, like the egg filled with banana flan with granola and fruits (SO GOOD) and a cranberry loaf with orange butter (yum!).  For appetizers, I had the Crisp Duck Egg (creamy spinach, duck foie gras sauce, and Sauternes pickled Spring onion - this was such a cute dish, where the duck egg was lightly battered and fried to a slight crisp, but the inside was still soft and runny - it wasn't salty at all, and it was a nice light dish, considering it's a duck egg!), and my husband had the Pear Salad (warm caramelized pear, frisee, apple cider dressing, goat cheese fondue, bacon, and toasted walnut; this salad was absolutely delicious, as it was light, but creamy, refreshing from the apple cider dresing, and the goat cheese fondue and the salty bacon chunks added a nice element to it!). We also shared the Hudson Valley Foie Gras Two Ways (classic pressed terrine and foie gras mousse, fresh rhubarb and warm griddled brioche slices on the side - this was literally one of the best terrine I've had - decadent and it had a lovely flavor; I just wished there was a little bit more of that fresh rhubarb!).  For our entrees, I had the Maine Lobster (poached fresh lobster, celery root puree, sweet and sour butternut squash, and brussel sprout leaves - a whole lobster, de-shelled, perfectly cooked, but a little too sweet with the butternut squash and the celery root puree), and the hubsters had the Golden Pancakes (buttermilk pancakes, 24-carat gold dusted milk chocolate, caramelized hazelnuts, smokey bacon (on the side), with Vermont maple syrup - this was quite delicious!  Not just any buttermilk pancakes, but perfectly griddled, and a lovely strip of literally gold-colored milk chocolate with hot Vermont maple syrup - yum yum yum!).  We were seated by Josh, who was oh-so-awesome and oh-so-cool, and our server was Steven, who had a great sense of humor :D  Both were extremely attentive, made sure that everything was perfect, and that we were having a grand time!  Even though it was a rainy day, the view was still nice, and I would love to come back for dinner, as I'm sure the Manhattan skyline would just be spectacular!  It's been quite some time since I'd had a brunch this enjoyable :D  Lovely food, great service, and a lovely view - check the River Cafe out! :D+Brunch menu is pre-fixe (reservations highly recommended!)+Pear Salad+Crisp Duck Egg+Golden Pancakes (ritzy and delicious!!!)+ask for Josh and Steven :D",5.0

"2 stars for the location, bread and dessert....First you arrive in a nice lobby where a hostess take your coat. We made reservations the day before and weren't informed about the ""Jacket mandatory for the gentlemen"" The good thing is that they provided one. Wife had a bad sprained ankle, had to wear very comfy boots (she wasn't dressed up, but looked casual nice with dress and flat boots)When making the reservation, we asked for a table next to the window, given that we were celebrating a birthday. We were assured that ""all tables were next to the window and had a view"". Guess what! we were seating in a remote corner, not at all next to the windows! NO view at all! We felt it was before we weren't ""pretty enough"" for the place, that they hid us. We saw at least 3 unoccupied tables by the windows, and none of them had people all through our meal.Dinner: here is another thing that we weren't made aware of: It's a pre-fixe menu, at $120 (excluding gratuity and drinks). You have to choose one appetizer, one entrée and one dessert. When we looked up online, my wife wanted to order a couple of appetizers instead of an appetizer and an entrée. She usually orders that way.Bread was goodSo appetizers: foie gras for her, crab for me. Crab was good, tasty. Foie gras was unedible. You know how foie gras is supposed to ""melt"" on warm toast. She is French, she knows foie gras. This foie gras was undercooked, with half of it being slimy pieces of almost raw liver. Just gaggin at the thought of it. She had to test every bite, mashing it with the fork, to make sure it was edible!! half of the foie was send back, nobody asked us why!ENtrees: strip steak and lobster. Yeah... while the strip steak was bland, the lobster was too salty! Desserts were good: The brooklyn bridge and some dessert with sherbet.Bill was something like $350 before gratuity. We don't mind spending that kind of money, even more if the food is on point, and we don't feel like we are a disgrace to the restaurant.

"I'd like to say first that the chicken here is amazing! It was delicious! My main entree also came with waffles and each bite was sweet and delectable.Since it was a 3-course dinner I had to choose an appetizer first which I did not care for any on the menu. I asked for a garden salad but the taste of vinegar was too overwhelming so I left it untouched. The main entree saved the restaurant from getting 3 stars. The dessert looked very pretty but I've had better chocolate desserts at other fine dining restaurants. And the view was excellent but I needed to enjoy each entree to deserve 5 stars.We enjoyed our time despite getting 'looks' from other patrons dining there.

"What a wonderful restaurant. We were dressed to the nine's, celebrating a special occasion, and had requested on the resy that they sit us by the window, so that's what they did (the wait staff was excellent). The food was not particularly innovative (that's not what they're known for), but it was really well done, and sometimes the classics are just what I need. We had the corn ravioli (ok, I guess that is kind of innovative), wagyu tartare, lobster, and lamb. For dessert, of course we had to get the somewhat kitschy Brooklyn Bridge dessert (better looking than tasting).Tip: They have a bar that also looks out into the bridge, so if you don't want to spend $$$$ on dinner, you can spend $$$ siting at the bar sipping bubbles.",4.0

"This is a true New York institution that rivals the best restaurants in the city. FOODWhile the 5-course dinner tasting menu is pricey ($155 pp) the lunch menu on the weekends is a steal ($42 pp for two courses). All of the food was top top notch. My girlfriend and I shared two apps - a crab cake that came with uni and avocado, and steak tartare with quail egg. Both dishes were equal parts beautiful and delicious. My GF's mom had the kale ravioli with oxtail which was a special and it was also delicious. My mother had a scallop with foie gras. Every bite I had around the table was superb. I would recommend the ravioli and the scallop as the best of the four.For the main course my girlfriend and I shared the duck with spatzle and the branzino with chorizo crust. We were torn between the fish dishes, but it was the duck that really excelled. The meat was perfectly cooked with a sort of berry compote that tasted like thanksgiving. Everyone who ordered the duck was extremely satisfied. The branzino was also good but not as superlative. The crust on it had a sort of grilled cheese taste. Now I love grilled cheese but not on my fish. My girlfriend's mother got the niman ranch steak which was a prime cut cooked perfectly with a side of creamy mashed potatoes. I recommend sticking to the meat dishes. For dessert we shared the chocolate souffle and almond-apple tart. Both were tasty. We skipped the famous brooklyn bridge because I've heard it's more style over substance.Overall the food was very, very good. I would feel $155 for dinner is stretch, but again the lunch deal is impossible to pass up.DRINKSWe shared a bottle of sancerre (an always excellent white) which was a somewhat modest $52.SERVICEI would put the service at River Cafe above any other restaurant in the city. It was technically on the level with it's more international rivals, but it was more down to earth, pleasant, and less pretentious than the Bouley's and Per Se's on the world. It really has an old american feel to it that is hard to replicate.AMBIANCEThis is where the River Cafe excels over all rivals. Situated right on the water in Dumbo with floor to ceiling windows showing up the Manhattan skyline and statue of liberty make it the single most breath taking ground floor restaurant in the city if not the country. Add to that an incredible display of flowers inside and out of the restaurant, and you have a picture perfect spot. There was a wedding there during our saturday lunch and I think that's a good idea.OVERALLGraduation, anniversary, engagement, birthday - find any excuse to come celebrate at River Cafe. Come for lunch to sample the treasures without breaking the bank. Enjoy this ideal symbol of restaurant greatness.",5.0
"I'd like to start off by saying, if your planning to go to the river cafe, your planning to spend $$$$, but it is well worth the money! To say this place is special is an understatement. The restaurant is located just adjacent to the Brooklyn bridge and offers breath taking views of the NYC skyline. Tip for those new to the area or restaurant, try to go during the evening time to watch the sunset in addition to this try to be seated closer to the water. When we went, we were seated towards the back of the restaurant and although every seat offered a view of the city, I believe those seats where that much more spectacular. The food was amazing. Small in quantity as you would expect for most high end restaurants in NYC but that taste is unforgettable. I had rabbit for appetizer and duck for entree. My wife had a very nice cut of beef cooked exactly as she ordered. The food is above and beyond. Service was highly attentive. They were there to serve. Very attentive to refilling wine, water, bringing extras like bread (oh and the dinner rolls were unbelievable). The setting was amazing as I eluded to earlier. Don't leave this place in a hurry. Walk around the grounds. They have a beautiful garden nearby which you can sit in. Super romantic. They also have a small dock side next to the restaurant. Also try to enjoy DUMBO. It's an amazing part of Brooklyn! And when your finished with all your experience, the restaurant will bring you home in one on their private cars (if you really want the convenience) or you can flag a cab (if your looking to save some money) This is the perfect spot for a special occasion. I went for my first anniversary. I would definitely recommend this place to others and would love to go again for a special occasion.",5.0

"I love this place, their food is always excellent and the location is absolutely perfect.I saw this place in the Sopranos and I had to check it out. We got the roasted rabbit and tuna tartar for appetizers. For our main course, we had the black sea bass and the duck breast. I don't think my pallet is sophisticated enough to pick up all of the flavor notes, it was kind of a sensory overload. I think my favorite was the sea bass, it just fell apart and melted in my mouth. It would be impossible for me to even get close to mimicking anything they cooked in at home, and I've been cooking for quite some time.You can't beat the view or the live piano player either. If you're a visitor, make a reservation for this place, it's a great way to experience the city. Don't forget about the dress code.",5.0
"This place was beyond what I expected! I came here for a dinner for my boyfriends birthday. He was astonished and the scenery was out of this world. Loved the ambiance and the piano playing in the background (especially since we're music lovers).What I appreciated most is that they accommodated my boyfriend and I even though we were late for our reservations. The restaurant's kitchen closes at 11 & we came in at 11:05 and they still let us eat. So I'm extremely grateful for that.  The food was okay. Nothing crazy. I got steak it was cooked well for my liking & the shrimp appetizer was really good though. I know we came late, but I did feel rushed. I didn't get to explore the menu and ask questions the way I wanted to. So I just ordered safely with the steak. I did feel like I was being watched a lot. I don't know if it's because they really wanted us to leave or they wanted to ensure customer satisfaction. Anyways, I would definitely recommend this spot to someone else.",5.0

"What a wonderful restaurant. We were dressed to the nine's, celebrating a special occasion, and had requested on the resy that they sit us by the window, so that's what they did (the wait staff was excellent). The food was not particularly innovative (that's not what they're known for), but it was really well done, and sometimes the classics are just what I need. We had the corn ravioli (ok, I guess that is kind of innovative), wagyu tartare, lobster, and lamb. For dessert, of course we had to get the somewhat kitschy Brooklyn Bridge dessert (better looking than tasting).Tip: They have a bar that also looks out into the bridge, so if you don't want to spend $$$$ on dinner, you can spend $$$ siting at the bar sipping bubbles.",4.0
"I love this place so much, we were lucky that our table was sitting next to window, which they have excellent view of Brooklyn bridge, river, and Manhattan. Lunch is more casual than dinner, and the price is reasonable and acceptable. We ordered Foie gras, lobster, and their signature Brooklyn bridge chocolate cake, they are all delicious. I can't find any critic yet. Overall end up with 90/pp. good for anniversary and birthday. Definitely come back :)",5.0
"This is a true New York institution that rivals the best restaurants in the city. FOODWhile the 5-course dinner tasting menu is pricey ($155 pp) the lunch menu on the weekends is a steal ($42 pp for two courses). All of the food was top top notch. My girlfriend and I shared two apps - a crab cake that came with uni and avocado, and steak tartare with quail egg. Both dishes were equal parts beautiful and delicious. My GF's mom had the kale ravioli with oxtail which was a special and it was also delicious. My mother had a scallop with foie gras. Every bite I had around the table was superb. I would recommend the ravioli and the scallop as the best of the four.For the main course my girlfriend and I shared the duck with spatzle and the branzino with chorizo crust. We were torn between the fish dishes, but it was the duck that really excelled. The meat was perfectly cooked with a sort of berry compote that tasted like thanksgiving. Everyone who ordered the duck was extremely satisfied. The branzino was also good but not as superlative. The crust on it had a sort of grilled cheese taste. Now I love grilled cheese but not on my fish. My girlfriend's mother got the niman ranch steak which was a prime cut cooked perfectly with a side of creamy mashed potatoes. I recommend sticking to the meat dishes. For dessert we shared the chocolate souffle and almond-apple tart. Both were tasty. We skipped the famous brooklyn bridge because I've heard it's more style over substance.Overall the food was very, very good. I would feel $155 for dinner is stretch, but again the lunch deal is impossible to pass up.DRINKSWe shared a bottle of sancerre (an always excellent white) which was a somewhat modest $52.SERVICEI would put the service at River Cafe above any other restaurant in the city. It was technically on the level with it's more international rivals, but it was more down to earth, pleasant, and less pretentious than the Bouley's and Per Se's on the world. It really has an old american feel to it that is hard to replicate.AMBIANCEThis is where the River Cafe excels over all rivals. Situated right on the water in Dumbo with floor to ceiling windows showing up the Manhattan skyline and statue of liberty make it the single most breath taking ground floor restaurant in the city if not the country. Add to that an incredible display of flowers inside and out of the restaurant, and you have a picture perfect spot. There was a wedding there during our saturday lunch and I think that's a good idea.OVERALLGraduation, anniversary, engagement, birthday - find any excuse to come celebrate at River Cafe. Come for lunch to sample the treasures without breaking the bank. Enjoy this ideal symbol of restaurant greatness.",5.0
"I'd like to start off by saying, if your planning to go to the river cafe, your planning to spend $$$$, but it is well worth the money! To say this place is special is an understatement. The restaurant is located just adjacent to the Brooklyn bridge and offers breath taking views of the NYC skyline. Tip for those new to the area or restaurant, try to go during the evening time to watch the sunset in addition to this try to be seated closer to the water.

"The food was great. Josh, the host, was not. We could only get a granny 6pm reservation, which whatever. Fine. We shouldn't have waited so long. My boyfriend asked if we could get a window seat. I realize these are in demand, but we're going to be there for early bird special--why not? Whoever took our reservation said that they were given out first come/first serve and that if we showed up early, we'd have a better shot. So we got there at 5:30 and asked about the window. The restaurant was nearly completely empty. Perhaps two tables had been seated and two people waiting at the bar. Josh said window tables were only for regulars. The boyfriend repeated what the person who answered the phone had told him and Josh just smiled and shrugged. My man said, ""so basically the person on the phone lied and we could've taken our time getting here?"" I mean, who wants to eat at 6pm, let alone 5:30? Josh just kept repeating himself. Josh needs to speak to the people who take reservations so they can tell people who call that unless he's wearing a Rolex and she's wearing Manolos (and they're both over 80), you're not getting a window seat. I am not a fan of Josh. Ironically, the main reason we went was because we were trying out places to hold a family member's 80th birthday party later this year. It won't be at the River Cafe, that's for sure. Thanks, Josh!",3.0
"Situated beneath the Brooklyn Bridge with striking views of Manhattan from the East River, the iconic River Cafe does not disappoint for a special occasion.I took my boyfriend here for his birthday for the first time and was impressed. The decor was very classic and the atmosphere - sophisticated. The courtyard was adorned with fresh flowers secluded from the hustle and bustle of the DUMBO piers. The staff was a little stuffy, but extremely knowledgeable and polite. DRESS CODE: Men must wear a jacket at all times past 5pm or admittance will be terminated. Look sharp and presentable - everyone else will be too. I saw a couple get turned away for a dress code violation so be aware of their policies which can be found on their website.The food is pricey but worth it. $115 for prix-fixe and a more expensive 6 course tasting menu is available. Check the website for the items that will be available for the evening. The chocolate mousse Brooklyn Bridge is a must-try. All in all, have your wallet ready and a reservation booked early in advance, bring a suit jacket and have an empty stomach.P.S.

We didn't get the view we'd hoped for-- we thought we would have a window seat, but were seated in probably the worst spot by where the food comes out.

"I was really hoping for a great night to celebrate my best friend and my husband's birthday. Despite the glowing review by NYT's Pete Wells, I was disappointed by our evening.Service was really bad. The coat attendant and the maitre d were a pleasure but problems started with our waiter. He didn't welcome us to the restaurant and proceeded to provide very little explanation of the options after we asked several questions (Q: ""Tell us about the tasting?"" A: ""We're not doing that anymore tonight I think.""). It was a full night and he seemed very rushed to take our order. After going to Stone Barns Blue Hill last week, the service at River Cafe paled in comparison.The food itself was satisfactory but felt unoriginal. Our table ordered an array of entrees (poached lobster, the lamb chops, mushroom Wellington...). No one volunteered thoughts about their meal until I inquired their thoughts (when I did, responses were typically ""it's good""). The ambience is beautiful, a true NY classic on the water which gave them the extra star on my review.

"The iconic River Cafe is an amazing setting for a special occasion. A perfect destination for a journey starting on the brooklyn bridge which combines a classy dining room with breaktaking views of the East river and Manhattan skyline.The service, while bordering on stuffy, is polite, knowledgable and courteous. The menu offering a 3 course menu for around $115, as well as a pricier 6-course chef's tasting menu, has something for everyone. Each course gives you the choice from some ten options, meaning that you and your date can try several options between you. This, coupled with a litany of tasty sounding creations leaves you spoiled for choice. The goods, once they arrive, perfectly deliver on the promise of the mouth watering descriptions; we attacked each course with gusto and were never disappointed. Dessert and drinks menus are also comprehensive - the Brooklyn Bridge dessert if a must-try.

"I had an amazing time here. I came here about a year ago and I'm writing the review now because I recently got on yelp but that doesn't change all the great things I have to say about this place! From the ambience to the food to the service, I have nothing but praise for this restaurant. The view is beautiful since it's right in Brooklyn Bridge Park and the restaurant itself is beautifully decorated with a nautical theme. The little garden in front of the restaurant is a great place to take pictures (perhaps not at night because there were mosquitos). The service here is top notch, they come around with a bread basket every now and then in case you wanted more bread. They come across and sweep off all the crumbs after every course. We opted for the 3 course set menu and everything on the menu seemed amazing. From their menu at the time, I started with the fried oyster wrapped with smoked salmon topped with caviar and my date got the grilled octopus. Both dishes were full of flavor; I especially liked mine, everything complimented each other very well. For our main courses, I had the steak with mashed potatoes in bone marrow and my date had the lobster. The steak was melt in your mouth good and the mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had (even to this day). The lobster tasted very fresh and it came with a sauce that tasted like corn which completed the dish. In between the entrees, the amuse bouches were watermelon with feta and a tomato soup. Both were very yummy. For dessert, I had a pistachio semifreddo and it was absolutely delicious. What really wowed me was the other dessert we ordered, the Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge. It was literally a chocolate Brooklyn Bridge. It looked amazing and tasted just as amazing. The chocolate was rich but not too sweet since it was a mix of milk and dark chocolate. In the end, they even brought us some complimentary treats. A wonderful experience and I would definitely go back often if I could. I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion.",5.0

"A signature dining experience for us during a visit to Brooklyn. We arrived a little early and settled comfortably in the piano bar with cocktails to await our third guest. It was early evening on a rainy October day so the view of lower Manhattan was misty yet inspiring. Service was attentive and friendly and we were seated promptly after our guest arrived.We enjoyed the two course pris fixe dinner, starting with tuna tartar for one guest and the Wagyu beef steak tartare for the other two. The Wagyu came in a neat circle with rays of condiments surrounding. The shell of the shiny quail egg was propped to the side and served as a cellar for a measure of sea salt. The entrees of lamb and duck breast were expertly prepared and simply presented. The wine list is a little dangerous but with the cooperative maitre'd we were able to select 2 bottles of red that were reasonably priced and bold enough for the meal. We finished with the Madeira flight and confections for dessert. A wonderful evening. Highly recommended to anyone with the occasion to dress up and eat well.",4.0

Beautiful presentation as well. Compremantary dessert. Mine is a Brooklyn bridge chocolate cake. I don't have sweet tooth so 90% of bridge was left untouched.

"If you ever have the pleasure of coming here, do it on the 4th of July!A friend of mine invited me to a dinner party for the 4th. Yes me... i thought ummmm is this place ready for all of my personality, including my loud laugh??? Then I thought about the guest list for the dinner party and figured the river cafe didn't know what they got themselves into when they gave us a reservation. 1st... there is a bit of a dress code: Men make sure you wear a jacket...YES, even in the summer. Ladies grab a sundress or cocktail dress and leave the jeans and flip flops for the diner. 2nd... the fine dining experience is a bit different. The pre-fixe menu included, complimentary champagne and caviar, appetizer, entree, and dessert. Veuve clicquot is served... a goodie and out comes the caviar. Not a fan of caviar, but the mini pancakes that it came with were good (clearly, my fine dining training is minimal..LOL). For the appetizer I had the arugula salad w/ strawberries, beets, and a light dressing...pretty tasty. For my entree I had the strip steak and it was flavorful and made just right. Dessert was a smorgasbord of treats...chocolate bk bridge, a mini ice cream bar, and something else I couldn't identify but it was tasty. The other guest ordered the duck, the lamb, the mushroom wellington and seemed to be in heaven. 3rd....the feeling of being served is a bit amazing. Our waiter or waiters were more than accommodating and seemed to appear when you thought of them. Just enjoy the experience. 4th....you will be selling a body part to pay for your meal.

"Snobby service. Not friendly to non-regulars. Inattentive. Over priced. Food is underwhelming.

Overall, disappointed. Easily the very worst experience I've had at dinner. Too bad -- we were really looking forward to it. Certainly not a romantic setting despite the view.",1.0

"Wowza!  Was surprised and taken here for a special occasion &I it definitely is a WOW-er. As you walk in you are greeted by a couple of hostesses in the lobby and are ushered into the actual restaurant after confirming your reservation. We were a bit early, so asked to sit at the bar. I ordered a Sauvignon Blanc, for 13.00..which honestly not too bad given the caliber of this restaurant & the price that they charge for food. As we sat down, I felt like we had a team of staffers ready to help at any turn of the head. They brought over a small bench for my purse to be placed beside the table which I loved! The menu is pre fixe and you have the option of a three course for $115.00 per person or a six course tasting menu for $145.00 per person. The staff brought over a complimentary chilled gazpacho soup & a small watermelon and feta bite which was great. I feel like the appetizer choices could have included at least one option for someone who's palate  is not as experienced besides a salad, my date was adventitious and had the rabbit, because in his words ""I am not spending this amount of money and getting a salad"". He actually loved it and I tried it and it had a  mild surprising taste. I ordered the Wild shrimp with white asparagus and crabmeat which was DELICIOUS. Both of us devoured every bite of our appetizers. For entrees, I ordered the branzino fillet, served with an amazing shrimp and chorizo crust and he ordered the 16 oz strip steak accompanied by bone marrow mash (again stepping out of his comfort zone)  everything again was devoured. The River Cafe definitely knows the exact amount of food to leave you satisfied but not overly stuffed. On to the desert, we had the Brooklyn Bridge & the warm marshmallow and chocolate soufflé. They were beautifully plated and SO yummy. The staff had Happy Anniversary written in chocolate for us along with candles, which was beautiful. The view is spectacular and I am sure at night it is beyond words (we dined from around (5:30 to 7:40 before running off to our play). It is extremely expensive and I deducted a star maybe because I am cheap- but believe that it is just a bit overboard. The staff is extremely friendly, and made us feel like we belonged and  actually could afford eating there without selling our firstborn. Would definitely recommend coming here for a special occasion.",4.0
"This place is disappointing all around. It is snobbish, stuck-up, and tacky. The kind of crowd you find here is rich old people, who have bribed the maitre'd for a window seat (yes, I literally saw the maitre'd, Josh, get bribed 50 dollars for a window seat). Looking around, the entire staff is white. EVERYONE! From the front desk girls, to the servers and valets- there is not any diversity... The man in charge of hiring is clearly a racist-- or has some kind of problem with diversity. To go further into complaint surrounding the employees, everyone just radiates fakeness and gives off a creepy vibe due to their over bearing and exuding (and dreadfully faked) attitude.The food was okay. I wouldn't recommend this place for the food. The view is nice, however. I'm not sure it's worth 120 per person, though. My fiancee ordered a salad and was surprised to find only two asparagus on his plate. All in all, the River Cafe exudes a pretentious, racist, and misogynistic vibe. Whether it be not hiring any people of color, or forcing the women to dress in dresses and heels (there was a front desk girl sitting on the floor in agony from the pain her heels had caused her when I walked out), this place needs some social reforms.  They also need some decorative reforms, because it reeks old school, tacky, and conservative.",1.0
"Really cute environment, but food a little underwhelming.I came with two friends on a Saturday evening, and we were seated with a nice view of the river. My main entree was the monkfish, which was decent but really nothing particularly special. I tasted a piece of my friend's lamb, which was well flavored and probably a better dish. I had the souffle for my dessert, which was nice and not too strongly flavored, but overall not worthy of the price tag, in my opinion. It does have quite a nice ambiance and is great for an intimate meal in that sense, but the food just wasn't nearly up to snuff for me.",3.0
"Went here for my birthday last week and it was a wonderful, old world New York experience. It's refined luxury. When you walk up to the restaurant, it really is beautiful.

I started with the corn ravioli and then had the duck with sweet potato spaetzle and my husband started with the foie gras and then had the steak and bone marrow mashed potatoes (which were pretty cool, as they were served in the bone).  Our server left something to be desired which was a bit annoying for such a nice restaurant, but overall an excellent experience!",4.0

Our waiter or waiters were more than accommodating and seemed to appear when you thought of them. Just enjoy the experience. 4th....you will be selling a body part to pay for your meal. It is pricey, but 1 time a year it's okay to splurge.",4.0
"Snobby service. Not friendly to non-regulars. Inattentive. Over priced. Food is underwhelming. Not many tables with a good ocean/bridge view -- or at least not offered to non-regular customers as I was rudely told by the waiter. There was an unappealing ""old boys club"" vibe to the place. Overall, disappointed. Easily the very worst experience I've had at dinner. Too bad -- we were really looking forward to it. Certainly not a romantic setting despite the view.",1.0
"One of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to. Had the steak tartare as an appetizer, chicken as an entree, and pistachio dessert. The steak tartare, chicken and dessert was extremely good. I have no complaints. My significant other had the ravioli as an appetizer, the lobster as an entree, and the Brooklyn bridge dessert. It was truly an amazing experience to dine in here. Pricey food but definitely worth every penny!",5.0
"Wowza!  Was surprised and taken here for a special occasion &I it definitely is a WOW-er. As you walk in you are greeted by a couple of hostesses in the lobby and are ushered into the actual restaurant after confirming your reservation. We were a bit early, so asked to sit at the bar. I ordered a Sauvignon Blanc, for 13.00..which honestly not too bad given the caliber of this restaurant & the price that they charge for food. As we sat down, I felt like we had a team of staffers ready to help at any turn of the head. They brought over a small bench for my purse to be placed beside the table which I loved! The menu is pre fixe and you have the option of a three course for $115.00 per person or a six course tasting menu for $145.00 per person. The staff brought over a complimentary chilled gazpacho soup & a small watermelon and feta bite which was great. I feel like the appetizer choices could have included at least one option for someone who's palate  is not as experienced besides a salad, my date was adventitious and had the rabbit, because in his words ""I am not spending this amount of money and getting a salad"". He actually loved it and I tried it and it had a  mild surprising taste. I ordered the Wild shrimp with white asparagus and crabmeat which was DELICIOUS. Both of us devoured every bite of our appetizers. For entrees, I ordered the branzino fillet, served with an amazing shrimp and chorizo crust and he ordered the 16 oz strip steak accompanied by bone marrow mash (again stepping out of his comfort zone)  everything again was devoured. The River Cafe definitely knows the exact amount of food to leave you satisfied but not overly stuffed. On to the desert, we had the Brooklyn Bridge & the warm marshmallow and chocolate soufflé. They were beautifully plated and SO yummy. The staff had Happy Anniversary written in chocolate for us along with candles, which was beautiful. The view is spectacular and I am sure at night it is beyond words (we dined from around (5:30 to 7:40 before running off to our play). It is extremely expensive and I deducted a star maybe because I am cheap- but believe that it is just a bit overboard. The staff is extremely friendly, and made us feel like we belonged and  actually could afford eating there without selling our firstborn. Would definitely recommend coming here for a special occasion.",4.0
"This place is disappointing all around. It is snobbish, stuck-up, and tacky. The kind of crowd you find here is rich old people, who have bribed the maitre'd for a window seat (yes, I literally saw the maitre'd, Josh, get bribed 50 dollars for a window seat). Looking around, the entire staff is white. EVERYONE! From the front desk girls, to the servers and valets- there is not any diversity... The man in charge of hiring is clearly a racist-- or has some kind of problem with diversity. To go further into complaint surrounding the employees, everyone just radiates fakeness and gives off a creepy vibe due to their over bearing and exuding (and dreadfully faked) attitude.The food was okay. I wouldn't recommend this place for the food. The view is nice, however. I'm not sure it's worth 120 per person, though. My fiancee ordered a salad and was surprised to find only two asparagus on his plate. All in all, the River Cafe exudes a pretentious, racist, and misogynistic vibe. Whether it be not hiring any people of color, or forcing the women to dress in dresses and heels (there was a front desk girl sitting on the floor in agony from the pain her heels had caused her when I walked out), this place needs some social reforms.  They also need some decorative reforms, because it reeks old school, tacky, and conservative.",1.0
"Really cute environment, but food a little underwhelming.I came with two friends on a Saturday evening, and we were seated with a nice view of the river. My main entree was the monkfish, which was decent but really nothing particularly special. I tasted a piece of my friend's lamb, which was well flavored and probably a better dish. I had the souffle for my dessert, which was nice and not too strongly flavored, but overall not worthy of the price tag, in my opinion. It does have quite a nice ambiance and is great for an intimate meal in that sense, but the food just wasn't nearly up to snuff for me.",3.0
"Went here for my birthday last week and it was a wonderful, old world New York experience. It's refined luxury. When you walk up to the restaurant, it really is beautiful. The views are incredible and the food, while not super innovative, was delicious and well executed. I started with the corn ravioli and then had the duck with sweet potato spaetzle and my husband started with the foie gras and then had the steak and bone marrow mashed potatoes (which were pretty cool, as they were served in the bone).  Our server left something to be desired which was a bit annoying for such a nice restaurant, but overall an excellent experience!",4.0

Amazing! The view was nice and everyone was polite. Service was great. Servers r very attentive. The menu changes seasonally. I got a tuna foie for appetizer which was absolutely delicious!

There's a lot of food so don't be shy to ask them to pack for to go. I didn't see anyone around me finish their food!!!Total was abt $150 per person without drinks.

"Great restaurant, excellent service, but beware of livery cab scam!Our party of six visited this restaurant in the evening to celebrate a friend's birthday. The best views of Manhattan are naturally from the tables by the windows.  The inner tables are still very nice, but their views are limited by the awnings and at night by the glare from the lights inside.The food was very good, but not sufficiently outstanding that we would return solely for that part of the restaurant experience.   Because of the size of our party, we were able to try several of the appetizers and main courses. While everyone was very satisfied, none of us was blown away by the offerings.The service was excellent and the waiter made sure we enjoyed our celebration. He was very professional, knowledgeable and attentive throughout the dinner.  We never felt rushed or that we were waiting for attention. The various stages of the meal, from drinks to appetizers to main course to dessert were all extremely well-timed.As we were leaving the restaurant, we were approached by one of the parking attendants who asked us if we had transportation. We told him that we were going to request an Uber car (which was 4 minutes away), to which he replied that there was a taxi outside that was large enough to accommodate our group. After enjoying such a great evening, we were caught off guard and did not notice that he was not directing us to a taxi but, rather, a livery cab. The driver charged us $60 to travel a shorter distance (to Chinatown) than an Uber cab had charged us $23 when we travelled to the restaurant (from TriBeca) three hours earlier. Technically, it was our fault for not negotiating a price ahead of time - but to take advantage of our trust after a great dinner and to charge us more than 2.5 times the true value of the ride was not just bad style, but abusive. Five stars for the overall ambiance, five stars for the service, four stars for the food, but the classless livery cab scam detracted from our experience and reflects very poorly on this otherwise beautiful restaurant.",4.0
"I found out about this restaurant through yelp and a few recommendations from coworkers. I made a reservation a month in advanced and was looking forward to spending my last night in New York here. The view would have been amazing but we were sat in this awkward corner and very close to both tables either side. The service was great and everyone was welcoming.

Definitely not worth the price tag, and on top of it all I was sick the next day nauseous and vomiting the whole way home which is not fun on an airplane.",2.0

We got there at 11:45 am on a Saturday. Great view. Beautiful restaurant. Got the apple paté for dessert. It was good, but nowhere as good as the little tastes they ""give"" you. Oh, and the little tiny appetizers at the very beginning, compliments of the chef. DELICIOUS! Chilled melon soup and teeny tiny bacon fig sandwich. WOW!Not cheap, but worth it.",5.0
"I am actually really impressed by this place. My husband took me here for our one year anniversary. He didn't tell me where we were going, so when I walked in I was almost taken aback by how uptight this place is. He didn't read the dress code, so he didn't wear a suit jacket, but they are happy to provide one for you. The waiters and everyone in general are super attentive and do their best to make the experience great. When I heard that it was a fixed menu for dinner (appetizer, dinner and dessert) I was expecting really small portions and thought I would leave hungry, not the case. Everything we ordered was really good and we were super stuffed. The only thing I didn't like (but he did) was the bone marrow potato that came with the strip steak, it was a little dry for my taste.In my opinion, this is a place to come to for special occasions. It is very romantic during dinner and I would return here to celebrate another occasion, I don't think I'd come back on a regular day. For me this place is more about the experience and the view than the food itself. The view is beautiful as well as the restaurant grounds. There is a small garden with benches that is really lovely.Price wise this place is expensive, if you're coming for dinner plan on spending over $300 (for two people). And yes, the people here can come off as snobbish and stuck up, but they are just catering to the majority of the crowd that comes here. If you don't like that kind of atmosphere, this is definitely not the place for you.",5.0
"We came here to celebrate my birthday. First off, the ambiance and view of the city is breathtakingly amazing. You are directly adjacent and under the bk bridge, which provides a vista of the river and bay with spectacular light reflecting off of the water.Now before I begin, take note that my original ranking was going to be 2 stars, but due to ratification by manager, this was amended to 3. We were seated in the middle of the dining room even though we asked for  a table by the window so we could enjoy the view. The host told us that we could not be accommodated because they are reserved for regulars. WWHHHAATTTTTT!? Needless to say, the table we wanted remained vacant for the entire time we were there (close to 3 hrs)Now onto the food. The menu is prix fixe at $115 per person with choices from starters, entrees, and desert. Each item was great and well prepared. They just took forever to come out and we had three different waiters, and four different assistant waiters/bussers making it very confusing regarding who to order with or make requests to. Our total dining time was close to 3 hours, which really put a dent in our other planned activities, as it set us back tremendously. For dessert, my gf arranged for them to bring out mine with a surprise candle and happy birthday on it. They ruined that and made it very obvious when they came out to the table, didn't give us our desserts, and did a lap around the restaurant causing our ice creams and sorbets to melt. All because there was no silverware on the table. Whose fault is that?Now for the extra star...my gf contacted the manager after to complain about the lackluster experience, and he credited her back $95, which brought the total amount spent from $300 to $200. The service and food versus the price just doesn't match up. No view or legacy as a nyc famed restaurant equates what is being offered here. This is one of the REALest reviews I have ever wrote.",3.0

We had a seat by the window with my soon-to-be-fiance looking at the brooklyn bridge and because it was a clear night, my view was of the statue of liberty.The service was fantastic, food was excellent, and if you're looking for a place for a special occasion I would recommend this place highly! Note: For Friday/Sat night dinners, I would recommend making a reservation at least 3 months if not more in advance (yes, they do fill up that early)",5.0
"I had long heard of this place but for some reason never felt overly compelled to try it out.  But when my girlfriend scheduled my birthday brunch at River Cafe, I was excited to see what this restaurant was all about.  An abundance of beautiful plants and flowers adorn the entrance way and friendly hosts quickly seated us upon arriving.  We were seated side by side against the back wall and we got the privilege of looking out on the view they are famous for-the view of lower Manhattan and the east river.   My eyes were diverted from the view when a friendly waiter came over and presented us with the menus and offered us drinks.  The full 3 course brunch was seamless and all the food was delicious.  The service was totally on point with out being over being.  I could not put my finger on exactly what, but something about these place felt very grand to me.  It is the feeling that so many restaurants try to achieve but fall very short of achieving.  River Cafe was an amazing experience for brunch and I cannot wait to try it for dinner and see that iconic shot at nighttime, to say nothing of getting to be able to experience this first class establishment.",5.0
"This is a place special to both my Mom and me. We had the opportunity to dine here on several occasions during many summer months before Sandy rolled in and temporarily closed the restaurant. I can clearly say that The River Café is in my top ten memorable dining experiences. Each aspect from the valet service, to the beautiful outdoor garden that leads you into the restaurant, makes you aware that you are in for a wonderful experience. The River Café boasts an atmosphere for fulfilling romantic and special occasions or even a corporate business lunch or dinner.  This restaurant will impress most in my opinion. My Mom and I on many an opportunity admired the beauty of the floral arrangements decorating the entry way and throughout the restaurant, as well as the view of the luminous Brooklyn Bridge stretching over the East River leading into a wide open scenic view of the South Street Seaport...Spectacular!!Throughout our several visits, we both enjoyed and appreciated the attentiveness of the wait staff, sipped on many a glass of champagne then savored in the chefs amuse-bouches as well as a variety of different entrees that included meals of foie gras, filet mignon, lamb chops, lobster and tuna, to name a few. All of which were  served with a variety of very complimentary side dishes. And of course to end each meal there were the creative and artistic array of desserts. The River Café is in no way inexpensive, but is one that should be on anyones must try list. If it weren't for my sophisticated, worldly and overly generous mother I would never have known how to appreciate so many of the finer things in life. She not only taught me, but so many others that had the opportunity to meet her. This review on the 16th March 2014, is in honor of my Mom. A very thoughtful and appreciative thank you to my Mom and thank you River Café for many long lasting memories.",5.0

We told him that we were going to request an Uber car (which was 4 minutes away), to which he replied that there was a taxi outside that was large enough to accommodate our group. After enjoying such a great evening, we were caught off guard and did not notice that he was not directing us to a taxi but, rather, a livery cab. The driver charged us $60 to travel a shorter distance (to Chinatown) than an Uber cab had charged us $23 when we travelled to the restaurant (from TriBeca) three hours earlier. Technically, it was our fault for not negotiating a price ahead of time - but to take advantage of our trust after a great dinner and to charge us more than 2.5 times the true value of the ride was not just bad style, but abusive. Five stars for the overall ambiance, five stars for the service, four stars for the food, but the classless livery cab scam detracted from our experience and reflects very poorly on this otherwise beautiful restaurant.",4.0
"I found out about this restaurant through yelp and a few recommendations from coworkers. I made a reservation a month in advanced and was looking forward to spending my last night in New York here. The view would have been amazing but we were sat in this awkward corner and very close to both tables either side. The service was great and everyone was welcoming. The food I found bland and disappointing. Definitely not worth the price tag, and on top of it all I was sick the next day nauseous and vomiting the whole way home which is not fun on an airplane.",2.0
"Great place, really lovely. Really good food. Really great service. The two kinds of fois gras was one of the best dishes ever. Mushroom Wellington was really good. Duck was good. Red cabbage slaw with duck was great. Branzino was good.  Service was REALLY, REALLY good, extremely attentive and friendly without overdoing it. Got a window table without asking. We got there at 11:45 am on a Saturday. Great view. Beautiful restaurant. Got the apple paté for dessert. It was good, but nowhere as good as the little tastes they ""give"" you. Oh, and the little tiny appetizers at the very beginning, compliments of the chef. DELICIOUS! Chilled melon soup and teeny tiny bacon fig sandwich. WOW!Not cheap, but worth it.",5.0
"I am actually really impressed by this place. My husband took me here for our one year anniversary. He didn't tell me where we were going, so when I walked in I was almost taken aback by how uptight this place is. He didn't read the dress code, so he didn't wear a suit jacket, but they are happy to provide one for you. The waiters and everyone in general are super attentive and do their best to make the experience great. When I heard that it was a fixed menu for dinner (appetizer, dinner and dessert) I was expecting really small portions and thought I would leave hungry, not the case. Everything we ordered was really good and we were super stuffed. The only thing I didn't like (but he did) was the bone marrow potato that came with the strip steak, it was a little dry for my taste.In my opinion, this is a place to come to for special occasions. It is very romantic during dinner and I would return here to celebrate another occasion, I don't think I'd come back on a regular day. For me this place is more about the experience and the view than the food itself. The view is beautiful as well as the restaurant grounds. There is a small garden with benches that is really lovely.Price wise this place is expensive, if you're coming for dinner plan on spending over $300 (for two people). And yes, the people here can come off as snobbish and stuck up, but they are just catering to the majority of the crowd that comes here. If you don't like that kind of atmosphere, this is definitely not the place for you.",5.0
"We came here to celebrate my birthday. First off, the ambiance and view of the city is breathtakingly amazing. You are directly adjacent and under the bk bridge, which provides a vista of the river and bay with spectacular light reflecting off of the water.Now before I begin, take note that my original ranking was going to be 2 stars, but due to ratification by manager, this was amended to 3. We were seated in the middle of the dining room even though we asked for  a table by the window so we could enjoy the view. The host told us that we could not be accommodated because they are reserved for regulars. WWHHHAATTTTTT!? Needless to say, the table we wanted remained vacant for the entire time we were there (close to 3 hrs)Now onto the food. The menu is prix fixe at $115 per person with choices from starters, entrees, and desert. Each item was great and well prepared. They just took forever to come out and we had three different waiters, and four different assistant waiters/bussers making it very confusing regarding who to order with or make requests to. Our total dining time was close to 3 hours, which really put a dent in our other planned activities, as it set us back tremendously. For dessert, my gf arranged for them to bring out mine with a surprise candle and happy birthday on it. They ruined that and made it very obvious when they came out to the table, didn't give us our desserts, and did a lap around the restaurant causing our ice creams and sorbets to melt. All because there was no silverware on the table. Whose fault is that?Now for the extra star...my gf contacted the manager after to complain about the lackluster experience, and he credited her back $95, which brought the total amount spent from $300 to $200. The service and food versus the price just doesn't match up. No view or legacy as a nyc famed restaurant equates what is being offered here. This is one of the REALest reviews I have ever wrote.",3.0
"I came here the night that I got engaged and it really started the evening off on the right foot.  The softly lit garden in front gives a romantic feel right before you enter and evertything else just falls into place. We had a seat by the window with my soon-to-be-fiance looking at the brooklyn bridge and because it was a clear night, my view was of the statue of liberty.The service was fantastic, food was excellent, and if you're looking for a place for a special occasion I would recommend this place highly! Note: For Friday/Sat night dinners, I would recommend making a reservation at least 3 months if not more in advance (yes, they do fill up that early)",5.0
"I had long heard of this place but for some reason never felt overly compelled to try it out.  But when my girlfriend scheduled my birthday brunch at River Cafe, I was excited to see what this restaurant was all about.  An abundance of beautiful plants and flowers adorn the entrance way and friendly hosts quickly seated us upon arriving.  We were seated side by side against the back wall and we got the privilege of looking out on the view they are famous for-the view of lower Manhattan and the east river.   My eyes were diverted from the view when a friendly waiter came over and presented us with the menus and offered us drinks.  The full 3 course brunch was seamless and all the food was delicious.  The service was totally on point with out being over being.  I could not put my finger on exactly what, but something about these place felt very grand to me.  It is the feeling that so many restaurants try to achieve but fall very short of achieving.  River Cafe was an amazing experience for brunch and I cannot wait to try it for dinner and see that iconic shot at nighttime, to say nothing of getting to be able to experience this first class establishment.",5.0
"This is a place special to both my Mom and me. We had the opportunity to dine here on several occasions during many summer months before Sandy rolled in and temporarily closed the restaurant. I can clearly say that The River Café is in my top ten memorable dining experiences. Each aspect from the valet service, to the beautiful outdoor garden that leads you into the restaurant, makes you aware that you are in for a wonderful experience. The River Café boasts an atmosphere for fulfilling romantic and special occasions or even a corporate business lunch or dinner.  This restaurant will impress most in my opinion. My Mom and I on many an opportunity admired the beauty of the floral arrangements decorating the entry way and throughout the restaurant, as well as the view of the luminous Brooklyn Bridge stretching over the East River leading into a wide open scenic view of the South Street Seaport...Spectacular!!Throughout our several visits, we both enjoyed and appreciated the attentiveness of the wait staff, sipped on many a glass of champagne then savored in the chefs amuse-bouches as well as a variety of different entrees that included meals of foie gras, filet mignon, lamb chops, lobster and tuna, to name a few. All of which were  served with a variety of very complimentary side dishes. And of course to end each meal there were the creative and artistic array of desserts. The River Café is in no way inexpensive, but is one that should be on anyones must try list. If it weren't for my sophisticated, worldly and overly generous mother I would never have known how to appreciate so many of the finer things in life. She not only taught me, but so many others that had the opportunity to meet her. This review on the 16th March 2014, is in honor of my Mom. A very thoughtful and appreciative thank you to my Mom and thank you River Café for many long lasting memories.",5.0
I think The River Cafe is the most romantic restaurant in NYC.I had the  rib&lobster and it was probably the best I've ever had.,5.0
"The night started off marvelous with the charming, striking view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan - it was quite amazing. Upon arrival, the receptionist was  very sweet and we were seated promptly, but not at a window seat as I requested being that we celebrating my boyfriend'a birthday and they somehow made a mistake and moved around my reservation to 8pm not 830pm as I made months in advance. The Maître d' was inviting and our waiter walked us through the three course menu option, but failed to tell us about the six course tasting menu which I felt a strand of disappointment as  it was my every intention to experience that option as I read such great reviews and I overheard him telling the table next to us what it consisted of. We actually had to stop a waiter in transit to his table to ask what the breakdown of the six course menu was.We ordered the octopus and the shrimp for appetizers which I must they were both well put together. The pan seared octopus came with sliced potatoes and a fresh chimichurri sauce while being cooked to perfection. The shrimp was so succulent and was sided with crab meat which gave it an extra plus in my book. For the entrées, we ordered the lamb and branzino which were both incredibly tasteful! The lamb had an amazing mint and mustard glaze. The branzino was crusted with shrimp and was absolutely delicious. Oh, and might I add that both plates were served with a beautiful presentation that were definitely picture worthy:). Making way to desert, I ordered the milk chocolate soufflé which was topped with a toasted marshmallow and sided with melting vanilla ice cream. I honestly expected more from this desert as it was just simply just ""good"" in my book and I was expecting it to be ""great"" after reading all the wonderful reviews and my obsession with chocolate soufflés. My boyfriend ordered the apple crisp which consisted of caramelized apples, almonds, and a green apple sorbet. We found his desert to be tart and we weren't very fond it. Although the food was great for the most  part, the service was horrible in my opinion. From not being offered the six course menu to having to ask for bread in the beginning initiated the laundry list of complaints. We waited an awfully long time for our appetizers to come out and even more for our entrees and at that time the wait made us lose out appetite which we felt the dinner could have been a bit more appetizing if it was brought out in a timely fashion. When I made the reservation, I put down that it was a birthday and even doubled checked with the receptionist. The deserts were brought out with a candle on the one my boyfriend ordered and since we didn't have spoons on our table the two waiters walked around the whole restaurant and back into the kitchen until we had spoons; by time it was given to us our ice-creams were half way melting!!!! And, to talk about a surprise - my boyfriend knew automatically it was for him as they walked right in front of him with the exact deserts we ordered and a candle in one - and he hates when I tell a restaurant it's his birthday which I was just trying to surprise him, but that obviously didn't turn out as planned. Three stars because - all in all, the food and view was enjoyable. The staff was not attentive at all and we had no idea who our actual waiter was as we were greeted with about 5 throughout the duration of our dinner. I was highly disappointed with The River Cafe as it took  months in advance to make a reservation and to think I was going to receive superb service especially for the price you pay! Sadly, I will not be returning to this establishment in the future. I really expected a lot from this place and left feeling highly disappointed.",2.0
"Best steak tartare of all time. Also they somehow remove the entire shell of the lobster while allowing the lobster to keep its exact shape, I'm not even sure how that's possible. The view is second to none and the service is also top notch. Would go here for any sort of big celebration or formal dinner.",5.0
"My husband surprised me with this spectacular place for our anniversary. I think he said he booked it a few weeks ahead. It was beautiful and calming. We arrived about 40 minutes early and were seated at a table around the bar area and some wine while we waited for our table. We were then seated at a table where we were able to look at the view. Although we were a little too busy eating their wonderful endless serving of bread and I think the food we ordered was a $150 per person, it was a Chefs special (the chef pretty much picked what we were going to eat I think). We went with it and ate a few things we hadn't tried before. It was delightful and tasty. Our waiter was attentive even though it was a busy night (not sure if it is always so busy). At the end they brought us the cutest Happy anniversary dessert (the chocolate was the shape of the Brooklyn bridge =) ). We loved it and were surprisingly quite full when we left. I couldn't have asked for a better night ,it was perfect!",5.0

Wow. You would never know that Sandy had wiped out the place. Been a few times over the years and they never fail with their excellent service and amazing food. They view is simply spectacular so they break the rule that a great view and great food don't go together. It was an incredibly raining Monday that we visited. And the roads were just jammed. This place is easily accessible via the A though so we beat the traffic that way. It's a short walk to the water and the garden is as lovely as ever. We were lucky enough to book an early dinner and got a table by te windows. If u love storms and clouds there is nothing quite like watching the rain over lower Manhattan. The food was incredible. It is a prix fix menu and the wagyu tartare was so tender and falvorful. The wild blue shrimp were perfectly cooked and fresh with a lovely white asparagus. The duck breast was perfectly cooked with a nice light spice. And the New York strip steak. (Appropriate here :-) was really a delight. Perfectly charred on outside and wonderful flavor. And the Nova Scotia lobster was wonderfully prepared. Flavorful and delicate. Wow!,5.0
"All-time favorite foie gras dish here! Such an incredible atmosphere and excellent service. The floral arrangements and view are bar-none. So many fine dining experiences in New York feel tired or that they are trying to hard, but River Cafe is on point. The sommelier was lovely, and I cannot wait to return for the lobster. Pro tip: come during the holidays!",5.0
"I brought my husband here for his birthday since we were visiting NY, so I thought we'd go all out fancy. I didn't like that there was this dim light on the table that had to be plugged into the wall of our booth, so when they pulled out the table for us to sit on the booth side, I had to step over the wire and try not to trip over it in my heels. Besides that, everything else was great. We had great service, great food, and an amazing dessert of a chocolate Brooklyn Bridge. I got the steak with potatoes in bone marrow, and both were exquisite. My husband had the lobster and he thought it was delicious. The dessert was a little bit too rich for me, but I still loved the novelty that we ate a chocolate Brooklyn Bridge. :)",5.0
"This is kind of a delayed review, as The River Cafe was devastated by Sandy. I came here on August 19th, 2012.I booked a reservation many months in advanced, and was promptly reminded that it is jacket required. I called in to confirm my reservation and again was nicely reminded that a jacket is necessary.I was visiting NY, and in this weekend I was doing fine dining. This place was by far my favourite place and has been my favourite restaurant. Upon arrival, my guest and I were promptly seated with a gorgeous view of Manhattan. During our meal, the sun set behind the tall buildings and it was just absolutely amazing. The vibes here are super romantic. They had a live pianist playing soothing music that really help set the mood right. The lights gradually dimmed through out the night. When leaving the table for any reason (like using the restroom), a staff member will come by and refold the napkin properly. Prior to sitting down, we walked around; so when we sat, I was a bit warm and contemplated taking my jacket off, but decided against it because nobody else did. This was my first time at a jacket required place, so I wasn't sure if jacket required meant I had to bring one, or I had to wear one the whole night. Good thing I kept it on. A Japanese business man removed his jacket when he was seated and a waiter immediately walked over to him and told him he had to keep his jacket on. First out, complementary carrot puree/soup with balsamic vinegar; cured meat, cheese and olive. This was okay, nothing too amazing? If anything the flavour was a bit too strong. Appetizers:1. Wagyu Steak Tartare (hand cut Kobe style beef prepared tableside with quail egg yolk, Cognac gelée, traditional garnish and toast points)2. Rabbit and Dumplings (braised rabbit in natural juices, pan fried rabbit loin,garden pea sauce, homemade Brooklyn ricotta cheese dumplings)These appetizers were pretty darn delicious, but also very filling. We decided not to have the waiter mix the waygu steak tartar because we wanted pictures first. We mixed it ourselves without using the kosher salt. It was perfect without it.Entrees:1. Crisp Duck Breast (white truffle honey and fennel pollen glaze, duck leg and potato croquette, organic carrots, julienne bok choy)2. Branzino Fillet (Mediterranean sea bass, chorizo sausage and shrimp 'stuffing', smoked tiny vine tomatoes, petite zucchini, charred lemon confit)Both of these dishes were cooked perfectly. The duck was very tender, juicy, and flavourful. The bass was just a bit hard to get all the flavours in one easy scoop. There was a bit of work involved stacking everything on the fork, but still darn delicious. Desserts:1. Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge (handmade chocolate with Brooklyn ""black and white"" ice cream soda, Richter's raspberries)2. Hot Soufflé (lime soufflé, candied coconut flakes, coconut anglaise)I'm not a big fan of sweets, and this may have been just a tad too sweet for me, but I had tea to go with it. It was good. The ice cream soda was whatever. My +1 however, absolutely enjoyed both! :) The main reason why I got the Chocolate Marquise was so I could take a picture of it! Oh the things I pay for to take pictures of...This restaurant has 1 Michelin star. Does it add up? Definitely.I would definitely come back if they get up and running again, and highly recommend it.",5.0
One of the best restaurants we have eaten in. Awesome views and food. Had the Bordeaux and Pinot noir by the glass and the wines were wonderful. Had the shrimp for appetizer and lobster for the main entrée. Out of the world! My wife had octopus for the appetizer and sea bass for the entrée. They were fantastic too! Great pistachio and chocolate desserts as well. We had a 4-year-old with us and they accommodated her very well. They have an outdoor deck which is great for memorable pictures.,5.0

This is not being cheap because I'm not but don't make your clients feel inferior especially since most make a lot more $$$ than you think!!! Pathetic, disrespectful and not ""USA like"".",2.0

"I had a few questions going in.. So I'll attempt to tackle them in this review. Was pretty happy to land a reservation on a Saturday night the week before valentines day at a reasonable hour. Girls on the phone were great. Definitely don't be intimidated by the river cafe. It's a great experience in that they want you as much as you want them. Food/ service / maître d / valet parking, all phenomenal. Reasonably priced bottles of wine, check. View, obviously spectacular- Great views from any table in the restaurant but if you can snag a window table you are definitely winning.. My one small complaint - the dinner rolls were not very good. Just didn't seem fresh to me. Minor detail but you figure with a place like this that would more or less be a lay up for them? Anyhow, we all know nobody is there for the dinner rolls..Prix fixe @ 120$pp(1 app, each, 1 entree each, 1 dessert each)2 drinks at the bar , kettle sodas @ 20$ each. 60$ bottle of ... Not sure Tip and tax.. A little over 4 bills.And there you have it.",4.0
"We made our reservation way early for my birthday so that we can get nice seats with view. But unfortunately, when we arrived, our seats were all the way in the back. We were disappointed but understood everyone comes in for a view and can't accommodate all requests. As we go through our dinner, the guests who sit by the windows finished their dinner and left.  Then we saw, a couple who were sitting right next to us were awarded the seats. We asked our waiter and host if we can do the same. The host told us people are waiting outside and can't do that. I begged to let us sit for 5 min to take photo. He reluctantly said OK. When another seats become available, he allow other couple to move to the seats again. We had enough and left.",1.0
"As an old-school Brooklynite, the River Cafe has always held a romantic place in my heart. I recently dined there for the first time, after it reopened from Sandy damage. It was almost precisely as I expected. All of the table were oriented towards the views, the food was high-end, although not very daring, and it was a great location and setting for a romantic evening. The price is not as good a value as other high-end restaurants I have been to, but they also do not have this location.",4.0
"I came here for a wedding dinner. The food was wonderful; service amazing; and views spectacular. Everything about it was unforgettable, from the tuxedoed waitstaff to the lamb and above all, the atmosphere. It was a truly wonderful and wonderfully unique experience that's hard to find anywhere else.",5.0
"Beautiful restaurant with fresh flowers and an impressive view. Excellent service. Food is amazing 10/10. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of their dress code. Men must wear a suit jacket to dinner. As my husband and I are travelling he didn't have a suit jacket so receptionist kindly allow people to borrow a jacket in this situation. The restaurant was very warm inside and quite stuffy, my husband took off his jacket and was asked to put it back on immediately. My husband was bright red in the face, hot and uncomfortable. It is ridiculous that you should pay that sort of money to eat here and sit in a sweat suit against your will! Anyway, other than the suit jacket.. Amazing place",4.0
"This place is a MUST for a trip to New York. My husband and I journeyed to NYC from England last summer to celebrate my 30th birthday, and this is the restaurant I chose to spend our last magical night in New York before returning home with a heavy heart- I'm so glad we spent it here.This place is magical- from the impressive floral display when you first enter, to the old-romance ambience that hits you when you first walk into the restaurant- dimmed lighting and live piano playing really setting the mood- to the unmissable panoramic view over Manhattan that each and every table can benefit from- this place is amazing.Yes it's expensive- its a fixed price menu so don't go in thinking I'll have one cheap course just to try the place- this ain't that kinda place! You go all out or you go home!But its worth it; attentive waiters, exceptional food and wine, a view literally to die for. This place was made for special dinners, and for the last night in NYC it fit the bill perfectly.Top tip: after your meal you simply MUST mosey on outside to the riverside and take in the view of Manhattan proper. Breathtaking.I very much wish one day to return here and have already recommended it to friends visiting NYC, who I'm thrilled to say went on to sample River Cafe's delights.You won't regret it.",5.0
"I came here with the gf for her birthday. It's been 4 years. The price shouldn't be that bad to swallow knowing it's been 4 years. Man up and take her somewhere nice!I came on a rainy day, with a sprained ankle. I saw the bus boys outside by the door with huge umbrellas, and coincidentally, I forgot to bring mine (traveled by car service). But it's okay, I'll LIMP walking in the rain, while you stand there looking at me, deciding whether I would appreciate you coming over or not. I love wearing wet clothes.Reception was lovely. Very sweet, good looking, and opened doors for you. I called for a reservation 3 weeks in advance (so glad I did), and was told formal dressing required. (if you come here without a suit jacket, a rental will be given to you, and you will be seated in the back). I was given the hint that the better you dressed, the higher chance you'd get seated by the window. They cannot accomodate over the phone. Which is true, to an extent* Good view of the Brooklyn Bridge. Live piano music. Expensive, intimate looking decor. Definitely a place to come back to on a special occasion. Now to review the food. As of date, the pre-fix is $115, with the chef's tasting at $145. We both went for the prefix:1) Battle of Appetizers: Shellfish platter vs wagyu steak tartare: Wagyu steak wins! The tartare was very beautiful & flavorful.2) Battle of Main Course: 16 oz steak (medium) vs rack of lamb (medium rare): Steak wins! The rack of lamb could've used slightly bit more seasoning. The mint jelly that accompanied the lamb was strange.3) Battle of Dessert: Chocolate Bridge Cake** vs Sorbet plate: Sorbet wins! The cake was kinda dry.Overall, I recommend the place, on VERY special occasions. If you want a seat BY the window, maybe after you earn at LEAST $100k a year, have the appearance of a rich person, and speak French. *There were THREE open tables exactly by the window, with the restaurant half full when I entered. I was led, however, to be ""near"" the window, with a much older couple blocking the view. When night came, and the restaurant was full, I noticed that all those near the window were older (30+years), appear to be regulars, or insanely rich. I understand the business practice, but you basically assumed I can't tip well, or don't belong here. I dressed very sharp, and my date had a nice dress. Whatever; I tipped you well regardless, since the service was very professional (although on borderline friendly - stern).**The restaurant probably knows there's a lot of birthdays and proposals going on. If you mention it to your waiter, they can prepare a candle for your dessert.",3.0
"Went here last night to celebrate my husband's birthday. I don't understand the poor reviews on this site. Our meal was wonderful, the staff was very friendly and based on what I saw, every table in the room had some view of the river. Did we have a table on the window? No, but our table was situated in such a way that we still had amazing views of the bridge and river / harbor. The bar staff make excellent cocktails and the waiter was kind and unobtrusive. The food was really good, especially the appetizer which was a special of buffalo mozz ravioli in a porcini sauce with shaved white truffles. This is definitely a special occasion restaurant, but I'll be back to celebrate another special occasion.",5.0
"I have to say I don't understand how this place could get a bad review. My boyfriend and I went there for our anniversary right after they reopened. The place was booked so we left our name on a waiting list. They called us to let us know they had an opening and we snatched it right up. We arrived and were seated in the back which seams to be a complaint for a lot of people. We live in Dumbo so we have seen the view a lot, and I wasn't bothered by being in the back at all. I actually found our table much cozier since it had a couch like seat. It was romantic as well because we were seated next to each other.The waiter came over and was extremely friendly. We asked for suggestions on the menu and he provided very good recommendations. I had the vegetarian mushroom wellington and it was amazing. I love beef wellington and was curious to see how it would turn out without the beef and it was phenomenal. Also, the chocolate souffle is to die for. When leaving the gentlemen at the door asked if he could buy us a round of drinks which was very high class. We were in a rush and declined. P.S. did I mention the live piano music. So romantic.When we visited the second time (several months later) for my birthday we were welcomed back before we could even tell them we had been there before. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, however my boyfriend wanted to sit by the window. He asked and we were told it had been reserved by a regular. We took no offense and asked to be moved to our table from last time which was in the back (but again cozier). They accommodated us quickly. Again, we had amazing service. The same gentleman who offered us a round of drinks at the bar gave us his card and told him we could email him if we ever wanted a window table. I guess on your third time you get bumped to the front lol. The service was excellent both times, and it is now my favorite restaurant in NY.Thank you River Cafe for two perfect evenings. We can't wait to go back.",5.0
"First impression was good with the wonderful view of Manhattan and the Brooklyn bridge from where we sat. It went downhill from there. The tables were right next to each other so getting out for the restroom was a hazardous ""step over the lamp wire"" adventure. Luckily my wife wasn't wearing a tight dress. Next, it took the server a good 20mins after giving us the wine menu before coming to ask what drinks we had wanted. With our wine menu and the food menu still in hand, an appetizer was placed on the plates in front of us, so we had to hold the menu while going through the food we wanted?!! For a good 20minutes.Thankfully the food was decent, as both my foie gras and steak and my wife's shrimp and duck breast were appetizing. Nevertheless, we were expecting something beyond what we would find at a normal restaurant since this was a 1 Michelin star establishment, and that was a little disappointing.Overall, service was tardy, other servers were rude when we did interact with them, and that really spoilt the otherwise nice ambience and decent food, despite paying the price for fine dining.",3.0
"I had a few questions going in.. So I'll attempt to tackle them in this review. Was pretty happy to land a reservation on a Saturday night the week before valentines day at a reasonable hour. Girls on the phone were great. Definitely don't be intimidated by the river cafe. It's a great experience in that they want you as much as you want them. Food/ service / maître d / valet parking, all phenomenal. Reasonably priced bottles of wine, check. View, obviously spectacular- Great views from any table in the restaurant but if you can snag a window table you are definitely winning.. My one small complaint - the dinner rolls were not very good. Just didn't seem fresh to me. Minor detail but you figure with a place like this that would more or less be a lay up for them? Anyhow, we all know nobody is there for the dinner rolls..Prix fixe @ 120$pp(1 app, each, 1 entree each, 1 dessert each)2 drinks at the bar , kettle sodas @ 20$ each. 60$ bottle of ... Not sure Tip and tax.. A little over 4 bills.And there you have it.",4.0

"Best meal of my life!Stumbled across this place during a freezing walk in the month of February. Boy am I glad we did!! It was pretty late at night when we came here and not many people were in the restaurant. As soon I walked in I knew this place was special. THE VIEW!!! We sat down at the beautiful table next to the window and looked across the river where you can see the beautiful Manhattan skyline. My friend looked at the price and said...""guys it's $120 fixed menu to eat here, we can go somewhere else if you want"" ""I am not going any where!"" The view was worth the money, not to mention the sensational food and wine! It was a 3 course meal and you had several options to go with. We ordered a delicious bottle of cabernet for the table. I ordered the grilled octopus for the appetizer and it was amazing! I had the lamb for dinner and it blew my mind!!!!! It had thinly sliced potatoes under it that were divine!! I still dream of that lamb. I am not a huge dessert person but ordered the apple tart and had it with a glass of port. YUM Everyone was happy with their plate. I wish I tried food off my friends plates because they looked amazing but I was too entranced with my lamb! They ordered the lobster and the rib eye, both were said to be amazing.Exceptional service and a meal I will never forget during a trip I will never forget!

I went for the first time 4 months ago on my birthday. Everything was excellent! At night the place looks absolutely beautiful with all of the lights in the garden.

And the dessert with the chocolate Brooklyn Bridge was very impressive. Best dining experience in my life ever!!!!!!!!,5.0

"While browsing the list of restaurants participating in Dine in Brooklyn, I saw that the The River Café was offering a 3-course lunch menu for $20.12, which is an incredible deal. Being me I had to view the website to make sure that the special menu was decent and not some crappy menu that they put together. To my surprise the menu was not only decent it was beyond my expectations. I went ahead and made a reservation for lunch.  The day finally came and I was all excited to have lunch at The River Café. Entering the restaurant, there's the scent of fresh flowers, there's the staff all dressed in white suits, and there's the view of Manhattan during daylight that creates such a wonderful atmosphere. In case you're wondering about the dress code, people around us including ourselves were dressed business casual. For lunch at least the dress code is not as strict. Now on to the food:Appetizer 1. Lobster miso consommé & dumplings (s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com…), with mushroom and lobster dumplings, dashi cured shitake mushroom, fresh soybeans, and dusted miso powder. I like the Asian twist to this dish, it's cute and it works.2. Wild fluke ""tiradito"" (s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com…), with citrus-soy ponzu sauce, fresh hearts of palm, pickled chilies, and crispy plantain. I love the presentation this dish and how it was executed. The fluke was wonderful.Entrée 3. Tender beef short ribs (s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com…), slow cooked in Barolo red wine, creamy polenta, braised red cabbage, and roasted carrot baton. This dish was so tender with the right amount of flavor. 4. Grilled cobia fillet (s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com…), with grilled zucchini, broccoli rabe, red pepper, and aged Villa Mandori balsamic vinegar. The fish and vegetables were perfectly grilled and lightly flavored. Dessert5. Tasting Dessert Trio (s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com…), dark chocolate marquise cake, tahitian vanilla bean brulée, and coconut & pineapple sorbet. What a lovely presentation of all 3 desserts. I loved every one of them.",5.0

"Beautiful views, incredibly classy atmosphere, but mediocre food for a restaurant of this quality.If you ever want to feel like you're sitting in a movie full of the upper crust of New York social life, go here. The view of the water is incredible. The people are beautiful and dressed impeccably. The service is flawless and the plating is dazzling. But if you want your mind to be blown by the food you're eating, if you're looking for a place that will make you rethink what it means to be eating good food, this isn't really the place for you.Don't get me wrong, the food was very tasty. But some of the sauces were pretty simple, and not in the ""elegant in its simplicity"" sort of way (the abalone we had, for example, was in a sauce that I'm pretty sure was just vinegar and soy sauce). Similarly, the steak we ate was chewy. Some pieces had large amounts of gristle on them. The shrimp we ate was overly salted, and the foie gras, while very, very tasty, was in a portion that was a bit too big.All this would be fine in a restaurant of lower quality, but when you're paying $400 for a meal for two, I think it's reasonable to expect every dish to wow you. Personally, I don't think I'll go back to The River Cafe anytime soon. For my money, I'll take myself back to Nobu, where every plate was spectacular.",3.0

"As a native NY'er this establishment was always one of my favorites, until NOW- The arrogance, the nasty Hostesses and Door man were horrendous-Is ok to turn people away with no jacket, but 6 of us were well dressed, extremely good looking- lol and coming from a wedding on a Sat night and were turned away- Not only did they keep us waiting over a half hour, but then decided they didnt have room for us- (one of our party left, as he didnt have a jacket, nor would they loan is one- thats ok- he couldn't stay anyway)The Bride and Groom were on their way when they told us they couldn't seat us at an empty bar- She was so looking forward to a cocktail here- We were told by the young, unpolished hostess that it was a MIS- Communication-THink about where you want your money to go before booking your reservation-They should be ashamed of themselves- -Native New Yorker-",1.0

"The River Cafe is a comfortable yet sophisticated dining experience that has to be on anyone's ""must try"" list for New York City. It is located right next to the Brooklyn Bridge on the Brooklyn side, with a serene view of the East River and the gorgeous Downtown/Midtown Manhattan skyline.The entrance to the restaurant hides behind a cozy courtyard with lights strewn about tree branches and small decorative garden pieces. Upon checking in your coats, you'll be escorted through a small walkway that sits above water and into the main dining area that is designed so that most patrons will have an unobstructed view of the river. Coupled with the soothing sounds of a live pianist, and you're on your way to the dining equivalent of a sensual full body massage.The chef sent out a nice amuse-bouche of butternut squash cream and pumpkin seeds next to a delicious jerky laid on top of mixed fruits. For the appetizers, the girlfriend got a delectable steak tartare (probably the best steak tartare I've tasted in NYC) and I went with the foie gras ""two ways"" option. I may be biased since I hadn't had foie gras since a trip to Paris last year, but man do I miss that taste. I thought the foie gras at the River Cafe was served wonderfully. As good as the opening of the meal is, the entrees blew our minds away. The girlfriend got the duck breast cooked to a perfect medium rare and served on a bed of pickled red cabbage and fried sweet potato bits. There are many restaurants in New York that pair some things with the proteins that will have you scratching your head, but this won't be one of them. The items on a plate complement the meats to perfection. One bite into that duck with a bit of red cabbage and sweet potato on your fork, and you'll know what I'm talking about.I loved my strip steak, which was also cooked to a perfect medium rare and retained the right amount of charred fat. It is coated with a bed of red wine mushroom marmalade, and once again it complements the flavors of the brilliantly-seasoned steak to perfection.Desserts are never my favorite part of a meal, but these desserts were underwhelming ONLY relative to the appetizers and entrees. They taste just fine, but were forgettable only because what came before it completely blew me out of the water.As a final note, do stop by the bar beforehand if you are early for your reservation. Ask for a glass of scotch neat and you'll get what would normally be considered a double at most places. It's funny how the smallest things in life can sometimes make or break your day.",5.0

"This was like a dream finally being taken on a date here since I discovered it when I first moved to the city years ago after walking over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Beautifully decorated and lit up garden outside and gorgeous view of Manhattan.The atmosphere of this place is 5 stars.  Inside it feels rather old fashioned, maybe a bit dated but we loved it.The appetizers:  Tuna was delicious - served with some sort of bacon..Like nothing we have ever had before.I had a sampler with shrimp, scallops and seafood dumplings.  The dumplings weren't too good, the shrimp was okay but the scallops were melt in your mouth delicious.  Too bad there was so little of them.Bf loved his rack of lamb entree, although it was a bit small.I was torn between the Scottish Salmon and the Branzino, and wish I had chosen the salmon dish.  The Branzino was good - but I didn't flip over it.  The fish was covered with some sort of breaded coating that seemed like blah tasting melba toast covering it  -- wasn't for me.  The chorizo sausage and seafood stuffing was good-- not an overpowering smoky sort of flavor, just a little.I would give this dish no more than 3 stars.The Brooklyn Bridge chocolate dessert was quite a sight.  Very cool.  Wayy too much chocolate but it tasted good.  The complimentary cookies were all very good except for the miniature macaroon which tasted like pure sugar.My creme brulee came with a delicious hot peach sauce and peach ice cream.  It was good but I didn't flip over the flavor combinations.The desserts were huge so we filled up on this.  If only their food were as big portions.It was such a nice, romantic evening and I think the experience itself was worth the extremely high price since we were celebrating a special occasion.  Food-wise, the meals could and should be a lot better - more 5 star- to suit the high prices.",4.0

"The food takes a close second to the view and romance of this restaurant.  Feels like one's transported to the Titantic dining room.  Lots of kissing between bites of sumptuous food.  We enjoyed the fois gros (sp?) 2 ways as appetizer, the grilled black seabass was delicate and delicious and finished with a creme brulee.  Witnessed two marriage proposals.  Pricey was the only negative.",4.0
"Highlights:Gorgeous view (but you probably already know that)Impeccable serviceThe food here was good, but nothing extraordinary. Ordered the tuna - foie, black snapper (they ran out of the sea bass), and apple ""crisp"" for dessert. The tuna was the highlight of the meal. The snapper was nothing extraordinary, and the apple ""crisp"" was alright.Overall, come here for special occasions for the view and ambiance. Service here is exceptional and they truly make you feel special.  NOTE: If forget to wear a formal jacket, they provide one for you",4.0

Though they are most famous for their chocolate bridge dessert (get this if you're a chocolate lover), I've also tried their s'more souffle which was delightful.

"Oh, The River Café.*stares longingly into space and makes a romantic sigh*Such a beautiful restaurant that rests in the shadow of my beautiful bridge in Dumbo. I was once taken to The River Café for a birthday dinner and had such a lovely evening. True, it's no friend to the wallet, but the food was delectable and totally worth the triple digit price tag at the end of the night. I highly suggest ordering anything with foie gras, beef tartar or duck. Everything is impeccably arranged on its plate with a strong sense of creativity and precision. Let's face it, you can't beat the ambiance and service of The River Café or its scenery of the Brooklyn Bridge and Lower Manhattan. It's practically an aphrodisiac for the ladies. Plan your visit at least a few weeks in advance if you hope to get a prime night dinner hour booked on a weekend. For Valentine's Day, you'll need to rob a bank and partake in a Satanic ritual involving a sacrificial goat to secure your reservation.

"This is an unfortunate review. I really wish that I could give The River Café a higher rating, but what transpired during my visit at this restaurant utterly ruined my entire evening.My dining companion and I decided to make reservations at The River Café to indulge in an elegant meal, while at the same time surround ourselves by the magical views of the NYC cityscape that the restaurant boasts. The views are, indeed, breathtaking. I would imagine that there are only a handful of other establishments that may come close to offering the scenic vistas of the NYC skyline that are comparable to what you will encounter at The River Café. Absolutely, our choice to spend our last evening at this restaurant--before flying back to San Diego the following day--was seemingly a perfect idea.I was dressed in a suit, and my dining companion was dressed in a tasteful and sophisticated shirt, tie and slacks. Upon arrival, we were greated by two hostesses. To our dismay, one of the hostesses, a female brunette, rudely advised my companion that ""jackets are required and you will need to borrow one from us before being seated."" We were unaware that there was a stringent jacket requirement. Notwithstanding, had the hostess been gracious and polite about it, there would have been no offense taken. Unfortunately, her pretentious, austere behavior and terse tone had the effect of not only making us feel unwanted, but it completely chilled our excitement for wanting to dine at The River Café.  In fact, after we were seated, we were both miserable and felt uncomfortable even being there. Both of us are accomplished professionals. Fine dining is certainly not foreign to me. I've dined at some of the most elegant and highly regarded restaurants in San Diego. In all of my dining experience, I've never encountered such an offensive, ostentatious display as what we received at The River Café. It was truly shameful. After paying our bill ($100+ per person) and discussing what had transpired shortly after departing, I decided to call the restaurant and ask to speak to the manager. The individual that answered the phone advised me that the manager was unavailable but would call me back. I left her my name and phone number. To date, I haven't received the courtesy of a telephone call. Such woeful lack of follow up only further demonstrates that the poor customer service orientation that we experienced at the staff level is systemic and indicative of the persona of the management. I still remain mystified. +1 star for the delicious food & spectacular views.",1.0
"In the middle of a rainy, windy, chilly day in late April, my husband and I, visiting from California, were looking for a place to rest out of the wind and made a beeline for a bench in the lovely garden outside of the River Cafe. A woman who was organizing plants for the cafe took pity on us and invited us inside, even though at that point the restaurant had not yet reopened for lunch service. She seated us at a table in the greenhouse with a stunning view of the Lower Manhattan skyline and the Brooklyn Bridge, served us coffee and cookies, and then went about her work as we thawed out. What a beautiful restaurant, and the cookies and coffee were delicious! Thank you, Maureen--we'll never forget your kindness.",5.0
"I went to The River Cafe in December with my boyfriend and his family while visiting, so it has been a while. I can't remember the details about the food but I do remember enjoying everything. (We all opted for the tasting menu.)What I DO remember is how I felt about the entire experience. Everyone has mentioned the view but it really made the dining experience perfect.Obviously at a restaurant with Michelin stars the food and service is expected to be pretty damn phenomenal (or it should be with the amount of money it costs). The entire experience was lovely.",5.0
"Recently my wife and I had dinner here. The food was exceptional, the service even better. The only reason I cannot give this restaurant 5 stars is that the bread that was served in the beginning of the meal was cold and hard. The same could be said of the rock solid butter that came with it. For such a wonderful restaurant to not perceive the flaw in this simple and yet easily fixable issue does not make sense... Otherwise, I recommend this restaurant.",4.0
"My favorite aspect of River Cafe was the scenery. If you can, try to plan your reservation to coincide with the sunset. It was lovely to see the NY lights become brighter and brighter throughout our dinner. My boyfriend and I took public transportation, and it was a nice walk from the subway station to the restaurant (about 10 minutes). Approaching the restaurant, we really got to see the cobblestone roads and the history of the little area that River Cafe is nestled in. River Cafe itself is a lovely little restaurant. It's interesting to see the ginormous Brooklyn Bridge behind this quaint cottage of a restaurant. There's pottery all over the place. What are they used for? I should've asked. Lights strung in the branches of trees all over make it very romantic. As soon as you walked through the doors, there was a huge arrangement of flowers. The smell is so nice. My boyfriend said, ""I imagine this is what President Snow smells like."" Lol. It is quite floral. The restaurant is small but cozy. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get a booth seating that allowed us to sit side by side, looking out the window at the NY night scenery. Service was absolutely wonderful. They explained all the dishes and made great recommendations. They were polite and friendly, and not at all pretentious. I always worry about how employees at expensive restaurants will treat my boyfriend and me because we look so damn young, but River Cafe was wonderfully and respectfully polite. Food was good, but not impressively great. We ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu, which I think is a better deal than the pre fix menu. The pre fix menu is 3 courses for $100 and the Tasting Menu is 6 tasting courses for $125. The pre fix dish sizes were too big for me. I would've gotten sick of the dish halfway through. The tasting menu has perfectly sized dishes. Just the right amount, and you get to taste even more dishes. (1) Soft Shelled Crab Special Appetizer. Delicious! Lightly fried, stuffed with peeky toe crab. Our favorite dish. (2) Foie Gras. 2nd favorite. It was perfectly seared, atop french toast stuffed with cooked apples. Perfect flavor combinations. (3) Wild Rock Lobster. Possibly the best lobster I've ever had. Texture was awesome.(4) Colorado Rack of Lamb was cooked perfectly(5) Branzino Fillet (sea bass) was good. My least favorite though. (6) Caramelized Apple Almond Tart was okay. I wouldn't recommend this as a choice. My boyfriend got the goat cheese cheesecake, which was better. They did a good job of incorporating the goat cheese flavor into the cheesecake. All of the food was great, but nothing blew me away. I definitely recommend this restaurant though. Awesome scenery with good food and great service. Wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary, and they customized our desserts with a chocolate placard that said ""Happy Anniversary"" and our server even wished us personally a Happy Anniversary. If you can, definitely try River Cafe.",4.0

"Two stars because the prices dictate a higher standard.We were well met and brought into the restaurant.  It's sort of a double entry which is interesting and embracing.  The host was a little put-offish finding our reservation. Felt like we were gypsies trying to take over the palace for a moment.Stunning view of Manhattan.Waited for the rest of our party.  Bar was friendly, efficient.  Drinks and billing followed us to our table in seamless fashion.Ordered bubbly.  Som brought it out then suggested we wait until we finished cocktails before serving.  Put on ice.  About 10 minutes later the waiter served.  It was warm dagnabbit!.  Waiter offered no recompense until I had to take him aside and inform him he was buying a round while the sparkling wine chilled.  Reluctant compliance.  This really screwed up the flow of the experience and it took a while to recover.Foie gras was only ok.  Three shells was good.  Octopus and shrimp were good.  Turned out the appetizers were better than the entres.Duck breast was a little tough, dry and the skin lacked crunch.  Monk fish, sea bass and branzini also a little dry.  In general the entres lacked pizzazz.Good cheese selection and plentiful.  Brooklyn bridge was fun.The evening ended on two down notes.  1) They picked up the check and reviewed it before we left.  This is pet peeve of mine.  Always makes me feel like I'm being judged.  2) They use a car service instead of local cabs.  Simple extortion.  Way overpriced.The screw up with the bubbly set a bad tone admittedly.  But they fell on their face with a lack of recovery.  And the two flaws at the end indicate the level of service is uneven and inconsistent.",2.0

In all of my dining experience, I've never encountered such an offensive, ostentatious display as what we received at The River Café. It was truly shameful. After paying our bill ($100+ per person) and discussing what had transpired shortly after departing, I decided to call the restaurant and ask to speak to the manager. The individual that answered the phone advised me that the manager was unavailable but would call me back. I left her my name and phone number. To date, I haven't received the courtesy of a telephone call. Such woeful lack of follow up only further demonstrates that the poor customer service orientation that we experienced at the staff level is systemic and indicative of the persona of the management. I still remain mystified. +1 star for the delicious food & spectacular views.",1.0
"In the middle of a rainy, windy, chilly day in late April, my husband and I, visiting from California, were looking for a place to rest out of the wind and made a beeline for a bench in the lovely garden outside of the River Cafe. A woman who was organizing plants for the cafe took pity on us and invited us inside, even though at that point the restaurant had not yet reopened for lunch service. She seated us at a table in the greenhouse with a stunning view of the Lower Manhattan skyline and the Brooklyn Bridge, served us coffee and cookies, and then went about her work as we thawed out. What a beautiful restaurant, and the cookies and coffee were delicious! Thank you, Maureen--we'll never forget your kindness.",5.0
"I went to The River Cafe in December with my boyfriend and his family while visiting, so it has been a while. I can't remember the details about the food but I do remember enjoying everything. (We all opted for the tasting menu.)What I DO remember is how I felt about the entire experience. Everyone has mentioned the view but it really made the dining experience perfect.Obviously at a restaurant with Michelin stars the food and service is expected to be pretty damn phenomenal (or it should be with the amount of money it costs). The entire experience was lovely.",5.0
"Recently my wife and I had dinner here. The food was exceptional, the service even better. The only reason I cannot give this restaurant 5 stars is that the bread that was served in the beginning of the meal was cold and hard. The same could be said of the rock solid butter that came with it. For such a wonderful restaurant to not perceive the flaw in this simple and yet easily fixable issue does not make sense... Otherwise, I recommend this restaurant.",4.0
"My favorite aspect of River Cafe was the scenery. If you can, try to plan your reservation to coincide with the sunset. It was lovely to see the NY lights become brighter and brighter throughout our dinner. My boyfriend and I took public transportation, and it was a nice walk from the subway station to the restaurant (about 10 minutes). Approaching the restaurant, we really got to see the cobblestone roads and the history of the little area that River Cafe is nestled in. River Cafe itself is a lovely little restaurant. It's interesting to see the ginormous Brooklyn Bridge behind this quaint cottage of a restaurant. There's pottery all over the place. What are they used for? I should've asked. Lights strung in the branches of trees all over make it very romantic. As soon as you walked through the doors, there was a huge arrangement of flowers. The smell is so nice. My boyfriend said, ""I imagine this is what President Snow smells like."" Lol. It is quite floral. The restaurant is small but cozy. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get a booth seating that allowed us to sit side by side, looking out the window at the NY night scenery. Service was absolutely wonderful. They explained all the dishes and made great recommendations. They were polite and friendly, and not at all pretentious. I always worry about how employees at expensive restaurants will treat my boyfriend and me because we look so damn young, but River Cafe was wonderfully and respectfully polite. Food was good, but not impressively great. We ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu, which I think is a better deal than the pre fix menu. The pre fix menu is 3 courses for $100 and the Tasting Menu is 6 tasting courses for $125. The pre fix dish sizes were too big for me. I would've gotten sick of the dish halfway through. The tasting menu has perfectly sized dishes. Just the right amount, and you get to taste even more dishes. (1) Soft Shelled Crab Special Appetizer. Delicious! Lightly fried, stuffed with peeky toe crab. Our favorite dish. (2) Foie Gras. 2nd favorite. It was perfectly seared, atop french toast stuffed with cooked apples. Perfect flavor combinations. (3) Wild Rock Lobster. Possibly the best lobster I've ever had. Texture was awesome.(4) Colorado Rack of Lamb was cooked perfectly(5) Branzino Fillet (sea bass) was good. My least favorite though. (6) Caramelized Apple Almond Tart was okay. I wouldn't recommend this as a choice. My boyfriend got the goat cheese cheesecake, which was better. They did a good job of incorporating the goat cheese flavor into the cheesecake. All of the food was great, but nothing blew me away. I definitely recommend this restaurant though. Awesome scenery with good food and great service. Wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary, and they customized our desserts with a chocolate placard that said ""Happy Anniversary"" and our server even wished us personally a Happy Anniversary. If you can, definitely try River Cafe.",4.0
This restaurant does not welcome kids and is really overpriced. Do not go there if you are willing to have a good time. If you enjoy a good view there are better places to go in Brooklyn or Manhattan...,1.0
"Two stars because the prices dictate a higher standard.We were well met and brought into the restaurant.  It's sort of a double entry which is interesting and embracing.  The host was a little put-offish finding our reservation. Felt like we were gypsies trying to take over the palace for a moment.Stunning view of Manhattan.Waited for the rest of our party.  Bar was friendly, efficient.  Drinks and billing followed us to our table in seamless fashion.Ordered bubbly.  Som brought it out then suggested we wait until we finished cocktails before serving.  Put on ice.  About 10 minutes later the waiter served.  It was warm dagnabbit!.  Waiter offered no recompense until I had to take him aside and inform him he was buying a round while the sparkling wine chilled.  Reluctant compliance.  This really screwed up the flow of the experience and it took a while to recover.Foie gras was only ok.  Three shells was good.  Octopus and shrimp were good.  Turned out the appetizers were better than the entres.Duck breast was a little tough, dry and the skin lacked crunch.  Monk fish, sea bass and branzini also a little dry.  In general the entres lacked pizzazz.Good cheese selection and plentiful.  Brooklyn bridge was fun.The evening ended on two down notes.  1) They picked up the check and reviewed it before we left.  This is pet peeve of mine.  Always makes me feel like I'm being judged.  2) They use a car service instead of local cabs.  Simple extortion.  Way overpriced.The screw up with the bubbly set a bad tone admittedly.  But they fell on their face with a lack of recovery.  And the two flaws at the end indicate the level of service is uneven and inconsistent.",2.0

"I came here for the restaurant week lunch prix-fixe and I'd recommend coming here only for the RW. For $24.09, my experience was pretty decent, can't complain. The view of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan is priceless, I give extra star for the location. It's definitely benefiting a lot from the great view, because otherwise I'd rate this place as 3 stars. I know Jim U. would probably disagree with me again but I actually liked the lobster bisque. Despite the fact that it contains very few scallops, I enjoyed the flavor of the bisque itself - rich, creamy, and decadently flavorful. For me it was the best appetizer I tried that day, it was better than smoked salmon and lamb meatballs. What was most disappointing was the main dish. Yeah I know it's just a discounted RW prix-fixe lunch, but if this is the normal standard then I don't think this place deserves Michelin 1 star. I'd much rather give the coveted Michelin star to Chef Willy of Degustation(IMHO he deserves 3 Michelin stars!! Marry me now!!), even though I'm unselfishly happy that it still remains relatively under the radar of the mainstream public. Although the crispy duck was definitely better than the swordfish which was too dry and tasted more like a grilled chicken, neither one of them lived up to my expectations. Then came the desserts! Wow, all three of them for me?? Cool!! The dessert trio presentation was a really nice pleasant surprise because I wasn't expecting such generosity. However, I completely agree with Jim U. on this one, the dessert quality was decent, but nothing spectacular. The coconut sorbet had a nice elegant taste, it was light and the coconut flavor was subtle enough for non-coconut lovers too. The chocolate ganache was OK but somehow it reminded me of Kozy Shack chocolate pudding, sorry! And lastly but not least, the banana creme brulee was so rich and dense that I couldn't help myself comparing it to mofongo! Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but the texture kept reminding me of mofongo(Don't worry, it still tastes like a proper dessert).Ambiance:AService:A-Food:B/B+",3.0

"Romantic, beautiful, it's like heaven... except this restaurant has a very dark reality lurking beneath its pristine facade.

"I had come here in Summer 2012, before the place was temporarily shut down by Sandy. My brother and I treated our mother to this place for her birthday, and it couldn't have been a better choice.

Its location is under the Brooklyn Bridge, and it offers a breathtaking  view Manhattan skyline, especially at night time.

For an additional small fee, they pair it with a small glass of Chateau Petit Vedrines Sauternes (white wine).For my entree I had Branzino Fillet Mediterranean sea bass with chorizo sausage and shrimp stuffing, smoked tiny vine tomatoes, petite zucchini, and charred lemon confit. This was very scrumptious. Considering that this is a very upscale place, just like any other upscale restaurant the portions are considerably smaller than you may be expecting.For dessert we just ordered a cheese plate with glass of wine.Do not be mistaken, this place is very expensive, but I personally thought that it was worth every dollar, considering that beautiful view this place offers and the quality of their food.

"The River Café is another coveted and highly sought after reservation in NYC. My gf and I tried to come here for lunch during Restaurant Week, Summer 2011, but were unable to get a table for two. However, tables for three were available, so we invited a friend along. So, be sure to book early.Due to the location of this restaurant, I'd suggest driving or taking a taxi. The A or C train does stop at High Street, but it's still a bit of a walk to the restaurant. In our case, it was especially good that we drove, as we had dressed nicely for this lunch and it was probably 95 degrees out that day. There was no way we'd have made the trip from Columbia's medical campus on 168th Street to The River Café by subway without arriving as a giant ball of sweat. Just be careful for their driveway tho. As I was 3/4 of the way up, some old guy decides he's going to try and pull out and squeeze by me. The valets kept waving me forward, but our cars were so close to each other and the old guy refused to back up... I was really nervous, but we squeaked by each other.Anyways, upon walking through the entrance, you're immediately swept into a very classy and upscale environment which is a direct extension of the cobble stone courtyard through which you enter. There is a little bridge that leads you into the main dining room, which sadly doesn't really have much decor or ambiance and is painted in this dull yellow-ish paint, with air ducts and ventilation shafts hanging from the ceiling. A lot of the lunch patrons were very casually dressed too, in shorts, t-shirts and jeans. I was a bit surprised, especially after reading that jackets were required in the main dining room for dinner, but not lunch. However, the view that you are afforded during lunch (and this must count a whole lot more at night during dinner) makes you forget a lot of those little things about the decor and ambiance of the room.We were given a great table tho - right up on the windows, with great views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan. Upon being seated, our drinks orders were taken by a gentleman wearing a jacket and tie. He looked as if he'd been working here for a long time. For our appetizers, I had the Shrimp Dumplings with Lobster Consomme. The broth and dumplings were warm and flavorful. Nothing bland in this dish. My gf had the Fluke Tirado, which was also quite good. The sauces that it came with did not overpower the raw fish. Our friend had the Lamb Meatballs, with a peppercorn gravy and potato puree topped with a chip. The meatballs had a familiar flavor, but were hearty.For our main courses, my gf and I had the Swordfish Paillard, while our friend had the Crispy Duck Breast over polenta. The swordfish was quite good and well plated but familiar in its presentation and taste. Our friend really liked her duck, tho I've never been a huge duck fan. I'll eat it, but find it to be a bit gummy compared to other meats.Dessert was the same all around - a Dessert trio of Creme Brulee, a blueberry tart, and a scoop of strawberry ice cream (from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory) with graham crackers. All were quite good, tho the blueberry tart had a bit much pastry and crust on it.The service was always polite and attentive. The food here looked very simple, but was delicious and well plated.

The ""dress code"" says jackets for men are required so we made sure that we brought proper anniversary attire. We were excited.

Upon being seated, our drinks orders were taken by a gentleman wearing a jacket and tie. He looked as if he'd been working here for a long time. For our appetizers, I had the Shrimp Dumplings with Lobster Consomme. The broth and dumplings were warm and flavorful. Nothing bland in this dish. My gf had the Fluke Tirado, which was also quite good. The sauces that it came with did not overpower the raw fish. Our friend had the Lamb Meatballs, with a peppercorn gravy and potato puree topped with a chip. The meatballs had a familiar flavor, but were hearty.For our main courses, my gf and I had the Swordfish Paillard, while our friend had the Crispy Duck Breast over polenta. The swordfish was quite good and well plated but familiar in its presentation and taste. Our friend really liked her duck, tho I've never been a huge duck fan. I'll eat it, but find it to be a bit gummy compared to other meats.Dessert was the same all around - a Dessert trio of Creme Brulee, a blueberry tart, and a scoop of strawberry ice cream (from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory) with graham crackers. All were quite good, tho the blueberry tart had a bit much pastry and crust on it.The service was always polite and attentive. The food here looked very simple, but was delicious and well plated. You could tell that despite its simplicity, a lot of effort went into preparing it.  This would be a place I'd come back to for dinner if celebrating something. That night time view just makes you want to swoon...",4.0

"Enough time has past and I'm no longer upset with the cancellation of my anniversary dinner. For all my California followers, this place came highly recommended to me from friends in NY. I anxiously made reservations in May for my August trip. I even noted that we were coming from out of town and it was a special occasion. The ""dress code"" says jackets for men are required so we made sure that we brought proper anniversary attire. We were excited. The night before our reservation I get an email saying they cancelled my reservation AND there was ZERO explanation and NO call. This was such a disappointment. I can't explain how upset I was that they would treat their (potential) customer like this. But I guess they saved me $300.",1.0
"came here for my man's birthday, and was absolutely perfect.the food is great, the service was also excellent.however if you are thinking about saving money,i do not recomment this restaurant.it's a really really expensive place, and you should definitely come herewhen there is special occasion.it's not a random place to eat. you must think at least $500 including gratuity.however, a very romantic atmosphere.beautiful view of the brooklyn bridge.will definitely come back for my birthday again lol",5.0
"Came here with my bf for his birthday, very friendly staff. The view was amazing as well as the food and dessert. We got the three course meal and they were very accommodating to us considering I am a vegetarian and we do not eat  pork. They had a house special that night and accommodated us with a different special due to our request. The wine list is amazing, as well as the bread. Is it pricey? yes but totally worth it. I got the brooklyn bridge dessert which was amazing and highly recommended. Overall, we had an amazing experience.",5.0
"In the 6+ years of living in NYC, I only had one comparable eating experience in NYC, and that was Del Posto. I went here for my fiance's birthday dinner, and I was absolutely blown away. Although more continental then it's Manhattan counterparts, the food is beyond spectacular. Also, the experience you will get for $225/person (drinks, wine, food, tip and tax included) is infinitely better than the ridiculous amount of money I spent at Per Se. Oh, did I mention the spectacular view of downtown Manhattan? (For those interested. I would definitely book a reservation time in line with the sun setting)As a resident of Brooklyn, I can honestly say I am very proud to have such a world class eatery that I don't have to leave the boro for. Till next time River Cafe!",5.0
This is the 2nd time my fiance and i came here. The first time we came we were left speechless. We did the chef's tasting menu and you can tell the staff and chefs were on another level.

"Wow, this place is amazing!  I went here last with my finance for a special occasion and will definitely be back.  Everything was perfect!

"Possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city--with the BEST views of Manhattan. Perched on the water right under the Brooklyn Bridge, River Cafe is the classic date place. It has a beautiful, inviting garden as well. So ambiance is exceptional. My friend and I came here for lunch on Saturday; we walked in without reservations although we had to wait 10 min which didn't bother us at all. The food was fantastic especially the Red Snapper special with artichoke puree and the Duck (specifically the duck and potato croquette--I could make a meal out of just that). Even though we were extremely full from our entrees, mimosas/bellinis, we had to order the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate dessert. It was delicious as expected. The macaroons, etc chocolate goodies that came with it were a nice surprise but not necessary. It pains me to give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars, but there is room for improvement on the service side. We sat in very tight quarters, and didn't get our check for a long time. We also had one server who had very shaky hands which made us nervous. We came during the busiest part of lunch (so the lack of attention was understandable but still downgraded them a tad in my book).",4.0

"the BF made reservations for an anniversary lunch during our visit to the big apple.  it was a perfect, gorgeous summer day in NY.  even during the day, the Manhattan skyline is just breath-taking.  the restaurant isn't too difficult to find, even walking to it from the beautiful Brooklyn Heights. the restaurant isn't very big so making reservations was a smart move, even for a weekday lunch. the clientele seemed to be more of business than social. one thing i did notice was that we were only 1 of 2 tables there who spoke english, every other table around us spoke mostly french.  upon arrival, we asked to be seated next to the window but was told the window tables were reserved for their ""regulars"". it didn't make too much difference to me since the entire dining area facing Manhattan is surrounded by glass, no view was obstructed. the staff here is very friendly and attentive.  even though we were probably the youngest patrons at the time, they weren't snooty and still treated us like all their ""regular"" diners. i didn't read up on this place prior to dining here since it was a surprise by the BF, but it looks like their menu changes daily. it was only two pages long with a list of appetizers and a list of entrees.  for appetizer, we had the foie gras two ways and for my entree, i had the crisp duck with organic carrots, duck leg potato croquette and bok choy. i accompanied my meal with a glass of white wine (ya, i know, should've been red but i wasn't feeling red at the time). we didn't want to order dessert because we had plans to go to a dessert specific shop in the city but they gave us dessert du jour which is a small sampling of a few of their desserts in miniature portions. our entire meal was slightly over $100 (not including tip). the entire meal was delicious, romantic and well worth it especially for special occasions. like many fancy restaurants, be prepared to eat light, be captivated in a culinary experience, be serviced well and pay well.",5.0

"Walking into the River Café makes you feel as though you are walking into a scene out of a romance novel. When you walk through the front doors, it smells as though you walked into a flower garden with an abundance of beautiful plush flowers all throughout the main entrance. It is quite possibly the most romantic/best date spot in NYC with the beautiful backdrop of the NYC skyline/Brooklyn Bridge where every seat has a view. My fiancé and I had wanted to try the River Café and finally decided to go to for dinner to celebrate my grad school graduation.  I must admit that I went in having very high expectations and perhaps that is where I went wrong.  We arrived a bit early to our reservation and grabbed glasses of wine while waiting for our table to be ready. The bartender told us that we could take our drinks to the outdoor deck next to the bar which was a beautiful place to watch the sunset on such a beautiful night. The views are picture perfect! Once the table was ready, we were ushered to our table and given melon and gazpacho which was very delicious. You have two options, either the 3- course prefix for $100 or a 6-course tasting menu for $125. We chose the 3 course option, as the tasting menu is the chef's choice and I was really craving chicken for dinner. For the appetizer, I chose a special for the night--it was a cheese risotto with sweet corn and shrimp. The risotto had an odd texture and wasn't as rich and creamy with a bit of resistance as I'm used to, but instead was primarily resistant. The shrimp, however, was grilled to perfection. For my main dish, I ordered the organic chicken breast. The chicken was moist and a great-sized portion, however, there wasn't much flavor. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special I would have expected at a one-star Michelin restaurant. I was won over by the dessert, as it was a great-sized portion and I have a sweet tooth! I ordered the goat cheese cheesecake- the cheesecake itself had a very tart taste which was matched well with the rosemary sorbet. My favorite part was the lemon mousseline--it was absolutely delicious! Overall, I definitely would come back for the atmosphere alone! If given a choice, instead of ordering a main meal, I would love to just have one of each dessert!",4.0

Remember to wear a jacket for the gentlemen, if not, you will need to settle for their spear jackets. If i am to pick my favorite dishes, i will say the steak tartar, lamb chop and maine lobster. For desert, the brooklyn bridge chocolate cake is a lot of fun, but can be quite heavy. The apple tart was amazing!

The River Cafe is the ideal date night (make sure they are worth it :)), or the ideal place for a special occasion. You will not forget your experience. Also, the price is not bad at all, relatively speaking. For $100 the dinner experience is well worth it. Many inferior restaurants cost more.

"Came here for my birthday brunch. Started with zucchini bread which was cold and served with cold butter. The bread had a good flavor.Started with the Amuse bouche which was banana flan with granola on top. The flan was creamy and topped with milk and the granola was crunchy. It came in an empty eggshell, which was a nice way to serve it.The crab and coconut bisque was creamy and the crab was not overcooked. The coconut flavor along with the basil and lemongrass made it a very good soup. The wagyu steak tartar was fantastic. The toast was perfect, and the meat tasted like it was cooked. Cornichons, chives, mustard, and capers were added along with a raw quail egg to make the tartar. The foie gras was served two ways and both ways were cold. It had a good flavor but was not as rich or as good as the top foie gras I have eaten.The lobster special came with a claw and a tail served over cheese grits (which had a nice spice). The lobster was fresh and cooked perfectly and came with fried taro strips on top. The sirloin was cooked in between medium and medium rare (it was ordered medium rare) and had a nice flavor to meat with good marbling. The Bernaise sauce was very nice on the meat. The duck steak and egg was cooked nicely, and came with a breast, sausage and egg on a puff pastry. It was a great dish.Service was impeccable. Brunch was great and I would like to try dinner here sometime soon.",4.0

"Came here for my birthday brunch. Started with zucchini bread which was cold and served with cold butter. The bread had a good flavor.Started with the Amuse bouche which was banana flan with granola on top. The flan was creamy and topped with milk and the granola was crunchy. It came in an empty eggshell, which was a nice way to serve it.The crab and coconut bisque was creamy and the crab was not overcooked. The coconut flavor along with the basil and lemongrass made it a very good soup. The wagyu steak tartar was fantastic. The toast was perfect, and the meat tasted like it was cooked. Cornichons, chives, mustard, and capers were added along with a raw quail egg to make the tartar. The foie gras was served two ways and both ways were cold. It had a good flavor but was not as rich or as good as the top foie gras I have eaten.The lobster special came with a claw and a tail served over cheese grits (which had a nice spice). The lobster was fresh and cooked perfectly and came with fried taro strips on top. The sirloin was cooked in between medium and medium rare (it was ordered medium rare) and had a nice flavor to meat with good marbling. The Bernaise sauce was very nice on the meat. The duck steak and egg was cooked nicely, and came with a breast, sausage and egg on a puff pastry. It was a great dish.Service was impeccable. Brunch was great and I would like to try dinner here sometime soon.",4.0

"Probably the nicest restaurant I have ever been to. Besides the amazing view of the Brooklyn Bridge and NYC, the decor and surrounding gardens of the restaurant were stunning. I was able to go while with my stepmother on a business trip, so the very expensive bill was paid for on company dime. Nonetheless, I would definitely go back and be willing to spend my own money for the experience, excellent food and outstanding service. We had what seemed to be a 7 course dinner with wine pairings and everything I ate was impeccable. For dessert, we had a chocolate masterpiece that was sculpted into the shape of the Brooklyn Bridge and it was a great finale to a very memorable dining experience.This place has always stood out in my mind as one of the first fine dining experiences I ever had and one of the best.",5.0

"It's 1:34 in the morning and I just got home. I'm completely exhausted but I simply couldn't go to bed without writing a review. I scored reservations here after relentlessly calling the restaurant to see if there were any openings, with the hopes that I might be able to bring my best friend here for his birthday, and I got the happy call late this afternoon. We were in! Still, after reading such a wide range of reviews here from people who seemed to be peeved by mediocre food or snotty service, I was nervous. I shouldn't have been. Since neither of us had ever been there, the oohs and ahhs immediately commenced as soon as we started pulling into the cobblestone driveway. The trees were lit, the water sparkled invitingly beyond the restaurant, and the Brooklyn bridge looming directly overhead truly made our spines tingle with anticipation. The night just became more and more magical with each passing moment. I was concerned that we wouldn't have a nice view because we didn't get window seats, but we had an eyeful plenty from our seat because the entire side of the restaurant is a glass wall, displaying a panoramic view of the East River. Beautiful as it was, I would have been truly sorry if the view was all they had going for them. Instead, I was THRILLED to find that the food knocked our socks off. Our appetizers were delicious (rabbit and dumplings and crab bisque), as well as the amuse bouche of ham & potato croquette and some kind of chive sauce (we missed the description, but I could have eaten a plate full of that for my entree). My best friend ordered the steak and gratin potatoes, which I would have defended to the death with my steak knife had I ordered it, it was that delicious. But because he is a far better person than I am, he allowed me a few generous tastes. Artfully charred, but still tender and perfectly pink on the inside. It truly made our eyes roll into the back of our heads. I had the salmon in mushroom sauce, which was seasoned and simply prepared, but also one of the freshest fish that has ever been introduced to the sea of my gastric juices. Desserts came afterwards, with a sorbet assortment for him, the apple and almond tart for me. They thoughtfully provided a candle for his birthday, without any embarrassing waiters clapping and singing a la Applebees. The service was completely on point, and we had to chuckle at the fact that our water glasses seemed to be refilled every time we took a sip. It was a perfect night with unbelievable service and the most romantic setting possible. I don't like giving 5 stars too readily, but this was certainly a no-brainer.",5.0

"Not the greatest culinary experience but lovely overall. Loved the fresh flower arrangements at the entrance which reminded me of a flower shop and the ones on the tables. Flowers on the patio and in the garden out back. The restaurant seems like it is on a permanently docked boat that rocks while you are dining. Kinda feels like an earthquake. Came here for lunch during restaurant week and loved the view of the east river and manhattan. Servers were excellent and dressed in cute white jackets with gold buttons and black bow ties. They were excellent. The waiter I only saw once when he took our order. Im hoping some of my tip go to the wonderful servers that did everything else.Foodwise- great presentation, fresh clean tastes but nothing extraordinary. Appetizer I ordered the Lobster miso soup consumme with shrimp dumplings (2). The dumplings came in a cute glass octogon bowl with lid and then the lobster consomme was poured in. The broth was flavorful and tasted of lobster, the shrimp dumpling was ok and the edamame was superfluous in my opinion. My bf got the lamb meatballs that came with little cracker hats. They were nothing spectacular. For the main course, we both got the grilled atlantic swordfish as I dont like duck and didnt want pasta. It was simply dressed and soft in texture. I enjoyed it but have had better fish. Dessert was a blue, red and white dessert with creme brulee, strawberry ice cream and a blueberry pastry. It was yummy.

"We went here for lunch for Winter Restaurant Week 2010.  I was very much looking forward to trying this Michelin rated restaurant and since the reviews are also raving, I felt even if it is the Restaurant Week menu, it should still be outstanding.   Well, unfortunately, River Cafe fell below  and expectations.Ambiance: Very nice!  The view is outstanding, no doubt and we were seated facing the lovely East River and the Manhattan skyline.  The actual restaurant was well decorated and modern.  In the summer, this would be great to dine in the garden area.Service:  was decent and attentive.  One point of contention I do have is that once our desserts were brought out, the waiter just dropped them off without explaining to us what they were which is customary in a restaurant of this caliber. It was odd.  Other than that, I can't complain. Now for the nitty gritty: THE FOOD.  I started off with the Maine Sea Scallop and Lobster Chowder. This had lobster cream, poached scallops, Russet potato, leeks, fresh herbs and coral.  At least that's the description on the menu.  This was just not enough food..even for an appetizer. It about 1/3 of a SCALLOP..not ""scallops"" and a very tiny piece of lobster. The rest of the chowder contained about three little square sized nuggets of a potato and a couple of slivers of celery.  The rest of it was just the lobster cream.  Although it tasted nice, it left a lot to be desired. At this point, I was pretty hungry.For the main course, I selected the Grilled Atlantic Swordfish.  This was served with scallion whipped potatoes.  This was actually a substantial piece of fish and although a bit on the salty side, it was well prepared and satisfying.  This selection made up for the appetizer. The dessert course was a Tasting Dessert Trio with crème brûlée banana bread pudding, coconut sorbet, fresh roasted coconutmilk chocolate ganache and candied coco nibs.  This was actually the best course and the largest course as well. I am a big fan of the creme brûlée   and banana bread pudding. That was actually excellent and huge!  I couldn't finish the trio but all three were very nice.In conclusion, I didn't think this was a bad meal and for the price, I suppose compared to what I would have normally paid to eat here, was definitely reasonable, but still I feel they fell short of my expectations.  I don't think I'll return based on this experience, especially since Grimaldi's is up the street!",3.0

I made reservations for lunch and asked if it was possible to personalize our table menus which I had heard about. The hostess said that the manager was happy to accommodate my request. Upon arrival, we were greeted with personalized menus, fresh flowers on the table and complementary glasses of champagne. I was blown away and so was my new fiancé .

"AMAZING PLACE!!! A friend and I celebrated his birthday here and the whole experience was superb!  From the moment we pulled up to the valet I knew I was going to love this place! The trees and little lights hanging from them gave the outside a magical touch.  Not to mention your right under the Brooklyn Bridge! Once you enter, the arrangement of beautiful fresh flowers everywhere will capture your attention! We were greeted from the staff and after we check our coats we proceeded into the actual restaurant. As soon as you walk through those doors your hit with the most beautiful breath taking view of the Manhattan skyline! I would loveeeee to come here often just for that view!  We went to the bar while we waited for our table. The view in combination with the live piano playing gives this place a wonderful elegant atmosphere! We had a 10pm reservation (reservations are a must!) and we were seat maybe 10 minutes later.  Although we did not get a window table the view from where we were sitting was still great.  In actuality every table in the restaurant has a great view! They had our cocktails sent over from the bar for us (cocktails are around $15 each) and brought out a complimentary dish to start off along with a bread roll.  The maitre d' was friendly and really nice as  were all the waiters.  They were attentive to us and everything came out in a timely fashion.  The price fixe menu is at $100 per person which includes appetizer, main course and dessert! The Maine rock lobster is to die for! and the Colorado rack of lamb is simply delicious! My friend had the chocolate Brooklyn bridge for dessert and it was brought out with a candle and a little chocolate sign that said happy birthday along with my dessert and two glasses of champagne (As I requested when I made the reservations) A glass of champagne runs around $20.  During dessert they also brought out a plate of mini complimentary sweets which I thought was a very nice touch!  After dessert was brought out whenever the waiters and maître d' passed by they all wished my friend a happy birthday which was nice also!Veryyyy IMPORTANT!!! Men must wear a jacket, it's a strictly enforced dress code, suit jacket, sports coat or blazer it doesn't really matter as long as it has a lapel!All in all if you plan on having a dinner for two here expect to spend anywhere from $350-400 (including tax & tip)  It's a bit pricey but If you appreciate a place with a great view, great ambiance, excellent food and friendly service then this is definitely the place for you!  I would dine here every day if I could!",5.0
"I can not recommend this place enough!I was working in NY for four months and my husband came out from LA to visit for Thanksgiving.  Now, I've been out to restaurants for Thanksgiving before, and let's be honest, going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving makes you feel like an orphan!  Not so with The River Cafe.  Just 5 days before T-day I was able to book a 2:30 pm seating for our Thanksgiving dinner, soon to become known as, ""The best meal of my life"".The service was beyond excellent.  Our waiter, (at first we thought he was the manager as he was dressed in a business suit) was warm and informative, and kept and eye on us from a far.  Always there if our drinks looked low or to check on our progress for the next course.  Everything was perfectly timed.  With the Thanksgiving seatings, I thought for sure we would eventually get rushed out after a few hours, but we stretched our meal out until 7 and were able to catch sunset during our meal.The food was incredible.  I mean words simply won't do it justice.  Phrases like 'symphony of flavors' and 'absolute joy' come to mind but seem contrived compared to what the actual experience was like.   I had the crab trio appetizer, and for my main course I had whitefish with pumpkin ravioli and almonds.  My husband had some kind of ox-tail ravioli for appetizer, and for his main course sea bass with a shrimp, chorizo and vegetable stuffing.  Everything came with the traditional Thanksgiving sides.  Now my mother will tell you that I avoid yams like the plague, but the creamed yams with marshmallow sauce was practically a religious experience.  It was all I could do to refrain from licking the bowl!  And dessert was over-the-top.  We were *each* served the following: chocolate flour less cake made to look like the Brooklyn Bridge, a mini pumpkin tart with fresh made vanilla ice cream and crushed pistachios, a mini apple tart, a pumpkin gourde filled with creme brulee, and an assortment of holiday cookies.  We were so stuffed it was all we could do to sample each one before waddling off to the deck to take in the view and snap some great picks with the Statue of Liberty in the background.After we paid our bill and snuck away, our waiter came to find us, warmly shaking our hands and thanking us for spending Thanksgiving with them.  I mean my own family doesn't do that!",5.0

"I'm not sure what I did to deserve her, but my girlfriend took me to the River Cafe for my birthday. I arrived early and enjoyed a good martini at the bar, admiring the gorgeous sunset.Barkeep: It really turned out to be a beautiful night.Peter D: Yep.Barkeep: This is what Jesus was talking about.Peter D: I actually wasn't there that day. But that water into wine thing is quite the party trick. Barkeep: Yep.When my girlfriend arrived, the maître d' led us to a table in the back. As we contemplated the menu, the guy seated behind me got down on one knee. It was terribly romantic. Until he got to the part about ""...love of my life, blah blah blah..."" At which point I was forced to interject, ""Hey buddy. I'm trying to have a birthday dinner over here. You're kind of stealing my thunder. Wrap it up."" Anyway, I'm pretty sure she said yes. I mean, everyone in the place clapped afterward, but I think they were just glad it was over, so they could get back to celebrating my birthday too. I started with the foie gras laid over a caramelized apple and brioche ""French Toast."" It was rich, buttery and delicious, and a surprisingly large portion, unlike her lobster ravioli special. Served with butternut squash and a pomegranate sauce, her appetizer was also well-executed, but with only three tiny ravioli, it was a bit disappointing. For my entree, I went with the sirloin, medium rare, which my waiter was very enthused about. Perhaps because it costs a bit extra on top of the prix fixe. The steak was served with a red wine mushroom marmalade that I could've used a bit more of, and a russet and sweet potato gratin with bleu cheese fondue. The side came in the sort of dish that escargot are served in: solid with tiny holes for each snail (or little potato gratin thingy). Bleu cheese and beef has to be one of the best pairings on this earth; the dish was excellent, although not mind-blowing.Her branzino, on the other hand, was freaking sensational. Stuffed with chorizo and shrimp, the fish had an incredibly crispy top layer that made each bite a delight. It was flaky and juicy and exploding with flavor, all at once. It was the clear winner of the night. If I were to return, I think it is the only dish we would order again. This includes the desserts; both the apple tart and the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate creation were solid, but I didn't feel the need to finish either. The price tag at the end of the night is fairly steep, but remember guys: that doesn't mean you owe her anything.",4.0
"OK, so do you remember that scene in ""Terms of Endearment"" when Debra Winger - I mean Emma - is taken on a trip to New York by her best pal Patsy after she finds out she has cancer? They end up meeting Patsy's patronizing friends for lunch at a posh restaurant...PATSY:  Emma, this is Lizbeth.EMMA:  Hi, Elizabeth.LIZBETH:  Hi. It's Lizbeth.EMMA:  Isn't that what I said?LIZBETH:  You said ""Elizabeth"". It's Lizbeth.EMMA:  Oh, two names? Liz Beth?LIZBETH:  No, one. Lizbeth.EMMA:  Lizbeth?LIZBETH:  Never mind.PATSY:  And this is Jane.EMMA:  Thank heavens!Well, they met at the River Cafe, and ever since I saw Debra Winger talk about dealing with the tragedy of her cancer in front of the Twin Towers across the river (...a foreboding and somewhat ironic sight when you see it now), I had this hankering to come here...especially when I saw the strawberry shortcake Debra WInger was about to devour. I knew it was going to be a pricey place, so it would take the right occasion to justify the cost.So Jamie W. and I took a trip to NYC together this past weekend to see ""Young Frankenstein"" (a present from him to me) and have a nice meal at the River Cafe (a present from me to him). A 2PM Saturday lunch was the only reservation I could get on short notice, but it turned out to be a comparatively good deal, a prix-fixe per person of $45, a full $40 less than dinner.It's actually a modest place size-wise, a floating barge simply and tastefully decorated and surrounded by a garden that's past bloom this time of year. We were seated next to the window in order to take in the view of the Brooklyn Bridge (see photo). We were immediately served a complimentary appetizer, homemade granola in cream inserted in an eggshell cracked open and nestled in an egg holder (see photo). A tasty loaf of nutty cranberry bread was left for us to munch on while we perused the menu.For our appetizers, Jamie went for the devastatingly good Crab and Shrimp ""Duet"", fresh Maine crabmeat wrapped in a cucumber and floating in a citrus-sesame dressing coupled with five crispy marinated shrimp with chili and ginger (see photo). I ordered the very fresh Ceviche of Taylor Bay Scallops, five modest scallops topped with sea beans, tomato and coriander sprouts presented on top of a silver tureen filled with crushed ice (see photo).The entrees were even more impressive. Jamie had the Duck Steak and Egg, which consisted of a crispy duck breast topped with marinated red peppers and sauted pearl onions, a coddled duck egg embedded in a pastry shell, a wild mushroom 'chasseur' sauce and a grilled duck sausage (see photo). Wow. Mine was the equally grand Prime Sirloin and Short Rib, slices of charcoal-grilled sirloin on top of russet potato puree and a braised short rib shredded and mixed in a Pinot Noir sauce and topped with a poached egg with Hollandaise sauce (see photo). Decadently carnivorous.We decided to share a dessert after all that, and we picked a winner with the Goat Cheese Cheesecake, which came with a passion fruit sauce and a refreshing peach sorbet (see photo). Throughout the meal, we shared a bottle of Italian Prosecco, a relative bargain for $35 and just as bubbly as a first-rank champagne. What a perfect afternoon...I guess we could forget about going to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory next door for a scoop, eh.FOOD - 5 stars...culinary delights keep coming with no disappointments with our selectionsAMBIANCE - 5 stars...low-key formal and sedate with a spectacular view even on a cloudy daySERVICE - 5 stars...impeccableTOTAL - 5 stars...likely my best luxury-level dining experience in New York",5.0
"Came here Saturday lunchtime. Have been here before and the food and ambience is always really good. Very unprepossessing exterior from the water; but once you get inside you realise why this place is such an institution. The men still have to wear a jacket for dinner; and I really like that! There are flowers and plants everywhere and there is a private room for weddings and other functions. There is a lovely garden outside and a terrace. The view of the East River and the Brooklyn Bridge from the restaurant is breathtaking, as it's literally situated just underneath the Brooklyn side of the bridge. We had the brined trout and the smoked salmon, followed by the skirt steak. Eveything was perfectly executed and presented beautifully. Then we had the Tarte tatin and the Brooklyn Bridge Marquise which was a bit rich for me, but I'm sure has many fans. Will definitely be back.",4.0
"River Cafe is simply a really nice restaurant with very good service and very good food. One thing I found interesting however, was as fancy and formal this place is (Jackets required for men btw), I didn't find the atmosphere equally as fancy or snobby. I actually thought the atmosphere was very lively and fun. Don't get me wrong, this place is upscale. The food is sophisticated, the restaurant has expensive decorations, etc.. but when you're at a place where it's a minimum $100 a head, I think you would want to be in an upscale restaurant surrounded by other people who are dressed nicely. I was happy it was formal, but not stuffy.So for the food, my wife and I shared the Yellowfin Tuna app and the Rabbit and Dumplings appetizer. The tuna was really delicious. The bacon wrapped around the fish added a really nice crispiness, and the sauce in the dish was really unique. The Rabbit and Dumplings was something special. We licked clean the plate. Having the rabbit two ways was really nice and the ricotta stuffed dumplings were so good I wish we could have ordered a whole plate of them.For entrees we went with the Rack of Lamb and the Branzino. Both were great. The lamb was cooked perfectly. The meat was juicy and the mint glaze around the plate was a cool twist on a classic combo. The Branzino was the best thing we got all night however. The fish was creamy and practically melted when you ate it. It also was completely covered with a breading that went great with the fish.For desert we did the Brooklyn bridge desert was was very chocolaty and had a fun presentation, although it also came with this seltzer drink that was kind of odd... We also tried the Chocolate Sticky Toffee Cake which was very rich and also had a pistachio ice cream sandwich with it that was awesome.All in all the food was great and the service was really good. I appreciated that we were never rushed and the servers always seemed to come by at the right moment to ask if we wanted a new drink, and also didn't come over when in the middle of good conversation. They also let us breathe for a while between dinner and desert and just enjoy our drinks which was great. Lastly I just have to mention the view. It's really nice to look our on Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge and watch a sunset and then see the city lit up. Really great view that most other restaurants cannot offer. While this place is expensive, I definitely recommend it for a special occasion. The only thing I would probably do differently is bump up the extra $25 a head and do the full 6 course chef's tasting menu. For $25 more you really seemed to get a lot more food from what I saw at other people's tables. I think that's probably the best ""deal"".",5.0
"I've been here a few times over the years and this place consistently blows me away. It may be because I'm in love with the view that you get while dining at The River Cafe. This is the perfect place for a special occasion, whether it be a proposal, graduation dinner, birthday celebration or just because. This would be an amazing place to be married or proposed to if you want that romantic feel! It doesn't hurt that the food is amazing as well, and the service as attentive and polite as you could ask for. This place is pricey, but well worth it. Downside is that it's so hard to get to. Otherwise I would come here more!",5.0
Ein wunderschönes Café/Restaurant mit einem noch wunderschöneren Ausblick. Man blickt direkt auf die Skyline von Downtown Manhattan und das bezahlt man auch ;-) Am besten danach oder davor über die eindrucksvolle Brooklyn Bridge spazieren und der Tag/Abend ist gerettet!,4.0
"As I planned my proposal to my girlfriend on the Brooklyn Bridge, I wanted to make sure that the entire day was special. I made reservations for lunch and asked if it was possible to personalize our table menus which I had heard about. The hostess said that the manager was happy to accommodate my request. Upon arrival, we were greeted with personalized menus, fresh flowers on the table and complementary glasses of champagne. I was blown away and so was my new fiancé . The hospitality, the kindness and the special touches made our day so special. The food was excellent, the view was incredible and the customer service was unmatched. If you are looking for a special, romantic restaurant, please look no further! Thank you River Cafe for the most special day of our lives!",5.0
"AMAZING PLACE!!! A friend and I celebrated his birthday here and the whole experience was superb!  From the moment we pulled up to the valet I knew I was going to love this place! The trees and little lights hanging from them gave the outside a magical touch.  Not to mention your right under the Brooklyn Bridge! Once you enter, the arrangement of beautiful fresh flowers everywhere will capture your attention! We were greeted from the staff and after we check our coats we proceeded into the actual restaurant. As soon as you walk through those doors your hit with the most beautiful breath taking view of the Manhattan skyline! I would loveeeee to come here often just for that view!  We went to the bar while we waited for our table. The view in combination with the live piano playing gives this place a wonderful elegant atmosphere! We had a 10pm reservation (reservations are a must!) and we were seat maybe 10 minutes later.  Although we did not get a window table the view from where we were sitting was still great.  In actuality every table in the restaurant has a great view! They had our cocktails sent over from the bar for us (cocktails are around $15 each) and brought out a complimentary dish to start off along with a bread roll.  The maitre d' was friendly and really nice as  were all the waiters.  They were attentive to us and everything came out in a timely fashion.  The price fixe menu is at $100 per person which includes appetizer, main course and dessert! The Maine rock lobster is to die for! and the Colorado rack of lamb is simply delicious! My friend had the chocolate Brooklyn bridge for dessert and it was brought out with a candle and a little chocolate sign that said happy birthday along with my dessert and two glasses of champagne (As I requested when I made the reservations) A glass of champagne runs around $20.  During dessert they also brought out a plate of mini complimentary sweets which I thought was a very nice touch!  After dessert was brought out whenever the waiters and maître d' passed by they all wished my friend a happy birthday which was nice also!Veryyyy IMPORTANT!!! Men must wear a jacket, it's a strictly enforced dress code, suit jacket, sports coat or blazer it doesn't really matter as long as it has a lapel!All in all if you plan on having a dinner for two here expect to spend anywhere from $350-400 (including tax & tip)  It's a bit pricey but If you appreciate a place with a great view, great ambiance, excellent food and friendly service then this is definitely the place for you!  I would dine here every day if I could!",5.0
"I can not recommend this place enough!I was working in NY for four months and my husband came out from LA to visit for Thanksgiving.  Now, I've been out to restaurants for Thanksgiving before, and let's be honest, going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving makes you feel like an orphan!  Not so with The River Cafe.  Just 5 days before T-day I was able to book a 2:30 pm seating for our Thanksgiving dinner, soon to become known as, ""The best meal of my life"".The service was beyond excellent.  Our waiter, (at first we thought he was the manager as he was dressed in a business suit) was warm and informative, and kept and eye on us from a far.  Always there if our drinks looked low or to check on our progress for the next course.  Everything was perfectly timed.  With the Thanksgiving seatings, I thought for sure we would eventually get rushed out after a few hours, but we stretched our meal out until 7 and were able to catch sunset during our meal.The food was incredible.  I mean words simply won't do it justice.  Phrases like 'symphony of flavors' and 'absolute joy' come to mind but seem contrived compared to what the actual experience was like.   I had the crab trio appetizer, and for my main course I had whitefish with pumpkin ravioli and almonds.  My husband had some kind of ox-tail ravioli for appetizer, and for his main course sea bass with a shrimp, chorizo and vegetable stuffing.  Everything came with the traditional Thanksgiving sides.  Now my mother will tell you that I avoid yams like the plague, but the creamed yams with marshmallow sauce was practically a religious experience.  It was all I could do to refrain from licking the bowl!  And dessert was over-the-top.  We were *each* served the following: chocolate flour less cake made to look like the Brooklyn Bridge, a mini pumpkin tart with fresh made vanilla ice cream and crushed pistachios, a mini apple tart, a pumpkin gourde filled with creme brulee, and an assortment of holiday cookies.  We were so stuffed it was all we could do to sample each one before waddling off to the deck to take in the view and snap some great picks with the Statue of Liberty in the background.After we paid our bill and snuck away, our waiter came to find us, warmly shaking our hands and thanking us for spending Thanksgiving with them.  I mean my own family doesn't do that!",5.0
Great dining experience!Lovely setting with a view of Manhattan beyond the East river. Perfect place to have great conversations over delicious food. Impeccable service.,5.0
"I'm not sure what I did to deserve her, but my girlfriend took me to the River Cafe for my birthday. I arrived early and enjoyed a good martini at the bar, admiring the gorgeous sunset.Barkeep: It really turned out to be a beautiful night.Peter D: Yep.Barkeep: This is what Jesus was talking about.Peter D: I actually wasn't there that day. But that water into wine thing is quite the party trick. Barkeep: Yep.When my girlfriend arrived, the maître d' led us to a table in the back. As we contemplated the menu, the guy seated behind me got down on one knee. It was terribly romantic. Until he got to the part about ""...love of my life, blah blah blah..."" At which point I was forced to interject, ""Hey buddy. I'm trying to have a birthday dinner over here. You're kind of stealing my thunder. Wrap it up."" Anyway, I'm pretty sure she said yes. I mean, everyone in the place clapped afterward, but I think they were just glad it was over, so they could get back to celebrating my birthday too. I started with the foie gras laid over a caramelized apple and brioche ""French Toast."" It was rich, buttery and delicious, and a surprisingly large portion, unlike her lobster ravioli special. Served with butternut squash and a pomegranate sauce, her appetizer was also well-executed, but with only three tiny ravioli, it was a bit disappointing. For my entree, I went with the sirloin, medium rare, which my waiter was very enthused about. Perhaps because it costs a bit extra on top of the prix fixe. The steak was served with a red wine mushroom marmalade that I could've used a bit more of, and a russet and sweet potato gratin with bleu cheese fondue. The side came in the sort of dish that escargot are served in: solid with tiny holes for each snail (or little potato gratin thingy). Bleu cheese and beef has to be one of the best pairings on this earth; the dish was excellent, although not mind-blowing.Her branzino, on the other hand, was freaking sensational. Stuffed with chorizo and shrimp, the fish had an incredibly crispy top layer that made each bite a delight. It was flaky and juicy and exploding with flavor, all at once. It was the clear winner of the night. If I were to return, I think it is the only dish we would order again. This includes the desserts; both the apple tart and the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate creation were solid, but I didn't feel the need to finish either. The price tag at the end of the night is fairly steep, but remember guys: that doesn't mean you owe her anything.",4.0
"OK, so do you remember that scene in ""Terms of Endearment"" when Debra Winger - I mean Emma - is taken on a trip to New York by her best pal Patsy after she finds out she has cancer? They end up meeting Patsy's patronizing friends for lunch at a posh restaurant...PATSY:  Emma, this is Lizbeth.EMMA:  Hi, Elizabeth.LIZBETH:  Hi. It's Lizbeth.EMMA:  Isn't that what I said?LIZBETH:  You said ""Elizabeth"". It's Lizbeth.EMMA:  Oh, two names? Liz Beth?LIZBETH:  No, one. Lizbeth.EMMA:  Lizbeth?LIZBETH:  Never mind.PATSY:  And this is Jane.EMMA:  Thank heavens!Well, they met at the River Cafe, and ever since I saw Debra Winger talk about dealing with the tragedy of her cancer in front of the Twin Towers across the river (...a foreboding and somewhat ironic sight when you see it now), I had this hankering to come here...especially when I saw the strawberry shortcake Debra WInger was about to devour. I knew it was going to be a pricey place, so it would take the right occasion to justify the cost.So Jamie W. and I took a trip to NYC together this past weekend to see ""Young Frankenstein"" (a present from him to me) and have a nice meal at the River Cafe (a present from me to him). A 2PM Saturday lunch was the only reservation I could get on short notice, but it turned out to be a comparatively good deal, a prix-fixe per person of $45, a full $40 less than dinner.It's actually a modest place size-wise, a floating barge simply and tastefully decorated and surrounded by a garden that's past bloom this time of year. We were seated next to the window in order to take in the view of the Brooklyn Bridge (see photo). We were immediately served a complimentary appetizer, homemade granola in cream inserted in an eggshell cracked open and nestled in an egg holder (see photo). A tasty loaf of nutty cranberry bread was left for us to munch on while we perused the menu.For our appetizers, Jamie went for the devastatingly good Crab and Shrimp ""Duet"", fresh Maine crabmeat wrapped in a cucumber and floating in a citrus-sesame dressing coupled with five crispy marinated shrimp with chili and ginger (see photo). I ordered the very fresh Ceviche of Taylor Bay Scallops, five modest scallops topped with sea beans, tomato and coriander sprouts presented on top of a silver tureen filled with crushed ice (see photo).The entrees were even more impressive. Jamie had the Duck Steak and Egg, which consisted of a crispy duck breast topped with marinated red peppers and sauted pearl onions, a coddled duck egg embedded in a pastry shell, a wild mushroom 'chasseur' sauce and a grilled duck sausage (see photo). Wow. Mine was the equally grand Prime Sirloin and Short Rib, slices of charcoal-grilled sirloin on top of russet potato puree and a braised short rib shredded and mixed in a Pinot Noir sauce and topped with a poached egg with Hollandaise sauce (see photo). Decadently carnivorous.We decided to share a dessert after all that, and we picked a winner with the Goat Cheese Cheesecake, which came with a passion fruit sauce and a refreshing peach sorbet (see photo). Throughout the meal, we shared a bottle of Italian Prosecco, a relative bargain for $35 and just as bubbly as a first-rank champagne. What a perfect afternoon...I guess we could forget about going to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory next door for a scoop, eh.FOOD - 5 stars...culinary delights keep coming with no disappointments with our selectionsAMBIANCE - 5 stars...low-key formal and sedate with a spectacular view even on a cloudy daySERVICE - 5 stars...impeccableTOTAL - 5 stars...likely my best luxury-level dining experience in New York",5.0

"I dine at the River Cafe regularly, and it's my fave spot for an AMAZING day time and nighttime view couple with good service. On this visit to one of my fave spots, I came for Bklyn Restaurant week for a lunch with my cousin.The dining room hostess (young woman with blonde hair) was not as warm and friendly as I'd expect from my past experiences at the River Cafe, and was very short. I also didn't enjoy my experience with my waiter, who never checked to ask us how our meal was going, nor did he ever offer us dinner rolls (we had to ask our water guy). I believe his name was Josh, yes, Josh. The menu was what I'd expected-- solid food with a kick-@$$ dessert! I had the lamb meatballs, with the fish fillet with vegetable basmati rice (my cousin had the chicken salad, pasta with bolognese sauce) and we both had the dessert trio with the vanilla bean creme brulee, chocolate cake, and ice cream. I consistently love the food at the River Cafe-- everything from the Fois Gras, to the Bklyn Bridge Cake, Creme Brulee that is HEAVENLY, to their soups and salads are great. TYPICALLY the service is awesome. I have never been waited on by Josh before so it wasn't an option. It's typically the type of service that the moment you wish your water needed refilling, you desire another dinner roll, or you want another glass of wine to be poured from your bottle, it gets done. Josh was very inattentive, and although it was Restaurant Week, the idea is to lure guests to return to your place of business at later dates, not to detract them from your establishment. The rest of the wait staff was still amazing, as usual, so was the maitre' d that seated us, and the girls that initially greet you prior to heading into the dining room. Josh and the blonde girl at the dining room greeting podium were atypical and disappointing. All in all, I LOVE this place, and it lost out on pricing for the location for my wedding. I'd still consider it as a venue for my mom's 50th birthday party, so long as the service is top notch, with no room for errors.",4.0

"Where do I start... Walking down Old Fulton street, reaching the ridiculous line at Grimaldi's (mind you, there is nothing wrong with waiting for 1.5 hrs for their pizza), then for a change, PASSING the line at Grimaldi's, because we're heading to the River Cafe. Is it all that it's cracked up to be? Yup, I think so. Had Dad take the family here for Mom's 50th birthday. The weather was great, our table perfect by the window, piano in the background - the mood for a pleasant afternoon already set. Score (!) as it is not easy to please critical Mom.  None of us ordered the same which meant I tried 4 different appetizers and 4 entrees - as good as family dining gets. Before even that, as a pre-appetizer they brought us really really good carrot bread  in addition to our fresh rolls. Then surprise. The server places in front of each of us a plate with an egg on it, cracked on top, then pours milk into it. Quizzical subtle glances among us - no idea what it is. My brother takes one for the team and asks how to eat it. Ha, turns out you just spoon it out. It was some sort of granola but not your usual boring breakfast granola - much better. But of course granola is served in an egg! Duh. As for appetizers. I had the seafood trio (shrimp-fabulous-tempura, tuna/avocado delicacy, dumpling), my bro - oysters (this was maybe the one thing I did not enjoy but that probably mostly due to me not being an oysters person), mom - salmon, dad - trout. Excellent.  Had to wait quite a while for our entrees which of course just intensified the anticipation and we were not disappointed. I could not be happier with my choice - branzino with tiny zucchini and ham cubes. Oh My Goodness. Also tried the salmon with mushroom sauce and the duck, which was serviced with sausages and an omelette over a phyllo pastry. Oh My. Again. I think this is what those cooking competition judges must feel like. When the contestants are all excellent. I can be a quick eater, but this time, I just wanted to take my time with each and every single bite to make the most of the taste.Thoroughly enjoyable, definitely worth the price for the right occasion. Would love to go back again of course and hopefully it'll be for dinner. The day view was gorgeous but I'm sure the night one is somethin' else.",5.0
"I've been here twice, and the two times were night and day.My first experience was definitely a two star review.  While the food absolutely knocked it out of the park, the service was unbelievably bad.  I will spare everyone the details, but I will say that i was more than appalled.  To the restaurant's defense, it was an incredibly packed night due to fireworks (fleet week i believe) and the exceptional view of the river/city.But after a chat with the manager and giving the restaurant a second chance (I knew a restaurant with food THAT good couldn't possibly have service THAT bad) i have definitely come around.  The second time around the service was great and food was just as good.  the oysters were delicious, even though i normally hate oysters.  i think a restaurant is truely on a different level when they can make the foods you hate taste great.So overall 4 stars for the amazing food, good service (second time around) and breathtaking views.",4.0
"Amazing view of the city and Brooklyn Bridge, romantic, boat-like setting, and great service. We went around 5:30 in the summertime, so we got to watch the sun setting while we had dinner. Ask for a window seat when you make your reservation, but even if you don't get one near the window, the windows are very large and almost anywhere you sit you will have a view of the water and the city horizon. Great food, even better dessert! Order the Brooklyn Bridge dessert if you like chocolate mousse and raspberry. Remember to dress up a little and men, don't forget your blazer. A little pricey but for a special evening (like to celebrate an anniversary with someone you love) the experience is worth it, in my opinion!",5.0

The server places in front of each of us a plate with an egg on it, cracked on top, then pours milk into it. Quizzical subtle glances among us - no idea what it is. My brother takes one for the team and asks how to eat it. Ha, turns out you just spoon it out. It was some sort of granola but not your usual boring breakfast granola - much better. But of course granola is served in an egg! Duh. As for appetizers. I had the seafood trio (shrimp-fabulous-tempura, tuna/avocado delicacy, dumpling), my bro - oysters (this was maybe the one thing I did not enjoy but that probably mostly due to me not being an oysters person), mom - salmon, dad - trout. Excellent.  Had to wait quite a while for our entrees which of course just intensified the anticipation and we were not disappointed. I could not be happier with my choice - branzino with tiny zucchini and ham cubes. Oh My Goodness. Also tried the salmon with mushroom sauce and the duck, which was serviced with sausages and an omelette over a phyllo pastry. Oh My. Again. I think this is what those cooking competition judges must feel like. When the contestants are all excellent. I can be a quick eater, but this time, I just wanted to take my time with each and every single bite to make the most of the taste.Thoroughly enjoyable, definitely worth the price for the right occasion. Would love to go back again of course and hopefully it'll be for dinner. The day view was gorgeous but I'm sure the night one is somethin' else.",5.0
"I've been here twice, and the two times were night and day.My first experience was definitely a two star review.  While the food absolutely knocked it out of the park, the service was unbelievably bad.  I will spare everyone the details, but I will say that i was more than appalled.  To the restaurant's defense, it was an incredibly packed night due to fireworks (fleet week i believe) and the exceptional view of the river/city.But after a chat with the manager and giving the restaurant a second chance (I knew a restaurant with food THAT good couldn't possibly have service THAT bad) i have definitely come around.  The second time around the service was great and food was just as good.  the oysters were delicious, even though i normally hate oysters.  i think a restaurant is truely on a different level when they can make the foods you hate taste great.So overall 4 stars for the amazing food, good service (second time around) and breathtaking views.",4.0
"Amazing view of the city and Brooklyn Bridge, romantic, boat-like setting, and great service. We went around 5:30 in the summertime, so we got to watch the sun setting while we had dinner. Ask for a window seat when you make your reservation, but even if you don't get one near the window, the windows are very large and almost anywhere you sit you will have a view of the water and the city horizon. Great food, even better dessert! Order the Brooklyn Bridge dessert if you like chocolate mousse and raspberry. Remember to dress up a little and men, don't forget your blazer. A little pricey but for a special evening (like to celebrate an anniversary with someone you love) the experience is worth it, in my opinion!",5.0
"I came here for my birthday and had the prix fixe menu for $100. The view of the vast lit-up Manhattan skyline was absolutely gorgeous, which is why I give it 4 stars. The food was good, but not amazing for me. For the price, I expected a little more quality and attention to detail on the food. The view is really what made it an unforgettable experience for me.

"I can't believe I forgot to write a review about the River Cafe, especially since it was one of the best meals I've ever had before.I went in the winter for my birthday brunch, and my boyfriend and I had the luck of getting a table right next to the window on a perfectly clear day. I had a perfectly crafted champagne cocktail, while he had an equally strong gin and tonic. After that, the waiter presents to you granola inside of the shell of a brown egg, and pours milk in an old-school bottle on top, which was beyond delicious. For appetizers, he had the seafood trio, which he loved, and I had a simple but tasty and fresh vegetable salad. For the main course, I had these out-of-this-world waffles and he had an omelette, and each bite was better than the last.And then my most memorable part--the pianist stopped what he was playing and started with Happy Birthday, as my waiter presented me with the famous Brooklyn Bridge chocolate cake, as the restaurant sang. The service was so sweet and not at all pushy, and I'd love to make it a yearly tradition. This place is by no means cheap--brunch was close to $200 for 2 people, but for a special occasion, you really can't go wrong.",5.0
"Wow, what a view!  The most unique setting for fine dining in the area.  Food was good; service was a little spotty for the calibre of the restaurant.  Head waiter made comments about our conversation and other waiters had to hand dishes to some members of our party because of space contraints.  If you are going to charge $50+ for an entree, I think you should be properly served.  But the stunning view does erase some of that pain.$100 for 3 courses with some supplements.  Wine list is manageable.  This place does not give off a snobby vibe.  I would come back to have a drink at the bar and stare at the view.  Perfect spot for romance!",4.0
"River Cafe sits just underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, giving it a breathtaking view for the diners to experience. We came here on a night with a clear sky, so we were able to see the entire night skyline of Manhattan. It was beauuuutiful.With that said, the food wasn't up to my expectations or its price. I've tried restaurants around the same price range, and the food was prepared much better. The appetizers were actually my favorite part of the whole night. I started out with the Scallop Ceviche, and my boyfriend had the Rabbit with Ricotta Dumplings. Mine was very refreshing, and the ricotta dumplings are extremely flavorful. For entree, I ordered the Rack of Lamb and my boyfriend got the Maine Lobster. The lamb was good, but not anything amazing - I've had much better lamb before. It could have been a lot more tender. The Maine Lobster was also pretty ordinary... the texture threw both of us off a bit because it was more on the chewy side. The dessert was very disappointing. I ordered the famed Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge, and the boy ordered Caramelized Apple with Almond Tart. The presentation of the Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge was good, but the cake tasted pretty bad. It wasn't rich or moist or anything good chocolate cake should be. The vanilla ice-cream that came on the side was also unmemorable. The Almond Tart was good, but, like I said before about all the other dishes, nothing special.The servers were all very attentive, and the restaurant actually added a piece of chocolate with ""Happy Anniversary!"" on both our desserts when we told them it was our anniversary, which was a cute touch. (It wasn't actually our anniversary though - we wanted to get seats by the window so we tried to make our night out extra special. It failed.)In the end, I think the price range of this restaurant stems mostly from the location that it sits on. Other than that, it needs to up the quality of the food way more if it wants to be a top top restaurant.",3.0
"Super disappointed. As a local to DUMBO, I stopped by over the weekend to enjoy a snack and cocktail on the patio. When we were sat, it was explained there was a $25 minimum per table, by the host.

"My husband and I had our anniversary dinner here in January. The whole experience was magical.

It just feels like ""Why can't life always be this good!?""  We were lucky to snag a window table for dinner (you can make reservations far in advance for a window table, but not being by the window really does not detract a whole lot from the view or the experience). The food was truly delicious. I had the NY strip steak for a main course and even though I have been to every well regarded steak house in NYC and beyond, the steak at River Cafe was among my top three. I couldn't believe how flavorful and tender it was. The service was 100% impeccable. For desert, I went with the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate thing and it was huge, delicious, crazy cool-looking.

"We did the six course menu tasting that was delicious and the wine pairing was excellent. Each dish was amazing.

For the dessert I loved the Brooklyn bridge cake. The food was excellent A+!The ambiance was very romantic and we saw a beautiful sunset of Manhattan. The one thing that I did not enjoy was that the service once we sat down was terrible at first. The Maitre'd was great, but our waiter did not bring us a menu for quite some time. We sat there for 7 to 10 minutes looking around because there was no menu. We had to ask for a wine menu and about the six course menu tasting. The waiter did not even pay attention to us for the first 30 minutes we were there. We felt that it was because we were one of the younger couples dining that night.

"I had an absolutely wonderful dinner at River Cafe last night with my grandparents. They were visiting Brooklyn as a trip down memory lane and this dinner provided a lovely evening in a perfect setting. The place itself is beautiful, and there is a great novelty of dining in a barge looking out on the lights of lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. The dinner itself was one of the best I've had in New York, but the service did have a few issues.The food - we began with an amuse bouche of white bean soup with pancetta and some sort of green oil (avocado?) which was rich, creemy and smooth. For appetizers, Grandma had the oysters topped with caviar, which are served on a bed of peppercorns - very cute. Grandpa had the 'fois gras served two ways' (as opposed to the other fois gras offering on the menu) which he really enjoyed. I had the lobster tails with blood orange, which were delicious and beautiful. They were a bit tougher than necessary, but I'll forgive that because we weren't done with our drinks when they first tried to serve us, so I think they held the dishes back a few minutes.For entrees, Grandma had the rack of lamb which was great. The mint & mustard seed jus complemented the meat perfectly. Grandpa and I both got the duck breast in truffle honey which was fabulous! Both the duck breast and the croquette of duck leg and potato were a perfect texture. It also came with some baby carrots which were lovely too. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole dish.Dessert was a bit of a let down for me personally. I ordered the 'sticky toffee ice cream sandwich' which really was a sticky toffee cake and also a small ice cream sandwich.  The ice cream sandwich part was very enjoyable but the cake part was too sweet and had a funny texture. It was too spongy on the inside and a bit tough on the outside, making it seem like it had been frozen. However, Grandma's apple tartlet was much better, and Grandpa's chocolate 'Brooklyn Bridge' was the star. It's basically a chocolate mouse cake with hard chocolate bridge shapes on each side - adorable. After the desserts, there were a few little treats for the road which were also quite good.The service was very good for the most part, especially the hostesses who helped us in and out. The table service was good, but their timing was slightly off. They brought the little soups first, then the cocktails, then the bread, then the wine list, which was sort of a funny order. Our actual waiter popped up a few times and started talking, interrupting our conversation rather than waiting for our attention. All in all though, it was a wonderful meal, a wonderful atmosphere and a wonderful setting. I am looking forward to going back some time to watch the sun go down over New York.",5.0
"I am in LOVE with this restaurant. Great ambiance, great food, great view. We made reservations but never requested window seats, however the dining room is small enough so that, window seat or not, you get the best view. We were greeted by the nice lady at the lobby and the Maitre D' seated us within a few minutes. We promptly got our menus, made our order, and then were presented with a complimentary gazpacho. As an appetizer, I ordered the Crab and Coconut Bisque. I'm not a huge fan of coconut but I love crab and it was delicious. For the main course, I had the Branzino Fillet which was good, but not great. My boyfriend's dish though, the Crisp Duck Breast, was phenomenal. The duck was so flavorful and tender! Felt like it was melting in my mouth with every bite. For dessert I, having a very sweet chocolate tooth, had to have the Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge. I honestly loved it but I was so full by then, I only finished about half the bridge!The service was excellent. One guy who came with us was watching his health so he asked the waiter if there was any way he could opt for a healthier dessert. Our waiter spoke to the Maitre D' who asked him if he had any preference - he really just wanted fruits - Maitre D' asked if he was sure if that's all he wanted, then asked the chef to prepare a small fruit salad. Not the biggest request from a patron, but it was a nice favor from everyone there!All in all, $100 a head is really nothing for this place. You're paying for the awesome location, food and view!",5.0
"One of the top five meals I've had in my 28 years on earth.  The views of Manhattan from across the East River were romantic and very classy.  The wait staff was outstanding.  My fiance and I got engaged shortly before dining here, so the host took excellent care of us.  One would think that at one of the best restaurants in the country the staff would be a bit snooty.  However, they were very down to earth and friendly.  We had a great dining experience and can't wait to go back.Oh yeah, and the food is incredible.",5.0

"(Preface:  This place is on my ""Two-Week List,"" in which I list the top twenty restaurants and bars that I'd go to if some soothsayer came up to me and told me that I only had two weeks to live.  Check out the full list on my profile!)This is the ONLY place on my list that I haven't frequented.  (Definitely a special occasion place.)  In fact, I have only been here once, but it was the most memorable meal I have ever had in New York City.  We had friends in town celebrating their ten-year wedding anniversary, so it was truly a special occasion.  We had the chef's signature tasting menu.  Well let me back up -- I'm getting too excited.First, the place is breathtakingly gorgeous.  Picture the most beautiful restaurant of your dreams.  There, that's what it's like.  It's floating, and we had to walk through this breathtaking garden to get in.  Walking through that garden, I felt as if I wasn't in New York City.  I felt as if I wasn't in the same era, even... until I looked across the East River and the entire Manhattan skyline twinkled at me.  (I know it sounds so romanticized.  Honestly, though, this restaurant is just so... PERFECT.)  Upon walking in, we were greeted by a handsomely dressed maitre d', who whisked us to a table right at a floor-to-ceiling window, facing the water and the skyline.  (He insisted that the ladies get the prime view, and made the men sit with their backs to the skyline.  Loved it.)  We ordered two or three rounds of classic drinks:  gins and tonics, dirty martinis, or negronis.  A man was also playing a piano, which provided the perfect background.  Play it, Sam.We then had a round of oysters and wine.  A sommelier came to our table to advise us on what to pair with the oysters, as our waiter listened with rapt.  I loved that.  We followed this up with the chef's signature tasting menu WITH wine pairings.  It was extraordinary.  Every course was to die for.  Every course was my favorite. And the desserts were absolute decadence. This is the place to come for a proposal, a big anniversary, or anything that you want to remember FOREVER.  As I said, it was my most memorable meal in NYC.",5.0
"I heard so many nice things about this place and I had wanted to go there for a long time. Service was nice, the view of Manhattan was gorgeous, and food was good.

The restaurant was very intimate, but you could feel an upscale atmosphere, very New York. The view was AMAZING, the restaurant was virtually in the water.The food was very good, I thought it was kind of expensive, but I attributed it to the atmosphere and view. Surprisingly, we were very full from the 3 course pre fixe meal, I had the foie gras, Ribeye and goat cheesecake. They presented us with complimentary appetizers and chocolates, service was exemplary. Definitely not a place for regular dining, it's good to keep it memorable!Jacket is required btw",5.0

Not the biggest request from a patron, but it was a nice favor from everyone there!All in all, $100 a head is really nothing for this place. You're paying for the awesome location, food and view!",5.0
"One of the top five meals I've had in my 28 years on earth.  The views of Manhattan from across the East River were romantic and very classy.  The wait staff was outstanding.  My fiance and I got engaged shortly before dining here, so the host took excellent care of us.  One would think that at one of the best restaurants in the country the staff would be a bit snooty.  However, they were very down to earth and friendly.  We had a great dining experience and can't wait to go back.Oh yeah, and the food is incredible.",5.0
"River cafe... wow was waiting for this day for a long time. The entrance is filled with beautiful plants and flowers! Staff are courteous.The food was just ok.  However, presentation is what you pay for.The dessert ( brooklyn bridge) looks and taste nice.",3.0
"OK this is a great place. No, a fantastic place. The view is astonishing and the food amazing.The food is great too, especially the foie gras and the wild rock lobster. I think rock lobster is much tastier than the regular Maine lobster. In France it sells for a much higher price than Maine lobster so I highly recommend taking it.I have the duck with worked very well with the truffle honey...The desert is quite fantastic... you HAVE to take the Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge... it's good and soooo cool.",5.0
"(Preface:  This place is on my ""Two-Week List,"" in which I list the top twenty restaurants and bars that I'd go to if some soothsayer came up to me and told me that I only had two weeks to live.  Check out the full list on my profile!)This is the ONLY place on my list that I haven't frequented.  (Definitely a special occasion place.)  In fact, I have only been here once, but it was the most memorable meal I have ever had in New York City.  We had friends in town celebrating their ten-year wedding anniversary, so it was truly a special occasion.  We had the chef's signature tasting menu.  Well let me back up -- I'm getting too excited.First, the place is breathtakingly gorgeous.  Picture the most beautiful restaurant of your dreams.  There, that's what it's like.  It's floating, and we had to walk through this breathtaking garden to get in.  Walking through that garden, I felt as if I wasn't in New York City.  I felt as if I wasn't in the same era, even... until I looked across the East River and the entire Manhattan skyline twinkled at me.  (I know it sounds so romanticized.  Honestly, though, this restaurant is just so... PERFECT.)  Upon walking in, we were greeted by a handsomely dressed maitre d', who whisked us to a table right at a floor-to-ceiling window, facing the water and the skyline.  (He insisted that the ladies get the prime view, and made the men sit with their backs to the skyline.  Loved it.)  We ordered two or three rounds of classic drinks:  gins and tonics, dirty martinis, or negronis.  A man was also playing a piano, which provided the perfect background.  Play it, Sam.We then had a round of oysters and wine.  A sommelier came to our table to advise us on what to pair with the oysters, as our waiter listened with rapt.  I loved that.  We followed this up with the chef's signature tasting menu WITH wine pairings.  It was extraordinary.  Every course was to die for.  Every course was my favorite. And the desserts were absolute decadence. This is the place to come for a proposal, a big anniversary, or anything that you want to remember FOREVER.  As I said, it was my most memorable meal in NYC.",5.0
"I heard so many nice things about this place and I had wanted to go there for a long time. Service was nice, the view of Manhattan was gorgeous, and food was good. But I don't think it was worth what we paid. I felt like half of what we paid was just for the view. It was a nice experience but I don't think I will go back.",3.0
"Once we entered the driveway to the restaurant, my gf breath was taken away with all the flowers in the garden, so beautiful. I thought it was so cool that the restaurant was basically part of the Brooklyn Bridge. Valet was very courteous, and reception was welcoming and took our coats and bags.We came in with our reservation at 8p but wanted window seat, we had to wait until 930 they said, I was fine since we weren't hungry yet, and there was nice area with tables and bartender came around with cocktails. The restaurant was very intimate, but you could feel an upscale atmosphere, very New York. The view was AMAZING, the restaurant was virtually in the water.The food was very good, I thought it was kind of expensive, but I attributed it to the atmosphere and view. Surprisingly, we were very full from the 3 course pre fixe meal, I had the foie gras, Ribeye and goat cheesecake. They presented us with complimentary appetizers and chocolates, service was exemplary. Definitely not a place for regular dining, it's good to keep it memorable!Jacket is required btw",5.0
"My husband took me here for our first year anniversary. It was incredibly romantic, sitting by the window on a stormy night overlooking the river. We had at least 3 different people wait on us, which felt very luxurious.The food was amazing. I basically licked my plate clean each time. The best part was the dessert - they brought out my hot souffle with a candle and a little ""Happy Anniversary"" sign written on dark chocolate. It was a perfect evening and I would totally recommend this restaurant for anniversaries, birthdays, or any special occasion.",5.0
"My husband and I were given a $350 gift certificate to River Cafe and we went last night. We had a good time, but if I were you, I would spend my money elsewhere. Here's what we enjoyed: The view is beautiful, and so is the restaurant. The atmosphere was lovely, and the service was excellent. They do actually have some reasonably priced, good wines on their list, which I wasn't expecting. My appetizer was wonderful (baked buffalo mozzarella with currants and ine nuts). My husband's rack of lamb was excellent and my fillet of turbot was really good. We enjoyed the port tasting dessert.Here's why I only give it three stars: All the food is prix fixe - I think it was $98 a person for an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. All the entrees are basically small portions of fancy protein with no sides. It was simply not enough food for that much money. My husband's rabbit dumpling appetizer was unimpressive.Bottom line: You're paying a lot extra for the view, the service and the atmosphere. Maybe that's worth it to you. I'm sure it would impress your date. But me and my husband would rather spend a third of that money and have a full plate of food for dinner.",3.0
"The bottom line: Excellent food, amazing views of Manhattan, top notch service, a very memorable evening - pricy and worth it. ----------My friend and I were lucky to snag a highly coveted window seat. I was fortunate to have a concierge at a luxury hotel make my reservation and introduction. We were treated like royalty. I timed our arrival so that we had ample time to see the sun set over Manhattan. The weather was clear and mild and the view was absolutely spectacular. The food was delicious and the presentation beautiful but frankly I can't recall what we had but I'll never forget the view or the evening. This is an expensive treat that is worth every penny. If you're looking for a romantic and memorable evening you won't be disappointed.  Good luck snagging a window table though.  In all fairness, the view is spectacular from almost any table.",5.0
"Fantastic!Our server, Josh, took great care of us-- above and beyond.  He ordered extra desserts and tastes for us, because I wondered what the buttermilk sorbet tasted like.  We also received their pumpkin pie as a ""birthday"" surprise!!Great views of the NY skyline and Brooklyn Bridge at night.  Well worth paying the price of the meal.  If we had it to do all over again, we'd probably bring our own wine and pay corkage-- if it's an option.  That was the only thing that bulked up the price of our meal a little beyond expectation. At $90 for a three-course prix fixe, it seemed ""fair.""  But after ordering two bottles of Veuve Clicquot ($120 each) and a bottle of water, somehow our tab inflated to almost $650 + for 4.  With tip, we paid $800+.One of the most expensive meals I've had in my lifetime, but again, well worth it.If anyone is looking for a place to get engaged, this is it!Warning: Men must wear jackets.  No jeans allowed.",5.0

I loved the way that they put lemon ice in a lemon shell and you can eat your oyster with the lemon ice. The crab meat was ok, but it did get points for being creative as it was added in thai basil. Mom had sirloin for entree and I ordered rainbow trout (an appetizer) for entree. The sirloin came in a decent size with french fries. Both were tasty. The rainbow trout was smoked with interesting decoration (you can see it yourself in the picture). For dessert, we shared the brooklyn bridge. The bridge was made of a chocolate cake which was on the sweet side (that was why I did not give it a 5 star). The hazelnut icecream was really yummy.

I had to admit I was fairly disappointed because we were celebrating our anniversary. Regardless, the view was still nice. We got to see the sunset.My most memorable dish was the lobster tails. For an appetizer you get a good chunk of lobster. I almost got full just from that. I also ordered the branzino which I didn't like. It was a very small portion and there was nothing special about it. My bf ordered the sirlon and it was too charred and too rare for him. The waitstaff was very professional and courteous.

"Most of my first visit to River Cafe was pretty enjoyable. The food was great and the location can't be beat of course. This review mostly has to do with the service. I had taken my fiance there for her birthday, and neither of us drink alcohol. I have been to a number of upscale restaurants (Daniel, Bathahazar, Maze) around town and sometimes notice this effect, but it was particularly strong here. We essentially felt ignored because we didn't drink, which i understand is how these establishments make their money and I'm fine with that, just not with discrimination because I have a slightly lower tab (hell..i'm still paying 250 bucks to eat..doesn't mean I should be ignored). Everyone around us who was drinking got their dishes placed by the head waiter and had them described in detail and they got very attentive service. We got our dishes sort of plopped down by the wait staff with no fanfare or anything like that. Other things felt very slow (ie even slower than you usually expect for a nice fancy experience)Again, I understand that you're making less money from me sitting there, but at least be upfront about how I should expect lesser service in comparison to everyone else because I choose not to drink. I doubt I'll be returning to this place any time soon.",2.0
"I gather that the River Cafe is a New York institution - it was pointed out on our boat trip. From the water, it doesn't look like much but from the proper entrance, you can understand why.The River Cafe sits in the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge with the most amazing view of the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan across the east river. It has huge windows looking out over that view and every table in the restaurant can enjoy that view. It looks especially wonderful at sunset and at night when the lights come on.The food is definitely fine dining in the evening and the quality of cooking matches its vaunted location. I enjoyed exemplary sauteed foie gras and prime aged sirloin steak. For dessert, I couldn't resist the kitsch chocolate Brooklyn Bridge!Definitely a destination restaurant and at the risk of making it a cliche, an ideal place to propose.",5.0

"Treated my girlfriend to birthday brunch here, was a beautiful event. I easily can recommend this place for a special event -- beautiful location, well prepared menu, reliable service.The brunch menu is $55, 2-course fixed price. Paired with champagne and a dessert to share, the bill was expensive, but this is one of those iconic (albeit one of only 3 michelin star restaurants in Brooklyn) locations that you can pay a little more to enjoy.The atmosphere was super classy -- beautiful autumnal florals in the main area and adorning the entrance, piano player throughout the meal, GORGEOUS views.Certainly a ""must do once"" kind of place.",4.0

Not to mention is suited to anyone-a date, a parent, a benefactor-EVERYONE.My favorite entree was the Brazino- prepared to perfection and a savorily after taste. There Sauterne wine is also incredible-no need for a traditional dessert.Lastly-come classy or you will definitely appear like an outcast here.Now you officially have the supreme touch!",4.0
"Most of my first visit to River Cafe was pretty enjoyable. The food was great and the location can't be beat of course. This review mostly has to do with the service. I had taken my fiance there for her birthday, and neither of us drink alcohol. I have been to a number of upscale restaurants (Daniel, Bathahazar, Maze) around town and sometimes notice this effect, but it was particularly strong here. We essentially felt ignored because we didn't drink, which i understand is how these establishments make their money and I'm fine with that, just not with discrimination because I have a slightly lower tab (hell..i'm still paying 250 bucks to eat..doesn't mean I should be ignored). Everyone around us who was drinking got their dishes placed by the head waiter and had them described in detail and they got very attentive service. We got our dishes sort of plopped down by the wait staff with no fanfare or anything like that. Other things felt very slow (ie even slower than you usually expect for a nice fancy experience)Again, I understand that you're making less money from me sitting there, but at least be upfront about how I should expect lesser service in comparison to everyone else because I choose not to drink. I doubt I'll be returning to this place any time soon.",2.0
"I gather that the River Cafe is a New York institution - it was pointed out on our boat trip. From the water, it doesn't look like much but from the proper entrance, you can understand why.The River Cafe sits in the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge with the most amazing view of the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan across the east river. It has huge windows looking out over that view and every table in the restaurant can enjoy that view. It looks especially wonderful at sunset and at night when the lights come on.The food is definitely fine dining in the evening and the quality of cooking matches its vaunted location. I enjoyed exemplary sauteed foie gras and prime aged sirloin steak. For dessert, I couldn't resist the kitsch chocolate Brooklyn Bridge!Definitely a destination restaurant and at the risk of making it a cliche, an ideal place to propose.",5.0
Great view of the Brooklyn Bridge.  Food is delicious and wonderful atmosphere!They do a six course menu tasting with wine pairing that is incredible!,4.0
"Treated my girlfriend to birthday brunch here, was a beautiful event. I easily can recommend this place for a special event -- beautiful location, well prepared menu, reliable service.The brunch menu is $55, 2-course fixed price. Paired with champagne and a dessert to share, the bill was expensive, but this is one of those iconic (albeit one of only 3 michelin star restaurants in Brooklyn) locations that you can pay a little more to enjoy.The atmosphere was super classy -- beautiful autumnal florals in the main area and adorning the entrance, piano player throughout the meal, GORGEOUS views.Certainly a ""must do once"" kind of place.",4.0
"It didn't need to have amazing food, not when it has this view.  And it doesn't have that, but it does have very good food, much better than it needs, and much better than you'd expect.  Coupled with the view and you get an outstanding restaurant.",4.0
"Dining at The River Cafe was one of my most memorable experiences in NY. Here's why: when I ordered my main dish, I asked for a side of broccoli. The waiter kindly told me they did not have any that night. When my meal arrived, there was a side of broccoli and the waiter said, ""We had someone run out to the local grocer and get some for you""!!!The food was amazing, the ambience was breathtaking, and the service was impeccable. Truly an unforgettable experience.",5.0
"Ambiance, view, service, food all excellent.  This has the most amazing view of Manhattan, especially at night.Everything is a fixed price and comes with Appetizer, Main Course, and Dessert for $100.  If you want the 6 course Chef's signature menu it's $125.WHAT WE ORDERED:  - Sauteed Hudson Valley Foie Gras: sauteed with roasted apple in a cider reduction and candied pistachio.  Served with french toast.  Seared foie gras is truly the best way to eat it.  The sweetness of the reduction makes a nice charred crust on top.  This blissfully melts in your mouth like rib eye butter.  - Wild Rock Lobster (small lobster): Two roasted tails on top of thin slivers of mango with a pool of citrusy fennel, lemon olive oil sauce.  Very very moist and tender.  Perfectly cooked.  Complimented well with the mango and citrus sauce.  - Colorado Rack of Lamb: Huge pieces of lamb, seared with a nice crust.  Very tender and flavorful.  This is apparently one of the most popular dishes.    - New York Cut Sirloin: everything that a NY steak should be.  Cooked well, seared.  One pound of meat dry aged.  The russet and sweet potato gratin with blue cheese fondue tasted like a cheesy potato au gratin.  The gratin is served in an escargot platter.  - Caramelized Apple ~ Almond Tart: thinly sliced apples over a layer of fragipane (almond paste & butter) on puff pastry with a side of vanilla ice cream and green apple sorbet.  It's like the inside of a bear claw with apple and caramel.  So buttery, flaky, and went really well with the ice cream and sorbet.An enchanting and romantic dinner setting.  Definitely worth it for those special occasions.",5.0

"River Cafe has been my fancy next-door neighbor for almost two years (and is where I tell cab drivers I'm going, since none of them have heard of my street), but for some strange reason I'd never eaten there until Friday.  What on earth could that reason be?  Oh wait, I think I've got it.  $98 pp for 3 courses.  Thank heaven for Restaurant Week, no?  If there's ever a place to go for RW it's River Cafe, because, as NY Mag put it, it's not like they take away the view just because it's RW.  Now, the view (a stunning panorama of the BK Bridge and lower Manhattan) isn't so much the draw for me, since it's the same view I have from my roof, but it's still breathtaking nonetheless.  And even though River Cafe is only 30 years old, it feels like New York circa 1940--white-coated waiters, little lamps on the table, about four different people to greet you and show you to your table--I love this stuff.  Classic and classy, but not pretentious.  Sometimes when you go to a restaurant for RW they offer you a crappy, scaled down prix fixe menu where you suspect your dinner was created out of the scraps from last week's staff meals.  Not the case at River Cafe!    The inimitable Kaelea A and I had a choice of 4 delicious-sounding (and tasting!) appetizers and 3 drool-worthy entrees, and for dessert we didn't have to choose, because each person automatically got a DESSERT TASTING of creme brulee, chocolate mousse cake and peach sorbet (see pics).  Holy cow!  This is my kind of place.I'm now thinking that I should have started frequenting River Cafe the second I moved here--you know, get in with the bartenders, make friends,  play the neighbor card whenever I need a hard-to-get resy--and then maybe I'd be able to get a little of that $98 shaved off the top when it's not Restaurant Week.  Or at least a comp'd BK Bridge cake.",4.0

"Totally forgot to write a review for this place. Came here in the winter time and OMG I was blown away by the view once I walked in. I almost cried because I forgot to bring my camera. Anyway, I don't remember what night I came on, but it was definitely a weeknight. Came with a group of 10 people and were seated right away. I guess the only complaint was that we were right next to the kitchen where all the servers were coming in and out.So we ordered two bottles of Rose to start with. For those of you who don't know, the dinner is a pre-fixe menu @ $100 per person. Our group ordered different things and I couldn't help but pick at everyone's food. I ordered the pear salad, which was good. Except, I'm not a big fan of goat cheese, but at a hundred bucks per person, it's hard to go wrong with anything on that menu.For entree, I ordered the crisp duck breast. Now being Chinese, I'm use to eating those roast ducks hanging in front of the windows in Chinatown. I must warn that the River Cafe does not prepare well done ducks. I did see that they left it a little pink in the center. Anyway, I gave it a try and it was actually pretty yummy. Very juicy and tender. I also had a taste of the steak, which was okay, but I would probably prefer Peter Luger when it comes to that department. For me, the Branzino, which was sea bass was a win. While the menu does not state, the dish is breaded and fried, but it was still awesome.As for dessert, I ordered the caramelized apple tart AND the chocolate marquis brooklyn bridge. I wasn't paying, so I decided to be greedy. I loved the caramelized apple tart for its taste and the chocolate marquis for its presentation. But you can't go wrong with either one.So the bill ended up to be around.... probably $1500??? for the entire table with complimentary chocolates at the end. AND FINALLY...  go for the view. Go for the food. Go for the excellent service. Oh, did I mention go for the view? :)",4.0

"The River Cafe, underneath the Brooklyn Bridge with a front-row view of Manhattan's skyline, is what Tavern on the Green wishes it had been before ingloriously filing for bankruptcy: a quintessential New York experience, including great service, food and a view unlike any other in the city.  Also, unlike Tavern, it wasn't filled with midwestern tourists or elementary school birthday parties.The lady and I had the 6-course tasting menu ($125 pp) as our Valentine's 2k11 celebration (that's 4 in a row!) last night and overall I was very pleased with the experience.  It's not the kind of place you would go regularly (price, location, ambiance) but for a special occasion it's worth doing at least once.COURSE 1: TAYLOR BAY SCALLOP CEVICHENice presentation, with ceviched scallops being served along with a chilled tomato and light gazpacho in a half shell, but the scallops themselves were flavorless.  The tomato was interesting but this was probably my least favorite dish of the meal (which made me nervous as we began).COURSE 2: WILD ROCK LOBSTERNow we're on track.  Pretty straightforward presentation of a lobster tail with mango, lemon and fennel.  Lots of meat - a winner.COURSE 3: BRANZINO FILLETIn my opinion, the best part of the meal.  This was a total home run: perfectly cooked baby sea bass layered with chorizo and shrimp, covered with a thin, toasted brioche surrounded by bits of tomato and zucchini.  Felt like eating super delicious and expensive comfort food. Loved it.COURSE 4: SAUTEED HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRASThe fact that some people want to outlaw foie gras is so abhorrent to me that I can scarcely believe that their protest is real and not just some Wes Craven horror fantasy.  This wasn't the best foie gras I've ever had (Cyrus wins that, by a landslide) but it did the trick.  One thing the restaurant did which I could have lived without was to fill the brioche with a roasted apple filling and treat the whole thing as a french toast.  Mushy and not awesome.COURSE 5: NEW YORK CUT SIRLOINThree just-over-bite-sized cuts of sirloin.  Sort of tough, very meh.  Served with a mushroom marmalade in a red wine reduction that was actually very nice.  Could have done with a dish that featured those mushrooms instead of the steak.COURSE 6: DESSERTFor dessert I had the coffee parfait with caramel chantilly.  The parfait was nice but the chantilly was way, way too strong.  Think of a bittersweet caramel you've had and then multiply the intensity by 1,000 - you're now almost imagining the intensity of this stuff.  My girlfriend had the goat cheese cheesecake which was a better choice.",4.0

It's one of a kind and they are true professionals at pulling off a memorable evening.If you're thinking of the River Cafe for your wedding, feel free to contact me through Yelp for some tips.",5.0
"All in ONEFood, location, view, decor, music, staff, wine selection, atmosphereMy dinner at The River Cafe few months ago ranks as my most romantic and highly memorable gourmet experience in NYC ( I know I know it is actually in BK) so far. I always used to stop by for a drink at the bar during the day when I had friends in town. But I knew one day for a special occasion with special someone I will show up for dinner in LBD :o)I had the Foie Gras two ways complimented by Sauternes wine which was absolutely divine. The way it all melted in your mouth and hit all of the taste butts including those you though you don't even have was out off this world. Followed by white truffle honey and fennel pollen glaze, duck leg and potato croquette, organic carrots, julienne bok choy. Yes, you guess it right - it was extraordinary. To finish the great meal in proper way we did order the famous Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge handmade chocolate with a terrine of toasted hazelnut and Tahitian vanilla ice cream. Hmmm, hmmm let in your mouth for a bit so all the flavors have a chance to show the proper chocolate dance for you.WIth a wonderful bottle of red, smooth piano music in background, gorgeous  views of Manhattan in near distance and the best company one can ever ask for this ranks as to of the top. Go and fall in love.",5.0
"This is a restaurant that we kept going back to on very special occasions when we lived in New York for almost six years.It's a very classy romantic setting, the live piano playing and Jacket Required atmosphere setting a finishing touch for the very impressive view to Brooklyn Bridge and Lower Manhattan skyline over East River.The food is exceptional. You have to get a full menu, which will bring your total for the evening to ca $300 with wine (that is after taxes and tips). But for a very special occasion it is worth it. We used to go there for anniversaries and such.If you are looking for a very special dinner in NYC, I can highly recommend The River Cafe!",5.0

"Took my husband here for his birthday ... though the view was romantic (and we had a great time walking the brooklyn bridge to get there), there are so many other restaurants around that have MUCH better food at the same price (or less), so we will not be back. We did the tasting:Highlights: Scallop ceviche, Hudson valley foie gras, drinks (good pours) OK: Branzino (the fish was not the star of this dish...lemon and chorizo overpowered)Meh:Wild Rock Lobster (rubbery, no butter??), Brooklyn Bridge Dessert (we didnt finish it--that NEVER happens. very bland!!) Terrible: Sirloin (VERY dry!!) The pacing was slow ... took over 3 hours to do 6 courses, and we never knew who our waiter really was. When it all came down to it, we really didnt feel like a 20% tip was deserved. Bottom line: Great view, but for good food for a special occasion, head to a place like Le Bernadin or Eleven Madison Park.",3.0
"Abundance of five-star reviews of this awful restaurant makes me wonder--was it just we who were singled out to receive a service that is a stuff of nightmares? Are my taste buds incapable of picking up the subtle flavors of this restaurant's food? But let's start ab ovo. For his birthday, I decided to give my boyfriend the time of his life by bringing him to this famously romantic restaurant, and made a reservation well in advance. It was February, the landscape outside resembled an Agata Kristie crime scene, and it seemed that everyone but us was hopelessly snowed in. After arriving to the mostly deserted restaurant, we approached the Maitre 'D and immidiately offended him by our existence. Never in his life has he imagined seating such plebes! Averting his gaze, he carried on his phone conversation. Mere 15 minutes later, he realized that we were still there, pestilent in our insistence to be served.  Before we even knew it, the birthday boy and I became the only customers who were not seated by the window, which made us feel extra special. Maitre 'D even managed to take our order despite the waves of  violent nausea he clearly experienced in our presence. After expressing surprise that even a person of such low class as I could pronounce the word ""chablis"" correctly (I practiced for hours in front of the mirror well in advance!), he disappeared for another 30 minutes. Of course, a mere half an hour is not enough to recover from being exposed to the foul masses, which is probably why, when the Maitre 'D appeared with our wine, he had a case of halitosis that could make a grown man cry. The culinary artistry of the River Cafe's chef was wasted on us proletarians. Dishes seemed bland and greasy to our unsophisticated palates, but at least the portions were small. In any case, who cares about the food in a presence of such a great man--and such a formidable case of halitosis? Upon mercifully accepting our filthy money--$300, to be exact--Maitre 'D handed my boyfriend the filthy rags that we tried to pass off as coats, holding them with two  manicured fingers.In short, before going to the River Cafe, ask yourself--are you good enough? Does your apartment smell of rich mahogany? If the answer is anything less than a resounding ""yes"", spare yourself the humiliation of being put in your place.",1.0

"The River Cafe is my favorite upscale restaurant in all of New York.  I have been several times and have had a delicious meal and fantastic service every single time.  First, I love to walk through the garden right outside.  In the summer, it's a peaceful place to sit and relax for a few minutes in the shade surrounded by beautiful flowers.  As you enter the restaurant, you are again surrounded by the most beautiful flowers (the restaurant has a full-time gardener!) and you feel as though you're on a ship almost (because you kind of are).  You're quickly whisked away to the dining room which has a breathtaking view of the water and lower manhattan.  Even the flower arrangements on the table are breathtaking.  And the food!  I always get the tuna tartare appetizer, and my favorite entree is the duck.  There is also a lovely chocolate dessert in the shape of the brooklyn bridge that I love.  It's such a special place!  My advice is to go for lunch when you can enjoy a lovely meal for a little less. In fact, love this place so much that I even considered having a very small wedding here.  Now if that's not a vote of confidence, I don't know what is!",5.0

"We got dressed up.  Him in a suit.  Me in a cocktail dress (and flip-flops, damn sprained ankle).  It was his birthday and we were going all out.We took a car - cause that is how fancy people travel.  We walked in past the forest of fresh flowers and my heart leaped a little.  This was going to be one hell of an evening.We were seated promptly and given the chicken salad that everyone raves about on yelp.  We looked out the window and gazed at our lovely city.  We had timed it perfectly - it was still light when we arrived and we got to watch the evening settle along the water and the lights of Manhattan turn on.Back inside things were going well. We felt classy.  We ordered cocktails.  Fois Gras arrived (omg get the fois gras sauteed, I don't even like fois gras and I loved this.)  My scallops were refreshing.  We ordered a bottle of wine.  Our conversation got a bit louder.  The tables around us filled up.  The couple next to us planning their wedding left (and thank god because who really cares which shade of purple flowers she orders.)Our entrees arrived.  Branzino and duck which were both heavenly and far too much for us to finish because we both knew what was coming.  The tour de force.  The reason for coming to the River Cafe.  The Brooklyn Bridge chocolate construction.  And oh was it worth the calories.  And then the best part of the evening.  A woman who had clearly dragged her boyfriend to dinner sat down next to us.  He bitched that he didn't understand anything on the menu.  She told him to sit up straighter, to let her order, to stop whining and promised to get him a big mac on the way home.  The waiter bargained with him that if he didn't like the fois gras he would get him something else.  And this schmoo said, oh I might like it- I just can't handle the idea of it. And yet, five minutes later the sauteed fois gras was in front of him and we watched as he ate it in three bites.  Then we took our drunk-stuffed-selves home.",5.0

"WOW. This is place for special occasions. The service is great, the food was wonderful and they don't skimp on the portions or extras, and the view is one of a kind. My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary here this past weekend. Her brother had got us a gift certificate to cover a dinner for 2 (which in itself is a great idea for a wedding gift - it takes the stress out of picking a place for your anniversary). I timed my reservation for sunset, but I was a little displeased that I couldn't request a window seat ahead of time even for our anniversary (in hind sight, everyone there is probably celebrating something special so they wouldn't be able to accommodate each request.) We were seated one table away from the window and could still fully appreciate the view. All of the seats are pretty  good as this is a long and narrow restaurant along the waterline. The wait staff was very friendly, informative, and attentive. There was a lot of table side service and presentation. The walk to River Cafe is magical in itself in that you are slowly approaching the enormous base of the Brooklyn Bridge and then you spot this lush, beautiful garden out of no where. I would recommend coming early to take it all in and enjoy the experience. This is a leisurely, romantic dinner. We were there for over 2 hours - we did not feel rushed nor were we waiting for some to take our order or bring our next course. It's really nice to slow down. On to the food. We were greeted with a small gazpacho which was great and a watermelon medallion with shaved feta and mint amuse bouche that was perfect since it was 90 degrees outside that day. My wife started with the foie gras 2 ways - they give you 2 good sized portions (either of the 2 pieces ran larger than any foie gras I have ordered in restaurants in the past.) They were both fantastic - buttery and perfect. I had the Waygu beef tartare with quail egg - it comes out deconstructed and ""constructed"" at your table. I wish I could have tasted the bare beef before the egg, Cognac gelée, mustard, chives, caper puree, and who knows what else was mixed in; however, it was great as is too. For the main I had the lobster special which was tail and claws (de-shelled) over a tasty tamali. Dont get me wrong, it was great, but I wasn't blown away like with everything else.  My wife had the New York sirloin with sweet potato gratin with blue cheese fondue. WOW. Thank God this thing was a pound or we probably would have fought over it and the newly wed stage would have some to an abrupt end.  For dessert we split the goat cheese cheesecake (not too rich, severed with a tart lemon sorbet - more like a great lemon ice) and the peach souffle also served with ice cream (I love how a lot of the desserts come with ice cream which I believe they get from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory next door which makes me love it even more.) I believe their were also some petite fours but my selective instincts steered me away from these to save room for the ordered desserts. I was already stuffed from the apps and entree. Our severe also brought out a small plate with candles and a thin chocolate with happy anniversary written on it along with Earl Grey and toffee chocolates. A nice touchAll in all this was a great dinner that made our anniversary very special. I was all smiles during and painfully satiated afterwards (Note - you might feel to sexy after this meal.) It was also the most we've ever spent on a meal but we both felt that considering the location, the service, the food quality and portion sizes, dollar for dollar it was totally worth it - it's just a matter of finding those dollars and for that we are very grateful for our wedding gift.",5.0

It offers the same view of the city that never sleeps straight ahead, and lady liberty to the left.When you go, make sure to take note of the World Renown Jazz Pianist, Dom Salvadore. Drop him a buck and ask him to play ""Under My Skin"" for me.We loved this restaurant so much we had our wedding reception there, and go back each time we are in the city.",5.0
"The River Cafe is my favorite upscale restaurant in all of New York.  I have been several times and have had a delicious meal and fantastic service every single time.  First, I love to walk through the garden right outside.  In the summer, it's a peaceful place to sit and relax for a few minutes in the shade surrounded by beautiful flowers.  As you enter the restaurant, you are again surrounded by the most beautiful flowers (the restaurant has a full-time gardener!) and you feel as though you're on a ship almost (because you kind of are).  You're quickly whisked away to the dining room which has a breathtaking view of the water and lower manhattan.  Even the flower arrangements on the table are breathtaking.  And the food!  I always get the tuna tartare appetizer, and my favorite entree is the duck.  There is also a lovely chocolate dessert in the shape of the brooklyn bridge that I love.  It's such a special place!  My advice is to go for lunch when you can enjoy a lovely meal for a little less. In fact, love this place so much that I even considered having a very small wedding here.  Now if that's not a vote of confidence, I don't know what is!",5.0
"One excellent place to relax and enjoy a great meal with someone special!It has a great view , looking over the Hudson river,which makes it even more attractive in my eyes.The food and drinks were superb, top class, as you would expect from such a place.The staff are great, and so is the service. It is advisable to book in advance, and dress smart, it is a relatively expensive place but it worth it , for the view, the food and the atmosphere.Save it for a special occasion!",5.0
"We got dressed up.  Him in a suit.  Me in a cocktail dress (and flip-flops, damn sprained ankle).  It was his birthday and we were going all out.We took a car - cause that is how fancy people travel.  We walked in past the forest of fresh flowers and my heart leaped a little.  This was going to be one hell of an evening.We were seated promptly and given the chicken salad that everyone raves about on yelp.  We looked out the window and gazed at our lovely city.  We had timed it perfectly - it was still light when we arrived and we got to watch the evening settle along the water and the lights of Manhattan turn on.Back inside things were going well. We felt classy.  We ordered cocktails.  Fois Gras arrived (omg get the fois gras sauteed, I don't even like fois gras and I loved this.)  My scallops were refreshing.  We ordered a bottle of wine.  Our conversation got a bit louder.  The tables around us filled up.  The couple next to us planning their wedding left (and thank god because who really cares which shade of purple flowers she orders.)Our entrees arrived.  Branzino and duck which were both heavenly and far too much for us to finish because we both knew what was coming.  The tour de force.  The reason for coming to the River Cafe.  The Brooklyn Bridge chocolate construction.  And oh was it worth the calories.  And then the best part of the evening.  A woman who had clearly dragged her boyfriend to dinner sat down next to us.  He bitched that he didn't understand anything on the menu.  She told him to sit up straighter, to let her order, to stop whining and promised to get him a big mac on the way home.  The waiter bargained with him that if he didn't like the fois gras he would get him something else.  And this schmoo said, oh I might like it- I just can't handle the idea of it. And yet, five minutes later the sauteed fois gras was in front of him and we watched as he ate it in three bites.  Then we took our drunk-stuffed-selves home.",5.0
"Finally got my chance to try River Cafe during Dine-In Brooklyn!  For $20.11, we got a 3 course lunch, which was a complete steal.  The view is as gorgeous as everyone says -- but honestly you could get the same view sitting on the adjacent pier.  I was more impressed with the food!  The portions are small (as to be expected with such a nice restaurant), but beautifully presented.  Service was the kind where you don't notice the waiters, but magically your water glass is always full.  The best part was...they didn't rush us in the least as my friends and I lingered over coffee to catch up.  River Cafe goes to show that Brooklyn can hold its own with fine dining!",5.0
"WOW. This is place for special occasions. The service is great, the food was wonderful and they don't skimp on the portions or extras, and the view is one of a kind. My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary here this past weekend. Her brother had got us a gift certificate to cover a dinner for 2 (which in itself is a great idea for a wedding gift - it takes the stress out of picking a place for your anniversary). I timed my reservation for sunset, but I was a little displeased that I couldn't request a window seat ahead of time even for our anniversary (in hind sight, everyone there is probably celebrating something special so they wouldn't be able to accommodate each request.) We were seated one table away from the window and could still fully appreciate the view. All of the seats are pretty  good as this is a long and narrow restaurant along the waterline. The wait staff was very friendly, informative, and attentive. There was a lot of table side service and presentation. The walk to River Cafe is magical in itself in that you are slowly approaching the enormous base of the Brooklyn Bridge and then you spot this lush, beautiful garden out of no where. I would recommend coming early to take it all in and enjoy the experience. This is a leisurely, romantic dinner. We were there for over 2 hours - we did not feel rushed nor were we waiting for some to take our order or bring our next course. It's really nice to slow down. On to the food. We were greeted with a small gazpacho which was great and a watermelon medallion with shaved feta and mint amuse bouche that was perfect since it was 90 degrees outside that day. My wife started with the foie gras 2 ways - they give you 2 good sized portions (either of the 2 pieces ran larger than any foie gras I have ordered in restaurants in the past.) They were both fantastic - buttery and perfect. I had the Waygu beef tartare with quail egg - it comes out deconstructed and ""constructed"" at your table. I wish I could have tasted the bare beef before the egg, Cognac gelée, mustard, chives, caper puree, and who knows what else was mixed in; however, it was great as is too. For the main I had the lobster special which was tail and claws (de-shelled) over a tasty tamali. Dont get me wrong, it was great, but I wasn't blown away like with everything else.  My wife had the New York sirloin with sweet potato gratin with blue cheese fondue. WOW. Thank God this thing was a pound or we probably would have fought over it and the newly wed stage would have some to an abrupt end.  For dessert we split the goat cheese cheesecake (not too rich, severed with a tart lemon sorbet - more like a great lemon ice) and the peach souffle also served with ice cream (I love how a lot of the desserts come with ice cream which I believe they get from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory next door which makes me love it even more.) I believe their were also some petite fours but my selective instincts steered me away from these to save room for the ordered desserts. I was already stuffed from the apps and entree. Our severe also brought out a small plate with candles and a thin chocolate with happy anniversary written on it along with Earl Grey and toffee chocolates. A nice touchAll in all this was a great dinner that made our anniversary very special. I was all smiles during and painfully satiated afterwards (Note - you might feel to sexy after this meal.) It was also the most we've ever spent on a meal but we both felt that considering the location, the service, the food quality and portion sizes, dollar for dollar it was totally worth it - it's just a matter of finding those dollars and for that we are very grateful for our wedding gift.",5.0
"Came for a wedding, so imagine decadence upon decadence. I won't be adding anything new as I believe everyone is aware of the excellent service, high caliber food, and unsurpassed view. That being said, the wedding party was small, intimate, and adults-only - I'm not sure if there were children present whether the ambiance would have been as elegant and refined. Also, the temperature could have been better regulated in the tent and dining area. I would come again in a heartbeat.",5.0
"Michelin madness continues with a visit to this newly minted 1-star restaurant right on the waterfront in Brooklyn.  The view of the Manhattan skyline is gorgeous.  Unfortunately, it seems to distract most people, including reviewers, from the lackluster quality of the food.  I had a three course meal that began with the Maine sea scallop and lobster chowder.  They describe this on the menu as including lobster cream, poached scallopS, russet potato, leeks, fresh herbs, and coral.  Note the ""s"" on scallops.  In truth, there was about one third of a single scallop in this soup.  A similar sized piece of lobster was also included.  Both were fresh and flavorful, but noticeably small.  The potato was about 3-4 dice.  The broth was poured tableside, but the effect was lost given the comically small portion size.  I found the chowder to generally be good, but there simply was not enough of it to really remember its essence.  What it was successful in doing was making me very hungry for my entree.For the entree I had the slow smoked pork shoulder.  This was single handedly the most ill-conceived dish I ever had in a Michelin starred restaurant.  Allow me to take you through it.  The smoked pork recalled almost immediately a flavor from my childhood:  sloppy joes.  This not exactly a good thing in fine dining.  Worse, the dish had blood oranges in it which punctuated it with bursts of citrus.  So, more properly, it was like eating sloppy joes with orange juice.  Not to be outdone, there were ricotta dumplings in the dish.  So, sloppy joes, orange juice, and melted cheese.  If that is not ill-conceived, I don't know what is.  The flavors clearly did not meld together to create something greater than its parts.  Just regrettable.  It was the only time I seriously considered sending a dish back in a restaurant for the simple reason of being terrible.  I labored through it though.  That aside, a restaurant of this caliber absolutely should be able to stand by all of its dishes.  Moving on to dessert, I had a trio that included creme brulee banana bread pudding, coconut sorbet with a coconut chip, and milk chocolate ganache with candied coco nibs.  Of note was the portion size.  For some reason this dish was very large.  In fact, it was larger than the appetizer and the entree put together.  Strange.  Each dessert was decent.  I thought the sorbet had a nice, subtle coconut flavor.  The banana pudding was a little dense, but I like the contrast the creme brulee on top provided.  The ganache was overstated though as it was mostly a hyped up dollop of chocolate pudding in need of a sieve.  The service was functional and mostly okay.  I was put off though when the dessert was brought out and quickly placed before us, with the server quickly walking off.  That is to say, there was no explanation of anything being presented, even though that was done with several other patrons near us.  This was a curious lapse for a Michelin rated place, but otherwise the service was efficient and at times genial.  Over all, it is quite clear to me that the main draw here is the view.  The food simply could not hold up to any scrutiny.  Given the price point here, I could not recommend this place, save for a drink at the bar while waiting on a reservation elsewhere.",2.0

"Ambiance? 5. Service? 5. Flavor? Ehh..The appetizers were definitely the best part of the meal. I ordered the rabbit and dumplings: SIMPLY EXQUISITE! if you've never tried rabbit before, you should! For the entree, I ordered the lobster, which was recommended by my server. When I received it, the lobster was much smaller than I had anticipated, it was a tad overcooked as the meat was a bit on the rubbery side, and both the citrus vinaigrette and taro puree were not strong enough of flavors to compliment the lobster. I did enjoy the bits of grapefruit, but overall, an over-cooked lobster totally ruined it for me. The dessert was also sort of bland. The Brooklyn Bridge dessert is quite a piece of art, but my compliments stop there. The Caramelized Apple and Almond Tart was good, but not Yelp's $$$$ status good.The ambiance and service alone made the trip unforgettable and something I do not regret, but the lobster was just too dissappointing.",3.0

"Jackets required. That's when you know it's legit. This is the perfect place for a nice night out. The view is incredible - right under the Brooklyn Bridge with a picturesque view of downtown. The restaurant itself is on the water, tucked away from the street and surrounded by a little garden. The decor is great, inside and out. The service is impeccable. Everyone was very attentive and nice; I had expected a stuffy/snobby atmosphere (it's pretty formal) but was fortunately proven wrong. The food was amazing. It's $100 for a three course meal, and $125 for a six-course. There were three of us, and we all got the prix fix as opposed to the six course. I had the lobster for dessert, and it was really good. However, I regretted my choice after trying my mother's yellowfish tuna appetizer. Both appetizers were good, but I preferred the tuna and whatever sauce it was prepared with. My father ate the scallops, which he seemed pleased with. For the main course, I had the lamb. As a rule, I only ever eat red meat if it is well done, so I've been served dry, over-cooked meats more than a few times. However, this lamb was well-done while still being moist and delicious. My mother got the salmon, which I also thought was good. My father picked the real winner: the chilean sea bass. I eat fish and seafood all the time, but this was hands-down the best fish I've ever had. It was so good. For dessert, my father had the tart (I can't remember if it was apple and almond, or pear and almond), and it was really delicious and pretty big. I had the Brooklyn Bridge, and if you love chocolate, you need to have this cake; it was so good. Overall, a really great experience and highly recommended. The hefty price tag is most definitely worth it.",5.0
"I went to a gorgeous wedding at the River Cafe. The ceremony was in the garden with the sun setting in the back drop - and a view of the Statue of Liberty. And the bridge all lit up at night - amazing.Cocktail hour on the patio with champagne and passed oysters, mini mushroom egg rolls, and the most delicately fried shrimp I've ever had.Dinner consisted of 3 small plates. A crab cake, seared tuna with Israeli cous cous and filet with velvety whipped potatoes. And the dessert was a beautiful Napoleon type dessert with layered chocolate and chocolate designs of the Brooklyn bridge. Truly amazing wedding food.The venue was perfect. Dancing with the glow of the city lights and the bridge in the background. Service was wonderful. And the bride and groom were the perfect couple for such a wonderful event. Incredible.",5.0
"And for the thirty-seventh time during dinner I leaned against my boyfriend and sighed, ""It really is a glorious view."" I chose The River Cafe for my big 4-0 dinner knowing the positives -- fantastic food, stellar view, piano music, and the negatives -- touristy crowd and service that can feel a little cattle call-esque but deciding that for a Big Deal Dinner where I wanted to stay in Brooklyn, The River Cafe was the only choice.  It's been years since I've been there, but luckily my fellow Elite Leslie D. checked n recently and the preponderance of 4 and 5 star reviews convinced me that it has aged well. Like me, LOL. Dinner was sublime. There was some breed of Hungarian pig braised in Barolo for 12 hours as an appetizer special, and it was rich and tender. My foie gras two ways, paired with a glass of Sauternes, combined sweet and savory and crunchy and unctuous in each fantastic mouthful. My duck was crispy on the outside and incredibly meaty on the inside, and Joe's butter poached lobster was tender and wonderfully way to eat, a big plus when you're in nice clothes and not at a lobster shack in Maine. Joe's black and white soda for dessert came with an amazing chocolate cake and a little Brooklyn bridge made of chocolate. Superadorable!

"We got married at River Cafe on Saturday night in April. We had both ceremony and reception. Everything went so well that we couldn't ask better. The view was amazing and food was great. Our guests were so impressed. The special event coordinator, Luke, was so professional and kind.The wedding wasn't cheap but it was well worth the money. Highly recommended place for wedding.Thank you River Cafe. We will go back for 1yr anniversary!",5.0

"There was no problem getting a lunch reservation.    The location is perfect.  While it's a bit of a trek from the A line subway station, the destination is ideal.  It's right on the East River, almost directly underneath the Brooklyn Bridge.We tried the fruit wood smoked salmon and the spring parsnip soup as appetizers.  Our entrees were the filet mignon and the lobster and lobster.  Everything was great.  It's an upscale restaurant without being too stuffy.  The service was great.  The food was enjoyable.  Our bill came to $107., with 2 sodas and no dessert..  Since we used a gift certificate, given to us for our wedding, we tipped $53.Although it's a very nice restaurant, I wouldn't wait for a special occasion to dine here.  Life is short, enjoy yourself and come here when you need a break from life.",4.0

"Dear Katherine, I made my reservations with 6 weeks of advance and made sure to email, call and put a note on my reservation that I was VEGAN (NO EGGS, DAIRY, ANIMAL PRODUCT!) and insistently called back a bunch of times to try to see if they would accommodate me. all I got was that I could have a plain bowl of vegan pasta for $100. that's sounds great to me, better put some white truffles in there! awful!",1.0
"Ambiance? 5. Service? 5. Flavor? Ehh..The appetizers were definitely the best part of the meal. I ordered the rabbit and dumplings: SIMPLY EXQUISITE! if you've never tried rabbit before, you should! For the entree, I ordered the lobster, which was recommended by my server. When I received it, the lobster was much smaller than I had anticipated, it was a tad overcooked as the meat was a bit on the rubbery side, and both the citrus vinaigrette and taro puree were not strong enough of flavors to compliment the lobster. I did enjoy the bits of grapefruit, but overall, an over-cooked lobster totally ruined it for me. The dessert was also sort of bland. The Brooklyn Bridge dessert is quite a piece of art, but my compliments stop there. The Caramelized Apple and Almond Tart was good, but not Yelp's $$$$ status good.The ambiance and service alone made the trip unforgettable and something I do not regret, but the lobster was just too dissappointing.",3.0
"The setting of the River Cafe is beautiful. Set underneath the Brooklyn Bridge with a panoramic view of Manhattan, words cannot describe how beautiful it is here.This place was worth every penny. Although the food came out a little slow, the six course meal was great. For dessert, we had the Brooklyn Bridge classic vanilla bean creme brulee and warm cranberry and almond tart. Everything was so good!Overall, spectacular views and great food. This place is not cheap, but I highly recommend this place for special occasions.",5.0
"Jackets required. That's when you know it's legit. This is the perfect place for a nice night out. The view is incredible - right under the Brooklyn Bridge with a picturesque view of downtown. The restaurant itself is on the water, tucked away from the street and surrounded by a little garden. The decor is great, inside and out. The service is impeccable. Everyone was very attentive and nice; I had expected a stuffy/snobby atmosphere (it's pretty formal) but was fortunately proven wrong. The food was amazing. It's $100 for a three course meal, and $125 for a six-course. There were three of us, and we all got the prix fix as opposed to the six course. I had the lobster for dessert, and it was really good. However, I regretted my choice after trying my mother's yellowfish tuna appetizer. Both appetizers were good, but I preferred the tuna and whatever sauce it was prepared with. My father ate the scallops, which he seemed pleased with. For the main course, I had the lamb. As a rule, I only ever eat red meat if it is well done, so I've been served dry, over-cooked meats more than a few times. However, this lamb was well-done while still being moist and delicious. My mother got the salmon, which I also thought was good. My father picked the real winner: the chilean sea bass. I eat fish and seafood all the time, but this was hands-down the best fish I've ever had. It was so good. For dessert, my father had the tart (I can't remember if it was apple and almond, or pear and almond), and it was really delicious and pretty big. I had the Brooklyn Bridge, and if you love chocolate, you need to have this cake; it was so good. Overall, a really great experience and highly recommended. The hefty price tag is most definitely worth it.",5.0
"I went to a gorgeous wedding at the River Cafe. The ceremony was in the garden with the sun setting in the back drop - and a view of the Statue of Liberty. And the bridge all lit up at night - amazing.Cocktail hour on the patio with champagne and passed oysters, mini mushroom egg rolls, and the most delicately fried shrimp I've ever had.Dinner consisted of 3 small plates. A crab cake, seared tuna with Israeli cous cous and filet with velvety whipped potatoes. And the dessert was a beautiful Napoleon type dessert with layered chocolate and chocolate designs of the Brooklyn bridge. Truly amazing wedding food.The venue was perfect. Dancing with the glow of the city lights and the bridge in the background. Service was wonderful. And the bride and groom were the perfect couple for such a wonderful event. Incredible.",5.0
"And for the thirty-seventh time during dinner I leaned against my boyfriend and sighed, ""It really is a glorious view."" I chose The River Cafe for my big 4-0 dinner knowing the positives -- fantastic food, stellar view, piano music, and the negatives -- touristy crowd and service that can feel a little cattle call-esque but deciding that for a Big Deal Dinner where I wanted to stay in Brooklyn, The River Cafe was the only choice.  It's been years since I've been there, but luckily my fellow Elite Leslie D. checked n recently and the preponderance of 4 and 5 star reviews convinced me that it has aged well. Like me, LOL. Dinner was sublime. There was some breed of Hungarian pig braised in Barolo for 12 hours as an appetizer special, and it was rich and tender. My foie gras two ways, paired with a glass of Sauternes, combined sweet and savory and crunchy and unctuous in each fantastic mouthful. My duck was crispy on the outside and incredibly meaty on the inside, and Joe's butter poached lobster was tender and wonderfully way to eat, a big plus when you're in nice clothes and not at a lobster shack in Maine. Joe's black and white soda for dessert came with an amazing chocolate cake and a little Brooklyn bridge made of chocolate. Superadorable!

Exactly what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant. Great food, amazing service, and a very upscale/romantic atmosphere. The Food - Their steak was perfect, salmon was fresh, and the deserts were amazing. Everything was cooked to perfection and the champagne and deserts the waiter recommended were also amazing. The miniature chocolate version of the Brooklyn Bridge was cute.The Service - Everyone was very pleasant and professional, from the valet to our waiter (who offered us a window table as soon as one became available, even without us asking, which we took). The Atmosphere - Very classy, and has an amazing view at night. The live piano and violin were a nice touch. It's a good mix of romantic/high-end dining with an old-school feel.

"Marriages, or relationships, are a bit like cars. If you want them to last, you have to treat them with care, and do all of your ordinary maintenance. And every once in a while, you gotta have some major maintenance, like doing something memorable; in our case, my major maintenance was taking my wife to NY for our 10th wedding anniversary. Which opened the issue of where to have THE anniversary dinner. Some place memorable was needed, so I decided to go for the view; checked out a few panoramic places in Manhattan, but they all seemed a bit tacky or touristy (not that we were anything else, but still). Then my due diligence took me to the River Cafe, in Brooklyn, just at the other end of the bridge.Exchanged a few emails and phone calls, made a reservation, negotiated an hour (initially they only had 6,30 or 9,30 slots, the first being too un-romantic, the second too late for my jet-lag), and finally here we are.Just as requested given the occasion, the maitre d' kept us a first row table by the window (and eventually had the pastissier write ""Happy Anniversary"" on our dessert, which was not requested but very sweet).Strictly speaking, taken individually, most elements are probably worth 4 stars rather than 5. I had scallops chevice as an entrée and it was very good, though not memorable (and just had a far resemblance to ceviche, actually); and the same goes for all the rest; but then again, I live in Italy, and that may have made me a bit demanding with food.The room is nice, tables are well laid, though from a Michelin-starred place you'd probably expect a bit more. Piano discreetly plays in the background, and patrons are quite elegant, as prescribed by the dress code: business dinners, couples taking out the in-laws, etc. Not much privacy, given how crammed the tables are.But the view: breathtaking is the only appropriate word I can think of: the bridge literally over your head (well, almost), lower Manhattan just in front of you.Service is good, but a couple of times I had to pour the wine myself; which of course didn't kill me, I do it all the time at home and in most restaurant I eat at; still, at a place like this you'd probably expect a bit more. But then I must say the way the maitre d' took care of our special evening was really flawless.This, and the view, made our evening as unforgettable as can be, and well worth 5 stars: only because there's no 6th star available. And even breaking my all-time personal bill record (keep 350 $ ready for a dinner for two; that is if you fly low with the wine and undertip the Maitre d' - for which I sincerely apologize...) felt totally worth it.

"One word = AWESOME!Their dinner prix fixe menu is pricey (according to their website) BUT I went there for a la carte Saturday lunch. I'd say the prices aren't bad for an entree. Their appetizers are pricey but they are really good. We had 4 appetizers: beef salad, pear salad, lobster bisque, and tuna tartare. For the main dish we had the lobster and then the lamb shank. I'd strongly suggest the lamb shank and avoid the lobster. I generally don't eat red meat, but when it's good - it's DARN good and i'll eat it. We also had mimosas. It was alright but I don't think it's worth $15 a glass. And last but not least, the view is amazing! This place is so cute, cozy, and it's like you're literally in a boat.. Did you notice the windows on the back wall?? (it's those circle looking windows from a boat)  I can just imagine how nice it would be on a clear evening in warmer weather and they even have a patio area.

So, knowing the timing was tight I called and spoke to a young woman on Tuesday evening and asked if they could process my request and mail out the certificate ASAP so it would arrive by that Saturday to a NY address where I was staying. She didn't think that would be a problem.I faxed the request form on Wed morning with a cover letter emphasizing that I needed this certificate to arrive by Saturday (or else I would no longer be at that address) and asked that someone call me if that is not possible.I heard nothing until I called the restaurant Friday afternoon and, after some time, received a call back from the manager that processed the request. He casually said ""Oh, it went out Thursday morning I think. It should get there tomorrow or the day after"". Day after being - MONDAY.Needless to say the certificate never arrived, I had to leave a forwarding address with the people I stayed with, and I had nothing to give to my friends.

So, knowing the timing was tight I called and spoke to a young woman on Tuesday evening and asked if they could process my request and mail out the certificate ASAP so it would arrive by that Saturday to a NY address where I was staying. She didn't think that would be a problem.I faxed the request form on Wed morning with a cover letter emphasizing that I needed this certificate to arrive by Saturday (or else I would no longer be at that address) and asked that someone call me if that is not possible.I heard nothing until I called the restaurant Friday afternoon and, after some time, received a call back from the manager that processed the request. He casually said ""Oh, it went out Thursday morning I think. It should get there tomorrow or the day after"". Day after being - MONDAY.Needless to say the certificate never arrived, I had to leave a forwarding address with the people I stayed with, and I had nothing to give to my friends. Quite disappointed by the customer service. I would have appreciated a call letting me know that they may not get it out in time so I could have saved everyone the hassle.",3.0
"River Cafe is really nice, its on some sort of barge so its like you're on a boat on the river.  The views of downtown Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge are great.  We went to Sunday brunch and it was a beautiful day.  They come out with a hallowed out egg that they fill up with some nuts granola berries and oatmeal and its so yummy.  It's a fixed menu, appetizer and entree for $55 which is a little pricey for me but the atmosphere was worth it.  Food was good but nothing amazing but you're definitely paying for the high class atmosphere.",3.0
"Ah, the most common proposal spot in NYC.  That's all. The food is decent, but you will sacrifice the quality for the view.

"We were here recently on a special occasion.  It was an unusually early  night for us - we had a 5:30 reservation - but we were so happy we arrived early enough to get one of the window tables.  The view is superb.  The food and service lived up to the wonderful view as well - we had the branzino with a shrimp and chorizo crust that was delicious.  Our companions had lamb that looked and smelled divine.  The waitstaff was attentive but not all over us every minute.  Desserts were equally wonderful - we had the pretty bridge that others have posted in photos, and also the almond and apple dessert.  All great.  The sommelier was not as knowlegable as the winelist would indicate.  They have a breathtaking selection of extremely pricey wines from the Domaine de la Romanee Conti - and I guess if you are not willing to spend thousands (yes, these wines range from $1,400 to $8,000) they recommend a pretty ordinary bottle that only costs hundreds.  But we would still go back and still recommend this lovely place.",5.0

"Fabulous restaurant for an all around romantic dining experience!Went with my husband on a Monday night for no special reason.90% of the restaurant is the view and 10% is the menu.We had reservations for 8:30 (reservations between 7 and 9 were available), but it was packed.Here's the breakdownBARThere's a small bar to sit and have drinks while you wait for a table. We arrived 10 min before our reservations and that's exactly how long we sat at the bar. Great environment to sit and sip.SEATSThere are 2 types of seating, tandem, where you have to sit side by side, or standard across the table seating. Initially we were side by side but the waiter noticed a draft coming from the vents and when a table for two opened up right by the huge picture window under the bridge he promptly moved us. We never even asked to be moved he just did it.MENUThere are ONLY two options here.A- The 3 course fixed menu. Everyone at the table can pick 1 of each, an appetizer, main course, and desert. The menu is pretty extensive and ranges from scallops to lobster to fois gras. ($100/pp)B- The 6 course chef's selection meu. The chef chooses 2 appetizers, 2 main courses and 2 desserts. HOWEVER each portion is a 1/2 portion, so you're not getting twice as much food, rather you're getting to taste more food. The courses are pre-selected for the evening but if there's something you don't like (or don't eat) the chef is happy to change it. They recommend everyone at the table get this and there's good reason. ($125/pp). DRINKSIf you want to do a wine pairing with your dinner it's $50/pp. But the by the glass option is always available, and probably preferable unless you have an incredibly fine palate for wine and want the absolute perfect drink for every course. Keep in mind it's 6 different wines in addition to anything you've had at the bar.SERVICEThere is a head waiter, an assistant waiter and an additional waiter(s). The head waiter will take your order, tell you about the menu and chef's specials. The other two will bring bread, drinks, and clear the table. From that perspective you expect to have a never-ending supply of food served to you without delay. That will not be the case. Service is top notch, but this is not a restaurant where you can run in for a quick bite. Food comes out slowly.FOODSuperb! Every item is perfectly created to make the most fabulous flavor combinations. Again, if you order the 6 course you'll receive small appetizers so understand that once you get the first bite you will likely be very hungry, and the portions will be small, and the next appetizer will be 10 min away. But they did bring a small app on the house before our actual appetizer. Once they bring the main course it will be a smaller portion than it would be if you ordered the 3 courses, but it's still a great meal. We had lamb chops and there were 2 impeccably cooked, well seasoned, chops. We chose 2 desserts (full sized). The lime souffle was amazing, and the coffee caramel tart was just as great.",4.0
"The restaurant is cute, but the food was okay.  The view is underwhelming during lunch (compared to a San Francisco waterfront); I suspect it might be more impressive during sunset or at night. There were a few empty tables in this small restaurant, but this location will probably be bustling once Brooklyn Bridge Park fully opens.I love the reception area (which looks like a flower shop) and the bouquets of flowers on each table are fit for a quaint wedding.Foie Gras Two-Ways:  * Terrine: almond crust, ground coffee beans* Poached: fig sauce, balsalmic vinegarEither way tastes like butter coated with a sugar glaze, with the added vileness of a liver.  How many times do I have to remind myself that I don't like Terrines? (*rolleyes*)Lobster Two-Ways:* Lobster Tail - bland* Lobster Cheese Sandwich - oiliest sandwich ever!I wished I had ordered the Brazino while I was waiting for this dish and I wished even more when I was stuffing the greasy lobster sandwich down my throat.We were too full for dessert.  We might still have ordered one based solely on the glowing dessert reviews here, but the super rich-looking desserts on our neighboring table did not beckon us.I didn't realize that the restaurant is a house-boat until we walked outside the waterfront next to it.  That explains a few seconds of mild shaking while we were eating.p.s.: If you are walking here from the Brooklyn Bridge, get off the first stairway on the Brooklyn side.",4.0
"I attended a good friend's wedding at the River Cafe in Oct 2011.  Bottom line: best wedding ever.  Best location, best view, best service, best food, best ambiance.The courses were served with enough time in between to give me a break from eating; meaning that I did not get too full in between courses and was able to enjoy each one.The wine was absolutely exquisite and I have since tracked down a few bottles of my own through BevMo out here in CA.  The views of Manhattan are spectacular and I couldn't have asked for a better night.ADDITIONAL INFO: I happened to drop my make-up bag at the restaurant and had to catch my flight back to LA the next morning.  I didn't know where I'd left it and I finally emailed River Cafe, and they had it!  They sent it back to me, and I was beyond grateful as it held a number of valuables - earrings, a gold necklace, my entire supply of contacts (those things are expensive), etc.  So this was above and beyond in my book.  River Cafe is on my list whenever we head back to NYC.",5.0
"It was beautiful watching the sunset after walking the Brooklyn Bridge and being lost trying to find this place. I love good food, but I find it so awkward to be in an expensive restaurant and be on your best behavior. :( The first thing that I thought when I sat down was, ""Shiet, I belong in Chinatown eating."" But my dork boyfriend wanted to eat here because I'm leaving for dental school, so I gave in.It was $98 prix fixe, which I was not happy about, but it's ok. I had the rabbit ravioli, Maine lobster special, and the coconut bavarian. My boyfriend had the oysters, rack of lamb, and sticky toffee cake. I think my favorite dish of the night was the first thing they served us when we sat down, which seem to be some kind of delicious chicken salad. I didn't really enjoy the rabbit ravioli or the lobster, but the coconut bavarian was good - a little too sweet though so I didn't finish it. My boyfriend loved his oysters, his rack of lamb was iffy and his sticky toffee cake was a bit iffy too and really sweet.The service was amazing though. They refilled our water whenever we took a sip. The waiters were prompt and very professional. In the end, even I didn't feel particularly awkward like when I sat down.",4.0

"I just wanted to add my vote to the wonderful and romantic setting of The River Cafe in Brooklyn.  It is pricey but the food, presentation, and service are worth the $$$$$ check.  As soon as I read the menu and noted none of the dishes had a price tag, I realized a home equity loan was in order.  Fortunately, my date and I do not drink alcoholic beverages, so the check was under $250.  That covered tax and tip for an appetizer, main entree, and dessert for each.  You won't be disappopinted.",4.0
"The River Café easily ranks among the top 10 best meals I've had so far in New York City. Perhaps it was the local, perhaps the ambiance, or even perhaps the food. Either way, all three attributes easily laid the foundation for an extremely enjoyable experience.1) Local. Perched almost beneath the towering Brooklyn Bridge, River Café is awarded with incredible views of the Manhattan skyline. Watching the sun set and twinkle of office lights would bring any non-romantic to their knees.2) Ambiance. Match #1 with a window-side table and your date's panties* will already have hit the floor (but in this case, I was the one being taken out. And yes, the previous still held true...). The actual dining area itself seemed to occupy a ship/barge/boat, but without any of the rocking and sea sickness. The live piano music, which one could hear at any table in the dining room, and softly lit space set the tone just right.3) Food: It was fixed price at $98 per person, which included an appetizer, entrée and desert. For appetizers we had the Sautéed Hudson Valley Foie Gras and the Yellowfin Tuna. The foie gras actually came with a strawberry crepe! I mean, how can one not go about ordering that? The yellowfin tuna was equally amazing. The lightly seared tuna with a foie gras mousse stuffing was perfectly complimented by the slight crisp of Italian bacon. And the Burgundy black truffle vinaigrette that this was all floating in proved so tasty that I had to slop up the remainders with some French bread (faux pax, I know, but what can you do). For entrées we decided on the Main Lobster Special and New York Cut Sirloin. Understanding that River Café isn't a ""steak place,"" the sirloin was surprisingly good. The lobster was also very good, but I have to say that the awards go to the aforementioned appetizers AND the dessert... Oh the dessert. The Goat Cheese Cheesecake is what one my heart. Swirling among a passion fruit gelée, this was bliss. So much so that I purposefully made this the last thing to touch my taste buds for the evening, just so that my dreams that night would go untarnished.I will be going back to River Café, but only for special occasions as I don't want this experience to seem trite.*Is it me or does this word sound so dirty?",5.0

"Fabulous restaurant for an all around romantic dining experience!Went with my husband on a Monday night for no special reason.90% of the restaurant is the view and 10% is the menu.We had reservations for 8:30 (reservations between 7 and 9 were available), but it was packed.Here's the breakdownBARThere's a small bar to sit and have drinks while you wait for a table. We arrived 10 min before our reservations and that's exactly how long we sat at the bar. Great environment to sit and sip.SEATSThere are 2 types of seating, tandem, where you have to sit side by side, or standard across the table seating. Initially we were side by side but the waiter noticed a draft coming from the vents and when a table for two opened up right by the huge picture window under the bridge he promptly moved us. We never even asked to be moved he just did it.MENUThere are ONLY two options here.A- The 3 course fixed menu. Everyone at the table can pick 1 of each, an appetizer, main course, and desert. The menu is pretty extensive and ranges from scallops to lobster to fois gras. ($100/pp)B- The 6 course chef's selection meu. The chef chooses 2 appetizers, 2 main courses and 2 desserts. HOWEVER each portion is a 1/2 portion, so you're not getting twice as much food, rather you're getting to taste more food. The courses are pre-selected for the evening but if there's something you don't like (or don't eat) the chef is happy to change it. They recommend everyone at the table get this and there's good reason. ($125/pp). DRINKSIf you want to do a wine pairing with your dinner it's $50/pp. But the by the glass option is always available, and probably preferable unless you have an incredibly fine palate for wine and want the absolute perfect drink for every course. Keep in mind it's 6 different wines in addition to anything you've had at the bar.SERVICEThere is a head waiter, an assistant waiter and an additional waiter(s). The head waiter will take your order, tell you about the menu and chef's specials. The other two will bring bread, drinks, and clear the table. From that perspective you expect to have a never-ending supply of food served to you without delay. That will not be the case. Service is top notch, but this is not a restaurant where you can run in for a quick bite. Food comes out slowly.FOODSuperb! Every item is perfectly created to make the most fabulous flavor combinations. Again, if you order the 6 course you'll receive small appetizers so understand that once you get the first bite you will likely be very hungry, and the portions will be small, and the next appetizer will be 10 min away. But they did bring a small app on the house before our actual appetizer. Once they bring the main course it will be a smaller portion than it would be if you ordered the 3 courses, but it's still a great meal. We had lamb chops and there were 2 impeccably cooked, well seasoned, chops. We chose 2 desserts (full sized). The lime souffle was amazing, and the coffee caramel tart was just as great.",4.0
"The restaurant is cute, but the food was okay.  The view is underwhelming during lunch (compared to a San Francisco waterfront); I suspect it might be more impressive during sunset or at night. There were a few empty tables in this small restaurant, but this location will probably be bustling once Brooklyn Bridge Park fully opens.I love the reception area (which looks like a flower shop) and the bouquets of flowers on each table are fit for a quaint wedding.Foie Gras Two-Ways:  * Terrine: almond crust, ground coffee beans* Poached: fig sauce, balsalmic vinegarEither way tastes like butter coated with a sugar glaze, with the added vileness of a liver.  How many times do I have to remind myself that I don't like Terrines? (*rolleyes*)Lobster Two-Ways:* Lobster Tail - bland* Lobster Cheese Sandwich - oiliest sandwich ever!I wished I had ordered the Brazino while I was waiting for this dish and I wished even more when I was stuffing the greasy lobster sandwich down my throat.We were too full for dessert.  We might still have ordered one based solely on the glowing dessert reviews here, but the super rich-looking desserts on our neighboring table did not beckon us.I didn't realize that the restaurant is a house-boat until we walked outside the waterfront next to it.  That explains a few seconds of mild shaking while we were eating.p.s.: If you are walking here from the Brooklyn Bridge, get off the first stairway on the Brooklyn side.",4.0
"I attended a good friend's wedding at the River Cafe in Oct 2011.  Bottom line: best wedding ever.  Best location, best view, best service, best food, best ambiance.The courses were served with enough time in between to give me a break from eating; meaning that I did not get too full in between courses and was able to enjoy each one.The wine was absolutely exquisite and I have since tracked down a few bottles of my own through BevMo out here in CA.  The views of Manhattan are spectacular and I couldn't have asked for a better night.ADDITIONAL INFO: I happened to drop my make-up bag at the restaurant and had to catch my flight back to LA the next morning.  I didn't know where I'd left it and I finally emailed River Cafe, and they had it!  They sent it back to me, and I was beyond grateful as it held a number of valuables - earrings, a gold necklace, my entire supply of contacts (those things are expensive), etc.  So this was above and beyond in my book.  River Cafe is on my list whenever we head back to NYC.",5.0
"It was beautiful watching the sunset after walking the Brooklyn Bridge and being lost trying to find this place. I love good food, but I find it so awkward to be in an expensive restaurant and be on your best behavior. :( The first thing that I thought when I sat down was, ""Shiet, I belong in Chinatown eating."" But my dork boyfriend wanted to eat here because I'm leaving for dental school, so I gave in.It was $98 prix fixe, which I was not happy about, but it's ok. I had the rabbit ravioli, Maine lobster special, and the coconut bavarian. My boyfriend had the oysters, rack of lamb, and sticky toffee cake. I think my favorite dish of the night was the first thing they served us when we sat down, which seem to be some kind of delicious chicken salad. I didn't really enjoy the rabbit ravioli or the lobster, but the coconut bavarian was good - a little too sweet though so I didn't finish it. My boyfriend loved his oysters, his rack of lamb was iffy and his sticky toffee cake was a bit iffy too and really sweet.The service was amazing though. They refilled our water whenever we took a sip. The waiters were prompt and very professional. In the end, even I didn't feel particularly awkward like when I sat down.",4.0
"When my parents were in town, I took them to this place so they can enjoy the food with an amazing view of manhattan. and I was so glad that I took my friend's recommendation to come here.For appetizer, we hadsmoked salmonpear salad--by far, my favorite salad dish, it's fresh, fruity, different layers of flavor and just perfecttuna tartare--the chili oil and wasabi completes the dishfor entree,crisp duck breast--recommendscottish salmon-- a little bit overcookedbranzino fillet -- a mix with fish, sausage, tomato and other vegitables, not loving it, but interesting to try.we didn't have the time to try the desert, and this gives me one more reason to come back. The whole restaurant is like a flower green house over the water, and has a small garden in front of it. I can sooo imagine how even more beautiful this place could be in spring or summer. and I'm definitely coming back.oh, plus, the waiters are super nice~",5.0
"I just wanted to add my vote to the wonderful and romantic setting of The River Cafe in Brooklyn.  It is pricey but the food, presentation, and service are worth the $$$$$ check.  As soon as I read the menu and noted none of the dishes had a price tag, I realized a home equity loan was in order.  Fortunately, my date and I do not drink alcoholic beverages, so the check was under $250.  That covered tax and tip for an appetizer, main entree, and dessert for each.  You won't be disappopinted.",4.0
"The River Café easily ranks among the top 10 best meals I've had so far in New York City. Perhaps it was the local, perhaps the ambiance, or even perhaps the food. Either way, all three attributes easily laid the foundation for an extremely enjoyable experience.1) Local. Perched almost beneath the towering Brooklyn Bridge, River Café is awarded with incredible views of the Manhattan skyline. Watching the sun set and twinkle of office lights would bring any non-romantic to their knees.2) Ambiance. Match #1 with a window-side table and your date's panties* will already have hit the floor (but in this case, I was the one being taken out. And yes, the previous still held true...). The actual dining area itself seemed to occupy a ship/barge/boat, but without any of the rocking and sea sickness. The live piano music, which one could hear at any table in the dining room, and softly lit space set the tone just right.3) Food: It was fixed price at $98 per person, which included an appetizer, entrée and desert. For appetizers we had the Sautéed Hudson Valley Foie Gras and the Yellowfin Tuna. The foie gras actually came with a strawberry crepe! I mean, how can one not go about ordering that? The yellowfin tuna was equally amazing. The lightly seared tuna with a foie gras mousse stuffing was perfectly complimented by the slight crisp of Italian bacon. And the Burgundy black truffle vinaigrette that this was all floating in proved so tasty that I had to slop up the remainders with some French bread (faux pax, I know, but what can you do). For entrées we decided on the Main Lobster Special and New York Cut Sirloin. Understanding that River Café isn't a ""steak place,"" the sirloin was surprisingly good. The lobster was also very good, but I have to say that the awards go to the aforementioned appetizers AND the dessert... Oh the dessert. The Goat Cheese Cheesecake is what one my heart. Swirling among a passion fruit gelée, this was bliss. So much so that I purposefully made this the last thing to touch my taste buds for the evening, just so that my dreams that night would go untarnished.I will be going back to River Café, but only for special occasions as I don't want this experience to seem trite.*Is it me or does this word sound so dirty?",5.0
"This place seems to be built for tourists. Understandable... under the brooklyn bridge and all. but living in NY, we were not impressed by this place. We went for brunch. If you want to spend a bunch of money on a prix fixe menu, go to Gramercy Tavern. You'll get your buck's worth and more. The service here was worth 3 stars, and so was the food. The flavors were good, but nothing amazing. For a $55 brunch, we  at least expected bread on the table. They either forgot, or it was not included. Dessert was also not included. As far as ambience is concerned, it was good, but the best seats are next to the window. Anything other than that, and you'll find yourself wishing you were next to the window. All in all, I'd say that if you live in NY city, I'm sure you can come up with a better place to spend your money. If you don't live in NY, you'll probably be impressed.",3.0
FLAWLESS service and food. A true fine dining experience and a genuine New York gem. The view is absolutely gorgeous. Every seat in the house has a view. I would suggest planning your dinner so that you get to be in the restaurant during sunset.Worth the splurge for a special occasion.,5.0
"Without a doubt, one of the finest places to eat in the New York area.Yes, it's quite expensive, but for a special occassion, such as Christmas or an Anniversary, it is well worth it.Walking into the attractive reception on an evening it's clear this place is going to be good. The atmosphere is set by a musician at a grand piano and the lighting creates the most romantic setting. The food is very good and the wine choice is excellent. But its the jawdropping, unrivalled views of Manhattan which really make this restaurant.A four course set menu for Christmas Day is $125 per head, which isn't bad considering just how terrific this place is. It may not be somewhere you dine at every week, but as a one-off the River Cafe is a must.",4.0

"The food is as excellent as the VU. Most places with VU's fall short on the food, but this place scores! However, I was off to a difficult start when I was trying to secure reservations for 6. Read the end for my only gripes. First of all, I'm a loser cuz I didn't have access to a FAX (and had no time to go to Kinko's to do it. For RES for 6, they required a fax of your credit card. The ding-a-ling on the fone sounded like a transplanted Valley Girl but in BKLYN. Anyway, she agreed to hold the reservation tentatively since I told her I'd be in NYC in a few days, and wud walk in w/my CC. The reason why they want a fax is cuz they have a stiff $98.00 cancellation PER PERSON fee within 72hours of your RES. Plus they state a 20% gratuity for groups of 6 or more. So, I go in and sign the necessary forms and appreciate the view in daytime. Thanks to the persistence of a friend while I was out of the country, my wait-list for a Sat. nite came through! All that aside now, I could discuss the food and service. It says a lot about a restaurant when they serve artisanal bread - and this place had really high quality bread. A choice of three types no less! My water glass was always filled. While perusing the menu, an amuse-bouche was served (Guess they learned that trick to make the customer happy!) Between the six of us, appetizers selected: salad, rabbit ravioli with pancetta, seared maguro on edamame puree, and the rock lobster. Entree choices were: rack of lamb, steak (charged an extra $7.00 supplement - which is tacky for an expensive restaurant), and monk fish. Everyone was pleased with their choices. One third of my maguro was a little overcooked but the rest was perfect.  The rack of lamb was superb. I can't remember being at a restaurant where the lamb is seared first, and then finished by roasting it. The steak could not have been better. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Big eaters (like me) beware, I had to have two dinner rolls to supplement the chichi serving size. Desserts were fabulous. I won't go into detail here, cuz you could go to their site and look at the menu. To personalize the birthday girl - they had a (complimentary) chocolate plaque (about 1""x2"") that said Happy Birthday. The pianist even did a tasteful rendition of Happy Birthday for us - even though we would have opted to be more discreet. Gripe One: At the end of dessert, they placed one plate with 3 additional desserts: a chocolate mousse napoleon of some sort, their signature BklynBridge mousse cake, and something else - forgot. No one asked for this, and I was surprised they put it on the table. Well, it turned out it was on the bill - about $16.00. Okay, we're in a classy place and paying $98.00pp prix fixe - so we're not going to squabble over $16.00. Gripe Two: Uhhhhh not everyone could afford an $800.00 bottle of wine. We had to dig deep into the wine menu to find a $50.00bottle. Gripe Three: ....of which I have no control: I hate it when you go into an elegant restaurant and see people who have no table manners. I don't get it - people who don't even know how to hold a fork properly. They grab it like they're going to stab someone, and then 90 degree the fork into the mouth. Go ahead call me a snob. In any case, I can't wait for my next visit to River Cafe. It truly is a romantic, sophisticated place that's requires no membership.",5.0
"Absolutely love it! Definitely, this is the most romantic place for dates!  My boyfriend and I went to the River Cafe for our third date.  As you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by a friendly host who takes your coat and other stuff.  Walking down toward the restaurant area, you see a fancy grand piano on your side; music is played by a pianist.  Because we arrived there a bit early, we waited at a bar area and order two glasses of mojitos that are made perfectly. Looking outside, we saw lit up skyline of downtown at night, and the view is fantastic.Now onto our meal, we sat facing the window to experience the night life of downtown of manhattan.  Starting with a special dish from the chef, we tasted and ordered a glass of fine merlot and cabernet wine.  My boyfriend ordered rabbit and dumpling and I ordered lobster bisque for our appetizers.  For entree, he got medium rare lamb chops, and I got medium ny steak. The presentation of the food is gorgeous to the point you don't want to mess it up. The food itself is cooked perfectly to your taste. It was one of the best steaks I ever had! Definitely a fine dining I would say. Afterwards comes the dessert: brooklyn bridge chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for him and chocolate molten cake with pistachio ice cream for me.  Because the food is so filling, I could not dare to finish the dessert.  But this is not the end.  The chef complements the meal by giving you gourmet chocolate pieces. I 100% loved this place! I would go there again, except for the price of the dishes is expensive. I won't lie. Per person for a dinner meal was more than $100.

"Was kind of bummed to hear that this lovely restaurant was damaged by the hurricane. The food is pretty good. Classic offerings that aren't necessarily innovative but delicious nevertheless. Cannot beat the location next to the river and the lovely view, although i would've loved to enjoy the view with a table against the windows. This restaurant seem to disappear into another world while being in easily reachable brooklyn. The most memorable thing i enjoy is their dessert, which  is unique and in the shape of the brooklyn bridge (who could beat that!!). Another word of advice, they do small area for drinks which you can enjoy during the day. It's a bit secluded in the middle of this touristy area and give you a refreshing break from all the crowds. It isn't cheap, I definitely feel like i paid a bit for the novelty of location. It isn't your new school brooklyn restaurant like the Governor, but this a traditional restaurant so it isn't what you're shooting for anyways. Overall, had a lovely time and quite an enjoyable overall experience.",3.0

"Everyone who has written positively about this restaurant has commented on the view. Umm, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline are not owned by the River Cafe.

My first impression: pretentious, stodgy, ""old,"" obnoxious, meant for conspicuous consumption but not an enjoyable time with good food.  The dining room was almost empty at 6PM, and so we were assaulted with 5 waiters who gaped at us the whole time from about 5 feet away. And it was so quiet I felt I was in a library. Yeah, there was Manhattan, which I see on the B/Q train everyday.

"I came to this restaurant at the beginning of December with my sexy man. It was pretty much perfect  ! We had a few issues persuading a cab to take us there but we found one in the end and began our journey over the bridge. it was such a clear night and the views were spectacular. On arrival at the restaurant, we were a little early so they guided us to the bar where we were served lovely strong spirits.We got to our table and from there one the service was amazing. Not too attentive but making sure that all of our needs were met. The food was delicious. I have the Fois gras two ways, the duck breast and the chocoloate bridge. Each course had the most wonderful concoction of flavours. My partner had the oysters, the venison and the sorbet. Outstanding! As it was Chris' bday i asked if they could make that known.

For those of you wondering where to take your hunnies or handsome hunks this Valentines day...River Cafe should be on your shortlist. It has romance written all over it - from the beautifully lit promenade to the small cabin like interior with sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn Bridge. This is a day not to forget your wallet with a fixed price menu that may leave you out of pocket for a few days. So save it for someone special. The food is adequate with a not so great choice for veggie diners but the atmosphere more than makes up for it. Make the most of the River Cafe's location by going for a stroll to the viewing area beside the restaurant. If she doesn't swoon over you after this date you have serious issues to deal with.,4.0
"Been there twice. Once last year just for drinks and this year during Restaurant Week. View is really breathtaking, perfect environment to eat. Food was OK...just OK, nothing spectacular.

"Was kind of bummed to hear that this lovely restaurant was damaged by the hurricane. The food is pretty good. Classic offerings that aren't necessarily innovative but delicious nevertheless. Cannot beat the location next to the river and the lovely view, although i would've loved to enjoy the view with a table against the windows. This restaurant seem to disappear into another world while being in easily reachable brooklyn. The most memorable thing i enjoy is their dessert, which  is unique and in the shape of the brooklyn bridge (who could beat that!!). Another word of advice, they do small area for drinks which you can enjoy during the day. It's a bit secluded in the middle of this touristy area and give you a refreshing break from all the crowds. It isn't cheap, I definitely feel like i paid a bit for the novelty of location. It isn't your new school brooklyn restaurant like the Governor, but this a traditional restaurant so it isn't what you're shooting for anyways. Overall, had a lovely time and quite an enjoyable overall experience.",3.0
"Just an all around wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion. While there may be better food in NY, there is no better combination of food, ambiance, view and service. Jackets required for men and children over 14. I found the food to be very good, and the service very attentive and accommodating. Not a place if your looking to be loud or overly celebratory, the perfect place for a quiet and beautiful night!",5.0
"Oh, the hassle of finding the right place for my dad's birthday lunch... Not that I was organizing a real party (we were four), but my dad is pretty much the epitome of a foody. And he has been eating around the world in the best restaurants ever opened. So yeah, a total drag to find the right place.My partner suggested to take advice from our favorite food traveler, Travel channel's own Samantha Brown. Turns out, she did a special about Brooklyn and my dad had always wanted to go there. Bingo.Samantha recommended the River Cafe. So we made reservations. (I would trust Samantha with my palate's life).AMAZING view of Manhattan from Brooklyn. You are literally on the water.

I've always heard of this place, the restaurant with the amazing view and pricey menu. That was really all I was expecting, however, it's so much more. The staff is so attentive and the restaurant is filled with delicate and intricate details. The atmosphere is special. The food was really good too. We got the tasting menu for 125. We had six courses that were decently sized. The menu we got included scallops, rock lobster tail, chilean sea bass, foie gras, lamb chops, and an assortment of desserts. The foie gras was the biggest piece of liver ive ever had! I was so excited to see it on my plate and it tasted deliciousssssss! The desserts were amazing too. We each had 3 different desserts on our plates with a dish of mini desserts to share!  We were both sooo stuffed at the end. Drinks are also reasonable. 12 for a glass of wine or scotch. We ended up spending 400 but It was worth every dollar for those special occasions. It also made us really full and happy!",5.0
Went here for our anniversary and got the tasting menu. Worth every penny. Every dish was perfect. Usually I'm not the biggest fan of wine pairings and find them disappointing but at River Cafe they hand select each wine based on your taste preference and the among of money you are willing to spend... Perfect... Complemented and enhanced each dish. Highlights: foie gras was superb.. All 3 versions. Pitched lobster perfectly done. BK bridge dessert tasty and cute. Service is top notch.

"I was looking at this venue for my upcoming wedding. I called Luke who is river cafes party coordinator. I called him a number of times and left numerus messages, he never returned my calles.

"My first experience here is still one of my most memorable dining experiences.  River Café lived up to all the hype and more.I had made a 9pm reservation on a Friday night for dinner with my girlfriend and arrived promptly.  I had a drink at the bar before I was seated about 10 minutes later.  The interior decor was that of which you would find on a cruise ship.  The accompanying view of lower Manhattan on the water also gave you the illusion that you were in fact dining on a cruise ship.  The waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly.   We were initially seated at small table for two in the middle of the dining area.  After placing our appetizer order, a larger table against the wall opened up.  I politely asked if we could move there and our waiter happily moved us over without any hesitation.Our appetizers arrived and were phenomenal.  I had ordered the Yellowfin Tuna wrapped in thick Italian bacon, stuffed with foie gras and topped with black truffle vinaigrette.  The word ""wow"" doesn't even begin to describe how amazing it tasted.  About 10 minutes after finishing our apps, the waiter brought two very small bowls of gazpacho with crostini, compliments of the chef.  Nice touch.For the entree, I ordered the 16oz NY cut Sirloin which was a great steak.  You can probably have better at a great steakhouse, but nevertheless, this was still a good choice.  It had a nice touch of blue cheese fondue spread on top and a red wine mushroom glaze.  The sweet potato gratin side was tasty as well.Dessert was the only part that was a slight letdown, but turned out to be great thanks to the waiters.  We ordered the  Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge and the Chocolate Sticky Toffee Cake.  I'm not gonna lie, I thought both were rather bland.  They weren't bad, but I was expecting something more for the price.  We didn't finish either one, but sat at our table enjoying our drinks.  I was about to ask for the check, when two waiters came over and asked us to get up with our drinks and follow them.  We were both confused, but were pleasantly surprised when they led us to a new table right by the window overlooking the lower Manhattan skyline.  They told us we could finish out drinks here and no need to rush.  I thought that was very nice of them and unexpected.  Granted, the restaurant was now at 50% capacity, but still a great touch.  To top it all off, they returned 5 minutes later with a 3 tier dessert tray filled with handmade chocolates, compliments of the chef.  I can still taste the sea salt caramel dark chocolate truffle.Amazing dining experience all around.  It's not cheap, but it is highly recommended- especially for special occasions.",5.0

"My first experience here is still one of my most memorable dining experiences.  River Café lived up to all the hype and more.I had made a 9pm reservation on a Friday night for dinner with my girlfriend and arrived promptly.  I had a drink at the bar before I was seated about 10 minutes later.  The interior decor was that of which you would find on a cruise ship.  The accompanying view of lower Manhattan on the water also gave you the illusion that you were in fact dining on a cruise ship.  The waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly.   We were initially seated at small table for two in the middle of the dining area.  After placing our appetizer order, a larger table against the wall opened up.  I politely asked if we could move there and our waiter happily moved us over without any hesitation.Our appetizers arrived and were phenomenal.  I had ordered the Yellowfin Tuna wrapped in thick Italian bacon, stuffed with foie gras and topped with black truffle vinaigrette.  The word ""wow"" doesn't even begin to describe how amazing it tasted.  About 10 minutes after finishing our apps, the waiter brought two very small bowls of gazpacho with crostini, compliments of the chef.  Nice touch.For the entree, I ordered the 16oz NY cut Sirloin which was a great steak.  You can probably have better at a great steakhouse, but nevertheless, this was still a good choice.  It had a nice touch of blue cheese fondue spread on top and a red wine mushroom glaze.  The sweet potato gratin side was tasty as well.Dessert was the only part that was a slight letdown, but turned out to be great thanks to the waiters.  We ordered the  Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge and the Chocolate Sticky Toffee Cake.  I'm not gonna lie, I thought both were rather bland.  They weren't bad, but I was expecting something more for the price.  We didn't finish either one, but sat at our table enjoying our drinks.  I was about to ask for the check, when two waiters came over and asked us to get up with our drinks and follow them.  We were both confused, but were pleasantly surprised when they led us to a new table right by the window overlooking the lower Manhattan skyline.  They told us we could finish out drinks here and no need to rush.  I thought that was very nice of them and unexpected.  Granted, the restaurant was now at 50% capacity, but still a great touch.  To top it all off, they returned 5 minutes later with a 3 tier dessert tray filled with handmade chocolates, compliments of the chef.  I can still taste the sea salt caramel dark chocolate truffle.Amazing dining experience all around.  It's not cheap, but it is highly recommended- especially for special occasions.",5.0
"We enjoyed a wonderful Sunday brunch at the River Cafe. Pre-planned as a surprise for my mother's 85th birthday, the River Cafe did not disappoint. Most all reviewers have commented on the view, so I won't elaborate further than to say--stunning. While the price was high, $55 per person for brunch--with coffee and tea being extra--the food and service were both exquisite. From the time we arrived to the time we left our every need was attended to. From the first person we met, the valet, to the last person we saw, the host, everyone was unfailingly polite and upbeat.The mixed reviews I have read about the quality of the food are surprising as we had many different courses between the 4 of us and all were a taste to savor and enjoy. The portions are neither large nor small, but I could see how for the price so people would expect more.We were treated, as many mentioned, to a small treat ""compliments of the chef"". Ours was a banana yogurt, served with granola and cream. It was served in an egg shell. Both unique and tasty.From there, brunch consists of an appetizer and a main course. My appetizer was smoked rainbow trout-- a fish that usually at best is a little better than bland-- however, it was juicy and very flavorful. My main course was the brazino fillet, again, cooked to perfection.The atmosphere was not stuffy, or pretentious, but a nice mix of different people out enjoying a Sunday brunch--couples, families, friends. Some people were dressed in their Sunday best and others were casual. While there was a great deal of chatter, it was not loud enough that you couldn't enjoy the fine piano music.Give it a try, I don't think the River Cafe will disappoint!",5.0
"Amazing service, terrific views, delicious food. We had the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairing, which was excellent. Each dish was stellar and wines were perfectly matched.

"Wonderful restaurant with amazing views! This place is perfect for a special occasion. We just went for our 1 year wedding anniversary. It is very expensive, so be prepared, but well worth it. The food is outstanding, so too is the service. Just make sure you have several hours blocked off for dining, you will need it.

"It was our first night in NY after having travelled from CA.  We took a cab to River Cafe upon the advice of friends.  We wanted to have a quick drink and take in the view before heading out to dinner in Brooklyn.  We had on nice jeans, and I was in my heels.  We were not dressed for dinner, but to sit outside for a cocktail, we were fine.One of the bartenders took our order and told us to take a seat outside.  There was only one other couple sitting outside.  They had room, and it was early.  We went outside and were looking for a table when the very rude hostess stopped us and said we couldn't stay because there was a $25 min.  We said that's fine...then she changed it and said it is $25 per person.  It was obvious she was making it up.  We left thinking that this is what they are talking about when they say new yorkers are rude.  And by the way....we ended up loving new yorkers...it was the tourists who are rude.I would never go back and will let people know that if they want to have a nice experience to go elsewhere.",1.0

That is a nice change from being expensive and NOT worth it! i posted some pics of the steak etc..  GORGEOUS view... like no other!",5.0
"Service threw me off - some staff were overly and uncomfortably formal, while others were friendly and delightful - guess it just depends.  They gave us all the time we wanted, at least.  Anyway, the FOOD was outstanding.  Portobello mushroom soup starter - very nice.  Appetizers - foie gras two ways was fantastical (loved!), and veal and dumplings with bone marrow so satisfying.  For entrees the beef wellington was outstanding, but unfortunately the branzino was quite a disappointment - simply nothing special at all.  I regretted ordering it for at least the next 24 hours - so many more amazing options!  Dessert - sorbets very good, creme brulee excellent, and chocolate brooklyn bridge pretty good but not amazing (maybe amazing if you like light/fluffy chocolate).  Wine list excellent.  A little bit crowded - I would have preferred to sit in the outdoor patio space, regardless of view.  Oh yeah, Anne Hathaway was dining behind us, if you care about celeb sightings.  Overall wonderful experience and perfect for a special occasion.",4.0
"Unfortunately I have not yet had actual food here, but I have had drinks and cake! The view alone is every reason for going to The River Cafe! It is one of my favorite views of the city, and awesomely located beneath the Brooklyn Bridge ( my favorite bridge!) The wait staff is extremely and exceptionally nice for such a high end place. Usually servers in such high end establishments are stuffy, rude, and unhelpful....it is quite the opposite here! I took my girlfriend here for a belated birthday celebration and got her a cake. The look of the cake alone was impressive...but even more-so upon tasting it. It was decorated with a chocolate replica of my favorite bridge, with 'happy birthday' written in chocolate sauce. It was delicious...sweet but not overpoweringly rich. We had some sort of lemonade cocktails referred by the server....had a few too many as I cannot remember what they were called...but very refreshing. The atmosphere is beautiful and they always have fresh flowers, to me, adding even more beauty if possible. I look forward to trying the food next time I am there...it is very tempting as it smells so good:)",5.0

"It's been many moons since I've been here, but I'm sure it's still as heavenly as ever!I went here after seeing a Broadway show, cabbed there. When I made reservations for this place, I was doubtful, I mean it's in Brooklyn of all places! But after reading many reviews, I decided to give it a chance. When first arriving, the first thing you notice is the size of the place, it's tiny  looking and of course, you can tell right away that the place has an amazing view. I made dinner reservations around 7 pm, it was faith that I was able to get a table.When I walked in, I was quickly greeted and was seated right away. Got a table by the window (something you must request and is a recommended MUST), and the waiter followed as the hostess left. The waiter was very inviting and knowledgeable. He walked us through each of the dishes and answered all of our questions. We placed our orders and thought we were going to wait forever for our entrees. Not the case!To our surprise, the chef sent out two special dishes for us to taste (on the house!), both to die for! I wanted more, but didn't want to seem like a pig so I munched on the bread. I didn't do the prix fixe menu, I did the a la carte. For appetizer, I had their crab and scallop salad, AND their tuna tartar, everything just melted in my mouth! For my entree, I ordered their fillet with their baby lobster, I felt like there was a party in my mouth. Everything was so good! I was floating on air! I wanted more....! Even though I thought the portions were a little on the small side, I was actually full by the time dessert came around.What did I have for dessert...? Their chocolate Brooklyn bridge creation of course! I'm going to state this of hand, I'm not a chocolate fan, but that was something I'll never forget! Everything about it was wonderful. When the waiter brought out my dessert, I actually felt bad sticking my fork into it because it was so beautiful! But it was meant for eating, so I ate it. Every last bit!This is one of those hidden gems that I would come to again, and again if I was living in NYC, but unfortunately for me, I don't. The serve was wonderful! Top notch! So attentive and our glasses was never emptied. It was a two-hour meal for us, but every second was worth it. The view? Breath taking! The food? Delightful!

We've all eyed this place and it's ONE OF A KIND view from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory or stood next to it whilst on line for Grimaldi's. It was pretty amazing. The view made everything taste at least 100x better. I had the crab bisque soup to start which was amazingly yummy and then the lobster lobster as my entree which was bizarre but definitely excellent. It consisted of a fancy lobster grilled cheese type sandwich and a lobster tail in some decadently rich sauce with fresh veggies. Everything was so rich. We couldn't move. Of course I was easily convinced to get dessert (it was a special occasion, after all) and ordered the chocolate brooklyn bridge. We ate everything, including the Brooklyn Bridge.

Took my boyfriend there for his birthday and I couldn't have been prouder of myself for picking this breathtakingly beautiful restaurant to make his day special.From beginning to end, the service was just outstanding. The you also get to experience the beautiful view of Manhattan. We went for dinner and they have a set price menu where you get many choices to choose from. I have the Colorado Rack of Lamb wish was D.ELI.C.I.O.U.S!!!!! Everything was just done just right. The dessert are so cute and very artistic looking. I had a hard biting into it because of how beautiful it was but I'm glad I did because it tasted as good as it looked.Everyone was so attentive and was on top of their games and held themselves to their highest standards. All I have to say is the place was magnificent. Go if you want to experience a good restaurant and be left with memories that can last forever. I will definitely go back again and if I were to choose a place to hold all my special events, it would be my number choice. Keep up the great work River Cafe!!!!!",5.0

"Quite possibly the nicest restaurant I've ever been to IN MY LIFE.  And not to sound like a snooty dbag, but I've eaten at a lot of nice places.The view, of course, accounts for at least half of your bill, but you won't even notice because you'll be staring out the window at the gorgeous view.  Even if you're a jaded, bitter, why-do-I-still-live-here-when-I-make-no-money-and-I-constantly-get-touched-inappropriately-on-the-subway type of New Yorker, a table at the River Cafe will quickly transport you back to when you were a wide-eyed youngster, dreaming of moving to the ""Big Apple.""This was the long, tedious way of saying, ""be prepared to drop some cash.""  The menu is prix fixed, which means that you have no choice but to spend $98 a head.  And if you're a boozehound like me, you're probably going to rack up at least $40 on a bar tab.  Just put it in the back of your mind--you're here now, and the next time you'll be able to afford to come back is probably in five years, so enjoy it.For $98, you get your choice of an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  My favorite appetizers were the braised rabbit and dumplings, and the wild rock lobster.  For my entree, I had the branzino, which was like I died and went to fish heaven (FYI, in fish heaven, it doesn't smell like fish).  Everything was delicately plated and the portions, while not huge, were not skimpy.  Of course, you've got to end the night with the infamous Brooklyn Bridge chocolate cake, and then call a town car to take you home--tonight you're pretending you're a millionaire, and millionaires don't take the F train.",5.0
"I went with my sister and best friend, this is a beautiful place with wonderful food. Everywhere you sit in the main dining area would give u a wonderful view of the city. The dress attire is classy and nice. If you want the view in the main dining area you have to have the pre fixed meal for dinner at 100 a person it was hard to swallow. But the waiter staff was very nice even though we arrived late. I just wished that I could of had the window seat. Just remember the population that eats here are usually not your young and trendy it's a classy place majority of the people were in their 40""s when we went. At the price I wouldn't be surprised. It's definite a wonderful place for a special occasion in the evening. one thing to remember i would not go there without an reservation, the main dining area is cozy and small, and parking is valet or you have to walk a bit on cobbler streets for the ladies:)",4.0

I was beyond impressed and am planning to go back to this location.",5.0
"wow, great view of lower manhattan and the brooklyn bridge.  Service was very top notch - they made sure that my friend has his share of his bread (six times).  And my duck was perfect.  The brooklyn bridge cake was kind of cheesy but it was good too.  I would definitely go back here again.",5.0
"You gotta live your life and you also got to experience life to the fullest by exploring places that can leave an impression. The Rive Cafe is one of them. I am an avid diner and i know good service and food when I get it and the River cafe was all about that. Took my boyfriend there for his birthday and I couldn't have been prouder of myself for picking this breathtakingly beautiful restaurant to make his day special.From beginning to end, the service was just outstanding. The you also get to experience the beautiful view of Manhattan. We went for dinner and they have a set price menu where you get many choices to choose from. I have the Colorado Rack of Lamb wish was D.ELI.C.I.O.U.S!!!!! Everything was just done just right. The dessert are so cute and very artistic looking. I had a hard biting into it because of how beautiful it was but I'm glad I did because it tasted as good as it looked.Everyone was so attentive and was on top of their games and held themselves to their highest standards. All I have to say is the place was magnificent. Go if you want to experience a good restaurant and be left with memories that can last forever. I will definitely go back again and if I were to choose a place to hold all my special events, it would be my number choice. Keep up the great work River Cafe!!!!!",5.0
"My boyfriend took me here on my birthday and it was one of the best birthdays ever. i loved the goat cheese cake it was great!! of course the portions are not big but if your looking to impress a date and have some extra cash to throw around, by all meansdo it in this place. we went in may but we stopped by during the christmas season and the decor and scenery took our breath away. real romantic place.",4.0
"Quite possibly the nicest restaurant I've ever been to IN MY LIFE.  And not to sound like a snooty dbag, but I've eaten at a lot of nice places.The view, of course, accounts for at least half of your bill, but you won't even notice because you'll be staring out the window at the gorgeous view.  Even if you're a jaded, bitter, why-do-I-still-live-here-when-I-make-no-money-and-I-constantly-get-touched-inappropriately-on-the-subway type of New Yorker, a table at the River Cafe will quickly transport you back to when you were a wide-eyed youngster, dreaming of moving to the ""Big Apple.""This was the long, tedious way of saying, ""be prepared to drop some cash.""  The menu is prix fixed, which means that you have no choice but to spend $98 a head.  And if you're a boozehound like me, you're probably going to rack up at least $40 on a bar tab.  Just put it in the back of your mind--you're here now, and the next time you'll be able to afford to come back is probably in five years, so enjoy it.For $98, you get your choice of an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  My favorite appetizers were the braised rabbit and dumplings, and the wild rock lobster.  For my entree, I had the branzino, which was like I died and went to fish heaven (FYI, in fish heaven, it doesn't smell like fish).  Everything was delicately plated and the portions, while not huge, were not skimpy.  Of course, you've got to end the night with the infamous Brooklyn Bridge chocolate cake, and then call a town car to take you home--tonight you're pretending you're a millionaire, and millionaires don't take the F train.",5.0
"I went with my sister and best friend, this is a beautiful place with wonderful food. Everywhere you sit in the main dining area would give u a wonderful view of the city. The dress attire is classy and nice. If you want the view in the main dining area you have to have the pre fixed meal for dinner at 100 a person it was hard to swallow. But the waiter staff was very nice even though we arrived late. I just wished that I could of had the window seat. Just remember the population that eats here are usually not your young and trendy it's a classy place majority of the people were in their 40""s when we went. At the price I wouldn't be surprised. It's definite a wonderful place for a special occasion in the evening. one thing to remember i would not go there without an reservation, the main dining area is cozy and small, and parking is valet or you have to walk a bit on cobbler streets for the ladies:)",4.0

"My first five-star review.  I was surprised with a dinner at the River Cafe for my birthday.  Nestled in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, the River Cafe is on the water, with spectacular views of Manhattan.  I spent most of the meal gawking at the skyline, boats, and water taxi (yes, I'm a native New Yorker).  Okay, now the meal.  Awesome.  The menu includes a $100 prix fixe option (appetizer, entree, dessert).  Almost all of the choices sounded delicious and we had a difficult time choosing.  While waiting for our appetizers we were treated to an Asian-inspired amuse bouche.  I can only speak for myself, but my crab bisque and duck breast were wonderful.  Excellent flavors.  My other companions also ooh-ed and ahh-ed over their meals.  Steak and fish, respectively.  Dessert was also quite yummy.  As a chocolate lover, I was satisfied with my chocolate Brooklyn Bridge creation.  Sticky toffee pudding was also lovely.  After dessert we were surprised with some handmade chocolates and mini biscotti.  Staff was very attentive, refilling water, asking if anything was needed, and providing explanations for menu items.  Valet called for a car service and then ran to the street to hail us a cab (after I vetoed the car service's offer of $20 to go 2 miles).  Overall, an excellent experience.  Would definitely love to return!",5.0
"I am SUCH a fan! Gorgeous place, location, the staff are uber professional and our waiter aside from being friendly was very well dressed. This place is very expensive but oh so good! We were seated next to the window and the food adventure began with a starter the chef sent over some refreshing salmon cucumber thing with a chip. We all (4) ordered different appetizers, entrees and desserts. The scallops were the special for the day I think and were so Delicious! The rock lobster appetizer was also pretty good. The duck was so tender and crispy - not greasy or fatty. The steak came with the most delicious blue cheese sweet potato fondue was phenomenal - what a great combination! The steak had a really good flavor, the lobster was okay but apparently it was not cooked evenly and the lamb was okay but not particularly memorable. The desserts ranged from okay to good, but nothing spectacular. I listened to yelp and got the Brooklyn bridge dessert and I thought it was average and boring! The lime souffle was just plain weird, the winners were the chocolate sticky coffee cake and the apple almond tart.

"Ok, my experience here wasn't the standard evening dinner deal.My close friend had her wedding here & I have to say that the ambience was excellent (very romantic - my hair dresser told me he proposed to his wife there) views were excellent and the food that I had was delicious.Apps that I was able to try were seared tuna on a bed of crunchy something in a vinegarette (is that how you spell that word?), seared duck breast w/a touch of hoisin (sp?) glaze, fried oysters on top of mashed potatoes w/a sprinkling of cavair (disclaimer, I don't really care much for oysters, but these were daxx good!) and pigs in a blanket (my all time fav)  - but w/a twist-- the 'blanket' part was a cheese biscuit type blanket - who would've thunk you could improve on a pigs in a blanket?!  All the apps were excellent...I wanted more...but then they asked us to be seated because dinner was ready to be served.  (Basically, I'm just greedy.)For our starter it was a bib lettuce salad with a shallot vinegarette and black truffle cheese and brioche croutons - fresh ingredients and a nice blending of flavors. (yeah, the ingredients are as yummy as they sound!)Black cod on a bed of fried rice and the sauce escapes me, I want to say a squash, but I'm not 100% sure.  The cod was fresh and prepared well, the rice & sauce underneath were kinda forgettable but the presentation was lovely - the colors were v. pretty -- but the flavors were great, which is the imp thing.Seared veal medallions with a red wine reduction, carrrots and green beans and a parmesagn risotto cake - the veal was so tender!  Again, a dish where the main protein was cooked perfectly, the accompaniements were good, but not mind numbingly so.The simple fact that I can recount the dishes down to a 'red wine reduction,' level means they were pretty darn good.  How many weddings have you gone to that you're like, 'um, I think I had filet mignon, or no, was it salmon?'Dessert was a mango sorbet on top of some buttery cookie thing (the mango was mixed with basil or cilantro) wasn't my favorite but I did polish off the shortbread like cookie underneath - I'm a fan of butter...what can I say?I was amazed that the dishes were served hot, promptly - the service was excellent, staff working were very polite and friendly -- I can only imagine how well the dining room is run.And the bar has a great view, the bartendar is personable, easy to talk to and he let me sample a long grass vodka? which was light and refreshing (and free) which was cool.  (I got there a little early b/c I didn't want to make the mistake of showing up late for the ceremony, NOT b/c I'm a booze hound, well, at least not before the ceremony happens, that is.)Basically, worth it to fly in for the weekend before I head back to the UK and subject myself to the land of limited food.  I wanna go back and have a regular dining experience, the restaurant has amazing views of Manhattan and we had the terrace to ourselves!If you're in NY - try to remember how good you got it!",5.0

"River Cafe is one of a handful of top-end, highly anticipated, very expensive restaurants that I have been to that lived up to the hype and completely justified the price.  The food, drinks, service, pace of the meal, ambiance -- and lets not forget the views -- were all outstanding.  As other reviewers have noted, the atmosphere is very casual and inviting and not too stuffy.  The wine list is pretty expansive and rather overpriced, but even one of the cheapest bottles on the menu was great and perfectly matched our meals.  The portion sizes are also very adequate and by the time you get done with an appetizer, main course and dessert you walk out feeling full but not stuffed.  And if you do feel a bit full, walk it off while admiring the wonderful garden and river views of the bridge and the lower manhattan skyline just across the way.For a once-a-year or special occasion type of dinner, River Cafe is a perfect spot.",5.0

"River Cafe is one of a handful of top-end, highly anticipated, very expensive restaurants that I have been to that lived up to the hype and completely justified the price.  The food, drinks, service, pace of the meal, ambiance -- and lets not forget the views -- were all outstanding.  As other reviewers have noted, the atmosphere is very casual and inviting and not too stuffy.  The wine list is pretty expansive and rather overpriced, but even one of the cheapest bottles on the menu was great and perfectly matched our meals.  The portion sizes are also very adequate and by the time you get done with an appetizer, main course and dessert you walk out feeling full but not stuffed.  And if you do feel a bit full, walk it off while admiring the wonderful garden and river views of the bridge and the lower manhattan skyline just across the way.For a once-a-year or special occasion type of dinner, River Cafe is a perfect spot.",5.0
"First off the view is insane at this place. Went here for lunch and it was a perfect experence, except for the secret service all over this place for the vip who was eating here. Ordered the lobster and lobster which is a lobster tail and a lobster grilled cheese sandwich with black truffle. Was excellent. Also you must get the brooklyn bridge for desert, it is suberb.",5.0
"Speachless!Every thing was perfect from the moment we got ; amaising floral decoration, roamtic music, perfect service, the foos with i could die for, stuning view...Every thing to the smolest detalis.. Defenitly the most romanic dinner i had with my husband for 8March, wich is womens day!!",5.0
"the restaurant is absolutely breathtaking! the food was excellent - the salmon in particular, with the chocolate pistachio icecream for dessert! the salad was also one of the best I have ever had! Service was very attentive! we had a reservation for 2 but they very sweetly adjusted it to accomodate 2 more people - although we waited at the bar for about 45 mins to get the adjustment. I didnt mind at all - the views were absolutely breathtaking!",5.0
"OK, it was delicious and the view was amazing, but my girlfriend and I both had a stomach issues after getting home.  We both were trying each others food, so I'm not sure in particular what it was.  It was totally worth it though.  This is a once in a lifetime experience.  The service was amazing as well and not snooty at all.  Some of the other customers are a little, though.  At least we were alone by the window for most of the time.  We arrived at around 6, and it wasn't busy at all.  By 8 it definitely was.  I recommend reservations around sunset, so you get to enjoy the view during the day and night.",4.0
"i cannot even review this place because i reached out to them to discuss possibly hosting my wedding there.  the events manager luke would NOT clearly answer the question as to whether the bathroom is wheelchair accessible. these are all actual copy pastes from our emails.me: is your bathroom accessible?him: The restrooms are a bit tight,me: When you say the restrooms are ""a bit tight"" does that mean that they are too tight for a wheelchair?him:I think it would be difficult for a guest in a wheelchair to use the restrooms without assistanceme: I just need you to please clarify - can a person in a wheelchair use your bathrooms or not?him: A person in a wheelchair would most likely need assistance to use your restrooms.i had to CALL HIM and he proceeded to get defensive that my question was unclear.just wow.",1.0
"This restaurant is simply divine. From doors opening every which way you walk, to superb service, an amazing view, and, let's not forget the food. There was a wedding going on when we got there, so I'm sure if there is dining in that room usually, because the main area looked small. But, the view was simply beautiful. My boyfriend, well, fiance, originally planned to propose to me two nights ago, but he decided to do it new years eve instead. They still gave us the window seat, though there's no bad seating, really. The staff knew we had theatre tickets, and ensured us that we would be able to make it to the show because they rushed our order. The atmosphere is really rice, but when they offered us a tiny espresso cup three quarters filled with soup, I was doubtful. But the soup was just to whet our appetites, I guess, and it was deliscious, with a little crunchy disc of bread in there. The bartender was great, and he even refilled my daquiri before they brought it over from the bar, free of charge. I ordered the foie gras, not really knowing what it was, but after I was told I didn't want to back down. I ordered the french toast and apple version, and while I can't say I'll be ordering it again (not a huge fan of animal organs) it wasn't bad. My fiance ordered the rock lobster, which was pretty good, and they offered us bread from a silver tray and we chose between, french, grain, and olive bread. I orderd the branzino, knowing I like it, and he ordered the steak killed, natch. It was more than delicious. It was creamy, it was juicy, it was crispy and crunchy. They but a thin piece of amazingly crispy bread on top of it, and they pour grilled lemon juice around it, and honestly, it was astounding.  The only way I can describe it is pure and utter goodness. My fiance loved his steak, but It could have been  supermarket bought for all I knew. They way he orders his steak (well), to me makes it not worth eating to me. He also loved his mini potatoes with blue cheese, though I am not a fan of blue cheese so I didn't find it too wonderful. They let us order the dessert in advance, and since they knew about the engagement (since he called to let them know there would be no proposal) they gave us candles on each of our dishes as well as pink champagne. A little corny, but also very sweet and yummy! I got the brooklyn bridge, which was good but not wonderful. I did marvel at the brooklyn bridge chocolate, though.  He got something in which the name escapes me, but it was coconut with a raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was amazing, and he loved the coconut... thing. It's very formal, but not snobby. Not a place that makes you feel like you should be grateful to be eating there. Wonderful atmosphere, excellent service, more than excellent food.  I want to eat there every night.",5.0
"This is an excellent restaurant. It's advisable to book in advance - we went on a quiet weekday lunchtime and it was packed. If you book far enough in advance ask for a window seat, as apart from looking out over the Hudson River you will also be right next to the Brooklyn Bridge. Food and service are all top class. There's a viewing area next to the restaurant where you'll get great pictures of Manhatten across the water.

Started with some light h'ors d'oeuvres, including hummus on artichoke, perfectly fried shrimp, and a few other items.Then, a wonderful salad with some of the best croutons I've ever had.  The croutons were extremely crunchy yet light and fluffy, if that makes sense.The fish course was a blackened salmon with green beans and carrots.  The fish was the weakest link in the menu, but the green beans and carrots were perfect.The meat course was the highlight of the night.  All I can remember is the absolutely perfectly cooked pieces of beef tenderloin (it appeared to be sous vide), and the very subtle flavors of the gravy/sauce.Finally, we ended with a dessert which, by this time, I don't remember what we had because of the heavy pours of the wine ;)Besides the view and food, the wait staff are friendly and attentive.  All around a great meal!  Can't wait to bring my wife.",5.0

He's extremely nice so chit chat with him, request a song and don't forget to tip him!The service and ambiance is amazing but the food could be A LOT better. The head chef hasn't changed since 2001 but the sous chefs have so the dishes have changed, and NOT for the better.

"With the economy forcing the powers that be to extend Restaurant Week 2009 into Restaurant YEAR 2009, I was happy to indulge in Brooklyn's turn with their $24 three course lunches, dinners and, in some cases, brunches. I perused the list in TIME OUT NY and checked off my selections. So I made a list and my first lunch voyage was to one of the top dining experiences in Brooklyn, The River Cafe in Dumbo, on the relaxing shores of The East River. Opened in 1977, this New York landmark has an amazing view of Lower Manhattan. Michael O'Keefe's vision of great food, ambience and service is realized in the River Café. With Chef Brad Steelman in the kitchen, this restaurant under the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most well known destinations in the five boroughs for the combination of romance and fine dining. This place is everything Tavern On The Green has aspired to be but the tourist trap that it is and historically weak menu has kept it from being. After a short A train ride to the High Street stop, I exited the station and sauntered down to the watefront. Upon arriving for my 1pm reservation, I noticed the formal circular cobblestone driveway that allows limos to drop off guests and swing around to park on the street. There were lights on the trees and at night it must be quite a beautiful sight. I came to to the door and was greeted by a well dressed doorman who pointed me down a corrider bridge to the riverboat restaurant. The lobby is lined with flowers, fake flowers, but still..a nice touch, also some sailing items and maritime paintings hanging from the wall add to the yacht club atmosphere. The hostess at the podium checked my coat and led me into the main dining room. There is a second dining room to the left reserved for special events and offers more garden-like surroundings. The restaurant tables are elegantly adourned with the finest linen tablecloths paired with wooden, wicker-like chairs and each table along the perimeter of the room has its own mini lamp. The servers are dressed in traditional fifties style waiter dinner jackets which is appropriate as most of them are in their fifties. The younger staff seem to be the assistant managers, hostesses and kitchen personnel. I had already looked over the Restaurant Week Menu on the website. My first course was a savory lamb meatball au poivre dish with russet potato puree and cognac sauce. It was a satisfying starter and similar in quality to the meatballs I tried over at Mia Dona, although these meatballs were a bit denser. I accompanied my plate with a refreshing Pinot Grigio ($10) which was generously poured..a nice change of pace of late. The servers were very attentive but not intrusive and refilled my bread plate without asking. The second course was a three cheese ravioli with wild boar ragu. This dish was as good as any you would find in the Italian restaurants of Little Italy or Arthur Avenue. Mario Batali would have given it a ""thumbs up"". Before dessert, I was craving a pre-cocktail. So I ordered one of my favorites from the bar..a classic Grasshopper ($13). The bartender made it well using the traditional recipe. But I still think Sam Ross at Milk & Honey makes it the best. Halfway thru my Grasshopper, my waiter said that the other guests were intrigued over what I was drinking. I love being a trendsetter. There was only one choice for dessert. The kitchen chose for the menu their signature River Cafe Duet of Marquis chocolate terrine coupled with a pear sorbet and home made vanilla wafer. It was nice and light and an end to a great lunch. This place is all class and I would like to try it again for dinner with a special someone..now I just need to find her. Three course lunch with two drinks, tax and tip was $60.",4.0

I accompanied my plate with a refreshing Pinot Grigio ($10) which was generously poured..a nice change of pace of late. The servers were very attentive but not intrusive and refilled my bread plate without asking. The second course was a three cheese ravioli with wild boar ragu. This dish was as good as any you would find in the Italian restaurants of Little Italy or Arthur Avenue. Mario Batali would have given it a ""thumbs up"". Before dessert, I was craving a pre-cocktail. So I ordered one of my favorites from the bar..a classic Grasshopper ($13). The bartender made it well using the traditional recipe. But I still think Sam Ross at Milk & Honey makes it the best. Halfway thru my Grasshopper, my waiter said that the other guests were intrigued over what I was drinking. I love being a trendsetter. There was only one choice for dessert. The kitchen chose for the menu their signature River Cafe Duet of Marquis chocolate terrine coupled with a pear sorbet and home made vanilla wafer. It was nice and light and an end to a great lunch. This place is all class and I would like to try it again for dinner with a special someone..now I just need to find her. Three course lunch with two drinks, tax and tip was $60.",4.0

This was truly an amazing experience. I had duck foie grass with ahi tuna rapped around. This was one of the best Duck Foie Grass dishes I have had. I have eaten it in Europe at fiver star restaurants. And this one topped it. And my husband had the lobster that was the best lobster I had a bite and it was like someone puffed air into it. No rubber consistency at all. 5 stars all the way. It was the most priciest dinner at 450 for two people but it was worth it.,5.0

"So,...I gets myself back to the hotel just in time to gussy up for dinner. All day long it has been a surprise as to where we's guys is going to eat.

We were seated one row back from the window tables, at a round table, as there were twelve of us this time. I swear, Alan Colmes was sitting right across from us. Dinners here are Prix Fixe $98, so I went for the lobster. I don't know how they got all the meat out of the shell without tearing it up, but it sure looked like an entire lobster to me, sans/shell. The lobster was sweet and not over cooked. Susan had steak that was fantastic...we order different things and share. They also have a seven course Chef surprise meal for about $30 more ($130 per person + drinks), but only a few of us felt like being surprised and it has to be a unanimous meal choice for the entire table.Decadence is overused, especially where chocolate is concerned.

"I'm always leery about restaurants with a gimmick, say maybe the fact that they rotate, or have a great view.  Well, River Cafe wasn't good just for a restaurant with a view, but was a genuinely pleasurable dining experience.We started with the Ceviche of Taylor Bay Scallops, which was very enjoyable, as was the initial bread.  For the main course we had the Crisp Duck Breast and the Branzino Fillet, both of which were delightful.  The duck breast was an Asian fusion-type of dish, with a tangy and savory sauce.  The sea bass was interesting, topped with a crispy layer that was a nice counterpoint to the smoothness of the fish.

"My parents did not buy me battery-powered toys when I was a kid. My brothers and I played with Lego and Lincoln Logs and saying ""I'm bored"" prompted the injunction to ""Go read a book."" No surprise that when I had playdates at other kids' houses the only thing I wanted to do was play Hungry Hungry Hippos, Operation, or Sega. (No surprise either that I now make software for kids.)The worst--and most common--response to my wanting to play these games was the friend saying, in a totally bored voice, ""Oh, the batteries are dead"" or ""We lost the body parts."" That sort of disappointment is about what I felt while dining at the River Cafe. Granted, the view is amazing and you feel like you're on a big fancy boat, but in my opinion the hype about the food is complete misguided. What really gets me is that the pre-appetizer ""compliments of the chef,"" a doll-sized teacup of lobster bisque, was awesome. It made me think I was at the right restaurant, watching the sunset beyond the Manhattan skyline, peering at the Statue of Liberty in the distance, having a romantic dinner blah blah blah. The bread, too, was great--I had three fennel-raisin rolls; when the waiter came around the fourth time, I almost expected him to suggest that I cut down on carbs. All in all I guess we got off to a good start: my dirty martini was smooth and had the perfect amount of olive juice. My boyfriend and I shared two appetizers, a tuna tartare and some foie gras plate. The latter was way too sweet  (think foie gras with Welch's grape jelly). And ever had raw tuna? Well yeah, then you've had this dish. Our main courses were some kind of duck--a little overcooked even though we asked for it underdone--and sea bass or one of those white fishes that are sometimes light and melty in your mouth and sometimes dry and cafeteria-like (you guess how this one was prepared).I am a fairly critical person, but I was dying to like this place--the waitstaff was friendly and the venue was beautiful and, let's face it, everyone wants to love restaurants in Brooklyn. But all the food we were actually paying for--and when I say paying I mean really racking up the airmiles on my credit card--was mediocre. Even the desserts! I mean, how hard is it to make chocolate into something delicious? I've had better desserts at McDonald's.The point is, the River Cafe is a lovely place for a drink , especially if you can rope one of the waiters into giving you free bread. For dinner, though, you'd be better off packing a turkey sandwich and having a picnic on the Brooklyn Bridge.",2.0
"This is by far the most romantic dining experience I've ever had. The floral courtyard and Christmas lighted trees lining up the long cobblestoned driveway gives this place a fairy tale appearance. The ambience is uber fancy where a jacket is required. A piano player provides all the music reminiscent of Sinatra.The view of Brooklyn Bridge & the Manhattan skyline is breathtaking. If you do make a reservation here, ask for a table by the window months in advance. The full experience is well worth the wait. For appetizers, we had the buffalo steak tartare & warm pear salad. For the main course, we had the prime aged sirloin steak & wild striped bass. Every dish was absolutely amazing & we enjoyed over indulging ourselves here.For dessert, I had the chocolate marquise Brooklyn Bridge, a terrine of toasted hazelnut & tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. It comes with a centerpiece in the mold of the Brooklyn Bridge made out of chocolate. With all the effort they put into the mold itself, I was afraid to touch my dessert.",5.0

We Ordered the 3-course prix fixe ($98) - ignore their website - it says $95(I will denote standout dishes with an asterisk)-Amuse bouche (free) - slice of smoked salmon over a round cracker w/ cucumber raita*Foie Gras Two Ways [classic pressed terrine with fig jam and brioche melba toast poached roulade with coffee, date and almond crust] - wow, the coffee/almond crust sucked the gameyness out of the foie, coffee was a brilliant twist, surprisingly went well, the classic terrine was delish as well, very generous portions, but only served w/ 4 tiny slices of thin brioche melba, expected the fig to be caramelized more*Yellowfin Tuna [seared rare with foie gras stuffing, burgundy black truffle vinaigrette, sweet roasted onion puree] - loved this dish, the puree and vinaigrette were so synergetic, foie gras made this dish over the top, pancetta wrap being super crispy was a little slice of heaven-Prime Aged Sirloin Steak (+$7 supp)[charcoal grilled, handmade potato gnocchi and parmigiano gratin, roasted spring onions] - also garnished w/ halved cherry tomatoes on top, the caramelized onions, albeit paltry portions on top, made this dish SING!, ordered this medium, it was perfect in the middle but overcooked on the sides, expected more for +7 supp.-Cape Cod Monkfish [slow roasted suckling pig filled ravioli, muscat poached golden raisin puree, roasted mushroom filets, pork braising juices] - huge 3"" square ravioli, 2pcs of monkfish, this was nothing to write home about, just OK*Coconut Bavarian [blackberry - lime sorbet, lime syrup, blackberry compote] - sorbet was way too soft, perhaps it was on a hot plate, but the coconut tasted like a pana cotta, super rich and a thin layer of sponge cake under it*Chocolate Sticky Toffee Cake [pistachio ice cream sandwiched between dark chocolate cookies, butterscotch sauce, ronnybrook farm whipped cream] - opted out of the butterscotch sauce, cookies are really super thin, ice cream was heavenly and surrounded by pistachios on the outside, whipped cream was fresh as can beThey also offer:SIX COURSE CHEF'S TASTING MENU ($125) - ignore their website - it says $115-Taylor Bay Scallop Ceviche-Sauteed Hudson Valley Fois Gras-Maine Lobster Special-Colorado Rack of Lamb-Branzino Fillet-DessertTotal came out to $127/pp after everythingPics: meetup.com/teamfoodie/ph…",4.0
"I'm always leery about restaurants with a gimmick, say maybe the fact that they rotate, or have a great view.  Well, River Cafe wasn't good just for a restaurant with a view, but was a genuinely pleasurable dining experience.We started with the Ceviche of Taylor Bay Scallops, which was very enjoyable, as was the initial bread.  For the main course we had the Crisp Duck Breast and the Branzino Fillet, both of which were delightful.  The duck breast was an Asian fusion-type of dish, with a tangy and savory sauce.  The sea bass was interesting, topped with a crispy layer that was a nice counterpoint to the smoothness of the fish. Add in the nice view, and all in all I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here.",4.0
"We did not have an enjoyable meal.  We came for lunch and the restaurant was not busy.  We asked to be seated by the window,but we were told that we were not dressed properly to sit by the window.  The table we wanted remained empty during the entire time we were there.  We notice that a nice Indian couple, very well dresses was put further back than we were.  As was a table of four young men, flamboyant but nicely dressed.  Who got the window seats?  Old white people.  They were no better dressed than we were.  This place has serious issues.  Stay away unless you are old, white and nattily dressed or if you don't care if they give you a seat at the back of the boat.  Ugh!",1.0
"My parents did not buy me battery-powered toys when I was a kid. My brothers and I played with Lego and Lincoln Logs and saying ""I'm bored"" prompted the injunction to ""Go read a book."" No surprise that when I had playdates at other kids' houses the only thing I wanted to do was play Hungry Hungry Hippos, Operation, or Sega. (No surprise either that I now make software for kids.)The worst--and most common--response to my wanting to play these games was the friend saying, in a totally bored voice, ""Oh, the batteries are dead"" or ""We lost the body parts."" That sort of disappointment is about what I felt while dining at the River Cafe. Granted, the view is amazing and you feel like you're on a big fancy boat, but in my opinion the hype about the food is complete misguided. What really gets me is that the pre-appetizer ""compliments of the chef,"" a doll-sized teacup of lobster bisque, was awesome. It made me think I was at the right restaurant, watching the sunset beyond the Manhattan skyline, peering at the Statue of Liberty in the distance, having a romantic dinner blah blah blah. The bread, too, was great--I had three fennel-raisin rolls; when the waiter came around the fourth time, I almost expected him to suggest that I cut down on carbs. All in all I guess we got off to a good start: my dirty martini was smooth and had the perfect amount of olive juice. My boyfriend and I shared two appetizers, a tuna tartare and some foie gras plate. The latter was way too sweet  (think foie gras with Welch's grape jelly). And ever had raw tuna? Well yeah, then you've had this dish. Our main courses were some kind of duck--a little overcooked even though we asked for it underdone--and sea bass or one of those white fishes that are sometimes light and melty in your mouth and sometimes dry and cafeteria-like (you guess how this one was prepared).I am a fairly critical person, but I was dying to like this place--the waitstaff was friendly and the venue was beautiful and, let's face it, everyone wants to love restaurants in Brooklyn. But all the food we were actually paying for--and when I say paying I mean really racking up the airmiles on my credit card--was mediocre. Even the desserts! I mean, how hard is it to make chocolate into something delicious? I've had better desserts at McDonald's.The point is, the River Cafe is a lovely place for a drink , especially if you can rope one of the waiters into giving you free bread. For dinner, though, you'd be better off packing a turkey sandwich and having a picnic on the Brooklyn Bridge.",2.0
"This is by far the most romantic dining experience I've ever had. The floral courtyard and Christmas lighted trees lining up the long cobblestoned driveway gives this place a fairy tale appearance. The ambience is uber fancy where a jacket is required. A piano player provides all the music reminiscent of Sinatra.The view of Brooklyn Bridge & the Manhattan skyline is breathtaking. If you do make a reservation here, ask for a table by the window months in advance. The full experience is well worth the wait. For appetizers, we had the buffalo steak tartare & warm pear salad. For the main course, we had the prime aged sirloin steak & wild striped bass. Every dish was absolutely amazing & we enjoyed over indulging ourselves here.For dessert, I had the chocolate marquise Brooklyn Bridge, a terrine of toasted hazelnut & tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. It comes with a centerpiece in the mold of the Brooklyn Bridge made out of chocolate. With all the effort they put into the mold itself, I was afraid to touch my dessert.",5.0

All of it was delicious and proportioned perfectly. We gorged ourselves on chocolate for desert.

We dropped about $350 including wine & tip, which included a fixed price of $98 per person for appetizer, entree, & dessert. *The service is impeccable! So attentive, yet not hovering. So informative, yet not arrogant. *There is no finer view! Hint...if you want to take pics, be sure to start taking them at dusk. The dusk pis came out much better than the night pics, b/c you can still see the buildings. If you don't want to drop this kinda cash, you could eat at one of the places around the corner and walk to the park next to River Cafe and get the view...but you won't have the romantic view while you dine. *The food is great, the stuff that ""Top Chef"" is made of...fois gras, onion foam, etc... we had the soft shell crab & Seared yellow fin tuna w/ fois gras for appetizers. The Tuna...what more can I say?!- I'm still thinking about it! Had the Branzini & Steak for dinner. Steak great, Branzini was ok, but I found lacking in flavor.

"It certainly is located in a great area, and faces the city creating a romantic destination for some occasion or celebration.  It does have all the ingredients for the best night ever, including the cobblestone pull up driveway for your car.  On nice nights you can sit in the elevated garden area in front of the restaurant.  However, for me, it  just didn't fulfill all it's promises.  From the rats that were hanging out  in the garden when I went last to the food,  it was only good.  Nothing was really spectacular.  The waitstaff was decent, ambience ok, but somehow I just expected more especially from the hype and pricing.  I think the better and cheaper date night is to just hang out on the pier, if summertime get some icecream from Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, and who cares if it dosent mix, but sit at the bar in the restaurant (which faces the same view if not better) and get a drink instead .",3.0
went to this famous (?) resto a few years ago. was a-ok compared to what i was told by many critics. i was expecting more high-end atmosphere considering a big check we ended up.,3.0
"My husband and I took a 10 yr anniversary trip to NYC in early June 2010, and I made reservations 2 wks ahead for River Cafe. Here are some facts... *Yes it is expensive...but so were all the other 5 star places (Daniel's, Savoy, etc..) We dropped about $350 including wine & tip, which included a fixed price of $98 per person for appetizer, entree, & dessert. *The service is impeccable! So attentive, yet not hovering. So informative, yet not arrogant. *There is no finer view! Hint...if you want to take pics, be sure to start taking them at dusk. The dusk pis came out much better than the night pics, b/c you can still see the buildings. If you don't want to drop this kinda cash, you could eat at one of the places around the corner and walk to the park next to River Cafe and get the view...but you won't have the romantic view while you dine. *The food is great, the stuff that ""Top Chef"" is made of...fois gras, onion foam, etc... we had the soft shell crab & Seared yellow fin tuna w/ fois gras for appetizers. The Tuna...what more can I say?!- I'm still thinking about it! Had the Branzini & Steak for dinner. Steak great, Branzini was ok, but I found lacking in flavor. Had the Chocolate Marquise Bridge and Apple tart for dessert. Someone in your party has to get the bridge dessert just so you can see it, and it tasted great.",5.0
Pricey but well worth it :) All the view Giando has with out the crappy service. My steak was cooked just right no complaints here. Alot of restaurants need to take notes.,4.0
"Tremendous place and a New York institution. The view is fantastic, the atmosphere and service are impeccable, and the food is stellar. Excellent seafood with waiters that know how to give legitimate and objective opinions and a wine pairing or two. The brunch is great - perfect for a (pre-planned and reservations-secured) weekend meal, particularly before a museum or theatre visit perhaps. The dinner is equally impressive, arguably more so, and the view of the water and Manhattan is  really breathtaking. A lot of fun and absolutely worth shelling out for if you want to really enjoy an inimitable piece of the NYC restaurant scene.",5.0
"Went here with my wife as part of our nyc wedding anniversery.  Everyone talks about the view of the river and lower manhattan.  And its true.  It is a beautiful view.  But . . . there's also the view of your fellow eaters.  We sat so close to the couple next to us that we felt like we were eating at the same table.  That would be fine if we actually knew them and had inteded a dinner for four.  But as we were two separate couples who had never met each other eanc trying to have a romantic meal for two, it was quit awkward.  Also the restaurant itself is not very becoming.  A felt a bit as though I was on one of those river boat casinos on the missippi river.  Now for the food:  my wife got the duck and the carmelized apple almond tart (I forget what she had for appetizer).  I had the diver sea scallop (that's right singular as it only cam with one scallop), the steak, and the chocolate marquis for dessert.  Niether of our appetizers were anything to write home about and my scallop was not big enough to have only one on the plate.  My wifes duck was not crispy (despite the name) and still had that layer of fat under the skin which turned her off a bit to the meal.  My steak on the other hand was the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly cooked and nicely charred on the outside.  It was really delicious.  My chocolate dessert was also nice but the apple tart was, again, mediocre.  I think this restaurant could get 4 stars if we were sitting on top of our neighbors and if the price wasn't so expensive.  For the price we paid, we expected more delicious food.  We went to several michelen-starred restaurants over the weekend and this was the weakest (Ai Fiori was nice, and eleven Madison Park blew our minds).  We will not come back to this restaurant.",3.0
"We have been going to the River Cafe for many years, you can count on the view the service and the food BUT you can't count on the crowd.  The last time I was there there were 2 high priced escorts with business men and a table full of tourists with shorts (it was lunch) but still who wants to sit with all this at these prices?!",5.0

River Cafe is FANTASTIC! The service is absolutely amazing. I went there for restaurant week and the service and food were fantastic. The food is so flavorfull and the wine list is excuisite. They have a very sweet German Reisling that went perfectly with our food. I would def recommend it.,5.0
"i don't eat here often, but it is such a pleasure when i do.  i've come here with my father and step-mother for thanksgiving dinner for the last 3 of 5 years when they have visited.  we all love it so much...the atmosphere, the staff, the food, the drinks, the everything!!!",5.0
"I always think of the ""As Time Goes By"" whenever I come here.  maybe it's because the pianist was playing that the first time i dined here.  Maybe it's because this place exudes romance for me and that song is so fitting.  Whichever the case, this place is undeniably beautiful-from great service and food to amazing views.  Surely, there's nothing that compares to watching the sunset over the Brooklyn Bridge while drinking some great wine and listening to some good jazz renditions...Whether it's to dine with parents or a lover, the River Cafe is a place that will leave an imprint.",5.0
"I haven't yet been to a better special occasion restaurant.  Yes, we know it's pricey, but it's well worth it for the right occasion.  Service was perfect, the view is legendary, and the food was great.  The only negative I could possibly come up with is that when we were there, a family came in and was seated next to us, they were all in T-Shirts and Flip-Flops.  The River Cafe is Jacket required, and I certainly enjoy ""dressing up"" to go out, but I was reminded numerous times while making my res so I found it odd that they would seat them.  But everything was wonderful and they only seemed to be there for dessert.",5.0

"Phenomenal food and a fantastic view are in store for you!  However, food and view are not the only important aspects of a top restaurant.  If you want good service then you'll have to go elsewhere.  We arrived by TAXI and they would not allow the taxi to enter their circular drive.  So we had to walk in.  In addition, when we called a taxi to leave, we were served up a limo.  To get a taxi, one has to hail one's own by walking out of and off the restaurant's property.  Not a very nice manner in which to treat their patronage!  To boot, the wait service who took the order and served was completely stuffy and disingenuous.  My husband who never says anything ill, said ""they have a stick so far up their butts that it is rediculous"".  We were treated not with courteous regard, but rather with snooty and cold service.  For this reason, I give it only 2 stars and recommend that a nice evening is to be had elsewhere.",2.0

"I came here for lunch over the memorial day weekend with my mother and the views, food, and drinks were so good ! We were a smidge late because of the lovely subway, so we had to wait about 10 minutes while they cleared a table for us -- so i grabbed a drink at the bar. The Patron Silver on the rocks was soooo nice and only at 11 dollars i felt like i was robbing them. We sat one table away from the window but i dont believe it really matters, as this place is quite small and every seat is phenomenal of lower manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. The food was priced to what i would expect this caliber of a place would be for lunch. With plates starting around 15 dollars a plate it was more than reasonable for this NY legend. The food was really good, but i never felt that WOW factor like i have at places like the little owl and zaytinya. However this is a must if you live in NY or are visting, the ambiance alone is worth the pricetag.",4.0
I hosted a bachelorette weekend in NYC years ago for my best friend and 10 of us dined here to cap off the weekend.  It was scary expensive but quite literally the best dining experience I've ever had.  From the seamless service to the beautiful plating and delicious food...it was seriously perfect.  I would take a bite of my lovely warm roll and the next time I would look down there was a new lovely warm roll...what the?  I thought I was going crazy but they are like The Flash...the only evidence of their presence being a shiny new fork or a new tray of butter.  The view is stunning.  The whole meal feels like you are on a cloud somewhere.  I haven't been back but this would be a wonderful romantic dinner for a special occassion (one wonders how many rings have been hidden in cakes and puddings there) but it would be a great place to take visiting parents who get a beautiful NYC experience...(and hopefully pick up the tab).  It is a prix fixe so at least you know the damage right off the bat.  The dessert that is a chocolate Brooklyn Bridge is a nice touch.  A must NY dining experience.  Save your pennies.,5.0
