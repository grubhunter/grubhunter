"So far, I am a fan. The two women that work during the late morning are EXTREMELY nice and helpful. The cafe is pretty new, so everything is nice and shinny. However, unlike many of the new cafes that are sprouting up in the area, the prices are pretty reasonable. I typically get the turkey sandwich with a choice of a small salad or chips, which is pretty awesome. My only complaint is there is not really much to the ""small salad"" because it is more like a garnish. They should include both the small salad and the bag of chips, but that is a minor issue for me. I will return but I liked what I saw and ate. Plus, word on the street is that the roasted corn soup is amazing.",5.0
Extremely friendly and customer oriented neighborhood coffee shop. What more could you ask for?Visited a couple times while in town on vacation and was not disappointed.,5.0
"I love my neighborhood cafes!!! I love this one in particular because of the expensive ass blueberry muffins!! They are moist, sweet and delicious. The only reason this place has a 4 instead of a 5 is because I ordered the avocado smoothie and it came out like flavorless thick juice. Steer clear of those  and get a blueberry muffin and/or a rise and grind wrap!!! Neither will disappoint you",4.0
This is my go-to neighborhood coffee shop. Always a pleasant atmosphere with delicious food and drinks. My favorites are the BEST and an African Autumn tea. I also have been known to grab a latte to kickstart my day. Take a moment and stop by: you won't be disappointed!,5.0
I picked this place based on reviews and was not disappointed. The owner is AMAZING she was happy to talk with me and answer my questions. I tried the cold brew coffee from this awesome contraption and it was so smooth I didn't need sugar. Also she knew almost everyone who came in by name and greeted them as they walked in which says a lot. The bacon and egg sandwich was awesome and she didn't have a problem with adding avocado to the sandwich. Check this place out!!!!!!,5.0
"We love this new Cafe! Bright clean and the best home cooking with a gourmet vibe! The food is high quality and the owner is right there! Ambiance: cute and clean, neutral colors and hardwood floorsFood: WHAT?! Egg sandwich on fresh Rye bread with herbed GOAT CHEESE spread... Why don't mind if I do! Delicious! My fiancé got the BST and he LOVED IT! Even came with a beet green salad which was also served with diced tomatoes! Coffee: they have an espresso machine, but I don't know how much use it gets next to the 12 HR Cold Brew Drip contraption! Fun to watch and delicious to drink! Overall this place is a must AT LEAST once a week for the outstanding coffee and perfect breakfast!",5.0
I pass by this establishment everyday after I drop my son off at school. Decided to give it a shot today. I really enjoyed my latte. It gave me that kick to start my morning. Definitely going to be stopping more often. The owner of the place is really friendly and welcoming.,5.0
"Nice, Clean and Friendly Cafe ShopI had the BST very tasty and The Staycation.",4.0
"Daaggggg. No but for real!!! While there are different cafes in this ever-changing community, this place really exceeded my expectations. The avocado with toast to which I added bacon, tasted so fresh; it was light yet filling. Since the juice I ordered tasted like the actual juice that comes directly from the fruit, the grape flavored Honest juice box is my drink of choice from here on out. The amazing flavor of the toast and juice made me want more. So I ordered the Muffin of the Day (Zucchini) and the Holiday Spice tea. OMG! I was like this can't be life or rather why can't life be like this on the regular. For real though, I was like we are not in Brooklyn anymore. We must be on a farm in the south or Midwest somewhere. I also got to taste the coconut cake...the best cake I've ever tasted. And I don't even really like coconut.As for the ambiance, it's spacious and cozy in a modern sense. A nice place to go solo or with one or two other people. Good customer service too. Looked as if everyone was on point.I'll be back, again and again and again.",5.0
"Came here with my boyfriend and his brother's and father for a light brunch over the weekend.  It's a quiet spot. The staffs super friendly. Great atmosphere. I love their decorations. Besides that let me tell you about the food.Me and my boyfriend share a pasta it was perfectly season not overly salty. I love the fact they added roasted vegetables with a light vegetarian cream puree  mix with pesto sauce and served with a  toasted garlic crostini to go with it. It's probably not a good idea to share this dish with someone.  It was a perfect blend with everything. If your a cofffee lover like myself.  You must try their 11 hour slow drip coffee its perfectly blend not water down and just add good drops of milk and 2 packs of sugar and its just right. My boyfriend's brother ordered a ""The Smokey "" it's a sliced turkey,  provolone cheese served with spinach and roasted tomatoes all fresh ingredients toasted on a french baguette with honey mustard and mayo. My boyfriend's father ordered something light a ""figs in a blanket "" it's a french baguette lightly toasted with prosciutto, Muenster cheese and spinach with a fine spread of fig spread. Comes with a  bedded salad.  If you wanted something light get the  figs in the blanket.  The desserts if you see the coconut pound cake on the counter order that. The cake is light and fluffy super moist and also add for some mango puree sauce. Its super amazing dessert.  After i had that i still stop thinking about them.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  This place is great for a light brunch. They also have a small section for outdoor seating but why sut outside when you could sit inside with comfort cushion seats. Great family gatherings or out with girls friends  either or. Its a great place.",5.0
MmmmmmmI'm addicted to their muffins!!!I'm a real estate broker that work a lot in the area and trying all the coffee places and I'm driving all the way from Fort Greene for their fresh muffins :)))Thanks for making my days sweet,5.0
"Drove by this place and was so curious by the awesome reviews and sweet interior you see through their huge glass window, I had to try it during my lunch break. Their cold brew is awesome. The large size kept me going for hours and tasted great even when I left in the fridge for a bit. Like all cold brews, it is a bit bitter. Add some of their simple syrup and you take care of that. I came in the morning another time and learned that all their goods are baked right in that oven you see behind the counter. I'm always a little skeptical, but I became a total believer when I saw the freshly baked muffins in their tins on top of the oven. I also saw her check on some cookies that were baking. What?!?!?! Grabbed a muffin with my coffee because I couldn't resist. Smelled like butter on my way to work and I quickly ate it. So good. Haven't tried it yet, but saw the mammoth of the coconut cake on the counter looking pretty darn sexy. Next time, I want to try it. It is their best seller.Oh, and ask for a loyalty card. Pretty sure I will fill that baby up real quick. They've been open for only 3 months, I've been their twice, and they've stolen my heart. Good coffee and treats is all I need.",5.0

"Macdonough Café a perfect addition to the neighborhood.  Finding a good coffee and somewhat healthy breakfast place nearby was a task, but not anymore.  Here's the skinny:Great coffee, which includes, drip, cold brew (Kyoto), fresh baked goods (baked on premise) and a friendly staff. This place has plenty of potential and I hope they do well.",4.0
