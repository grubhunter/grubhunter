"YUUUMMMMMMMM!!!! The place is nothing fancy and the Asian bartender is a weirdo, butttttt the FOOD WAS AMAZING. Mac and cheese: baked to perfection. Just the right amount of cheese portion could be bigger but it's on the menu as a ""starter"" so I get it. Fries: seasoned to perfect for those who love salty foods like I do. Crispy and you can tell they are fresh fries and not frozen. THE BURGER: definitely seasoned by a Latino/a you could taste the adobo LOL However, it wasn't overwhelming and was cooked just how I ordered it (medium well) probably THE BEST burger I've ever had. Wings: my boyfriend had the wings and said they were amazing. I'm not really a jerk kind of girl (too spicy for me) and he's not all that trustworthy so you're on your own with thoseAll in all, we will definitely be returning. They also have boozy hot chocolate which I will try next time.",5.0
"The highlight of the brunch was definitely the $3 Bloody Marys! Besides that, most went downhill during that brunch. The wait time for our food was super long and then the waitress asks for our credit or debit card to ""secure our place"" aka not leave the restaurant while the chef is slowly making our burger and waffles. It was a very strange and rude request that made no sense. We were not expecting to leave early and we were the only people in the restaurant besides a couple of people at the bar (most likely friends with the staff).I was disappointed with the bacon cheese waffles with egg. It was basically a Belgium waffle with an egg, slices of bacon and melted cheese throw in the middle. I had bigger expectations, such as bacon and cheese *infused* in the actual waffles, but I guess the chef lacks in creativity & skill.The waffles did not come with syrup or butter and we asked the waitress for them. She never came back to update us whether or not they were available (but what kind of brunch place does not have them)?! The breakfast burger was large but your standard burger with egg and a side of chopped potatoes.They had rickety bar stool chairs. They have one bathroom in the back with no soap. So I went back to the table and used hand sanitizer that I always bring with me in my purse. I would go somewhere better for brunch!",2.0
"I guess we must have at a bad time for Brooklyn Stoops. I came to meet a friend for lunch at the stoops. The atmosphere for the stoops was pretty okay nothing to fancy or memorable. Just older brick restaurant feeling.To the reason on why the BK Stoops received two stars. They had one waitress for a busy lunch hour which was really crazy because she was also the bartender. So btw making drinks, she took like 15 orders. We notice that ppl came in the restaurant assuming they were going to work, because they knew there way around the bar. So I got ahead of myself thinking she would get help with drinks or food. Whelp, I was wrong  they got their own utensils to feed themselves.... Hmmmm! The food came out after 2 drinks and a 45 min after appetizer. The food was ok, some parts was cold. The wings was pretty good.",2.0
"Please create a menu and perfect it. I've been coming to Stoops since they first opened and the inconsistency is ridiculous. The food was great when they first opened, got worse then better now it's bad again.",3.0
The customer service is poor. The bartender with the purple hair kept playing her kind of music. We asked for the music to be turned down. She will turn it down and then turn it back up. Beside that the drinks and food are good. Happy hours is good. But good luck trying to get their attention to order a drink. And the food takes for ever to come out. You just have to deal with their lack of attention.,2.0
"I just moved to the area and I think i'm going to become a regular. The bar staff (Marshall - thank you, youre amazing) are polite and attentive. The waitstaff, Brandon, is super nice too! They have fun activities, like Trivia Night on Wednesdays - you definitely want to come early because the place gets packed with all these geniuses. The food is just super effin good. Like, I love the idea of not being a great cook. Brooklyn Stoops saves me. Thank you Chef for the most amazing meals and hospitality. Thank you guys for welcoming me to the neighborhood. xoxo",5.0
"Before I say anything unfavorable I will say that the brunch here was absolutely tasty. My egg and cheese turkey sausage panini press was perfect, my home fries were also very good but I prefer skinless potatoes. The mimosa was weak. I didn't feel rushed or pressed to make quick decisions by the server. My girlfriend and I was able to sit for hours laughing and talking with no pressure. Brooklyn Stoops is obviously where Bushwick hipsters come to chill. Nice atmosphere for hanging out in their backyard  patio. The inside is quite dark and was a bit quiet - turn on pandora or something, this is not the library. I can't imagine the servers can see well since its so poorly lit. My mimosa glass was filthy. I ran my finger around the rim and was left with some type of gray dust residue. Eww!! I sent it back and the next glass wasn't as bad but wasn't much better. My server was apologetic in her own way. ""Oh shyt"" The food was really good and they have good menu options to choose from but I will pass because cleanliness trumps taste for me.",3.0
"I've watched a Thursday night and a Monday night football game here at Stoops. They do show the games on smallish TVs, but what's playing is sort of just an afterthought. This is in no way a sports bar or a venue you'd choose to get hammered. Stoops is just a meet-up neighborhood bar with good happy hour deals, a pretty standard yet good menu, and with clientele just as diverse as the rapidly diversifying neighborhood. The name suits it well. HH goes until 8. I believe it starts at 2pm but don't quote me. If you don't mind the cheap stuff, you can get $3 beers during this time. There is also a $6 special for a canned beer and a shot which is an all-hours deal. I've tried their burger and their bacon avocado quesadilla, both of which are super.Service is, I don't know... New York. Brandon is pretty great. Everyone else is just there for a paycheck. Check out the back patio and have a drink on the carpentered stoops or at the reggae bar if it's warm.",4.0
"I had the jerk wings and mac n cheese with the spike tea then spiked lemonade, my bf had a quesadilla with jalapeno poppers with a heineken1. Liquor was so watered down during happy hour it wasnt even funny.. Drinks taste like water with a shot of vodka2. Veeery yummy food it made the water w/ vodka tolerable3. Stick with the beersIm going to give them another shot outside of happy hour bcuz they have really good food. The vibes were good. Mixed crowd. Good music for the most part. Staff cool ppl and attentive. Bartenders need to look up every now n then to see who needs service but hey they have REAL baked mac n cheese. UPDATE: Went back i told the new adorable waitress about my water with vodka she made my margherita actually two to perfection. God bless her.",4.0

The food was overall great :) i would definitely recomment this spot if you're looking for something affordable in Brooklyn.Also they do accet carda but theres a $20 minimum.",4.0
Great place for cheap drinks and food! I had the pesto grilled cheese with the tomato and cucumber salad. It was just what I needed for the day. Very delicious and refreshing.

"This place was cool when it was a neighborhood bar. Now that it's sold out to the hipsters, it's not as down to earth.

This mob style atmosphere by the bartenders and some of the regulars makes it an unsafe environment for some people. I've personally been attacked here and nothing had been done.

"I went here with a friend and her boyfriend on a Thursday evening around 5PM. We didn't love the music, it was very mellow. The space was not very big and I imagine at a later time on a weekend it could get crowded inside. There were some people outside, but we didn't go out there because it was freezing outside. The bartender was very nice and open. I asked for a sangria and that he make it very sweet. That was the best sangria I have ever had in my life. He didn't scoop it out of a bin or pour it out of a pitcher like most places do with sangria a. He made it fresh on the spot. I was surprised. They seemed to have a decent variety of beers and my friend and her boyfriend enjoyed their smutty nose(I think that's what I was called). Also they a tv which allowed people to watch sports. I would return there solely for the sangria, not so much the atmosphere. I believe the sangria was 4 or 5 bucks during happy hour.",3.0

"Brooklyn Stoops you have such great potential! You have good and reasonably priced food, your beer menu is on point and you have an outside!!

"Friends and I came here for Trivia Night. Since we were both a larger crowd and got there just as trivia was starting, we funneled into the back patio. We proceeded to win 3 out of 4 of the rounds, however, the bartender decided to disqualify us. After the 3rd round, the bartender asked us to come inside to finish the trivia -- he didn't say why. We said no, because we were there with over 10 people, even though only 4 of us were playing trivia.

"So, this place was cool. Tip: there is a huge patio outdoors that isn't advertised very well. We were there for over an hour before I wandered to find a bathroom and realized there was this huge outdoor space with lots of people hanging out. It's kinda Narnia-esque in that fashion, but they should totally promote that gem better. There is also a second bar out there but it didn't seem to be open..? On a Saturday night in summer nonetheless..Who knows! Maybe someone played hooky from work tonight. We waited a good 20 minutes to get a drink at the bar inside - they were fairly busy at the time. However, the bartender was not paying attention to our end of the bar, but was serving everyone at the other end. I think they needed more staff for the amount of people in there tonight. Cool drink specials for happy hour all the way until 9pm - $6 for a PBR can and a shot of well liquor of your choice. $4 ""spiked lemonade"" - choose your liquor and they'll put it in pink lemonade that sits on the bar in a big plastic jug. $4 sangria too! Lots of cheap options. That pink lemonade is the delicious type of drink that you don't think is strong but then 15 mins later you're feeling pretttty happy. Highly suggested for those who like a lot of sweet while they're drinking. I would need to go back to see how the food and table service is - I did notice a man at a table eating with friends constantly needing to approach the bar for things since his waitress had disappeared. He looked more and more aggravated each time. He also didn't seem to be enjoying the playlist that consisted entirely of Drake and Lil Wayne. Kinda odd music choices for the atmosphere, decor, and crowd that were in there. To each his own, Madame bartender. So, overall: cheap drinks, kinda slow service, nice patio. Has great potential to be an amazing place if they would just get some more people on staff who can handle the crowds! I'd go back, though.",4.0

On a Saturday night in summer nonetheless..Who knows! Maybe someone played hooky from work tonight. We waited a good 20 minutes to get a drink at the bar inside - they were fairly busy at the time. However, the bartender was not paying attention to our end of the bar, but was serving everyone at the other end. I think they needed more staff for the amount of people in there tonight. Cool drink specials for happy hour all the way until 9pm - $6 for a PBR can and a shot of well liquor of your choice. $4 ""spiked lemonade"" - choose your liquor and they'll put it in pink lemonade that sits on the bar in a big plastic jug. $4 sangria too! Lots of cheap options. That pink lemonade is the delicious type of drink that you don't think is strong but then 15 mins later you're feeling pretttty happy. Highly suggested for those who like a lot of sweet while they're drinking. I would need to go back to see how the food and table service is - I did notice a man at a table eating with friends constantly needing to approach the bar for things since his waitress had disappeared. He looked more and more aggravated each time. He also didn't seem to be enjoying the playlist that consisted entirely of Drake and Lil Wayne. Kinda odd music choices for the atmosphere, decor, and crowd that were in there. To each his own, Madame bartender. So, overall: cheap drinks, kinda slow service, nice patio. Has great potential to be an amazing place if they would just get some more people on staff who can handle the crowds! I'd go back, though.",4.0
"Happy hour everyday from 2p-8pm. Beer, well drinks, sangria and wine all under $6. Bomb ass dinner specials all under $15. Need I say more?? Run, don't walk here after you get out of work. I've been looking for a reasonably priced happy hour spot in Brooklyn for some time. These days, Brooklyn bars can be just as expensive as Manhattan bars. My coworker who used to live in the area where Brooklyn Stoops is, put me on. I am forever indebted to her. No more spending $10+ on shitty drinks and burning through my measly paycheck. I can eat [a lot] and drink [a lot] for all under 30 bucks.",5.0
"The burger is nothing to write home about. It's not a one ""$"" place, it's a ""$$"". The girl who took my order on the phone was rude and sounded annoyed because she couldn't hear me. When I came to pick it up I told her I had put an order in she said I can't hear you AGAIN with this smug look on her face. I don't think she has the ears or friendly face to be a person behind the bar. Also I got a dollar extra charge just to use my card when the burger is already sub par at $11.95, wait, dollar charge...$12.95",3.0
Came here twice in the last month and it was really good for brunch.the menu is mostly items under $10 so if you're looking to spend a little on brunch this is the spot. It's not super busy either on Sundays so that would be a good day to go.,4.0
"I really want to give 5 stars, but the service was a little slow, and if your credit machine regularly goes out then maybe you should have an ATM.Beyond that, I loved this place. Great prices on drinks, food, and a daily special ($1 taco tuesdays, trivia wednesdays) and a happy hour that lasts from 2-9!!! The staff were friendly and casual, the food was well prepared and the atmosphere was assisted with a playlist you would play at home smoking a j with your friends playing monopoly. Even though I was only in town for 5 days, we visited 3 times and I'll certainly be back next time I'm around.",4.0
"Delicious food . Specifically the sides (mac & cheese, string beans & potatoes) Pickle backs are a rarity in bars around the city for some reason but here they never fail you . There's also a spacious patio with a pretty large smoking section . The venue isn't fancy by any means but they have an awesome staff and Black Chef who is super kewl and excellent at his craft . Check it out !",4.0
"Was here this afternoon with 2 friends. Two of us ordered the veggie breakfast burrito and it was ok, pretty bland. The ""seasoned"" fries were seasoned with salt and pepper. This is where it gets shady. My friend ordered the breakfast burger... The bun had MOLD on it. She had two bites before she realized the issue, and didn't eat the rest. They offered to take the bun away and didn't even compensate her for the moldy burger! So gross. Service was pretty slow, but there was a game playing, so I get that. Not the mold though.",2.0
"I was all set to like this place. Great location, fun dirty-hipster ambiance, unbeatable prices. $3 mimosa with brunch? I'm on board.The woman at the bar was friendly and quick, our mimosas were in our hands almost immediately. And that was where it ground to a halt. The minutes ticked by, the mimosas were drained, and no pancakes in sight. In fact, I only saw two plates leave the kitchen in the whole 45 minutes we were there, since we were pressed for time and had to leave hungry. They looked good, but I sure hope whoever got them enjoyed them, because everyone else was sitting there hungry. My ticket was only for two people though - not sure how pancakes and a breakfast burrito can take 40 minutes, even if the kitchen was ""really backed up"", as we were informed.I did feel bad for the lady out front - as the face of it, she's got to try and smooth over everyone else's mistakes, and to her credit, she did as well as she could with what she had. I was almost tempted to give a second star just for her - but in the end, I can't justify it for a place where we never got our food.",1.0
"Brunch burger is sooooo tasty! Kudos to the chef on that patty. I'd go back JUST for that burger. Lots of good French fry options.. I went with seasoned.

Friendly staff, cool, chill environment for a Sunday brunch. ALSO, they have a backyard area which has tons of potential.",4.0
"Any decent bar with a decent size patio to sit at on a warm summer night is always good. It's even better when the drinks and the food (and I mean real food, not just finger food) are also reasonably priced.

"All around okay. I came for late brunch on a sunny Sunday with my girlfriend; we got there around 2:45. There were about 6 other folks there. Mimosas and bloodys are $3 until 3 but I swear the guy making them took 15 minutes to make ours so we only ordered one each. They use simple syrup in theirs do they're a little sweeter. I ordered the cheddar and bacon waffles and she got the bacon panini and we split the mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was alright. Definitely not the worst I've ever had but not close to the best either. Very seasoned but not a whole lot of cheese. It was a huge portion though. The waffles were okay.. They tasted like regular waffles, not anything spectacular or different and I couldn't really taste and bacon or cheddar. But again, as is the theme here, they were alright. My girlfriend said her sandwich was alright, too. Nothing terrible, nothing outstanding. The spot started to fill up when we were finishing up. I really like the local vibe of the space. One amazing thing about this place is how cheap their drafts are, especially during happy hour! They're all $4 or less! I would come back here to drink a Strongbow and try some wings but this isn't somewhere I'd go for brunch again.",3.0
"I have been to Brooklyn Stoops on several occasions now, and it is as good as it gets! With a daily happy hour that extends until 9 p.m., which includes $3.50 drafts and $4 sangrias, how could it get any better? Furthermore, the sangria is delicious, and served in a glass jar. Also, three of the four occasions that I have stopped by have been on Taco Tuesday. For just $1 ($1.25 for chicken), one gets a hard shell taco, reminiscent of those from taco kits found in grocery stores around the country- and perhaps your childhood. And with a daily menu of well-priced and tasty bar fare, there is always something for everyone!",5.0
"The happy hour here is the deal. As for anything else, it's not much. Most beers are 2.5 dollars cheaper till 9 which is great, but the space is lacking the decor is zilch and the waiters... Well why are they waiting there? The establishment features one bathroom while serving cheap beverages, so be warned. Please enjoy the Tuesday night dollar tacos while you're at it- dollar for cat food grade beef in a hard shell isn't bad but veggie tacos without beans- ie lettuce in a shell with salsa is hardly worth the buck.My point is the bar is a welcome nook in a overpriced urban hell, but the lack of amenities is a serious kick in the teeth.",3.0
"I'd give this place way more stars...if it was possible. Shit...I would marry this place if it would put a ring on it. I've been coming here for about a year now. It's cheap enough already, but they have a ridiculous happy hour and great daily specials. You could totally get annihilated in here (if that's what you're looking to do) and still have some cash leftover for the next morning when you crawl into the nearest bodega, hungover and thirsty for a Gatorade or some shit. Their food is pretty decent, but they make you wait about 30 minutes to get it - be prepared. The kitchen dudes are laid back, local block heads that don't give a rat's ass how hungry you are. I don't eat meat because I'm too cool for school and save animals on the daily, but their veggie/black bean burgers are fantastic.  I go here for their trivia night (every Wednesday at 8), hosted by the sexy man meat that works there, Marshall. His questions are more obscure than abstract art on Jackson Pollock's dick...so, study hard. The cute, little bartender, Jen, makes a mean frozen margarita in their loud ass blender that should have a introduction  theme song. And there's this creepy dude who is always there...who lives upstairs, apparently. Just steer clear from him and his wandering eyes and HANDS, and you'll be just fine. Sometimes I go here to watch the Ravens sports ball games because they have televisions and I am a true Baltimoron, douche bag at heart. God, I love this local place. I can't wait for next week's trivia - it's marked, weekly, in my ASPCA calendar!",5.0

I've since went back and their their brunch hits the spot, too. The drinks are great, they have a good amount of options.

We ordered a 2 egg with toast and homefries($6)  and a sangria ($4) and a mimosa ($3). Our server Jason was pleasant and made our drinks top notch.  We came over about 2 times to tell us they had just fired up the grill. So we ordered an extra pair of drinks.

This place isn't for the fancy , it's for the locals who prefer a nice meal and still have money in their pockets. We will be back and thank you jason. If you are a fancy arse this place isn't for you. Sorry.",5.0
Love this spot. Around the corner from my house.  Their food is really great with a city or southern twang. The cook does his thing  with the pots and pans. People are awesome. Drinks leave you wanting more..... Awesome sauce.,4.0
"Was staying in this area for a night and half a day and came here for brunch on a Thursday morning. We ordered frozen margaritas, the burger lunch special, waffle fries and were very satisfied.

"If I could give a million stars I would. But unfortunately this piece of shit yelp only allows me to count to five.As for the food: bomb dot comAs for the bar service: bomb dot double comAs for the bar tenders: Marshall, he's a hunk of baltimore body and you won't regret talking with him. I also can attest to the fact that he is a trivia goddess. His questions will literally blow your mind.Jen, she is probably the sweetest and most genuine person who can tend to you for 1.5 hours while you satiate your innards with sweet liquor. Overall -- all around great people at this bar. So glad it's in my neighborhood.",5.0
"Awesome time! Drinks were delicious and affordable, music was great, and the owner, Jay, was very personable and kind. He made a short layover memorable for us, and Brooklyn Stoop will always be a stop when we're in NYC. Order the red velvet chicken and waffles, you won't regret it!",5.0

The wings are basically the reason I come. Everything I've tried on the menu has been really good though. Hard to fuck up a grilled cheese or a burger though. I've come twice when they just flat out didn't have wings, and once when they were limited to which sauces they had that day. Disappointing. And then I asked for ranch and they told me they hadn't had any in about 2 weeks...again, disappointing, especially being told that after I already received my wings. Also, how are you, as a mainly wing place out of a wing condiment? All in all, I'll be back. The prices are decent for what you get from Stoops. ALSO I never noticed it before going yesterday- they automatically add 18% gratuity! All along I've tipped because I've never asked for my receipt until yesterday because it seemed higher than it should have been and ALAS! ..gratuity.

"I came here just to watch game 7 of the World Series with a friend. We sat at the bar. As it turned out, it was Trivia Night. It was a lot of fun and the host ran it well. After trivia was over, they turned on the sound of the game instead of music. I'm not sure if anyone asked them to do so, but I was very happy about it. We had burgers, which were delicious - above average. Their regular fries were just okay - I will order sweet potato or waffle fries if there is a next time. I chatted with several other customers throughout the night and everyone was friendly. The bartender (Jen), was really nice to us the entire time. She even put away a bag for me which I had left on the bar when I went outside for a cigarette - really good customer service. We had a great time, enjoyed the atmosphere, met some friendly people, enjoyed their burgers and got our asses kicked in trivia. Giants won.",4.0

And then I asked for ranch and they told me they hadn't had any in about 2 weeks...again, disappointing, especially being told that after I already received my wings. Also, how are you, as a mainly wing place out of a wing condiment? All in all, I'll be back. The prices are decent for what you get from Stoops. ALSO I never noticed it before going yesterday- they automatically add 18% gratuity! All along I've tipped because I've never asked for my receipt until yesterday because it seemed higher than it should have been and ALAS! ..gratuity. So make sure you ask for your receipts people!!!!",3.0

"Fantastic neighborhood bar with a good vibe. Don't come here if you're in a rush or looking for a party. It's just a laid back place with nice people to banter with while you aimlessly stare at the TVs and work out whatever's on your mind while you drink a ridiculously cheap $3 beer during happy hour, which is every day of the week from 2 to 9.This place is the only thing keeping me interested in this neighborhood.",5.0
"I came here just to watch game 7 of the World Series with a friend. We sat at the bar. As it turned out, it was Trivia Night. It was a lot of fun and the host ran it well. After trivia was over, they turned on the sound of the game instead of music. I'm not sure if anyone asked them to do so, but I was very happy about it. We had burgers, which were delicious - above average. Their regular fries were just okay - I will order sweet potato or waffle fries if there is a next time. I chatted with several other customers throughout the night and everyone was friendly. The bartender (Jen), was really nice to us the entire time. She even put away a bag for me which I had left on the bar when I went outside for a cigarette - really good customer service. We had a great time, enjoyed the atmosphere, met some friendly people, enjoyed their burgers and got our asses kicked in trivia. Giants won.",4.0

"I used to live down the block from Brooklyn Stoops and was a regular here for almost two years. I started going here not too long after they opened.

The crowd is an eclectic mix of people, making the experience of visiting all the more interesting. The food is great, drinks very reasonably priced, and is home to NYC's best happy hour.

"Great neighborhood bar! This place has a nicely balanced group of people, unlike some nearby hopelessly hipster places that are clearly fallout from the Caucasian Invasion. Their simplified beer and liquor selection covers the bases, and won't cost you a hand and a foot - especially if you hit it at happy hour! The air conditioning feels really nice when it's hot out, and when it's not too scorching the back yard is a delightful place to drink and relax. There's even a modest food selection if you get hungry. Don't expect fine cuisine from this makeshift pub-food kitchen, but if it's grilled cheese and fries you're after, you won't be disappointed.My only complaint is the TVs that pollute the walls with distracting advertisements intermingled with slow-moving sporting events. If they kept it to the well-selected iPod playlists that energize the party, it would be better.

"We were visiting some friends in this neighborhood and ended up coming here for breakfast 2 days in a row and getting sandwiches to go for lunch one day too. The breakfasts and coffee were just what we wanted. On the first day, we had espresso and breakfast sandwiches on bagels. The second day my husband had waffles with walnuts, dried cranberries, and maple syrup - he loved it. I had a sesame bagel with cream cheese, also really good. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the prices are reasonable. I loved the music selection too.My only complaint is that the tomatoes on our to-go sandwiches were bland and not very red. But I know I'm picky about tomatoes and it's a lot to ask for ripe tomatoes in NYC in January. So maybe I should have asked them to leave the tomatoes off.",5.0

They were definitely a top cafe in the area, and I would be sad if they are closed for good!",4.0
"I love this place. It's laid back, has a great happy hour(s), and good service. I live a few blocks away and am glad to have a neighborhood go-to. Less hipster/dirty than Project Parlor and less expensive than Black Swan.",5.0
"Great new spot just a couple of blocks from my apartment. They have good food and good coffee (I haven't tried the smoothies yet) and play great music. There's a couch in the back and it's the perfect place to come study on a cold afternoon. They lose one star on three points: 1. the exhaust never seems to work and the place reeks of smoke, to the point that it burns the eyes. 2. they are closed on Mondays and close way too early the rest of the week.3. there's no sign and the places is usually mostly empty. I passed by a bunch of times without noticing it and only found out it was here because my neighbor told me.Hopefully they'll get these details sorted out, because this is exactly the kind of place this neighborhood needs.",4.0
"Decent selection of beer, mostly friendly locals, good chili, friendly bartenders.  Great watering hole to watch sports!",5.0
"Great neighborhood bar! This place has a nicely balanced group of people, unlike some nearby hopelessly hipster places that are clearly fallout from the Caucasian Invasion. Their simplified beer and liquor selection covers the bases, and won't cost you a hand and a foot - especially if you hit it at happy hour! The air conditioning feels really nice when it's hot out, and when it's not too scorching the back yard is a delightful place to drink and relax. There's even a modest food selection if you get hungry. Don't expect fine cuisine from this makeshift pub-food kitchen, but if it's grilled cheese and fries you're after, you won't be disappointed.My only complaint is the TVs that pollute the walls with distracting advertisements intermingled with slow-moving sporting events. If they kept it to the well-selected iPod playlists that energize the party, it would be better. The friendliness of the bar staff is contagious and makes this a great place to get together and put back a few.",5.0
"I noticed this place open a few months ago and had been meaning to check out it. It's a great little cafe with good food. The staff was approachable, friendly and down to earth which is a huge plus in my book. I had a grilled cheese that came with some chips and was very tasty (and only 3 bucks). I will be telling me friends about this place will be back soon.Can't wait for the outdoor area to be finished and open in the Spring!",5.0
"This is a simple cafe with a sandwich menu, coffee and tea, and baked goods.  They offer WiFi and is a great place to get work done, read and have good food to munch on.Enjoy",4.0
This place is good for a quick breakfast. I was expecting the food to be better though. The decor kind of builds your expectations a little too high and deflates when you receive your order.,3.0
"I heard about this place online and met a friend for a quick sunday brunch/cup of joe today. Best Panini I've ever had the luck of meeting on a sunday...Crunchy, salty, with a touch of sweetness and a healthy portion of cheese (mmmm ham and cheese on ciabatta) Not only was the french chef/owner extremely personable, everyone working there was warm and engaging.  Pleasant waitresses are an added plus to quick service and good food. Good vibe and will definitely come back again. Brooklyn stoops. Five stars.",5.0
"We were visiting some friends in this neighborhood and ended up coming here for breakfast 2 days in a row and getting sandwiches to go for lunch one day too. The breakfasts and coffee were just what we wanted. On the first day, we had espresso and breakfast sandwiches on bagels. The second day my husband had waffles with walnuts, dried cranberries, and maple syrup - he loved it. I had a sesame bagel with cream cheese, also really good. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and the prices are reasonable. I loved the music selection too.My only complaint is that the tomatoes on our to-go sandwiches were bland and not very red. But I know I'm picky about tomatoes and it's a lot to ask for ripe tomatoes in NYC in January. So maybe I should have asked them to leave the tomatoes off.",5.0
"Been here a few times- it is less than a block away from my apartment. My roommate is obsessed with this place and supporting small local cafes/restaurants.

"The place is a great place to watch a game, have a drink and have some food.  The wings and the onion rings are really good.  Also they just added a macaroni, corn bread and 2 piece fried chicken for $8, can't beat that.  The owner is always on site and the bartenders are cool.  The only thing in which I think they should add is delivery!",4.0
"This cozy little place has great coffee and tasty homemade food like sandwiches and cookies/ cakes. I love the BLT on croissant and the carrot cake.

"This place used to be more of a coffee shop than it is now, but I feel like its changed for the better.  Attentive and knowledgable bar staff, simple but delicious food menu, and plenty of local products make this the go to place in the neighborhood.  I can't recommend this place enough of you're in the neighborhood!",5.0
"Finally decided to walk around my neighborhood and find some delectable eats, and came across a familiar name: Brooklyn Stoops. I recognized the name from a menu I found in my apartment lobby, so I decided to give it a try. The decor is very rustic modern mixed with the scent of freshly ground coffee. There's pictures around the cafe of.. yes, you guessed it, Brooklyn stoops. The cute name personally brings good memories of Hey Arnold's Stoop Kid. The review: I ordered a Turkey Club sandwich that came on wheat bread, crispy fresh lettuce & tomatoes, deli-style turkey slices, and the best part: succulent bacon cooked just the way I like it! I was going to stop there until I saw they had Jalapeno poppers, and just couldn't resist. My boyfriend ordered an Everything bagel BLT, and in the midst of challenging me, ordered mozzarella sticks. My sandwich was delicious (came with a side of chips) and my poppers were as well. The dipping sauces came in shot glasses which I thought was awesome. Bottoms up! Even a simple meal of an Everything bagel BLT was delicious. The staff was extremely hospitable and even had a sense of humor. This is a new business as I believed it opened in November. It's a great place and hopefully more hungry adventurous Brooklynites will rejoice in the greatness of Brooklyn Stoops!See you all there, for I think I have now found my new favorite spot :)",5.0

"Great cafe in Bed-Stuy!  I have yet to eat here for lunch, but I have been for breakfast/brunch and have been blown away each time!  The food is consistently good, which is key in any restaurant.  Cook time is pretty quick- I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes.  It's never been crowded, and the food is cheap too!  It makes me sad that I moved away from the neighborhood, but it is definitely worth the trek back there!",5.0
"I love this place since it turned into a bar.  Happy hour until 9pm.  Draft beers are $5 and under and they have good bar food but the wings are small.  They have TVs so it's a great place to watch ""the game"", whatever that game may be.  They have an outdoor section that I haven't been in yet but I'm sure I will be in the coming weeks.  Also, they just started doing trivia night last night and they let you play beer pong out back, too.If you're not looking for a sceney place or a 7-course gourmet meal but you like reasonably priced drinks and a relaxed atmosphere, come here.",5.0
"FINALLY!! I cafe near my apartment, where I can bring my laptop to write/research/whatever or bring a friend to just chill. The coffee is great, especially for the price.
