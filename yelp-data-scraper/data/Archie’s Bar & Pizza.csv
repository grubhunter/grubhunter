"Drink selection is good, pizza is AMAZING. Wandered over here before meeting up with friends, sat down at the bar, bartenders were very nice, and they have a decent beer selection for pretty cheap.I ordered one pepperoni slice, which was big enough (unless you are totally starving). The sauce, cheese was all good but that crust is something real special. A little thicker with just a little crisp, and some special ingredient I can't tell what it is, and apparently the staff can't tell either haha.Definitely stopping back while I'm in town.",5.0
"April 5th is National Deep Dish Pizza Day. I'll admit I let myself be a sucker and became fixated on finding deep-dish pizza in Brooklyn. Performed the usual online searches, this place keeps getting great reviews. I trekked over to Bushwick with high hopes.I relearned not to trust reviews with too many AWESOMEs AMAZINGs and SUPERs. The place is cute and small. The bartender was pleasant. I ordered a slice with pepperoni. Now, for the record, for all you wonderful transplants that give color and energy to our great city, let me explain something: this in New York, the pizza they serve is called ""Sicilians"", or sometimes just called ""squares"", except that this slice was wedge-shaped. It is NOT deep dish. It is a bit unusual. But it is NOT f#&king amazing.  It's OK, maybe even good ( if you're drunk and starving at 2 AM). The crust is not crispy enough, the pepperoni is not flavorful enough, although the cheese and the sauce are fine. It is true that they have a bar. I asked the bartender what the shot was with the Tecate for $5; she said that was only for happy hour, which was from 6:00 to 8:00. It was literally 8:01. I said ""guess I just missed it"". A nonreply proved me right.Finally: no ""did you enjoy it?"" or ""would you like anything else?"", although a very cheerful goodbye when I was halfway out the door. Maybe the other food here is better (I won't drag that beaten and abused word ""amazing"" out, I just won't). But I'll probably not make another trek to find out.",3.0
"The pizza is so so good, I'm ashamed to say that my boyfriend and I manage to always finish the large pizza between the two of us! Great prices and a warm atmosphere. We go every couple weeks and are never disappointed!",4.0
"A great bar for a late night slice ... and maybe a beer as well.The slice ($3) is quite different from a New York slice. A reasonably hearty crust, with a crunch bottom, and a good dose of cheese. The slices are short and wide, which is very different from the familiar ""fold and bite"" procedure. While enjoying my slices, I certainly sat there jealous of those who were sharing a pie with pepperoni. They also have a handful of other toppings.Not only a great low key bar, but a fine place for a bite after (or during) your drinking.",4.0
"Went here for the first time yesterday, ordered a 14 in' pepperoni and smoked bacon pizza to share, and one word AMAZING! Ok another word, DELICIOUS! So juicy, full of flavor and tht crust, oh man, I'll definitely be returning. Also, the service is very warm and welcoming.",5.0
"Came in here tired as fuck after pounding the living hell out of my amazing wife, we sat down and look at the menu for about 30 minutes there wasn't anything that caught our attention, and the smell in that place was unbearable.. Not sure if it was the smell of premature sex or the sweaty hipster kids walking In with their dirty sneakers and John Lennon shades (mind you we were indoors) so we left and I pounded my wife some more at home.",2.0
"Solid square slices in Bushwick. I got Archie's for delivery on a Friday night. The staff was super friendly over the phone, and the food came hot and delicious. I ordered a square slice and meatball sub. The marinara sauce was just right...not too chunky, just the right mix of sweet and garlicky. Would like to try more of their stuff.",4.0
"I came here multiple times for a late night last minute pizza fix. Both times I was very happy with my experiences. The apartment I was staying at was about 3 blocks from this place. Yelp told me where the nearest pizza place was, so I had to give it a go and try it out! I was delighted. The pizza style is hard to describe.. It's not New York style, it's kind of.. Bar style? Regardless, it's super yummy and hits the spot. Over the course of a few days, I got mushroom and broccoli, pepperoni, and tomato and spinach. Minus one star for being pretty busy each time I came, especially the second visit - I waited 30 minutes.",4.0

"The best pizza in Brooklyn. Maybe the best pizza in New York or even the world. Have been here a million times and every time the pizza is beyond good. Pro tip - get the large even if you aren't that hungry, then you'll have tons off yummy Archie's leftovers!",5.0

"One night when my roommate was out I decided to take a little walk over to Archie's, as I heard they served a mean pie.  I didn't know exactly what to expect, but at 8pm this place definitely had more of a bar ambiance that centered around the fact that they also serve pizza.  I sat myself at the bar and ordered a slice of pepperoni and a beer. There's a hip, social, and somewhat sexy (due to the dim neon) vibe to this place.  The bartender who took my order was friendly and helpful, and the beer he served me was cold and refreshing.  I was pleased to see how big the slice was, and I would say it was very good.  The crust was thick and fluff, with a slightly buttery flavor, kinda like a thin version of sicilian crust.  The tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni were good, but not particularly memorable.  I wouldn't come back because I absolutely love the pizza (I'm sure some people do), but I would come back because it's a cool place to socialize, drink a beer, and have a pretty good slice of pizza in a hip and friendly environment.",4.0
"This place is amazing! I don't know how my husband and I went so long without discovering it. It's a freaking GEM! Open super late, friendly people and AMAZING deep dish style pizza, but not too deep. Pretty much the perfect thickness of crust. It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood. I hope Archies is around for many years to come.",5.0

"Look, I live right around the corner. Literally 1 minute walk, maybe less (30 seconds?) So I loved it when they opened, still love them, frequent the place, all that.

But I was in the middle of doing something, not to mention I was in my underwear, so I decided to order delivery- not that I need a reason. If they OFFER delivery, they should deliver, right? Even if I just wanted it because my lazy ass is glued to my couch? And the definition of delivery is to your apartment door, not in front of your building, right?So I was a little miffed when the deliveryman called and said ""I'm here"" and no one was by my door. I called him back, and he said he was in front of my building, and since he's so busy, could I come down? (No ""please"" either, btw- forget about ""I'm sorry."") What?? I have had this happen a few times since I moved to Bushwick, and I just don't understand- it NEVER happened living on 4th floor of a WALK UP building in Manhattan. Yet these guys can't take the ELEVATOR to my 4th floor apartment? Is this a Brooklyn thing? White hipster delivery dude thing?I was going to tip him generously as I love Archie's and I always support local businesses, but as soon as I heard his tone- basically even though he only walked 30 secs to come here, he can't bother to take the elevator to my apartment- and saw his sour face, I decided to tip him a dollar instead.I will continue to support this business, but I hope they get better delivery men. Three stars just because it's not fair to give a lower rating to the whole place because of one guy.",3.0

Finally, my friend leaned over to ask if we could place a pizza order and she somewhat rudely said ""yeah, just give me a minute"" (in addition to the 20 we already gave her?), and eventually took the order. Kinda annoying. I can see why this spot is popular with loud, young hipster kids, and again -- pizza was good. But I think next time we will either order in or try a different place.",3.0

"Archie's seems like a real cool place.  The neon sign out front is gorgeous.  It looks like they have good beer on tap which is a plus.  Everyone there was nice.  The pizza just wasn't that good.     Everyone these days thinks they're some kind of pizza connoisseur.  I won't be so presumptuous as to assume that status.  I mean, I should probably be automatically exempt from it considering I was vegan for 5 or 6 out of the last 15 years.  Connoisseur or not I'll give you my assessment of this pizza.      I believe this is thick crust pizza.  It's definitely not the thin style New York style pizza I'm used to.  So with thick style pizza I guess you have a lot more crust to work with.  In order to make this extra crust worthwhile it would need to be damn good.  I did not find this to be the case with Archie's.    The sauce was nothing to write home about either.  We got a 10"" cheese and mushroom pie.  Both the cheese and the mushroom were fine but that's really all I can say about them.  Besides, whenever my girlfriend and I would try to grab another slice the cheese would stick to the adjacent slices and you would have to pull it off and try to plop it back on in the least gross manner possible.  No thanks.    Lastly, the price wasn't great. I think we paid like $12 for a 10"" Cheese and mushroom pizza.  You can get a 12"" pizza with 2 toppings from Tony's in bushwick for $7.50.     I might go back to Archie's for a sandwich and a beer sometime but I will not be going back for pizza.  If you want simple but good New York style pizza in bushwick then go to Tony's.  If you want artisanal pizza in bushwick then go to Roberta's.  I would say the bottom line is that Archie's doesn't really seem to have a niche unless you are an ardent fan of the deep dish.",3.0

"The pizza here is really solid, but the staff is not. Granted it was a busy Friday night, but we waited close to 20 minutes at the bar to be acknowledged while 2 employees ignored us. One may have been a bar back, but the girl bartending was too busy chatting up her friends and taking a shot to take our order. Finally, my friend leaned over to ask if we could place a pizza order and she somewhat rudely said ""yeah, just give me a minute"" (in addition to the 20 we already gave her?), and eventually took the order. Kinda annoying. I can see why this spot is popular with loud, young hipster kids, and again -- pizza was good. But I think next time we will either order in or try a different place.",3.0
"WooHoo! As good as it gets! Great pizza, Great service, Great menu... Everything is soooo good. The pizza isn't like an kind I've ever had. The sandwiches are next level too. We order a few and a pizza one night and ate it for a week. Unreal so happy to have this in the neighborhood.",5.0
"I have been a huge Archie's advocate since the first day I went. Its rare to find a bar that has amazing pizza. Not only is the pizza great, but they have a good selection of beers on tap. The best part is they are open until 4am so they are always my last stop before heading home. If you are looking for great service, great beer, and great pizza then Archie's is the place for you.",5.0
"Archie's seems like a real cool place.  The neon sign out front is gorgeous.  It looks like they have good beer on tap which is a plus.  Everyone there was nice.  The pizza just wasn't that good.     Everyone these days thinks they're some kind of pizza connoisseur.  I won't be so presumptuous as to assume that status.  I mean, I should probably be automatically exempt from it considering I was vegan for 5 or 6 out of the last 15 years.  Connoisseur or not I'll give you my assessment of this pizza.      I believe this is thick crust pizza.  It's definitely not the thin style New York style pizza I'm used to.  So with thick style pizza I guess you have a lot more crust to work with.  In order to make this extra crust worthwhile it would need to be damn good.  I did not find this to be the case with Archie's.    The sauce was nothing to write home about either.  We got a 10"" cheese and mushroom pie.  Both the cheese and the mushroom were fine but that's really all I can say about them.  Besides, whenever my girlfriend and I would try to grab another slice the cheese would stick to the adjacent slices and you would have to pull it off and try to plop it back on in the least gross manner possible.  No thanks.    Lastly, the price wasn't great. I think we paid like $12 for a 10"" Cheese and mushroom pizza.  You can get a 12"" pizza with 2 toppings from Tony's in bushwick for $7.50.     I might go back to Archie's for a sandwich and a beer sometime but I will not be going back for pizza.  If you want simple but good New York style pizza in bushwick then go to Tony's.  If you want artisanal pizza in bushwick then go to Roberta's.  I would say the bottom line is that Archie's doesn't really seem to have a niche unless you are an ardent fan of the deep dish.",3.0

"Found this place on yelp looking for something opened late with decent food in my neighborhood. Archie's surpassed my expectations. The atmosphere was awesome.

My friend and I sat next to a friendly and helpful local from Greece who was emphatic about their feta cheese, lol! So we ordered a 10"" pie with sausage, peppers, feta and artichoke. No photo to post at the moment cause my phone was down to 1% but words couldn't describe how beautiful this baby was when she came out, quickly I might add. And how fresh the ingredients were. And how amazing the pizza taste. I usually don't go for deep dish pizza but Archie's executed this pizza perfectly. I finished the rest for breakfast.

"I'm pretty obsessed with this place.I've worked in pizza bars/restaurants for most of my adult life to date, so pizza is not new to me.They have a crust that they have gone on record on their Facebook page as calling ""New England-style, which is basically a pan-pressed thin crust.  It utilizes a little more dough than your standard New York-style hand-tossed thin crust, but it isn't as thick as your Chicago-style deep dish.  One of the big chain restaurants does it this way.  I want to say Pizza Hut, but I could be wrong.  So it could go so wrong so easily but they execute it so right.Hawaiian Pizza is my go-to in most situations, spicy if possible.  If they use canned pineapples like most pizzerias, it doesn't show, because they look prepped in-house.  The ham and hot cherry peppers aren't bad either.  By now I've also had my share of their other toppings by rotating out special slices, with no bad results to report so far.Decent beer selection; they seem to stick to the same breweries but rotate the style represented by each brewery.  Full bar but not a particularly liquor-forward drink menu, and I don't know why you would expect one in a pizza place.  I had their hot toddy and it was really good.The only grinder that I've had from them was their cheesesteak.  The next day I had a top-5-lifetime level of severe case of diarrhea, and it was completely worth it.  Maybe it was a mild case of food poisoning, maybe I have a gluten intolerance and the meat was slightly undercooked and/or cross-contaminated.  Maybe I got sick for an entirely different reason.  I don't care; the sandwich was delicious and I regret nothing.They seem set up location-wise kind of specifically to cater to the Castle Braid complex, which I find to be interesting and probably a good move long-term for their bottom line.They indicate that delivery is ""coming soon.""  I need to find a second job in preparation for that time.",5.0

"This is my go to dinner spot, whether it be for a slice of their special pizza, a grinder, or a salad with a side of meatballs. Everything I order from here is amazing. The pizza is soft yet has a crunchy bottom, the cheese and sauce are perfect, and they loadddd on the toppings. The main thing I get is their salad and add ham, turkey, and shredded mozzarella- makes an amazing chef salad. They have so many different beers to choose from and they aren't the traditional CoorsLight, Budweiser, Coronas, which is refreshing, they craft or local beers. The service is great, they are always friendly, down to chat, and remember you for the most part. Sometimes if I don't feel like going out out- just going here for some beer and food with friends is a fun night. They play good music, attract a pretty young and eclectic crowd, its always a good night here. Very relaxed. Definitely check it out.",5.0

Happened upon this on a friday night when all our other local spots were too crowded to sit and eat.  We got here a little after midnight and there were tables and space at the bar (crowd increased as the night went by).  Pizza took a minute but was hot and fresh.  It was good but over priced.  I have had a lot of NYC pizza and definitely had better.  BUT it was perfect for what we needed and great if you need some food and a beer after midnight in the area.  We will definitely be back.,4.0

"Great pizza here, it comes to your table piping hot with a crispy and airy crust. The pizza'a got some thickness to it and a nice blend of cheeses and the sauce compliments it quite nicely. A great touch they have is a super comprehensive array of hot sauces to use to your heart's content. Also there's usually a cute little cat that hangs around outside that looks like a skinny Garfield.",4.0

"Visited what was once the old Bushwick Kitchen spot the other night. At first glance, if you remember the old place, it has been completed remodelled on the inside. Very lively and bright. Nice. The ambience unfortunately is a different story. Walking in, you immediately get a ""hipster only"" vibe from the place. Standing around browsing through the menu, we were told by one of the patrons sitting at the bar ""This seat is taken!"" as their friend was walking in a minute behind us. Restraining myself, we continued to look through the menu. Laughing at the price of 3.50 a slice, we decided to give it a try. 2 slices please. Didn't want to buy a pie and be disappointed and thankful that we decided on that. The pizza itself is not a typical New York style. The sauce is pretty sweet and the cheese salty. If I had to compare, think of it as step up from a Elio's pizza from the freezer of a supermarket. Not bad but not mind blowing especially at the cost. You get that ""Eh, its ok"" effect out of it. Seating was not an option due to no seats being available at the time, so can't really comment on anything else. In conclusion, if your part of the hipster crowd and looking for a quick pizza and beer this is your spot. If your looking for a typical New York slice or something more like a pie from Roberta's this is not for you. Hope this helps.",3.0

"This is a great neighborhood hangout.  It's small enough that the fun staff gets to know just about everyone.  I sat at the bar by myself, and made a couple friends.  The recipes are from the chef's Greek grandmother, so you know they're going to taste home-made.  The meatball grinder was full of flavor, and so big I could barely finish it.  The dressing on the Greek salad was light and tart.",5.0
"Great for late night eats.  Love the pizza, tastes homemade. Thicker crusts than most other places. Ingredients are fresh.  Simple but solid pizza! Laid back atmosphere and decent bar. Good for when you need some foods after hours.",5.0
"This is my go to dinner spot, whether it be for a slice of their special pizza, a grinder, or a salad with a side of meatballs. Everything I order from here is amazing. The pizza is soft yet has a crunchy bottom, the cheese and sauce are perfect, and they loadddd on the toppings. The main thing I get is their salad and add ham, turkey, and shredded mozzarella- makes an amazing chef salad. They have so many different beers to choose from and they aren't the traditional CoorsLight, Budweiser, Coronas, which is refreshing, they craft or local beers. The service is great, they are always friendly, down to chat, and remember you for the most part. Sometimes if I don't feel like going out out- just going here for some beer and food with friends is a fun night. They play good music, attract a pretty young and eclectic crowd, its always a good night here. Very relaxed. Definitely check it out.",5.0
"Great service and great food. Cool neighborhood bar, great prices and full bar. Very nice. Will definitely return.",4.0
Happened upon this on a friday night when all our other local spots were too crowded to sit and eat.  We got here a little after midnight and there were tables and space at the bar (crowd increased as the night went by).  Pizza took a minute but was hot and fresh.  It was good but over priced.  I have had a lot of NYC pizza and definitely had better.  BUT it was perfect for what we needed and great if you need some food and a beer after midnight in the area.  We will definitely be back.,4.0
i love this spot.  great pizza. great service. great prices. please note: always wait longer than expected to take that first bite or risk burning the roof of your mouth! :),5.0
"Great pizza here, it comes to your table piping hot with a crispy and airy crust. The pizza'a got some thickness to it and a nice blend of cheeses and the sauce compliments it quite nicely. A great touch they have is a super comprehensive array of hot sauces to use to your heart's content. Also there's usually a cute little cat that hangs around outside that looks like a skinny Garfield.",4.0
"Just got REALLY toasty and picked up a 10"" pepperoni jam with garlic. AMAZING. Not feeling well now but that may be related to the velocity in which I consumed the fucking thing. Really hurting. Would def go back.",5.0
"Visited what was once the old Bushwick Kitchen spot the other night. At first glance, if you remember the old place, it has been completed remodelled on the inside. Very lively and bright. Nice. The ambience unfortunately is a different story. Walking in, you immediately get a ""hipster only"" vibe from the place. Standing around browsing through the menu, we were told by one of the patrons sitting at the bar ""This seat is taken!"" as their friend was walking in a minute behind us. Restraining myself, we continued to look through the menu. Laughing at the price of 3.50 a slice, we decided to give it a try. 2 slices please. Didn't want to buy a pie and be disappointed and thankful that we decided on that. The pizza itself is not a typical New York style. The sauce is pretty sweet and the cheese salty. If I had to compare, think of it as step up from a Elio's pizza from the freezer of a supermarket. Not bad but not mind blowing especially at the cost. You get that ""Eh, its ok"" effect out of it. Seating was not an option due to no seats being available at the time, so can't really comment on anything else. In conclusion, if your part of the hipster crowd and looking for a quick pizza and beer this is your spot. If your looking for a typical New York slice or something more like a pie from Roberta's this is not for you. Hope this helps.",3.0

"This place rocks!!! So happy to find it right in the neighborhood. Awesome, friendly, happy, super attentive staff. $5 sausage & peppers dish that was not only filling but out of this world. Massive Greek salad, also only $6.50. Great wine, beer, and liquor selection. Did I mention super friendly staff :)",5.0
"I have come here with friends, on dates, and I've also ordered it as take out, and each time the meal is over I am left wondering when my next Archie's fix will be.  It's so good!  I mean SOOO GOOD! The stuff of dreams. Gooey cheese over cripsy crust, it's delicious.  The toppings are diverse, my boyfriend and I usually get a large pie, half ham/pineapple, half broccoli/pepperoni. We also split a salad before the entree to make ourselves feel better about all the pizza consumption, but damn, the salad is just as delicious! Plus Carla and Jacob are amazing and always make us feel at home.  If I could I would eat at Archie's all the time!",5.0
"This place is right on my corner, but I haven't had the chance to stop through until last night and I'm so glad I did!! I was starving after the gym, and as much as I told myself I was just going to grab a quick drink... that meatball ""grinder"" was calling my name... LOUDLY! I was happy to see that my favorite bartender from Miles has transferred over here, always nice to see a familiar face! I was also happy to see that the pizza looked tasty and the booze selection looked abundant. It does seem really well lit for a bar type atmosphere... we went in around nine, so maybe they dim the lights as the night goes on? No one else seemed to take issue with the lighting though because the place was definitely full!",4.0
"This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood!  I've been in three times since they opened just barely two weeks ago and I'm completely obsessed.  The itty bitty pepperoni's they put on a yummy slice of pizza are amazing and kind if remind me of the pizza I ate growing up as a kid in the Detroit area.  Anyways, this place is great!!!",5.0
SO GOOD. While visiting a friend in the neighborhood he took us to Archie's. Best pizza I had on my trip to New York. I had the cheese and the special that day which was sweet cherry peppers and pineapple. Topped both off with a variety of hot sauces. All of it was great.,5.0
