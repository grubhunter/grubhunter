"Yesterday was my fifth visit to Cafe Tibet and I'm a big fan of this friendly and cozy hideaway next to the Cortelyou train station. Between three people, we had the momo sampler and the sha-baklap as appetizers, and our entrees were the lamb curry, the ginger chicken and the thukpa. Although the lamb and chicken entrees came with rice, we also had an order of the tingmo - the dense Tibetan steamed buns. Everything was delicious, although I don't think we expected the ginger chicken to have as strong of a natural ginger flavor as it did. I like the Japanese style curry more than the Indian-style currys I've had, and the curry here was more in-line with the Japanese variety of not-spicy and almost-sweet curry. Cafe Tibet does not do delivery and the prices here on Yelp are not current. They do take-out though.",5.0

"Cafe Tibet is my favorite place in Brooklyn! Hands down the best food ever! I adore this tiny little hole in the wall restaurant. The food is always made with love and care. The place is always crowed for a reason! Sometime I wait for 30mins for a table for two and I never care! The staff is very nice and quick. They will answer any question you have and not be snobby about it. Which is refreshing! The place, again, is very tiny! But I never care! The food at times takes a while but again, I seriously never care. I just love coming here. My favorite dish is the Mung bean! it's crazy good. To die for! Nice level of spicy, with a perfect cut of acid (vinegar) and super garlicky! It's vegan and I could eat it all day if I could. (If you have a stuffy nose, eat this and you will feel better! I swear)! The rock n roll noodles with tofu is crispy and soft noodles with this sweetish saltish sauce,  just pure goodness all around. The vegetable fried rice has FRESH VEGGIES! That's almost unheard of these days! It's so good. Then I always get about two glasses of fresh mango lassi. It's the greatest! I come to Cafe Tibet when I have extra cash laying around because I always order so much! Prices are fair though, the portions are HUGE! I mean you can feed two-three people with one dish! I love this place and come here often!",5.0
Intimate restaurant nearly hidden from sight right next to the Cortelyou subway. Good food and affordable. Had the curry noodles and the chili shrimp. Both were solid but I was hoping everything would be a little more spicy/flavorful. Also had the ginger honey tea and I swear I could drink that by the gallon -  the mugs were a cute touch. Cash only (ugh) so be prepared.,4.0
"If you've never tried Tibetan food and live near a Q train, you won't break a sweat getting to this hole in the wall adjacent to the Cortelyou subway stop. Narrow and cozy, Cafe Tibet was packed for a 5pm dinner on Sunday.The cuisine reminded me of a blend between traditional Chinese and Indian foods. Momos are almost replicas of baos (beef is the way to go) and the variety of menu options were curry/spice based. I enjoyed trying the la-phing, a mung bean jello drenched in hot sauce that gives your taste buds that mini roller coaster tingle. The thukpa noodles provided a lighter and cleaner taste if you prefer something a tamer burst of flavor. Cafe Tibet was definitely welcoming on a chilly winter evening; no wonder it's a must have before braving the Himalayas.",4.0
"Whoa, this place is amazing. Having lived in NYC for 10 years now, it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to food here. It takes even more to truly blow me away. Cafe Tibet nearly did it. What a hidden little hole in the wall gem. Nestled right next to a Q/B train subway station, if you blink coming out of the station you'd miss this place. Inside it looks cheesy, almost kitschy. But once you taste the food, all it's weird spatial decorative misgivings evaporate. Make sure you order the momons, they take almost 20 minutes to steam but once you taste them you won't regret the wait. Just make sure you order the meat variety as the veggies version fell short tastewise when compared to the meat ones. Also, the sha-baklap is not to be missed, It's a sort of a Tibetan empanada (or maybe empanadas are Latino versions of these!) Anyways, they are delicious as well. We also had lamb curry, which wasn't as good as these other dishes, but it was still tasty. Their bread is strange, it comes in a rolled ball and you rip off strands of it. It went well with the curry but it lacks the ""mopability"" of naan. Tasty nevertheless. Apparently they allow BYOB which we will partake of next trip, and the many more trips that I have planned. You should plan one here too!!!!",5.0
Great and authentic tasting food here. Curry noodles are my favorite.,5.0
"Here I had the best curry in my life! It was so creamy and spicy and the meat was also nice. Before we had some dumplings to share - also very good. I love the atmosphere in there, it's really authentic. A little bit small, but familiar.I will come back, when I will be in NY again!",5.0
"Came here with my friends and we decided to order off of the vegetarian menu...well, one did, the other friend couldn't handle it and ended up stuffing his face with spicy pork. Anyways, I ordered the silky tofu noodle soup with tomato paste ($9.99), my friend ordered the garlic noodles, and the other friend ordered the spicy pork with rice. We started off with spicy chickpeas and boy was it amazing! I highly recommend that a starter! The garlic noodles were stir fried with shredded carrots and peas. This dish was good and I should've ordered it. I felt like my silky tofu noodle soup wasn't worth $10, since I could've made it myself, there was nothing special about the dish...The interior is cramped, but the decorations are oddly fascinating!",3.0
Totally random little restaurant tucked into the corner of the Q train Cortelyou stop. Maybe 8 tables tops. Wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people. Actually no more than 2 is my suggestion. And maybe come at an off time because it can get packed.Food is what your Tibetan grandma would cook. Hearty and filling bowls of noodle soup is the cure for winter depression. Momos are good too but the Tsam-Thuk is the bezzzzttttt! 2 bowls to my head please!Food comes out on the slow side so don't expect your growling stomach to be immediately satiated.,4.0

"I am a fan of this quaint eatery, everything about it rings authentic. I have eaten here before and can say the food is consistent. The curry is rich and I love the use of tomatoes in the dishes.

My fave is the one clown who says only ""white hipsters"" review this place meanwhile having a septum nose ring and a pretentious Marilyn Monroe piercings ...lol Derp?Food is great and varies wildly. You can get a good coconut curry, tofu vegetable stir fry, dumplings and my fave: the carrot soup. It's BYOB, as well so take advantage if you want a refreshing beverage with your meal.

The salad that came with the beef patties was a lot more enjoyable and even that was pathetic as it had the lettuce head in it.

"Well I want to enjoy this place. I would if the wait was not as bad as I had to endure. Some of the dishes are plain that I can easily make on my own. We started our night aiming for a local and easy date night and this place provide something in the middle. No alcohol, no super fancy waiting, no fancy lighting.  Here is what you should expect on a Saturday night dinner. Wait is about 20 to 30 Minutes which you can leave a phone number and they might call you. We have to wander around which is expected. After being seat, DO order quickly because here comes the second waiting wave. Expect your food to be out around 25 to 30 minutes if the place is packed with people. We order a tea and that comes around 20 minutes after we order. I kept wondering why they cant just send the appetizer out first. The truth is their cook will make order by order. Please change that or at least layout some bread to fill us up a little.Anyway, their momo? I am not impressed. $1 dumpling in chinatown is better. Only thing I really enjoy is their curry which they recommended. We added a tofu dish and that was a disappointment. Soup is definitely a plus after being starving for the past hour.

"Very disappointed with the subpar service. Have been loyal to this place for years, and yet I get my momo without sauce and have to wait FIFTEEN MINUTES for SAUCE.

Now... that doesn't even take into account that I had to wait for 10 minutes for someone to take my order, and 30 minutes for my food to be brought.The total process of eating a simple dinner here took nearly THREE HOURS. I like the food, but the service is absolutely horrible.I'll come back in three or four months. If they're as poorly staffed as they were last time I was here, I simply won't come back.

"I went with my friend who was in town on a Saturday afternoon.  The place is almost hidden when you're walking down the block and you won't see it until you're exactly right in front of it. It's also right next to the train station, I mean RIGHT next to it. You can pretty much hear people complaining that their card isn't working and MTA's humble and warm response. That's sarcasm in case you didn't know...They have outdoor seating, which, LAWLZ! Not in this heatwave we've been going through! However, I'm sure it's nice on days where I don't need rain boots for my own sweat.  It's a smaller place and probably seats about 15-20 people?  Outside may seat another 10. We were able to grab a table right away though & we were greeted by one of the waitresses.  She handed us menus and we noticed there wasn't any alcohol.  Now don't get me wrong, they have a GREAT drink selection including all kind of teas and sweet beverages but I'm 25 and going through the transition of drinking alcohol for fun and drinking to cope with life, I need it. I asked her if they had any alcohol and her response was ""No, go get some next door."" Excuse me?! I'm trying to spend what little money Sallie Mae doesn't take, at your place to eat.  She then pointed to a pathway in the back of the restaurant and my reaction quickly went from, ""She's rude!"" to ""OMG I LOVE YOU, WHAT'S YOUR RING SIZE?!?""  Literally right next door, they are attached to a store that has beer on beer on beer.  6 packs, 40s, everything, and the best part is you can pick and choose different bottles and make your own 6 pack. We get back and realize we don't have a bottle opener but that's okay because our wonderful waitress supplied an opener, mugs, and hope that real love is out there for me.  Be prepared to wait a good 20 minutes or so for the food because it's made fresh and that's how it should be. It's fantastic though! Momo's are awesome, the mango chicken is awesome (spicy but I'm a wimp with spicy) and the pricing is great too.  You get 8 big size MoMos for 8-9 bucks.  This place is cash only because New York is a weird place that loves to have cash only places even though it's one of the most populated places....so come prepared.Summary: Great Food, Great Price, BYOB with Beer store attached, I'm going to marry our waitress.",5.0
"I love Cafe Tibet! My go to's are Thali (chicken or lamb), Tingmo, and the spicy chicken and tofu soup.. great if you have a stuffy nose or if you just want something with a slight kick.

I usually order by phone at the Newkirk stop, get some cash on the way, maybe run an errand on Cortelyou, and then grab my food to go.They only take cash, but I don't mind because they are special - so I get to treat it like a special occasion, even though the prices are good for everyday!Fun Fact: A few years ago, I ended up hosting Thanksgiving in my tiny studio apartment and we had a ""Very Tibetan No Turkey Day."" The staff were so sweet when I told them why I was ordering so much food, and when I tried to carry it home (like a clumbsy doof) they gave me a ride in the van so that it wouldn't get cold.

Usually when I eat somewhere new, I like to ask what is the popular choice among the diners.  So I went with the lamb curry and lawd have mercy it was soooooooooo good!!  Yes, the food took a while, but it was worth the wait.  Cheap food with nice flavor and spice...yeah mang, I'm satisfied.  Another spot to check off my list and take out of town guests for an authentic Brooklyn experience.",5.0
"I went with my friend who was in town on a Saturday afternoon.  The place is almost hidden when you're walking down the block and you won't see it until you're exactly right in front of it. It's also right next to the train station, I mean RIGHT next to it. You can pretty much hear people complaining that their card isn't working and MTA's humble and warm response. That's sarcasm in case you didn't know...They have outdoor seating, which, LAWLZ! Not in this heatwave we've been going through! However, I'm sure it's nice on days where I don't need rain boots for my own sweat.  It's a smaller place and probably seats about 15-20 people?  Outside may seat another 10. We were able to grab a table right away though & we were greeted by one of the waitresses.  She handed us menus and we noticed there wasn't any alcohol.  Now don't get me wrong, they have a GREAT drink selection including all kind of teas and sweet beverages but I'm 25 and going through the transition of drinking alcohol for fun and drinking to cope with life, I need it. I asked her if they had any alcohol and her response was ""No, go get some next door."" Excuse me?! I'm trying to spend what little money Sallie Mae doesn't take, at your place to eat.  She then pointed to a pathway in the back of the restaurant and my reaction quickly went from, ""She's rude!"" to ""OMG I LOVE YOU, WHAT'S YOUR RING SIZE?!?""  Literally right next door, they are attached to a store that has beer on beer on beer.  6 packs, 40s, everything, and the best part is you can pick and choose different bottles and make your own 6 pack. We get back and realize we don't have a bottle opener but that's okay because our wonderful waitress supplied an opener, mugs, and hope that real love is out there for me.  Be prepared to wait a good 20 minutes or so for the food because it's made fresh and that's how it should be. It's fantastic though! Momo's are awesome, the mango chicken is awesome (spicy but I'm a wimp with spicy) and the pricing is great too.  You get 8 big size MoMos for 8-9 bucks.  This place is cash only because New York is a weird place that loves to have cash only places even though it's one of the most populated places....so come prepared.Summary: Great Food, Great Price, BYOB with Beer store attached, I'm going to marry our waitress.",5.0
"I love Cafe Tibet! My go to's are Thali (chicken or lamb), Tingmo, and the spicy chicken and tofu soup.. great if you have a stuffy nose or if you just want something with a slight kick. All of the food is great and the staff are very nice. It is a small place and everything is made fresh, so plan for about a 20 minute wait. I usually order by phone at the Newkirk stop, get some cash on the way, maybe run an errand on Cortelyou, and then grab my food to go.They only take cash, but I don't mind because they are special - so I get to treat it like a special occasion, even though the prices are good for everyday!Fun Fact: A few years ago, I ended up hosting Thanksgiving in my tiny studio apartment and we had a ""Very Tibetan No Turkey Day."" The staff were so sweet when I told them why I was ordering so much food, and when I tried to carry it home (like a clumbsy doof) they gave me a ride in the van so that it wouldn't get cold. And probably because they thought my giggly mom and I were funny.",5.0
"Good food. Interesting menu. Friendly service. Unfortunately, a very small restaurant with very tight seating. No matter how much you try, it is very difficult to get comfortable.

Taking their recommendation I ordered the Curry Beef and I enjoyed it. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but it was good. I should've started off by saying THE BEEF MOMOS!!! Oh my goodness. Had just 4 and I wanted more but I had to leave space for by entree. Absolutely amazing. I also had the Tibetan Iced Tea with Milk and it was also satisfying as it was hot outside that day.

It absolutely has everything to do with it being the ONLY Tibetan spot in the hood and beyond, so they can get away with it. It's a niche market!

Oh Cafe Tibet! What a wonderful little restaurant.  I just joined Yelp and I could not think of a better business to write my first review about.The first time my husband and I came to this restaurant was before we moved to Ditmas Park and before we knew we were even going to move there.  Two months later we moved around the corner and began eating there 2-3 times monthly for the two years that we lived there.  The Vegetarian Curry was my go to dish but at times I ventured to the Ginger Tofu or to Shogo Ngopa which were both pretty great. The Chana-Khatsa is also pretty awesome but it has a kick to it so sometimes it can be a bit much to start off with (depending on your tolerance for spicy food).  My husband was a huge fan of the lamb curry and the ginger chicken.BYOB is also a plus.  The only negative is that it is very small so it isn't good for groups of more than 6.We miss you Cafe Tibet!,5.0

This is a cute little spot in the cut in Flatbush Brooklyn. I never go to Flatbush but when I found this place I had to try it as I was curious about Tibetan food and the reviews made it even more enticing. We had the chicken and veggie momo half friend and half boiled. The veggie one did have much of a developed favor but the chicken one was really good. My friend ordered the ginger chicken with half rice and half bread which she said was really good she loved the flavor combination of the ginger and the spice. I ordered the lamb curry it was really good. It have me Indian and Thai fusion with a little kick. The flavors were delicious but the lamb didn't sit well with my stomach. I have never had lamb before and I am a pescatarian. I wanted to try it once and only once. There was my moment lol. You should definitely check out the place you like adventure with your taste buds!,4.0
The tiniest of restaurants and hard to find but it is a little gem. No sign on the street just a little alleyway tucked between an Asian grocer and the subway on Cortelyou road. I had gone here about 5 years ago and for the life of me I don't know why I haven't been back sooner.  I simply had a light dinner of chicken and coconut curried noodles with a few vegetables.  I washed it down with a complex Tibetan iced tea. Basically a chai but just right. Next time I have to try some appetizers I recall that they were very good.  When I was here last I catered a luncheon for the exiled king of Tibet who was making a visit to my school.  It was a great experience and the King gave it thumbs up too. It takes a little while for the food to come out but considering how small this place is the kitchen must be the size of a phone booth.  Worth the wait.,4.0

"When I arrived in Brooklyn this week, I checked Yelp for interesting places to visit.  The first place that caught my eye was Cafe Tibet, but it took me all week to finally make it there.  I'm glad I eventually did.Located by the train station, and nestled against a grocery store, Cafe Tibet is easy to miss.  But the food is intensely flavorful, and the service is attentive.  I was expecting an eclectic blend of Chinese and Indian, and while that's what I got, I don't think that description really does the place justice.  We had a seriously spicy appetizer of gelatinous bean curd, that made me sweat from the first bite.  I then had a chicken corn soup, which was almost, but not entirely, unlike the Chinese version.  It was darker and more flavorful, but with the same congealing skin on top that I love.  My friend had the shrimp curry, which seemed like a mixture of Thai and Indian, and was absolutely delicious.  I really loved the decor as well.  Each table gets a dragon head totem, and many get these crazy face masks that look almost vampiric (though they likely have a religious meaning diametrically opposite).  There were also many framed scrolls, some of which contained a devanagari inspired script, others with the words of the 14th Dalai Lama.  Definitely a must go place if you're in the neighborhood.",4.0
"To say I have an addiction to Cafe Tibet is a drastic understatement. We took a leisurely stroll down to Ditmas about a month ago. After trying the...Momos: Savory wheat dumplings stuffed with your favorite meat, scallions and spices galore, served with the house sesame hot sauce,Shrimp Coconut Curry: Light and creamy coconut milk-based fragrant yellow curry with over a dozen decently sized shrimp. Served with either rice or bread.Lamb Biryani: Think indian biryani without the cream (soy sauce instead, but we ordered it without), heavier on the cardamon, meat, and scallions with significantly less cumin. Surprisingly tasty and markedly distinctive for such a standard dish....We've been biking instead just to sate our cravings even sooner. Alas... y'all can hang up your helmets/keys/teleportation devices -a couple of minutes saved won't make you fuller faster. CT is classically understaffed, and the kitchen takes its time. Even takeout will run you 30, even 45 minutes during peak hours. Bring a book, good company, and some patience, and you/your wallet are certainly in for a treat.",4.0
Momos were a 3/10. I've had better. Prices on Yelp aren't prices on menu (Yelp cheaper and not up to date). Service is subpar. Had to get my own menu and ask to have order taken. Took 40 min for one order of momos to come out. There are only 2 other parties in restaurant.,1.0
"Savory, flavorful, comfort food! Wonderful home-made-tasting dishes, especially the Beef Pingsha with rice and Beef Steamed Momos! Great hot sauce too so make sure you ask for the red hot sauce.

We were able to rearrange the furniture to accommodate everyone in our party and the staff didn't mind this at all. I stuck with the Sukuti [$5]. The deep fried pork seemed better this time around than all the other times for no reason in particular. Everyone at my table loved it as well. The vegetables were delicious too, the onions were perfectly caramelized and soaked up the spices. By the end of the meal I was trying not to use a spoon to drink down the [grease-filled] sauce.The Lamb Curry [$9] was equally delicious, just not as much of a flavor bomb as the sukuti. The lamb was extremely tender and the curry was very mild. Get rice with this dish so it can soak up the curry sauce, which there is a lot of! Like last time, I spent $20 for a pleasantly hearty meal. I seriously can't rave about this place enough.",5.0

This is a cute little spot in the cut in Flatbush Brooklyn. I never go to Flatbush but when I found this place I had to try it as I was curious about Tibetan food and the reviews made it even more enticing. We had the chicken and veggie momo half friend and half boiled. The veggie one did have much of a developed favor but the chicken one was really good. My friend ordered the ginger chicken with half rice and half bread which she said was really good she loved the flavor combination of the ginger and the spice. I ordered the lamb curry it was really good. It have me Indian and Thai fusion with a little kick. The flavors were delicious but the lamb didn't sit well with my stomach. I have never had lamb before and I am a pescatarian. I wanted to try it once and only once. There was my moment lol. You should definitely check out the place you like adventure with your taste buds!,4.0
The tiniest of restaurants and hard to find but it is a little gem. No sign on the street just a little alleyway tucked between an Asian grocer and the subway on Cortelyou road. I had gone here about 5 years ago and for the life of me I don't know why I haven't been back sooner.  I simply had a light dinner of chicken and coconut curried noodles with a few vegetables.  I washed it down with a complex Tibetan iced tea. Basically a chai but just right. Next time I have to try some appetizers I recall that they were very good.  When I was here last I catered a luncheon for the exiled king of Tibet who was making a visit to my school.  It was a great experience and the King gave it thumbs up too. It takes a little while for the food to come out but considering how small this place is the kitchen must be the size of a phone booth.  Worth the wait.,4.0
"Their beef and chicken momos are my neighborhood comfort food. Plus, the salad dressing is great and the chickpea appetizer. Really, everything I've had. And peanut butter tea! Yes, bring cash. No cards. It's affordable though.",4.0
"When I arrived in Brooklyn this week, I checked Yelp for interesting places to visit.  The first place that caught my eye was Cafe Tibet, but it took me all week to finally make it there.  I'm glad I eventually did.Located by the train station, and nestled against a grocery store, Cafe Tibet is easy to miss.  But the food is intensely flavorful, and the service is attentive.  I was expecting an eclectic blend of Chinese and Indian, and while that's what I got, I don't think that description really does the place justice.  We had a seriously spicy appetizer of gelatinous bean curd, that made me sweat from the first bite.  I then had a chicken corn soup, which was almost, but not entirely, unlike the Chinese version.  It was darker and more flavorful, but with the same congealing skin on top that I love.  My friend had the shrimp curry, which seemed like a mixture of Thai and Indian, and was absolutely delicious.  I really loved the decor as well.  Each table gets a dragon head totem, and many get these crazy face masks that look almost vampiric (though they likely have a religious meaning diametrically opposite).  There were also many framed scrolls, some of which contained a devanagari inspired script, others with the words of the 14th Dalai Lama.  Definitely a must go place if you're in the neighborhood.",4.0
"To say I have an addiction to Cafe Tibet is a drastic understatement. We took a leisurely stroll down to Ditmas about a month ago. After trying the...Momos: Savory wheat dumplings stuffed with your favorite meat, scallions and spices galore, served with the house sesame hot sauce,Shrimp Coconut Curry: Light and creamy coconut milk-based fragrant yellow curry with over a dozen decently sized shrimp. Served with either rice or bread.Lamb Biryani: Think indian biryani without the cream (soy sauce instead, but we ordered it without), heavier on the cardamon, meat, and scallions with significantly less cumin. Surprisingly tasty and markedly distinctive for such a standard dish....We've been biking instead just to sate our cravings even sooner. Alas... y'all can hang up your helmets/keys/teleportation devices -a couple of minutes saved won't make you fuller faster. CT is classically understaffed, and the kitchen takes its time. Even takeout will run you 30, even 45 minutes during peak hours. Bring a book, good company, and some patience, and you/your wallet are certainly in for a treat.",4.0
Momos were a 3/10. I've had better. Prices on Yelp aren't prices on menu (Yelp cheaper and not up to date). Service is subpar. Had to get my own menu and ask to have order taken. Took 40 min for one order of momos to come out. There are only 2 other parties in restaurant.,1.0
"Savory, flavorful, comfort food! Wonderful home-made-tasting dishes, especially the Beef Pingsha with rice and Beef Steamed Momos! Great hot sauce too so make sure you ask for the red hot sauce. It's not so spicy, so fear not if you can't handle spicy. It's very robust and flavorful! The space is always warm and welcoming. BYOB means I can bring my own wine! Definitely a great dining place that is authentic Tibetan.",4.0

"I had rather high hopes, after reading reviews for this place. While the beef momo I ordered was tasty, it took over 40 minutes for it to arrive. I wasn't in a hurry, but I was hungry, and service here is nonexistent. It was just before that when the only waitress in the place informed me that I wouldn't be getting the Chai tea I ordered.

"I was super excited to try Tibetan food for the first time, but this place was seriously disappointing. The service was terrible. I tried to be patient as I know different cultures have different standards for these things, but this was truly unacceptable. It took forever before we were even asked for our order. An hour later, she brought my entree, 15 minutes later she brought the appetizer (YES after my meal), and after 2 hours we finally just told her to forget about my friend's curry. She never brought the rice I ordered with my meal and she never asked us for refills on our water. The worst part was that another group of people who appeared to be her friends came in after us and they received their food very quickly and were treated much better. She never even apologized for the horrible service. The food itself was nothing to brag about it either. The ambiance of the place is pretty cute, but it is quite small. Probably won't go back.",2.0
"It's such a small cafe around the corner that I almost didn't see it. One waitress serve all tables, answer takeout phone calls and get the check, so it's a long wait. The food worth four stars though. I'm glad that I finally find a restaurant with good butter tea.",3.0

"I've heard a lot of good things about Cafe Tibet and finally decided to try it this past Saturday. Overall I really enjoyed the food and would be back for sure. The service wasn't the best as there was only one waitress but the food came out quickly and we didn't really have any issues. As it's above the train tracks the sound of the Q/B going by can get a little annoying and kill conversation. We went with the boiled combo momo platter to start. The vegetarian was very bland and the chicken was also lacking in flavor, I had to put a healthy dose of sauce on both. The beef was excellent, it had a great flavor and was definitely my favorite of the bunch. I have no idea what the difference between the 2 sauces they put on our table was, they both tasted and looked the same. For my meal I went with the pork chili which I thought was great. The portion size is adequate and I was stuffed at the end of the meal. It had a good amount of meat and a nice assortment of vegetables, the sauce wasn't too heavy. I went with the rice which was just a small bowl of plain white rice, I also got a order of tingmo on the side. I'm not a huge fan of steamed bread but it was pretty good and very dense, great for sopping up the extra sauce. I also had a sweet tea which I really liked, it was served very hot and would be amazing on a cold day. It was a heavily spiced black tea with milk, my friend had a sip and had to order one for himself. My roommate went with chicken friend rice. He enjoyed it though I didn't see much chicken, looked like it was only tiny little cubes. My other friend went with the vegetable curry which he rated as very good. I think we all agreed that we would come back. If they were on seamless I could see myself ordering from them all the time. The prices are very reasonable as well for the quality of food and it's a great neighborhood spot.",4.0
"Since the day it opened this place frustrates me with its inconsistency. Years ago while walking to the food coop on Cortelyou Rd my friend and I discovered a tiny new restaurant that had just opened right next to the Q train station. We tried it and loved most of the food we had. I has the lamb thali which is still my favorite. In fact, it is one of my comfort foods. The curried lamb, spicy potatoes, mustard greens, beets, and tingmo combine to produce an unforgettable experience.Though to this day the momo dough remains too chewy and tough, the menu selection and food quality has improved.My main complaint about this restaurant has been and still remains  food inconsistency.Even the lamb curry, which is a staple at this restaurant, can be almost completely unseasoned and dry one day and succulent the next.Two weeks ago my husband and I decided to give Cafe Tibet's noodles another chance when we needed to grab a quick bite before a movie. He had curry chicken noodles and I had pork chow mein. We just could not get enough of those noodles! The veggies in my chow me in were crisp and refreshing. The pork soft and well-seasoned. Delicious! And the curry noodles were smothered in this thick, delicious gravy.Tonight we decided to pick up the same two dishes and were extremely disappointed. Tonight's chow mein was bone dry, yet the veggies were soggy and wilted. The pork was so dry that some pieces were crunchy and I had to spit them out. There was no sauce or seasoning of any kind, maybe just a pinch of salt.The curry noodles were also very dry and under-seasoned.It looked like all the ingredients for our food had been left to sit on a counter somewhere for hours, then they were haphazardly slapped together, and the resulting dishes were left sitting on the counter for a few more hours.But I know that the next time we eat there (or the time after that) the food will knock our socks off.",3.0

"Oh Cafe Tibet, you are my happy place with a touch of spice and everything nice. The first time I went here my boyfriend decided to surprise me. Before going here I asked him, where were we going.

So from the outside it feels like you are about to work in the train station. But you're not it looks like a 'hole in the wall' type of place. But the worse it looks, the better the food!

"came in on sunday for dinner. if you make it before 8 you should be seated but food takes a LONG LONG TIME to come out. and like other yelpers, my food came all at once. i rather have been served out of order because i just want to eat!! come at least 40 minutes before you intend on feeding yourself. or you will catch yourself constantly looking over at the tables near you and salivating. i had the chicken curry with ting mo (which is like a plain bread). best choice ever! it was freaking amazing. i dipped the ting mo in the sauce and slopped it all up. i might have licked the bowl clean in the end. the chicken was meaty, but like other yelpers mentioned, there were some pieces that were literally just bone. that wasn't nice because it made the dish bigger than it really was. we also tried variety momo- that wasn't up my alley. i prefer to have chinese dumplings because the wrap is thinner. if you like thick dumpling wraps then you may enjoy the momo. flavor was a bit lacking in my opinion. also tried chili beef which was an interesting sour/spicy twist. didn't have room to try the other popular item -the beef patty. but i wouldn't mind coming back soon. that chicken curry is addictive.

"I've been coming here since I moved to Brooklyn. Yes, the service is slow, but the food is good. I like the Then Tuk  (homemade noodle soup with vegetables and your choice of meat).

"So much love for Cafe Tibet.  My roommates and I went last night (in the blizzard, yes; it was worth it) and had a great time.  The place is tiny which you should definitely be aware of - the largest group they can really fit is 4 people, and there are maybe 10 tables inside.  But it's so pleasant - calming green walls, Dalai Lama quotes, the scent of burning incense, kind and friendly waitstaff.  It amazes me that such a place exists in my neighborhood.And then there's the food.  We shared everything we ordered, so we tried the peanut butter tea, the butter tea, and the chai (which was absolutely perfect.)  We had the La-Phing for an appetizer, which is mung beans in a very spicy sauce.  Loved it, but be prepared for the spice!!  We also enjoyed dipping our tingmo bread in the sauce.I had the Sha-Baklap for my meal, which are fried beef dumplings - very good!  We also enjoyed the veggie dumplings and my roommate loved her pork curry.Also good to know - it's BYOB and cash only!Definitely will be back - my meal last night is all I can think about today.",4.0
"The only bad thing about Café Tibet is that it's not in my own neighborhood. Truth be told, a good friend of mine lives nearby and I noticed it hiding there beside the Cortelyou Road B/Q-train station one day when I was visiting the area. I actually said ""This restaurant is as diminutive as Tibet itself,"" but I hope that doesn't come off as condescending. On a subsequent visit to the neighborhood, I brought a couple of friends along (adventurous eaters too, which helps) and we had one of the most exciting, memorable Asian food meals I've had in a long time.We were able to snag a table around 7:00pm on a recent Saturday night with no problem. As I mentioned, the restaurant is small with a few outdoor tables and one is immediately struck with the comforting scent of incense when you walk in. I don't know why, but we all agreed that was a really nice touch. Anyway, the menu itself is fairly extensive with a large selection of foods I had never tried before. Ripe for the picking, we went for a few truly awesome items, all of which were vegetarian. The menu's descriptions are a bit lacking in some ways, so some side-Googling while deciding helped a lot. We started with the la-phing appetizer and vegetarian momos. La-phing is truly what I'd call an ""acquired taste"" as you're presented with a bowl of mung bean jelly (clear, hot cubes with little taste) bathed in a shockingly spicy sauce. The first taste was eye-opening and tear-inducing, but we all kept going back for more. The vegetarian momos were good as well, stuffed with an interesting mixture of cabbage and ginger. We loved their peanutty, spicy dipping sauce for the momos, too (in the red bottle). I went for the ginger tofu as my main which was another big hit. Served with tingmo on the side (steamed buns/bread great for sopping up all that sauce), it was a fresh, fairly light choice which I really liked. My friends also loved their flat noodle soup which had a lightly creamy broth and lots of vegetables in it. Service at Café Tibet was friendly and fast and I was really impressed with everything. This is another restaurant I'm looking forward to coming back to time and time again.",5.0
"LOVE this little gem that I recently discovered.  This cafe is teeny tiny, but the food is incredible.   I would highly recommend the veggie momos, glass noodles with potato and coriander, and fried veggie patties.  My husband says the beef momos are excellent and so is the pork chili with tingmo (steamed tibetian bread).  Everything is so good!!

"I've enjoyed cafe Tibet many times regardless of its slow and disorganized service and long waits...the food was always excellent. Today the salmon thali I ordered to go was a huge disappointment....the fish so dry, opening a can would have been preferable, the sides flat, under seasoned and flavorless (and god only knows what that stale tortilla like thing is supposed to be). I asked twice for some of their tasty hot sauce, both girls nodded but didn't give me any. I had to slather everything with salt and sriracha to make the meal somewhat edible. The first time I got the salmon it was juicy and delicious, the second not quite as good but acceptable...and now this mess. Other downsides that I forgave because the food used to be pretty darn tasty are: they don't take credit cards, nor do they deliver. Bummer.",2.0
"So glad BK has its own Tibetan food so I don't have to trek into Manhattan or dare I say it, Queens!Cafe Tibet is so small you could miss it at first, it's tucked into the side of a fruit store by the train station.

I hate when places just throw generic Chinese take out dumplings at you (AKA EVERY OTHER CHEAP SUSHI PLACE'S ""GYOZA"").But to get back on track, the veggie momo were delicious and Tibetan! The Then Thuk was great too. If you're never had it, it's a hand pulled noodle soup that's really homey and hits the spot. I like the Then Thuk at Tsampa in the E.

"I live 5 blocks away from this place and it has taken me over a year to try this place, after the 1st time I noticed it.This Tibetan Cafe is a little hole in the wall restaurant, located down an alley next to the Q train subway entrance on Cortelyou Avenue in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.  It is easy to miss the sign, unless you're looking up.  However, like many hole in the wall's, it is well worth the trip for delicious, authentic Tibetan food.Rustic decor and a dark interior - this is definitely not the place for decor and ambiance.  However, the restaurant is clean, with a friendly staff, who all speak English.  Surprisingly, for this type of restaurant, it is apparent they pay attention to details in the presentation of the food.The best cup of Chai I have ever had at a restaurant! At many Indian restaurants, it is made at the moment and the flavor of cardamom and ginger is not given enough time to permeate the liquid.  Not the case here.  A large cup of chai for only $1.50.  The tea is simmered for time, so it is a delicious, spicy cup of perfect chai.The biryani was flavorful with large chunks of tender lamb.  The chili chicken was also delicious, although different from the chili chicken I am used to eating at Indian restaurants.  Instead of strips of chicken, it was chicken meatballs - the perfect amount of chili - spicy, but not overpowering.They have a few cakes for dessert.  The mango cake was a wonderfully light mango flan on top of an equally light sponge cake.

"Tibetan food in Brooklyn, Yay!  To me Tibetan food is perfect a least once in the winter. I've only eaten here once, and ordered what I usually do at Tibetan places, Beef Chili which came with Tingmo bread (think it was supposed to also come with rice as well, but came with two big breads, so no complaints.) I was pleasantly surprised by the authenticity. Was seriously expecting this place would really just be Chinese, trying to pass for Tibetan. There were many choices on the menu. Maybe because I came on a Tuesday, middle of the day, the wait was short, not what others have experiencedThe food was served very hot (as in heated not spicy). Decided to order an appetizer before I left, since didn't know when I'd be back. It was curried potatoes, which just seemed like boiled potatoes with a little spice, not too exciting.I also liked that the decor seemed ""old school"", meaning knick knacks put together by the owners and not curated by an expert.This place is very easy to miss, you might think it was someone's house, inside a gate, and hidden between a subway station and a deli. Wish they had some kind of lunch special as prices are a little more than I'd want to spend, so keeping me from frequenting here. Also while not unfriendly they are not exactly attentive, at least when I was there. The young lady there spoke English but didn't seem helpful in questions about the cuisine, and completely ignored a question by a couple also dining there (it was a question about the place which may have been too personal, How'd she get the job, was it a family business?), but I think she could've handled it better.

I was worried that this place would be too noisy because of the train but (we sat inside) I couldn't hear it at all. I love the green walls and decor of this place! Service was friendly. And ... it's BYOB. I went down to Market (about a block away) and picked up some chilled craft beers to have with dinner. And what a dinner it was. I chose the Ginger chicken. Holy CRAP it was good. Not too spicy but full of flavor. We got some interesting starters as well: some sort of beef and spicy mung beans, which were spicy and unusual.

"Small restaurant hidden by a train station. The food is really good and the chai is awesome.  I haven't been to many tibetan restaurants to compare, so for now, it gets 3 stars",3.0
"Holy crap! I was blown away by Cafe Tibet! A tiny little hole in the wall, right next to the subway. I was looking for something cheap but unique to take my mom for her bday. I was worried that this place would be too noisy because of the train but (we sat inside) I couldn't hear it at all. I love the green walls and decor of this place! Service was friendly. And ... it's BYOB. I went down to Market (about a block away) and picked up some chilled craft beers to have with dinner. And what a dinner it was. I chose the Ginger chicken. Holy CRAP it was good. Not too spicy but full of flavor. We got some interesting starters as well: some sort of beef and spicy mung beans, which were spicy and unusual. My Mom ordered #20, which was glass noodles with potatoes and coriander. That might be the best dish I tried. The chili chicken was good as well. Plus the prices are great. I will be back!",5.0
"I have been craving for this stuff ever since we had it at our monthly Town Hall Meeting!  It's one of those types of food you know would be SICK as leftovers...if there happened to be any that is.  I can't tell you how upset I was when I went to look in the work fridge to see it completely raped from its contents!  I'm still softly bitching about it in my head as I write this...damn!Anyway, so my company ordered for our Tibetan workers a lovely spread of comfort food for them.  We had no idea what to get, so the guy who took our order simply said, ""I know what they want.""  Well, I know what I want too!  I want those freaking fried dumplings that were stuffed with a Jamaican beef (at least that's what it reminded me of), ginger chicken with spinach, steamed plain buns, veggies like you've never tasted with a light curry sauce, and curried potatoes.  Vegetarians reign supreme at my work, and no one uttered a word as we took up our chopsticks and engorged.  Yes, it reminds me too of mildly spicy Indian food with a little Chinese flare, but just tell them you've never had the stuff before, and they will fix you up reallll nice! GET ENOUGH FOR LEFTOVERS!!! Don't be regretful like me...::sigh::",5.0
"The food is delicious and the prices are completely reasonable. I get the thali so I can eat multiple items & also because the greens are SO amazing. The dumpling appetizers are super good, too. Also, their chai is authentic in a way that transports me back to India. Service is very good. CASH ONLY!",5.0
The food here is good but the restaurant cannot handle the volume and becomes disorganized. Appetizer was served halfway through eating entrees   We ordered tea and asked about it several times but did not get it until after we were presented with check and we pointed out to waitress that we had been charged for it. I would call and order food to go,3.0
LOVE this tiny trinket of a restaurant. The food is really special and delicious. We came here on a cold night to warm up with some curry and noodles. Such a great idea. My shrimp curry was phenomenal as was our beef appetizer. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. I couldn't ask for anything more. I will definitely be going back.,5.0
"Cafe Tibet, why oh why aren't you huddled in a cove next to MY train station?A group of girls and I headed to Cafe Tibet, a super small restaurant nestled quietly behind the Cortelyou Road train station in Brooklyn.  It's set far back behind the station, in a place where you can only see it if you're looking for it - I left the resto to get cash out of an ATM (they don't take credit cards) and actually had a hard time finding it again.  I got the Vegetable Cafe Tibet Thali - it was a heap of steamed vegetables in a spicy coconut curry seasoned with ginger and cilantro, seasoned beets, steamed mustard greens and spicy cabbage.  Everything was separated purposefully in a metal ""lunch tray"" plate.  I can't remember another Asian inspired meal that I've had in my life that conveyed so many distinct layers of flavor - I literally savored every bite of each component.Cute metal cups kept our water cold without ice cubes.   The ""Tibetan Ice Tea"" is a must - no joke, it tastes like a liquid Froot Loop.  The waitresses were quiet but gracious, and the bill came out to about $10 a head with drinks - cheap, satisfying, and the newest addition to my go-to resto list in Brooklyn.I've never thought much about Tibet, but if the food here is any hint about what its like, I'm ready to book my ticket!",5.0
"There is friendly service in this small restaurant.  Almost all 2 tops under 20 seats so you might have to wait, they'll text you when you're table is ready.

"Cafe Tibet was the first restaurant my Wife and I visited when we began looking at places to live in the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn a little over two years ago.  We instantly fell in love with the hallway-sized, Q train-adjacent eatery and the incredible Tibetan fare they served.  It has changed a little over the past two years; new seats and tables, new menu/menu organization, slightly increased prices increases.  There have also been some issues with inconsistencies in the food preparation.  One time they used a tangy, citrusy dressing instead of the original creamy variant and, although I thought it was an interesting flavor, they were back to the original in no time.  Service can be slow at times, especially if you hope to get a seat outside (and don't mind the rumble of the B train or the screeching brakes of the Q).  Bit it's a popular joint, and rightfully so.  Plan on waiting 30 minutes to an hour at peak times!  BYOB makes the experience even better.  The bodega next door is a great place to pick up a brew or walk a few extra steps to the liquor store just a stones throw away for some wine or bubbly.  Oh yeah, and don't forget to bring cash to your Tibetan feast (cash only).  There's an ATM in the bodega too!",5.0

"This is a so far so good review because when I stopped in at Cafe Tibet today all I had was  tingmo (freshly steamed bread) with hot sauce and their spiced sweet tea. The tingmo was quite similar to the steamed bread used to make Chinese cha sui bau (steamed pork buns) but the spicy sauce made it come alive with flavor (but be forewarned, the sauce is legitimately hot!). The spiced tea was an excellent chai. The restaurant is quite small so I am glad I went at an off hour and as many have noted, the service is very friendly.Some other pluses are that Tibetan people eat here and that it is about a 10 second walk from the Cortelyou Rd stop on the Q train. Already on my to try list next visit are the Sha-Baklap and the Momo!Second visit (the next day): The Sha-Baklap were amazing and the spiced sweet tea just as good as yesterday!  My only disappointment was that as much as I love the music of Bob Marley, and I do, I would prefer to hear him while I eat Jamaican jerk chicken and to listen to authentic Tibetan music while I am eating Sha-Baklap.",4.0
"Slow service but good RARE food nonetheless. There aren't many Tibetan restaurants in NYC, so when I discovered this little hidden joint next to the Q train's local stop, I immediately dined in. Nowadays, I order by phone and pick up to go. I usually order the beef momos which are basically dumplings but they are oh so good! They are juicy and quite big. I think it's worth the $10. I have also tried the peanut tea... I don't recommend it but it's good to try once, although very pricey for something I dumped out once it turned cold. It's very thick and fattening, like eating/drinking a jar of peanut butter and chocolate milk. Otherwise, place is small and cramped and smells like incense, but feels authentic because they are actually Tibetan.",5.0

"After debating three or four options on Cortelyou Road, we finally settled on Cafe Tibet, as noted, a tiny restaurant right next to the subway stop. Expectations were relatively high, as we had sorted through several options and landed on this one. To get it out of the way, the service was really mediocre at best. The restaurant was small, tiny even, so it seemed to take a very long time to get water, a waitress to take our orders, etc. Something that really bugged me was that there were three of us, and all three of our meals came at separate times. It really wasn't fun watching the first person eat for a solid five minutes, then the second, and got my meal last. Also, I didn't quite get what I ordered, but when I said something, the waitress sort of dropped the dish off and ran off without engaging with me. The good part was the food (obviously the most important part) was, for the most part, good. I wasn't a huge fan of the tingmo (steamed bread), because it had said on the menu that it was fried. However, my two companions seemed to enjoy it more, but for me, it was quite doughy and unappetizing. One friend ordered a combination momo, and the dumplings were better than average. Another ordered shrimp chilli, which was quite tasty and spicy. Lastly, I ordered a dish I didn't know was soup, turned out to be soup, and was a decent soup. Overall, satisfied with the soup.

"This place is authentic as it gets.It's weirdly, but conveniently, located directly to/above a train station. This place is cozy and calm-very intimate space, but not too intimate. Also, the eclectic music was quite quirky. The food here is AWESOME. FIRSTLY, let's address the homemade hot sauce: I don't know what the hell's in it, but it's freakin' delicious. I lathered it  over all my dishes,not that they absolutely needed to be, it was just that good. The Sukuti, which is stir-fried dried beef bits and chopped onions [which is also cooked with the delicious hot sauce I mentioned] is so flavorful.The Shogo - Khatsa, which is curried potatoes is also very tasty.The Cafe Tibet Thali offers several of the food groups; the chicken 'curry' that was included was pretty mild, compared to other ethnic curries.  The Momos are tasty, although if you're bored of eating steamed dumplings (being of Asian descent,of course),I'd advise not to order it. I wasn't a fan of the veggie ones, I thought it lacked flavor.Ginger Chicken is ""very tasty"" and "" the chicken is in meatball form"", as Vanessa G. says, and it comes with plentiful rice.Prices and portions are good; you totally get what you pay for, service is okay, size is cozy, music and lighting is nice- And there aren't that many Tibetan places.I'm definitely coming back here.",4.0

I'm sure I will come back really soon!",5.0
"This place is authentic as it gets.It's weirdly, but conveniently, located directly to/above a train station. This place is cozy and calm-very intimate space, but not too intimate. Also, the eclectic music was quite quirky. The food here is AWESOME. FIRSTLY, let's address the homemade hot sauce: I don't know what the hell's in it, but it's freakin' delicious. I lathered it  over all my dishes,not that they absolutely needed to be, it was just that good. The Sukuti, which is stir-fried dried beef bits and chopped onions [which is also cooked with the delicious hot sauce I mentioned] is so flavorful.The Shogo - Khatsa, which is curried potatoes is also very tasty.The Cafe Tibet Thali offers several of the food groups; the chicken 'curry' that was included was pretty mild, compared to other ethnic curries.  The Momos are tasty, although if you're bored of eating steamed dumplings (being of Asian descent,of course),I'd advise not to order it. I wasn't a fan of the veggie ones, I thought it lacked flavor.Ginger Chicken is ""very tasty"" and "" the chicken is in meatball form"", as Vanessa G. says, and it comes with plentiful rice.Prices and portions are good; you totally get what you pay for, service is okay, size is cozy, music and lighting is nice- And there aren't that many Tibetan places.I'm definitely coming back here.",4.0
"Dirt cheap. Delicious. Authentic. Cafe Tibet does great business despite being a hole in the wall next to the Cortelyou stop and easy to miss. They do it because their good dishes are, as people have written, legitimately wonderful. Tingmo is great with everything. I don't go here enough.",5.0

"Awesome momo's (dumplings). Nepali/Tibetan momo's are different from Quintessential dumplings. There's usually more spices and veggies. Cafe Tibet has a pretty close taste to home cooked momo's. It's full of flavor and their hot sauces are amazing. So far I've tried their beef and chicken dumplings, I like them both equally. Now if only they added delivery service!",4.0
"Too much good food. I had to wrap most of it to go.  There was no way I could fit in 9 whole dumplings.  They have flavorful meals including rice and noodle dishes and soups.  I remember there being vegetarian options along with meat eater platters as well.  I went with a huge group of friends and was able to get a table for 6.  Lucky am I!  There are not many seats maybe 12?  It's right next to the Q train at Cortelyou Ave and I've always been dying to try it.  Plus, I haven't tried Tibetan food before.  Reminds me of Malaysian food but with more of a Thai influence, but that's really my opinion.  Instead of taking my word for it, you should visit and just have a taste!",4.0
"I really wanted to like Cafe Tibet, especially since I had wanted to check it out for months. Unfortunately, it was a let-down.The vegetarian momos were bland.

When they got too spicy, I ate them as is - Instant blandness. My friend said the same about his beef momos (bland and kind of dry). He liked his strawberry-banana lassi but I wasn't really a fan of my mango lassi.

"On this very rainy evening, we had to push past subway riders using the attached grocery store's awning for cover.

The dish was good, but maybe looked too good for what was actually possible, and did not have quite the explosion of taste I was expecting. The other main course was Shogo Ngopa, described as spicy fried potato and spinach. This is an accurate enough description, but the delight of the dish was the accompanying Tibetan bread, which I used for dipping in the sauces and broths of everything we ordered.And of course, no Tibetan meal is complete without Momos, a type of dumpling, and another staple of Tibetan cuisine.

It seemed like every table in the tiny place had at least one order.We were thoroughly plumped from eating way too much, but could not resist the Dreysil, a sweet rice dessert with white and black raisins interspersed.

"I love that you don't need a car in New York.  As much as we bitch and moan about the public transit system, it can really take you just about anywhere within the five boroughs.  There are certain places (like Red Hook, Brooklyn) that are difficult to reach by train and will force you to walk for 20 minutes or so.  But, still, a 20 minute walk is nothing.  And always a welcomed activity when I'm eating all this gut stretching food.But Cafe Tibet required barely any walking at all.  It was literally outside the Cortelyou subway station in Ditmas Park.  It's wedged between the station and the deli next door.  It's an adorable little shop that whisks you away to another world.  And from what I hear, in warmer months, there is even a garden overlooking the train tracks.  And since this is far into Brooklyn, it's more picturesque than you might think.Predictably, Cafe Tibet (or Top Cafe Tibet, as the sign reads) serves Tibetan food.  The most famous dish is the momos, which are steamed dumplings.  So we ordered the combo momo platter, along with a very light but filling barley soup, and the sha-baklap.Time Out describes them as a Tibetan version of Jamaican beef patties.  They look more like a big deep-fried dumpling.  When you cut into the crispy dough (biting into it was a bit daunting), it seems like all the juices ooze out.  Fortunately, the juices stay on the plate and soak back into the crust.The inside was a big clump of beef patty.  It was very well-seasoned (with onions, ginger, and spices) and overly juicy.  And it stayed together amazingly well.  Maybe a little too well as it was hard to break apart and I almost ate half the filling in my first bite.  Which would have been fine since it was so tasty, but I wanted to spread it out over the entire sha-baklap.  I love saying that.  Sha-baklap.The flaky dough was just a touch sweet and slightly spicy.  And it worked very well with the savory beef inside.  It was a nice combination and an interesting take on the beef patty.  And I got to try this authentic Tibetan food with barely leaving the subway.  Now that's service.-eatthisny",4.0

"Even thought it was completely empty at 6pm on a Tuesday evening it felt intimate and friendly. Don't judge it by it's location once you step inside its charming and tastefully decorated. We wanted to order a plate of chicken momos, the beef sha-baklap and an entree but the guy behind the counter said the sha-baklap would take 40 minutes. We ended up ordering:-Ginger Chicken: so very tasty, the chicken is in meatball form which was a bit weird at first but the flavors made up for any texture issues I had. The ginger flavor was not overpowering but definitely present. Expect peppers, string beans, spinach and bite sized chicken meatballs sitting in a tangy ginger sauce.-Pork Chilli: nice sized pieces of tender pork in a spicy sauce. The spiciness here hits just the right note as it doesn't get in the way of the flavors of the other ingredients of the dish.

"I've been by a couple of times, it's one of the more humble eateries along Cortelyu that still has credibility with a younger crowd. It is cash only. They have a basic menu of hearty dishes. A small seating area outside and a small one inside. It smells like incense on the inside. The salted butter tea is not made with yak butter, I asked, it tastes good though. Nothing here is ""exotic"", not to my palate at least, it's just very well seasoned vegetables and meats and carbohydrates. Very yummy stuff.",4.0
"I love that you don't need a car in New York.  As much as we bitch and moan about the public transit system, it can really take you just about anywhere within the five boroughs.  There are certain places (like Red Hook, Brooklyn) that are difficult to reach by train and will force you to walk for 20 minutes or so.  But, still, a 20 minute walk is nothing.  And always a welcomed activity when I'm eating all this gut stretching food.But Cafe Tibet required barely any walking at all.  It was literally outside the Cortelyou subway station in Ditmas Park.  It's wedged between the station and the deli next door.  It's an adorable little shop that whisks you away to another world.  And from what I hear, in warmer months, there is even a garden overlooking the train tracks.  And since this is far into Brooklyn, it's more picturesque than you might think.Predictably, Cafe Tibet (or Top Cafe Tibet, as the sign reads) serves Tibetan food.  The most famous dish is the momos, which are steamed dumplings.  So we ordered the combo momo platter, along with a very light but filling barley soup, and the sha-baklap.Time Out describes them as a Tibetan version of Jamaican beef patties.  They look more like a big deep-fried dumpling.  When you cut into the crispy dough (biting into it was a bit daunting), it seems like all the juices ooze out.  Fortunately, the juices stay on the plate and soak back into the crust.The inside was a big clump of beef patty.  It was very well-seasoned (with onions, ginger, and spices) and overly juicy.  And it stayed together amazingly well.  Maybe a little too well as it was hard to break apart and I almost ate half the filling in my first bite.  Which would have been fine since it was so tasty, but I wanted to spread it out over the entire sha-baklap.  I love saying that.  Sha-baklap.The flaky dough was just a touch sweet and slightly spicy.  And it worked very well with the savory beef inside.  It was a nice combination and an interesting take on the beef patty.  And I got to try this authentic Tibetan food with barely leaving the subway.  Now that's service.-eatthisny",4.0

"I've long heard tell of the momo's hidden behind the asian bodega, by the cortelou subway stop.  they'd since acquired this grand epicurean romanticism in my mind: the undiscovered fort hamilton nepalese treat.  something to remind me of my time there 15 years ago.  a food that would bring back all the hidden memories of my childhood, to ease the pains of my youth.  it was all incredibly built up.and, instead, it was just a dumpling.  a mixed combo plate of dumplings, to be precise.  (and not even nepalese!  whoops!)they were decent -- the spicy chicken was easily my favorite.  (the vegetable dumplings were like a poor dimsum offering; the beef dumplings felt inappropriate for a non-beef eating nation.)  the dough was thicker than I would have liked, but they were also freshly made to order, and steaming hot.  (on the topic of hot, the mild sauce is hot enough.  the ""super hot"" sauce is just silly.)the hot honey ginger tea was fantastic.  looked like a pre-war cocktail.  tasted like warmth and love.",3.0

"Even thought it was completely empty at 6pm on a Tuesday evening it felt intimate and friendly. Don't judge it by it's location once you step inside its charming and tastefully decorated. We wanted to order a plate of chicken momos, the beef sha-baklap and an entree but the guy behind the counter said the sha-baklap would take 40 minutes. We ended up ordering:-Ginger Chicken: so very tasty, the chicken is in meatball form which was a bit weird at first but the flavors made up for any texture issues I had. The ginger flavor was not overpowering but definitely present. Expect peppers, string beans, spinach and bite sized chicken meatballs sitting in a tangy ginger sauce.-Pork Chilli: nice sized pieces of tender pork in a spicy sauce. The spiciness here hits just the right note as it doesn't get in the way of the flavors of the other ingredients of the dish.

"Let me tell you about thenthuk -- It's become my new comfort food. I can't seem to go two weeks without having it, especially in colder soup weather. It's a traditional Tibetan soup made with 1-inch square doughy noodles that remind me of southern-chicken-and-dumplings dumplings (the rolled kind, not the spoon-dropped kind). They put a little cottage cheese in the broth which, combined with the doughyness of the noodles, makes the broth slightly creamy. Fresh vegetables, and then they add chicken or beef if you like.

"Delicious!!!! Cozy warm restauramt squeezed between a grocery and the subway, it's a well hidden gem in Courtelyou. The food is very good, cheap, and the crew is very friendly. I'll definitely go back there.",4.0
"Such a find, a little oasis, feels like old school new york meets san francisco in the '70's.  So glad I was introduced to it.  Salmon curry (tho' had to watch for small bones) was yummy ... and the vegetarian momo excellent.  My friend had the Vegetable Thali and it was low key, simple but tasty, good portions and healthy!  Can't wait to try other dishes!",4.0
"Sha-Baklap, (tibetan beef patties), would rank right up there with foie gras, uni, buffalo wings, pizza, escargot, and great french fries as some of the greatest creations in the culinary world.  Seriously these things are that good.  Its about 30mins by subway from downtown and you dont need to walk at all.  Well worth the excursion",5.0
"The service was charming. We had the combo momos, chili chicken, and a soup. The vegetarian momos were bland. The chicken and beef were flavorful. The hot sauce, or as I call it, ""liquid samosa,"" could redeem even the insipid vegetarian momo. The chili chicken featured balls of ground chicken, which were sometimes cartilaginous. I saw no need for this and would have preferred chunks of unprocessed flesh. The sauce was tasty but insufficiently spicy and somehow lacking in character; I found myself supplementing it with liquid samosa. The soup was thick and nourishing; the base was hearty yet did not overpower the simple flavors of spinach and radish. It would be a good place to take a date who hungers for momos and hot sauce.",3.0
"I love this place, pretty much everything about it.  And the Beef Momo s are amazing.",5.0
"My girlfriend lives around the corner from this place and we eat here all the time and I'm never disappointed. It's small but we always get a table, service and food are good, but what really stands out are the low prices. I almost feel guilty, plus it's BYOB and there's a wine store right next door. Can't go wrong.",4.0
From someone who does not like Tibet food. Expect this to be a little biased. But the food was so fresh and flavorful. The flavor combinations were exquisite and 100% authentic. Definitely the best tibet restaurant ive been to. Too bad I dont like tibet food.,3.0
"The mung bean tofu-ish appetizer in chili sauce as well as the beef momo (not unlike Shanghai soup dumplings) were absolutely out of this world.  It's not a white-glove kinda place, but the service was prompt and very friendly.  The pork chili entree is fabulous as is the meat & cabbage entree (forget what it's called).  BYO.  Somehow a spicy Tempranillo worked very well, though a good crisp white is probably the safest wine bet.",5.0
"I think if you were not looking for this place, then you would probably walk-on by.  It is wedged in between the train station and a very narrow entrance way.  They have two tables outside, but I think hearing the train pass by every minute would disrupt my meal so I ate inside instead.  They have about 4 tables inside with eclectic relics from Tibet. I could really sense the Tibetan culture with the decor and the monk chanting music.    The waitress was helpful.  My bf and I started off with the beef momos and they were delicious.  The momos have a thicker skin than regular dumplings, but they were filled with savory goodness nonetheless.  They are oozing with delicious juicyness inside, but the skin helps to deflect the heat from the meat-filling.  I had the vegetable thienthuk broth soup.  The noodles were a bit different than what I was used to, and they were not consistent like long-strand noodles should be.  I would have preferred the broth to have a lot more punch in flavor, but it was quite mild.  The waitress gave us sauce to modify the level of heat intensity.  My bf had some sort of chicken dish which reminded me of eating Indian food.  It was like a sample of a small dishes with a salad, potatoes, chicken, and etc.  He told me the potatoes were cold, but the chicken was very soft.  I would definitely come back for more.  By the way, it's cash only no credit.",4.0
"tofu/ginger thing and thsam thuk (sp?) soup... and the spicy sauce... all yumservice is always great. and it's also byo for alcohol, love that (you can get beer at the adjacent bodega if you forget to bring anything).",5.0
"Admittedly, I had never eaten Tibetan food before coming here, but my life is just a little bit richer now that I have.  The momos are great -- try the combination platter with chicken, beef, and vegetables.  I've also had a spicy beef-thingy with white rice which is great.  The portions are just right -- they don't give you more than you can eat in one meal, but you won't go hungry.  And the waitstaff are very friendly and will patiently answer your many questions about this cuisine.",4.0
"Very very nice indeed.  Only went once, but it was quite a nice meal.  The momo's weren't the greatest, but very good, and the spicy condiment sauce was flavorful.  Wonderfully warm and spicy chai for about $1.50 -- all in all a nice experience.",3.0
"i've been in here a few times, it's a very cute spot and the people who work there are, in my experience, very friendly.  i don't really know much about tibetan food, and couldn't tell what most of it was, but it all looked pretty good.  last time i was there i ordered beef dumplings, which are AMAZING, and while i waited i asked for a taste of some spicy potato dish. he gave me a whole plate of it for free, and it was delicious.  great addition to the neighborhood.  they also have a full sushi menu, which is rather on the expensive side.  i haven't tried the sushi yet but i hear it's pretty decent.",4.0

"I have never been disappointed with a meal here - I've eaten in and taken out and it was all good.  Among the many dishes that have received praise here on Yelp, I would like to add the Chili Chicken, which is absolutely divine.

"This itty bitty restaurant is tucked back in an ally, barely the width of a hallway, but make sure you don't miss it. The service is friendly, the food is good and cheap. The coleslaw that comes on the side of most meals is so sweet, I crave it all the time. The mango cake and other desserts are quite tasty as well. When I went for take out, the cashier sat me a a table and brought me water while I waited, which I feel is very kind and polite of them.",5.0
"i love this place - it's amazing, and i've been coming here since it opened (actually had chai here a few times BEFORE it had even opened!  me and a friend were curious, and the owner was super friendly and invited us in!  i have the best experiences here and some annoying things get in the way of a perfect rating.  for starters, i hate when restaurants open and then keep jacking their prices up.  their portions have gotten smaller.  the last time i ordered sha baklap, the pieces were large - now they charge $2 more, and they're not as big..  (very disappointing!)  there's a new menu as of recently with lots of good sounding things i want to try, but again i was just disappointed so much by the hike in some of my favorite dishes and drinks  : (  the mango lasse, for example, has gone up by 2 bucks.  that's quite a lot! and the portions have gotten smaller..  i am not a fan of restaurants doing this.  i think that if they raise their prices, the least they could to is increase their portion size!  there's inconsistencies (again, annoying) like the side of rice is still $1.50, but the steamed tibetan bread (tingmo) is now $2 - wtf?!!  why???  it's so irritating!  i'm still going to come back and support them (i don't mean to just sit here and complain, this has just been on my mind, and i was wondering if anyone else out there feels the same way as me on this? (ripped off!!)  i also really wish they would deliver - maybe if they did, they would make enough money to not have to nickel and dime their loyal customers who have been with them from the very beginning (from before the beginning!  : ) with way too frequent price increases!  i sure hope they do xoxo  cuz i truly love this place and want it to succeed!  : )",4.0
"Only ordered delivery from here...The momo's (dumplings) were good..tried the combo one so I got to try them all. The least favorite of mine were the chicken momo. The Sha momo (minced beef) were great. Another stand out is the Sha Baklap (tibetan beef patties) which are fried dumplings filled with meat...they have this great juice locked inside of them that likes to make a mess when you eat it...try not to let it drip too much, that stuff is delicious. It is hot though, and somewhat uncomfortable if it drips onto your hand.Their fried rice is nothing special...probably a less bland than what you'd get at a random Chinese take out. Hot sauce helped it out a bit. The cafe tibet thali with lamb was good...a solid meal in one order, but careful when getting it delivered - one time the container with the lentil soup in it broke and soup was all over everything. Delivery is also kind of slow. But where else can you find Tibetan food?",4.0
"Any time I have to layer up to go out and brave the cold it reminds me of my trek in Nepal on the Annapurna Circuit. So I figured I'd head on over to this little narrow cafe (5 tables only) tucked behind a deli and jutting out over the western tracks of the Q stop on Cortelyou Road and check out the place's hearty menu. I knew I'd find the requisite momos, and was equally happy to see Tibetan tea (in all its butter and salt glory) on the Top Cafe Tibet menu, along with a number of soups. No garlic soup or dahl, though, which surprised me a bit as they were staples on the Tibetan side of the trail. The food takes a while to make it from the kitchen, but only because each item is made to order and arrives sizzling hot. For a first visit, had the spicy beef momo with hard-boiled egg appetizer and a bowl of the chicken, oats, tofu, spinach, garlic and onion soup. Both were terrific, as was the sweet chai tea. To add a perfect kick, ask for the Extra Spice hot sauce. Am looking forward to a return visit to further explore the menu, which includes several vegetarian dishes. On one table was a large thermos that reminded me of the ""hot lemon"" (boiled water with sliced lemons) my trekking partner and I used to order with every meal to warm up. Will inquire about it the next time I visit on a blistery winter day.",4.0
