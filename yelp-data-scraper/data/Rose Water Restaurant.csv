"The wait was long. Longer than they told us it would be. But, they did give us pancakes on the house, so no hard feelings here :) Food: delicious! It's a small menu so check the menu before you come here. I had the polenta and eggs, definitely a great dish. The pancakes were ok, nothing spectacular. Service: besides for the long wait the staff was friendly and helpful. 5 stars to them.",4.0
"As opposed to some other reviews when my guilt pushes me to a 2 star rating when my harsher self is saying ""2"", this is a 'strong' 3 star review.My pulled pork sandwich was excellent, but overall it seemed a bit pricey.  They didn't serve hot chocolate, and the other diners reported a mixed bag for their dishes.  One of those places that i'd probably need to try 2-3 more times to be truly sure what the right rating was, so i'll go with a 3 for now.",3.0
"I've been coming here for years-- probably since 2009 or so. It has always been pricey, but in the past it was worth the money. We had brunch recently, and the portions were out of control small. Like, brunch appetizers? Also the dishes were chock full of the cheaper ingredients, but we had to hunt to find the pricer veggies/proteins. The prices seemed a few bucks higher too.The service and ambiance are great, and the food was good. Just not worth it to leave hungry.",3.0
"We came here on a whim for dinner on a weekdays because we happened to be in the area, and this place is a true neighborhood gem. Their seasonal menu was very affordable, the food nicely displayed but unpretentious. The ambience is warm and romantic, while decor was tasteful and not over the top. Our server, Awesome S, sure lived up to his name. I got the potato leek soup, the pork belly and clam, and the blueberry bickle. My boyfriend got the chanteney carrots, grilled squid, and the fudge cake. We loved all of the dishes, especially the potato leek soup and the blueberry buckle. I would definitely come back here and recommend everyone to try this place at least once.",5.0
"Came here for late brunch on a Sunday. We were the last call before the kitchen closes for brunch. Brunch comes with one coffee/tea and an entree for less than $20. The food was okay. This is a very late post, I came here in July 2015, so I do not exactly recall what I ordered. Based on my pictures, it looks like I ordered crab cake with gravy and over easy eggs and salad with chickpeas. I recall the eggs being on point (leaky yolkkk), but the salad was really gross and spoiled. I guess because we were the last call they just give us the remaining mixed greens in the end. Please refer to picture and you will see what I am talking about.",3.0
"Came here for brunch. The first time I tried coming here, the wait was an hour. I was too hungry to wait so I went to Kiwana instead (good choice by the way). The second time I attempted to come, the wait was also an hour but I waited. I go around 11am on a Sunday so keep note. They have a pre-fixe for brunch for $17 (entree and beverage). Honestly, their brunch is overrated. Nothing jumped out at all. - Apple Buttermilk Pancake: Was okay- Challah French Toast: Too sweet; a couple bites will suffice- Some fried pork belly special: Was okayI prefer Kiwana for brunch. It's literally one block up.",3.0
"IN SHORT: A cheerful, local favorite for brunch serving organic, seasonal creations far better than the average 20-something expects on a Sunday, Rose Water is worth a trip from any of our fair boroughs.THE STORY: Before I start raving about how thoroughly surprised and impressed I was by a recent brunch at Rose Water on a warm weekend afternoon, I have to take a step back and ask a very important question: when did brunch, like, become a thing?The actual answer comes from food historians who first cite the old English monarchy's tradition of extended, multi-course meals full of meats, proteins, dairy products, and fruits all consumed in quick succession (and often followed quickly by death, but that's another story). Historians then suggest that the lazy, midday timing of the feast stemmed from the Catholic practice of fasting before Sunday mass, and then enjoying a bountiful meal after the conclusion of the service when everyone was pretty much ready to sin again.Researchers have also determined that the first use of the world ""brunch"" was in 1895 in an article in Hunter's Weekly, in which the author argued for a combination of ""breakfast"" and ""lunch"" on Sundays that would feature light fare with fruits and vegetables. Interestingly enough, the writer's original sentiment romanticizing the intent of brunch still rings true today, telling the world for the first time that ""brunch is cheerful, sociable, inciting. It is talk-compelling. It puts you in a good temper, it makes you satisfied with yourself and your fellow beings, it sweeps away the worries and cobwebs of the week."" I'm not sure what he would have to say about the DJ spinning club music at brunch today, but regardless, the social nature of this idea of eating a lot at a weird time of the day was in place.Because there is probably no harm at this point in inflating New York's culinary ego even more, many historians and food authors have suggested that the local cultures and populations of this city were also responsible for defining and popularizing the classic brunch dishes like eggs benedict and bagels and lox that litter almost every standard brunch menu. But, by the end of World War II, brunch finally became established as a social event, particularly for the many women who had just entered the workforce and were looking for a little respite with friends on Sunday, too.Like any tradition, brunch continued to be shaped by the generation reaching adulthood, and with the rise of Generation Y, the millennials, with their money, their music, their urbanity, their laziness, their flexible work hours, their intense sociability, and their grand civic visions, we got the slogan ""brunch without champagne is just a sad, late breakfast"" and the contemporary brunch scene we find today.So now that we know why brunch is a thing, we should go to Rose Water, the sunny bistro in Park Slope that serves a $17 prix fixe brunch full of spectacularly creative and palette pleasing plates.With its charming red awning and bounty of flowers shading the tables on the front patio from the bright, late afternoon sun, Rose Water is about as welcoming as restaurants come. The cozy, friendly space fills quickly on weekends with friends who just went for a run around Prospect Park, couples waking up nearby, pleased with the bistro's affordability, and even young families with baby strollers enjoying a lazy morning around the neighborhood. With its carefree, summertime atmosphere, Rose Water is already a winner, but with dishes far better than what those of us who have gotten too used to uninspired eggs benedict in the East Village expect, Rose Water wows.The peach buttermilk pancakes were simultaneously dense yet fluffy, soaked with an ethereal, barely spicy ginger butter that married perfectly with the crunchy bites of warm, nutty roasted hazelnuts. The crispy baked polenta with creamy goat cheese, poached eggs, and cooked broccoli spigarelli leaves was topped with a spicy, herbal chermoula sauce whose notes of paprika, garlic, and chili also added an incredible earthy heartiness to the dish.The ingredients used at Rose Water are so fresh and treated with such an extraordinary amount of knowledge and care that one really couldn't go wrong ordering any of the dishes. This summer's frittata featured favorites like asparagus, summer squash, mushrooms, and goat cheese, all cooked perfectly in a light, moist, eggy pancake. Because this is a brunch with a lot of that millennial-gentrified-hipster-appeal, there are cocktails like white nectarine rose sangria on the menu, but, really, no one would blame you for ordering a glass or two.Yes, Rose Water is the brunch we've been looking for after all this time. It's the restaurant at which we take our seat under the idyllic Brooklyn sun and think, ""I get it. This is what all the fuss is about. This is why brunch is a thing.""More on onehungryblonde.com",4.0
"After hearing about this spot from a friend and seeing the brunch menu, I made a point to try Rose Water for myself on my next Brooklyn adventure.My friend and I decided to be adventurous and walked 5 miles to get here. Needless to say we were a bit late for brunch and quite hungry.  The host was a hesitant to seat us since the kitchen was closing but did anyways.  In the end, I'm glad we arrived late. I walked by RW a week later around noon and there was a healthy line of people waiting to eat.On a cool fall day, the porch was gently heated and the lush flowers cultivated a greenhouse setting.  Inside is cute - but sit outside if you want the ambiance and a little more space.Though the kitchen was closing, the waitress was incredibly patient and answered our questions gracefully.  We both ordered the eggs our way, a side of applewood bacon, and the apple pancakes.  For beverages, we had the pear ginger auga fresca & concord grape sangria.  Our eggs were great but what really stood out to us were the side dishes. The applewood bacon was better than the regular bacon that came with our eggs. A bit more chewy and obviously more flavorful so it's worth it to upgrade. The pancakes were my favorite. Tart and not overly sweet.  If I were to come again, I would order a bunch of sides to split with my dining companions and skip the eggs. The agua fresca is great too for a non-alcoholic option. Those who need a little booze with their brunch will not be disappointed by the sangria.Overall, a really great experience here from product to presentation to personnel. There was also an ""incident"" which I will not describe here and to apologize, the restaurant comped us the pancakes. My friend and I were in no way bothered by the ""incident"" but thought this was a really gracious thing to do.  I highly recommend Rose Water and I'm eager to try the dinner menu.",5.0
"I went to Rose Water Restaurant this past Easter Sunday with my good friend, and it exceeded ALL expectations. Rose Water is located in Park Slope, Brooklyn & it gives off a very hippy and trendy vibe which I personally enjoyed! But what I most enjoyed about this place was the certified organic ingredients that they offered. I had the blueberry buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon butter and toasted almonds with their delicious mint lemonade. Every bite of the pancakes were magical, especially knowing the ingredients were all organic. I would definitely recommend Rose Water to anyone who enjoys brunching and if you're just as enthusiastic about organic ingredients as I am, you would appreciate everything about this place!",4.0
"3rd time here for brunch. The food is always good. Bread basket served warm with butter and jam (usually some kind of loaf, challah, and scones), perfect for share. Fried butternut squash sandwich was unique and tasty, pancakes ok, challah french toast had fresh fig, chicken sandwich was delish! Only part is that we were asked to leave once the table was cleared and a little after we paid. Understand that it's Saturday brunch but everyone is a paying customer and has a choice of where to brunch. I'll think twice next time.",3.0
"Very friendly staffers, starting from the host who accepted our name for a 'table is ready' text 20ish minutes later, to our smiley server. Entryway and really the entire space is too packed to warrant a 5, though, as every passage is tight even for us thin folks. Definitely Not a fan of the $17 'prix fixe' that includes only one course of food and forces you to get a drink, but the apple buttermilk pancakes and the three your way were definitely good, and emerged from the kitchen quickly (the three your way was still steaming). Unclear if they offer dessert during brunch, as our plates were whisked away at the same time as our check arrived, with no thank you or question whether we wanted anything else (we did).Their brunch menu is currently MIA @ rosewaterrestaurant.com/…",3.0
"This is one of the more expensive brunch places in Park Slope. They have a prix fix brunch menu, so decide ahead on what you want to order to avoid long wait times. The four of us waited around half an hour for a table. After we sat down, I decided to get up to use the bathroom, this feat was almost impossible. The little hallway where people come in is shared with the kitchen and solo bathroom. There were around 50 people moving in and around this one little hallway- this is a TINY restaurant! For $17 you get one entree, and a drink of your choice from the list. I got a fried mushroom sandwich, and two of our friends opted for the bass fish cake, and my other friend got the pork shoulder pretzel bun. The food was good, it was delicious. The price wasn't super bad also. The only thing was my fried sandwich was way too soggy. The peppers on it were really wet, like canned peppers. The ciabatta was drenched in oil. And at times tasted slightly nauseating. It kept coming apart as well. It could've been done a bit better- I guess they rushed. Another thing, the four of us sat down and ordered way before the two women next to us and they still got their food first. I guess they weren't going in order. The agua Fresca was so refreshing, I can taste it now. I also ordered a sake Bloody Mary with wasabi and sriracha- a no go. The wasabi was literally caked on the bottom. I couldn't even drink it properly- it was all sediment! They didn't mix the drink properly and it wasn't done right at all. Again, I understand that they're in a rush but any proper chef would not send out food that doesn't match its described quality. There is a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant, and I guess if you came on a non brunch day then it would be better, but I won't come again.",3.0

Our waiter was incredible - he had forgotten to place my order and despite only a 10 minute wait while he placed a new order, he insisted on comping the order. What attentive service!

"Rose Water, located in the heart of Park Slope, may just be the quintessential Brooklyn brunch spot. Sure, by standard brunch measures, it's got your endemic hipster servers, prix fixe pay structure, and a steady queue out the door every weekend, but what really makes this place the cream of the crop is its signature overgrown-garden front patio and its damn delicious localvore-minded menu, bound to satisfy both sides of the brunch personality coin, if you will.For the sweet-toothed breakfast seeker:Most weekends, this is my dominant brunch personality. And if it's yours as well, Rose Water overdelivers on big breakfast plate sweetness. Their Challah French Toast (Fresh Fruit, Cantaloupe Chutney, Creme Fraiche, Pistachios) is dessert-like in its decadence, from both a flavor and size perspective. Do not confuse a farm-fresh ingredient-driven restaurant like Rose Water for light fare - you get what you pay for here, and what you are paying for is a masterly concocted pile of carbs, fruit, and nuts.With said trio in mind, the Peach Buttermilk Pancakes (Ginger Butter, Roasted Hazelnuts) are likewise a strong call, which can also be ordered as a side if I've already sold you on the French Toast as your entree. You really can't go wrong either way.For the salt-toothed lunch craver:In general, I tend to lean on the savory side of things, and man, do I love sandwiches, but rarely do I spring for either during brunch. However, I was with a group that likes to eat in the early afternoon vs. my early bird tendencies, and by then, the window had closed on my pancake-like desires for the day. So, I went HAM on their Roasted Pork Sandwich* (Ciabatta, Cheddar, Watercress, Pickled Okra, Cucumber, Honey Mustard), which frankly included a number of individual ingredients I don't love, but somehow they all worked sandwich magic when nestled between those two halves of herbed ciabatta. The pickled okra in particular may have been a dealbreaker for me at a lesser establishment, but it somehow made sense here, adding earthiness to an already mouth-watering sandwich.I also had a few bites of my wife's Fried Green Tomato Sandwich (Focaccia, Swiss, Red Pepper, Lettuce, Onion, Basil Aioli), which I would order myself on a return visit. Though I'm not typically one to go for vegetarian sammies, this one, however, is a rare exception - like a veggie cutlet on cushion-y focaccia. Again, you really can't go wrong either way.For the sabre-toothed tiger:Just kidding. That's not a recognized brunch personality. That, and they're extinct. I digress.I mentioned Rose Water's striking green storefront. It's an idyllic brunch setting, perhaps a bit bucolic** even, if you get past the car horns and moving vans, which come with the territory. Given the restaurant doesn't take reservations, it's not a guarantee you'll be seated outside, so treat that experience as a bonus should they lead you there when your table is ready. The indoor dining room has the same country home kitchen charm and big windows that still show off their prize plants. And most importantly, still served is the same stupendous sweet and salty brunch food. I may have said this once or twice already, but... at Rose Water, no matter the options at hand, no matter your brunch personality at the time of your visit, you really can't go wrong either way.*Outdated hip-hop pun intended.**Sup, pretentious vocabulary?",5.0
"Atmosphere: a small restaurant that has a nice balance of indoor and outdoor seating. I particularly like that they keep blankets outside for outdoor autumn dining. The staff were a little slow, but nothing unusual. Food: seasonal is their thing. For 3 people, 2 light and 3 medium dishes left us perfectly satisfied with possible room to share a dessert (but we didn't). The homemade focaccia bread for the table was delicious- slightly dense yet airy with a lightly salted crust; it went well with the dipping oil. Pumpkin- a little too smokey for me. Romanesco cauliflower- good flavor and crunch, but way too oily. Baked polenta- my favorite. It almost tasted like a cheesy polenta cake. The accompanying mushrooms were cooked just right, leaving them with texture and flavor. Quail- the sauces and butternut squash made this dish special.",4.0

"Came here for dinner over the weekend with mine & my boyfriends parents. Although we were kind of a big party (7ppl) we wanted a more intimate setting for the evening & rose water was a perfect choice. They have a handful of tables out side and a handful inside as well. I didn't realize how small it was originally so I am happy we were able to get a reservation.The decor inside was minimalistic but welcoming. The waitress was great, very helpful in explaining the menu and recommending dishes. Unfortunately one of our orders was incorrect but they took an appetizer off of the menu to make up for the trouble. The presentation of every dish is absolutely beautiful. That being said, the portions are not very large & the prices are not low. This is def a place for a nicer meal, although the attire of the customers is on the more casual side. The menu here changes weekly based on what products are available so the items I am reviewing may not be available when you go. Food breakdown:-market salad: great mix of arugula, cherry tomato, snap peas & sweet corn. Very fresh, naturally sweet & refreshing-Italian peppers: great mix of flavor, served with diced peaches which were so sweet I thought it was mango at first-gazpacho: surprisingly really large portion. Soup is not too thick, it's a full liquid gazpacho so no diced veggies. Great amount of tang to it as well-polenta: I'm not a huge fan of olive tamponade but everyone else said it was good. The polenta itself was great, crispy on the outside, moist interior with a sprinkle of delicious feta-wahoo: got it seared as per chef recommendation. The fish itself is very light & cooked perfectly. My favorite part was the sweet corn mousse/purée that came with it. I could have had a whole cup of that itself-salmon crudo: salmon was served almost ceviche style, it tasted as though it was cooked in the lemon which I loved. Flavor was great, very lemony. The fish wasn't overpowering either-flank steak: got it medium well, was perfectly cooked. Very moist, lightly pink. The au jus and mushroom that came with it were also great. Blue cheese was stinky and great. Overall, def check out this place. It's delicious & beautiful. Great place for an outdoor meal",5.0
"I have been to this restaurant several times for brunch.  I must say that they truly have one of the most innovative dishes for brunch.  If you want pancakes, then you can surely get them here.  However, if you want something different, like hushpuppies on the side of your omelet or pate inside of your omelet, then this is the place to go.  Did I mention that their bread basket is to die for? No, there is no unlimited mimosa here, but who needs to gobble down subpar liquor for hour in order to forget the subpar food and to make their meal worth the money. Here, you get what you paid for, fresh and good quality ingredients that are prepared with knowledge of the ingredients.  Any schmuck can make an omelet, but one must be trained to make a delicious omelet.  The only downfall is the long wait and small space that often forces me to have strangers' children scream in my ear.  However, nothing is perfect, and this place is as perfect as it gets.",5.0

Here, you get what you paid for, fresh and good quality ingredients that are prepared with knowledge of the ingredients.  Any schmuck can make an omelet, but one must be trained to make a delicious omelet.  The only downfall is the long wait and small space that often forces me to have strangers' children scream in my ear.  However, nothing is perfect, and this place is as perfect as it gets.",5.0
"Excellent service and beautiful, warm-chic ambiance does not compensate for the shockingly bland food we had here last weekend. The food was fine. Just, fine. You'd think a vegetable goat cheese fritatta or Challah French toast with Creme Fraiche and Fresh fruit would have some oomph but it was pretty disappointing for the price and hype. I will say the smoky ketchup was the winner as well as the delicious coffee and tea. There's little to nothing on the menu for GF needs but even my 'eat anything' brunch mate was a bit disappointed.",3.0
"Rose water's brunch was hands one of the best brunches I've had in my last 2 years in the city.We came here to kick off my girlfriend's birthday. I had high expectations from the reviews below and I have to say they completely exceeded them!There was no wait to sit inside at 1:30 on a Saturday. The interior is super cute with artwork and a simple setup. They also have ample seating outside. The service was rapid, polite and friendly. The food was incredible. The challah French toast was divine with creme fresh and fruit. And the trout fish cake with poached eggs was surprisingly great. The sauce on it was really inventive and seemed to have a radish taste to it. My americano was also delicious and well made.",5.0
"What an amazing experience!! I have been trying to have brunch at this place for the past two year. Finally, today was the day that me and Rosewater collided.Right to it: Once I arrived, I had a 15 minute wait but me and my date was promptly seated. Truly within minutes of being seated, the cold water was poured and the hot coffee served. We were schooled on the brunch specials and off we were to completing our order. I had the butternut squash pancakes and my date had the three way. The food was umm umm good!! My complements to the entire staff, starting with chef!! I have to say, I want to return tonight for dinner just to experience what they can do with ""two fishes and five loaves of bread"".Rosewater may be small in size but it's humongous in creative flair across the board!!",4.0
"I'm a New Yorker who hates brunch.Blasphemy, I know.Perhaps it'd be more accurate to say that I hate the long wait times, the dumbed-down menus (some million variations of an omelette), and steep prices.With that said, there are a few brunch places that are very good, and (almost) worth the wait. Rose Water is one of them.For starters, the food is delicious across the board. I don't like that you must get a mandatory prix fixe ($16 for an entree and non-alcoholic beverage), but at least it's a great value. I ordered the trout fishcake with poached eggs, my boyfriend had the pork shoulder sandwich, and I had a bite of my friend's strawberry buttermilk pancakes. Everything impressed, but the fries (and sauce) that came with the pork shoulder sandwich were noteworthy!However, one big downside: service was painstakingly slow and the acoustics in the room made it impossible to hear our own conversation.I'll be back!",4.0
"Small, quaint place. On Saturday at 12:45 pm, our party of 4 waited about 30 minutes.The crepe was okay. My side of roasted pork shoulder was a little on the dry, stringy side.

"A brunch spot that's alright with me! Walking in Park Slope in a post holiday haze this Sunday July 5th, it felt like a brunch kind of morning. Noticing the amazing amount of reviews for Rose Water we decided to take in the menu and stretch our feet at this quaint local neighborhood staple. Getting a seat outside in the wide open air is the way to go. Sitting with a breeze to your back with flowers along-side aid in the relaxing of your holiday postpartum. I ordered the Strawberry/Blueberry Sangria, coffee (provided by Illy) and the Challa French Toast. My date had Coffee, Mimos and the Fritatta Price-wise was standard issue, with no complaints. As for the food, it was very good overall. The french toast was exceptionally cooked but a little bit too many toppings that made it overly sweet. Luckily with the bread portion being cooked so well the flavor and textures really made it a positive experience.The main complaint I would have was the frittata, too many jalapeños overpowered the flavor making the meal full of spice and less of flavor. The Sangria was amazing and I ordered a second just because of it. I would recommend that drink to everyone. Service was adequate with no shining stars. The overall atmosphere was friendly and relaxing. Overall this experience was worth a one time try, it doesn't stand out as a must go to for repeat visits, but if you're in Park Slope, give Rose Water a try and drink Sangria till your hearts content.",4.0
After wanting to visit this eatery for ages I was finally able to go today. For whatever reason I previously thought that you had to reserve a table in advance and was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is not the case.

This posed a problem for my husband who couldn't add more milk because the milk was cold and hence the net result was cold strong coffee. My husband had the pulled pork shoulder sandwich which he thought was tasty. However he didn't like the ketchup and wished that there had been a regular option in lieu if the house special. I had the fish cake with poached eggs. The egg white was not completely cooked on one of the eggs which raised a health concern for me. I also didn't like the combination of the cold greens with broccoli for this dish.The pumpkin pancakes were okay. I will have to return to see how I really feel about this place. Not fantastic but was not terrible.,4.0

All delicious, with unique approaches on the expected dishes. Service is wonderful as well, very friendly and positive, not even slightly invasive. Highly recommended for all.

"We came here for an early dinner. Rose Water is a cute, intimate space that exudes a farm-to-table ethos. We chose items off of the Winter Market, and for $26 a person ordered a small plate, main course, and dessert. We ordered the butternut squash soup, which was savory and very creamy. Roasted brussel sprouts with goat cheese were probably the most delicious thing on the table. Pumpkin Croquettes had wonderful flavors of curry and cumin, but the gooey/chewy center of the croquette made it more of a mini savory doughnut. Main plates: they were delicious. They were small. Grilled yellowfish tuna was delicious: perfectly rare and on a bed of honshimeji mushrooms that were to die for in flavor and texture. The accompanying veg puree was a bit too salty and overpowered the delicacy of tuna and mushrooms. My coworker had a baked polenta on a bed of crispy kale that she enjoyed immensely. The cornish hen at the table was small but albeit tasty. If you're ordering off of the Winter Market menu, I might recommend you order a medium or large plate to share with the table, or to order a robust appetizer.

The narrow leaves of lettuce come with apple, walnuts, and cheese, and you essentially assemble a lettuce cup for yourself.

The polenta was creamy yet structured and came with kale, which I believe was sauteed. The dish came together incredibly well and I would definitely recommend it.Pumpkin croquettes - I loved these.

I did the pre fix menu. Started with the butternut squash soup which was good. Then ate the polenta which was too die for. I just wish there was more on the plate. I ended with the chocolate cake which was a little too rich for me. Prices were reasonable especially for the quality of ingredients the kitchen uses.

"The romance is over.I've dined her quite a few times of the last few years and have had lovely experiences but must say goodbye now. The menu features ""small plates, medium plates, and large plates."" One would expect the food on them conforms to the plate size, however my dinner was a mouse sized portion lost in the middle of a large plate: 2 little strips of duck accompanied by a little puddle of parsnip and a tiny puddle of green something. The garnish, in keeping with the portion size was one piece of micro green leaf, I think it was a beet green. Too tiny to know.  This was absurd at $30.My last visit in October food was excellent, portions reasonable. I had duck then, the plate actually had food on it, enough to call an entrée, not just a hint of food on a big plate.The other disappointment was the dessert. I had looked forward to their apple cobbler again, dreamed of it, even! What was served up this time was not even a close relative. Instead of  perfect fluffy biscuits with gorgeously spiced apples topped by ice cream gently melting into it, what we got was somewhat burnt, hard and grossly over salted biscuits, and a hard hunk ice cream that had a chalky aftertaste. I guess the apples were OK, but lost in the disaster of the rest of the ingredients.Goodbye Rose Water. I'll remember the good times.",2.0

"We came here for a date night yesterday! From the reviews I've read, it looked like this place is more well known for their brunch, but we assumed that their dinner would be just as good. But...Pros:Great lighting, nice ambiance, cozy feel. I was seated in the corner and had a view of the entire (indoor) dining area. It almost felt like I was having dinner in an old friend's living room.Service: The waiters were sweet and attentive. Meatballs: Delicious. Richly seasoned, went well with the sauce.Cons: Hanger steak. Wasn't cooked very well. We didn't feel like the fava bean sauce went well with it. Polenta: I thought it could've been more flavorful... As these were our entrees, these were huge cons for us. :(We would definitely love to come back for brunch and try what people have been raving about. I don't think I'd be making a second stop here for dinner.",3.0
"I owe my girlfriend thanks for introducing me to Rose Water.  I had never heard of this charming little spot in Park Slope, but she had done some reading and told me she wanted to check it out.Rose Water catches your eye right off the bat.  From across the street you see baskets of hanging plants which act as a bit of a barrier between the restaurant and the outside world.  The front section has an outdoor seating area and then you walk into a narrow area that leads you to the dining area.  Like many buildings in the area the interior boasts brick and a metal, patterned ceiling.  It's tight in there however, with *just* enough room to maneuver between tables so be careful.  There's also only one bathroom, which winds up forming a line right by the kitchen so be careful there as well.My brunch choice was the slow cooked pork shoulder sandwich.  It comes with cheddar melted on top with a 7 grain bread.  The sandwich was absolutely amazing.  The pork was tender and flavorful, the cheese added a wonderful fatty element and the accompanying vegetables (including sliced cucumbers and cabbage) helped to keep the ingredients from being too intense.  It was one of the most perfect sandwiches I had eaten in quite some time.  Even better?  The Pimenton spiced fries included with the dish were super tasty and instead of ketchup, I was given a vindaloo style sauce to dip it in and it was heavenly (I actually had to ask for a second helping of the sauce).The service in Rose Water was great.  The waiters were fantastic and they were seriously hustling during the busy brunch time.I definitely recommend Rose Water for brunch.  Check it out some time!",4.0
"I love this place. Such wonderful food and service.Most memorable things by far were the polenta, the scallops and the rabbit.  They also have a delicious North Fork red by the glass.  The place is small but cozy, waiting for the bathroom you can see into their tiny kitchen which lacks that industrial stainless steel look, outfitted instead with wooden countertops and homey wall tiles.  Everyone  works well together there, it's like being inside a small well-oiled machine that produces impeccable little morsels of yummy food.  :)  Yet another happy place found!",5.0
"4.5 stars BUT what the hell.Rose water deserves a full 5 stars just because i enjoyed the almost everything about the food, service and the place itself.The environment here is so welcoming and cozy, on any given night id love to stay here for hours drinking wine and people watching.I was taken here by my person and it was a perfect dinner.The rose water menu changes seasonally and they offer a variety of ""small"", ""medium"" and ""large"" plates. All the plates are small in my opinion and don't range in size too much but its worth it because everything you eat here will undoubtedly delicious.We started with the fried maitake mushrooms with prosciutto and bocconcini. perfectly crisp and light with beautiful pieces of prosciutto and cheese. YUM. This really made me wanting more and I started to have great expectations for the other plates we ordered.We then shared the seared scallops, pork belly with bean salad, bacon and mustard dressing and the sautéed trenne pasta with beef Ragu, kale and parmesan.Surprisingly the biggest stand out was the trenne pasta. I don't think I've enjoyed a pasta dish this much in a long time. The pasta was crisp from the pan and the beef ragu was so tender and flavorful. I could eat this dish again and again.I know for most people this is a scandal to say but the one thing I would pass on next time would be the scallops. While they were still good, the bed of quinoa they were placed on did nothing for them and the sauce wasn't anything special. My date loved his pork belly, I just think it could have done without the bean salad.  Everything is presented so beautifully that all you instagram fiends ( including me) will quickly grab your phones to take an ""artistic"" shot before diving into your dish. I had such lovely experience here and also love that they try to get most of their ingredients from local distributers and farms. I'm so tempted to make another stop here once the menu changes again!",5.0

"Came here for dinner the other night with 3 other ladies. We were very impressed. This spot is very cute, cozy and intimate. Service was on point. Waitresses took their time and patience to answer our many questions about the food and wine.We must have had at least 5 baskets of bread. The bread here is so fresh and yummy. I did the pre fix menu. Started with the butternut squash soup which was good. Then ate the polenta which was too die for. I just wish there was more on the plate. I ended with the chocolate cake which was a little too rich for me. Prices were reasonable especially for the quality of ingredients the kitchen uses. After reading all these yelp reviews I definitely want to try their brunch. Can't wait to return!",5.0
"The romance is over.I've dined her quite a few times of the last few years and have had lovely experiences but must say goodbye now. The menu features ""small plates, medium plates, and large plates."" One would expect the food on them conforms to the plate size, however my dinner was a mouse sized portion lost in the middle of a large plate: 2 little strips of duck accompanied by a little puddle of parsnip and a tiny puddle of green something. The garnish, in keeping with the portion size was one piece of micro green leaf, I think it was a beet green. Too tiny to know.  This was absurd at $30.My last visit in October food was excellent, portions reasonable. I had duck then, the plate actually had food on it, enough to call an entrée, not just a hint of food on a big plate.The other disappointment was the dessert. I had looked forward to their apple cobbler again, dreamed of it, even! What was served up this time was not even a close relative. Instead of  perfect fluffy biscuits with gorgeously spiced apples topped by ice cream gently melting into it, what we got was somewhat burnt, hard and grossly over salted biscuits, and a hard hunk ice cream that had a chalky aftertaste. I guess the apples were OK, but lost in the disaster of the rest of the ingredients.Goodbye Rose Water. I'll remember the good times.",2.0

"We came here for a date night yesterday! From the reviews I've read, it looked like this place is more well known for their brunch, but we assumed that their dinner would be just as good. But...Pros:Great lighting, nice ambiance, cozy feel. I was seated in the corner and had a view of the entire (indoor) dining area. It almost felt like I was having dinner in an old friend's living room.Service: The waiters were sweet and attentive. Meatballs: Delicious. Richly seasoned, went well with the sauce.Cons: Hanger steak. Wasn't cooked very well. We didn't feel like the fava bean sauce went well with it. Polenta: I thought it could've been more flavorful... As these were our entrees, these were huge cons for us. :(We would definitely love to come back for brunch and try what people have been raving about. I don't think I'd be making a second stop here for dinner.",3.0
"I owe my girlfriend thanks for introducing me to Rose Water.  I had never heard of this charming little spot in Park Slope, but she had done some reading and told me she wanted to check it out.Rose Water catches your eye right off the bat.  From across the street you see baskets of hanging plants which act as a bit of a barrier between the restaurant and the outside world.  The front section has an outdoor seating area and then you walk into a narrow area that leads you to the dining area.  Like many buildings in the area the interior boasts brick and a metal, patterned ceiling.  It's tight in there however, with *just* enough room to maneuver between tables so be careful.  There's also only one bathroom, which winds up forming a line right by the kitchen so be careful there as well.My brunch choice was the slow cooked pork shoulder sandwich.  It comes with cheddar melted on top with a 7 grain bread.  The sandwich was absolutely amazing.  The pork was tender and flavorful, the cheese added a wonderful fatty element and the accompanying vegetables (including sliced cucumbers and cabbage) helped to keep the ingredients from being too intense.  It was one of the most perfect sandwiches I had eaten in quite some time.  Even better?  The Pimenton spiced fries included with the dish were super tasty and instead of ketchup, I was given a vindaloo style sauce to dip it in and it was heavenly (I actually had to ask for a second helping of the sauce).The service in Rose Water was great.  The waiters were fantastic and they were seriously hustling during the busy brunch time.I definitely recommend Rose Water for brunch.  Check it out some time!",4.0

"I really wish I could give Rosewater 5 stars... I've been wanting to try it for months and had a delicious brunch experience. But let me start off with why not 5. On our way there, we called and asked if there was a wait for two people. The host told us there was not. Three minutes later (no exaggeration) we walked in and were told there was a 15 minutes wait. When I told him we had literally just called, he sort of just stared at me blankly and said it would be 15 minutes.There were a bunch of tables open, by the way, that looked like they could seat 2, 3 or 4 people. When I pointed them out, he said they were  saving those tables in case a bigger group came. I understand the rationale, but I really hate when restaurants do that during a busy time like Sunday brunch.When we finally were seated, the host said ""Oh by the way, we're cash only today."" A little annoyed, I asked how they were allowed to just decide on the spot to be cash only. He just smiled and repeated that today, for brunch, it was cash only. Normally Rosewater is not cash only, nor are there any signs or anything written on the menu indicating that brunch is cash only. A few other people were pissed about this too, most people left when he informed them but since we had already sat, we decided to just suck it up and stay.Other than that... the food was DELICIOUS. I could have ordered anything on the brunch menu but I'm so happy I got the french toast. The waitstaff was really friendly and attentive, and did an excellent job managing the full tables and  busy brunch. The price also, $15 for entree + non-alcoholic drink, I thought was very fair considering portion size and value.",4.0
"For tight quarters and a limited Thanksgiving Menu, all 5 of us enjoyed the food and service at the last sitting of the night. The apps, an incredible fresh salad of greens, nuts, apples with a light blu cheese /oil/vinegar dressing was both wonderful and a good portion. Both pork belly apps were enjoyed. Mains were a turkey breast/ leg meat combo with the usual trimmings. Good and a healthy portion. One guest had an Artic Char that he was pleased with.Wine pairings were offered but we passed and went with a delightful Pinot Gris followed by a French Malbec, La Sugiur ??? a 2012 that went v.well with turkey. Both bottle price points and quality were quite good. Desert had 3 choices and all were simple. Choc fudge cake with Pistachio ice cream or an apple crisp with creme fraiche cant remeber exactly the 3rd but it had vanilla ice cream with a caramel sauce... my wife like it. Service was friendly and unhurried. I would recommend and it is a 10 min walk to Barclay Center thru a nice neighborhood.",4.0
"Brunch is always a mission in Park Slope, especially on or around the main avenues so this morning my boyfriend and I ventured off a little bit and took a shot with Rose Water. We arrived earlier than my usual preference (1-2pm) but did so on purpose, we wanted to avoid the usual sunday business. We were greeted by an exceptionally friendly host, and had about a ten to fifteen minute wait. The ambiance of Rose Water is so endearing that I didn't even notice the wait (the restaurant is small, but very cute and cozy)They have a standard price fixe which I thought was a great deal, under $17 for a drink and an entree, my only issue was none of the beverage options were alcoholic, in their defense the OJ was good, and the mint lemonade was refreshing on a blazing hot afternoon. (we got prosecco anyway.. i know i am not the only one to say so but they should have at least one alcoholic option, or add it with a $2 up charge, instead of making me get two drinks)  food was great. my boyfriend got the peach pancakes, with apple wood smoked bacon, GET IT.. TRUST ME!i couldn't resist a taste, would go back just to order that. the cinnamon ginger butter is to die for i wish they sold it. I got the baked polenta, as a new twist to my usual conformity, and was pleasantly surprised. Eggs were perfectly poached, the polenta wasn't gritty, and the roasted tomato vinaigrette added the perfect hits of bitterness to balance everything out.",4.0
"Lovely little brunch spot that every person in Park Slope has to try at least once.I stumbled upon this cozy restaurant after numerous walks around the neighborhood telling my friend ""We should try this place next time"", but always reverting to our safe havens.When we finally tried brunch, we were not disappointed. The outside decor catches your eye - hanging plants with bright and inviting colors. They do not accept reservations, but their table booking process works by giving the host your cell phone number and a text will arrive once the table is ready (pretty cool right?).The inside is cozy and small - a little too hot for one of the days I went.The food was very good for brunch. Brunch is only available with the prix fixe menu ($16 for a main and a non-alcoholic drink). An alcoholic drink can be purchased at your own cost but still doesn't reduce the price of the prix-fixe. I ordered the Fuji Apple Buttermilk Pancakes (with poppy seed ginger butter and cashews). It was delightful.The drinks - meh. Not the best and not the worst. Mediocre.I will be returning soon as their menu is mostly seasonal and new options will appear shortly.",4.0

The menu at Rose Water accommodated us all providing multiple options for the number of courses, size of meals served and variety of food. The food and drink were excellent. Coming from NH, my husband and I value local, farm-fresh foods. Our only disappointment was a wine recommended by the waiter that we were not as enthusiastic about as he was.  However, that clearly is a matter of taste. The staff were attentive but not hovering; respectful, warm and friendly.  The room was cosy on a rainy night.  And, when they brought out my mom's dessert with a candle, all the diners joined us to sing ""Happy Birthday."" It was a perfect evening for a very special event. I highly recommend Rose Water to you!",4.0
"Came here on a sunny Sunday morning for brunch at 11AM, minimal wait. Got a table outside which was nice as it was covered and had potted plants around. I ordered the rhubarb crepes & a blueberry bellini - yummy though I'd say the best part is the ambiance. Conducive to easy, relaxed conversation.",4.0
"We stopped in for dinner recent Sunday night, our second time at Rose Water. My partner had mackerel, I had lamb. Both arrived with a nice complement of vegetables, everything nicely prepared. My only complaint is that my food was just lukewarm, my husband's food was delivered to the table hot. What really earned our raves was the hot apple cobbler topped with their own vanilla ice cream. The perfectly cooked  apples were ladled over lovely biscuits and topped with the most perfect ice cream ever, melting dreamily into it. The truly extraordinary thing was that it was not overly sweetened as most desserts are. Even the ice cream had just a touch of sweetness.",4.0
"Atmosphere: Came here for dinner with a friend on a Sunday night.  It was about 1/4 full.  The decor is really nice.  The lighting and atmosphere make it a really nice date spot.  The waiters were attentive, pretty good on water refills.  It is also proud of supporting local produce if that's your thing.Food: There's salt on the side in a small little dish, one where you add pinches to your meal itself, which you may or may not need... because here's the thing.  I searched the word ""salt"" on yelp, and some people are saying it's overly salty, and some say it's not salty enough.  I don't know if the chefs are reading too into this and over-salting their foods in the process, but it was just overpowering -- enough to warrant taking a star off.Free bread - It comes with olive oil. I dipped my piece of bread in it and made a squeamish face.  The bread's crust tasted as if it was glazed in a salt bath.  It was very off-putting.  I'm not one to turn down bread baskets, but it was easy to say ""just one.""Pumpkin croquettes - Pretty interesting.  There were 5 pieces.  It kind of reminded me of a Thai curry puff, but with the Fall pumpkin craze to it.Grilled venison leg - The venison was cooked the way we asked for it.  The waitress suggested rare or at most medium-rare, but we went with medium.  The salt again is what bothers me.  The veggie bed it sat on was overly salty.  It really detracted from the natural venison taste -- which is where the other star is being taken off.Cold Spiced Apple Cider - Tasted like it came straight from the jug. Not impressed.Pear Ginger Agua Fresca - A bit unusual, but pretty tasty. It's pretty much water infused with pears. Very slight ginger taste. Not worth the $4. Now if they used a more concentrated infusion added to some sparkling water, I'd probably have loved it.Price: Pretty expensive during dinner.  It borders between $$ and $$$ easily, which is why we stuck with a small and a large dish.  I went home and had a slice of pizza.Would I come here again?  Probably not.",3.0
"Rose Water Restaurant is an adorable place. I visited one Sunday for brunch a few months ago and had a good experience. Food: I had a sweet breakfast crepe, smoked Applewood bacon, and a spiced pear drink (which doesn't seem to be on the menu this season). The crepe looked great - delicately sprinkled with nuts, fruit, and powdered sugar - and tasted even better. My only complaint is that the portions for each item was smaller than I expected. Service/Decor: the servers were very knowledgeable and offered everyone in my grouping recommendations based on our preferences. We also came on a chilly day and we're to be seated outside, in an extended dining area. I was unsure about this arrangement, but our table was set up with a heater and blankets! Too charming. Do visit, but be prepared for a wait if you're coming for brunch.",4.0

"Since my Memorial Day weekend plans got diverted, I decided to do brunch with a few friends. I'm glad I chose a holiday weekend to come here since the busy vibe toned down a bit. The last time I walked by on a weekend, it was jammed pack & at least an hour wait!So let's get down to the food. I ordered the smoked tuna cake. Totally not what I expected but a delightful surprise! Two poached eggs - perfectly made! The simple salad mix of quinoa & spring greens was refreshing. That slice of bread was soft & chewy with a nice crunchy crust. And that smoked tuna cake? A delicious mix of smoked tuna & chunks of poatoes formed into a thick patty patted down & fried lightly with bread crumbs. OMG, yum! And topped with a nice creamy garlic aioli. What a perfect compliment!Staff was very friendly. Atmosphere was homey. A tad cramped for big groups but great for going out with a friend or two. Loved brunch & I'd come back if I'm chilling in Brooklyn. Yum!",4.0
"This place hit all the right marks in making a fantastic brunch. Came here with a friend and there was an hour wait. Ain't too shabby for a Sunday brunch. We chat amongst ourselves and decided what to get while waiting. The instant we sat down we were ready to order and added extra drinks for a splurge. Slow Cooked Pork Sandwich: He kept commenting how great it was and how it was worth the wait. Mhm, you got that right sir!Tuna Fishcake with Poached Eggs: Amazing eggs and the fennel salad was fantastic! The tuna fishcake was good too but I didn't like the sauce too much that came with it. It was a tad overpowering and I didn't appreciate the fact that the sauce nearly covered my entire plate. I didn't want my lovely eggs swimming in the sauce!Pancakes: Hot damn they are good! We didn't think the ginger would go well with pears but whaddaya know, they are indeed a perfect pair! Loved these and they are sitting on the top of the list (among others) with one of the best stacks I've had in NYC. Can't wait to return just for the pancakes!Drinks: Rhubarb was mediocre, tasted like watered down lemonade of sorts. Hibiscus iced tea was much better and was a fine option to quench your thirst after a beastly meal. Libations we chose were probably best unordered because the drinks that came with the meal tasted far better than the liquored drinks. Rose Water, you astound me with your food and you will see me again and again and yet again. Don't ever change!",5.0

"The small brunch spot opens at 9:30 and serves a very small menu with five or six options on a prix fixe menu of $18. Don't go here expecting your basic breakfast staples. Do expect to pay a little more than you want.Vegetarian options are slim but I ordered the zucchini sandwich, which was somewhat bizarrely served with French fries instead of hash browns or home fries. It was a little heavy on the honey mustard but was reasonably delicious. I'm not a fan of the pricing, though, which is prix fixe for most of the menu and includes one drink (incl. $3 drip coffee). Tip: ordering two sides will give you a nice sized breakfast, like the yogurt and some pancakes. Overall, the pricing scheme seems like a tactic to milk you for more money, because there's no way a basic zucchini sandwich with fries is worth $18!",3.0

Pros:  Seasonal at it's best.  The chef & menu are wonderfully creative and food as well as drinks are expertly flavored.  Excellent wines.Cons:  Portion size.  Period.  It's not bad at brunch but dinner portions are just ridiculous.  Even most of the large plates don't have enough food. I just had the breast of lamb (medium plate) with the seasonal salad (another medium plate) and I'm still hungry!!!!,4.0

They have a medium sized wine list that is on the more expensive side. The cheapest bottle of wine was $52 when we went in July of 2014. But the three wines we had were great.

"Sorry, this review will be slightly biased cause I was seated outside in blazing 100-degree weather that left ass-prints on our chairs from our sweat. I went to brunch with a party of 5 on a Sunday at 1:30 and the wait was about 45 minutes. 45 minutes wasn't too bad, but the only 5 seat table they had were the one outdoors. They said they could probably rearrange some tables inside for us, but that would require some more waiting. We were hungry so when that table opened up, we stupidly said ""We'll take it!"" which was followed by 2 hours of misery and sticky clothes. First off, service was okay. The first waitress forgot to give us menus and had a minor attitude. But you know, it's hot, so it's okay. There was another waitress that was super bubbly though. We really liked her. Her job was mainly clearing tables because when we asked her something about the menu, she didn't really know. She should really get promoted! That type of attitude keeps your customers happy and your tips high (she's petite and has short dark hair). Nothing else was really noticeable. The food came quickly.Food: it's really so-so. Maybe I should've gotten the French Toast cause I love french toast and it usually makes my experiences better, but I just had french toast so I decided I should try something new. Salmon cake it is! The pictures on yelp did look delicious. Turns out, three of us got salmon cakes w/poached eggs, one got the Frittata, and the last got the slow cooked pork sandwich.The eggs were yummy. They were nice and runny and tasted good with the salmon cake and bread. It came with some kind of spicy sauce that I also enjoyed. The salmon cake itself was too much potato and too little salmon. I saw bits of it occasionally, but the taste was not very prominent. However, it did turn out to be the best entree on the table. My friend did not enjoy the frittata. It was nothing spectacular and had few ingredients. I had a bite and I, too, would pass on that. The slow cooked pork was okay. The fries that came with it were better. She thought it was bland until it reached the mustard, which is kind of sad really. Brunch comes with a drink, so we got lemonades and the hibiscus. Both were really good and refreshing for such a hot day. We also ordered a bread basket that had a bit of variety. It comes with two blueberry scones that were really amazing. Soft and chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. The other items in the basket were okay. Overall, I probably wouldn't return based on my experience. I really don't know if it's a fair decision cause I was dying outside while eating. Also I didn't get a french toast. Maybe I would've enjoyed that more.

First brunch in the slope! Had to wait about 40 minutes to get seated and service was a bit slow but the food was pretty good.

"Just an update about that amazing challah french toast - the first time I ordered this, there was only a tiny bit of syrup poured on top of my toast, no where near enough for the 4-5 huge chunks of challah! This time syrup was served in a little ramekin on the side, yay! I was also very impressed by their use of seasonal fruit. My first visit was in the fall and the French toast was served with crisp apple and pears. During my second visit in the summer, the toast featured ripe plums, cherries, and raspberries. A wonderful use of seasonal fruit.I had a 2 new brunch companions this time around and they absolutely loved this place. One ordered the plum crepes which she polished off very quickly, so it must have been excellent! The other went the lunch route with brunch and ordered one of the specials - proscuitto sandwich with a runny egg, goat cheese, and zucchini.

"Brunch review. I live on this block. So for a long time I have been walking past knots of folks waiting to get in here...why o why? Brunch is fixed at $15pp - which here means an entree and a non-alcoholic bev. (Even church gives out wine on Sundays - and that is free.)I had three my way: poached eggs (Hollandaise was not on the (brunch!) menu), bacon, beet salad, roasted potatoes and a hunk of bread. The eggs were well poached but nseasoned.  (Salt is tabled upon arrival.) The four pieces of thin sliced bacon were so unremarkable that I had no problem giving three to my date. (When was the last time you gave your bacon up?) Now I'm a man who loves beets. These were raw or maybe gently cooked - which is delicious to me. The salad meant a few sprigs of wilted, unseasoned mixed greens with an almost undetectable dressing. The roasted potatoes were also unseasoned, bland and tasted like they were made the day before and microwaved, just barely. The bread: what it lacked in flavor it made up in weight. At least one staff member couldn't tell me what the limp door stopper was. I would have upped one star had it simply been a slice of crunchy, possibly buttered, toast.My date had the challah French toast, which was served with fruit slices, ricotta and raisins. The bread itself was dry in the middle. Sure, enough syrup can cure that ailment, but c'mon. The rest of the plate was totally unremarkable.  Highlight: coffee. Delightfully good. I was enjoying my second cup in the quiet early empty hours. But then ten minutes after receiving my check I was pretty much asked to take care of it (not by my waitress, who was lovely). So much for the highlight.",2.0

We were accurate in the need as by 11am the place was full and there was a wait of people outside.We ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Cake, Fuji Apple Pancakes, and Quince Crepes. They were all tasty and delicious and came within 15 minutes of ordering.

"Just OK.  There was a wait, which was to be expected for brunch on a Sunday, however it was a mess. The host was no where to be seen so people were jumping the line and a few groups cut the line and actually sat themselves!  The host, when he was eventually found, had to actually kick people out!  The food wasn't bad, nothing special that you can't find everywhere else though, so I'd say in no way worth the wait.  Also, right after getting a second cup of coffee, we were asked to leave! We were there for less than an hour, after having to wait 40 minutes for a table!!*Won't ever be going back here again, also would never recommend it to anyone.Also want to note, really wish I would have read the reviews before hand.  After reading the owners responses to less than great reviews, I have very little respect for his establishment, he appears to know very little about customer service as all his responses to customer concerns and complaints are excuses and sometimes he even turns it back around on the customer! tisk tisk",2.0

"My fiancee and I went back with a friend of ours for brunch. We arrived at 10am on a Saturday morning to beat the rush of people. We were accurate in the need as by 11am the place was full and there was a wait of people outside.We ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Cake, Fuji Apple Pancakes, and Quince Crepes. They were all tasty and delicious and came within 15 minutes of ordering. The service was kind and frequent and left nothing to be desired.We sat in the indoor/outdoor seating area in the sun but it was sometimes cold when a draft came through the door. Luckily they had fleece blankets for us to use!",4.0
"Just OK.  There was a wait, which was to be expected for brunch on a Sunday, however it was a mess. The host was no where to be seen so people were jumping the line and a few groups cut the line and actually sat themselves!  The host, when he was eventually found, had to actually kick people out!  The food wasn't bad, nothing special that you can't find everywhere else though, so I'd say in no way worth the wait.  Also, right after getting a second cup of coffee, we were asked to leave! We were there for less than an hour, after having to wait 40 minutes for a table!!*Won't ever be going back here again, also would never recommend it to anyone.Also want to note, really wish I would have read the reviews before hand.  After reading the owners responses to less than great reviews, I have very little respect for his establishment, he appears to know very little about customer service as all his responses to customer concerns and complaints are excuses and sometimes he even turns it back around on the customer! tisk tisk",2.0
"I came here for dinner with my girlfriends on a Saturday night. There was a wait for a table but thats cos we didnt call to make reservations. The food was really good, however, small portioned. The dessert list looked super yummy. We tried two, one was the three different kinds of sorbets and the other was something with pears and both were so good! Will definitely come back for their brunch since they're more known for that!",4.0
"The most amazing brunch I have had to date. Don't underestimate this quant storefront, they are packing bold and intelligent dishes behind these doors! YUM! Satisfying portions, bounty of flavors blended beautifully regardless of what dish you order. Classic NyC flavors and style. Homey feel with an upscale twist. Well balanced earthy and new ideas. The standouts were the goat cheese and polenta poaches eggs and the challah French toast. These two dishes showed the strengths of the chef and the level of care taken in putting together each dish. Our server Gabriel was phenomenal, he made us feel welcome, at home, not rushed and was happy to go over everything with us. He really made our meal!! We will definitely be back, thank you guys!!",5.0

We both ordered the specials of the day -- duck confit with hash for me, and he had some sort of triangular pasta with pesto and eggs. We also ordered a side of honeycrisp apple pancakes.They don't tell you this, but note: specials are $17, not $15 for the prix-fixe.

"Great Food, Horrible Service.I came here over the weekend and was greeted by this hostess who just had an air of self-entitlement about her.  It felt like we were being treated as worthless peasants and that it was a privilege that this restaurant would grace us with it's food and service.We arrived as a party of three and our fourth member volunteered to find a parking space while we waited.  My mother was one of the members of the party, she happens to have arthritis and if she can sit, she would be more comfortable.  We asked the hostess if we could be seated as our fourth member will arrive shortly.  She promptly and rudely said ""No"" without any explanation.  I then tried again a few minutes later and just mentioned that our fourth member will be here shortly, and she said that we're welcome to be seated as a party of 3 but our fourth member would have to sit at a different table... even if we're seated at a table of 4 with only 3 people.  It made absolutely no sense and she just came across as going way of her way to be rude for no reason.We finally got seated and thanked god we didn't have to deal with the rude hostess anymore.  A waiter came around and started taking our orders.  One member of our party simply wanted yogurt and granola.  Our waiter practically gasped and explained to us that brunch is a prix-fixe menu and that she HAS TO order items that are either on that pre-fixe menu or order enough sides so that it equals over $15.  I've honestly never heard of a restaurant that won't just give you what you order when it's on the menu.  It was completely ridiculous.Okay we've overcome some awful service milestones and our food actually showed up without any other issues.  I ordered the nectarine pancakes and a side of a bacon and it was actually fantastic.  Maybe the best bacon I've ever had and the pancakes were just enough nectarines to add flavor without going overboard on the fruit which many places tend to do with waffles or pancakes.So to sum it up - if you're prepared to be treated like pond scum in exchange for a really good meal - Rose Water is the place to go.",2.0

"Came to brunch here with Hubby and was overall very happy, though there were a couple of things I think they could work on to make this place perfect. I would have given this place 4.5 stars, but since Yelp doesn't have that option, there were just a few things that kept me from rounding up. Hubby got the fried egg sandwich special which he loved. The fried egg was runny and came on a crunchy baguette with heirloom tomatoes, gruyere cheese, bacon, and arugula. His plate was literally heaped with food--pickled green beans, fries, green salad, and a few gherkins finished it off, and it all was delish. Which made the polenta with poached eggs look skippy by comparison--not that it was a tiny bit of food, but it's something to think about when coming up with food specials. The polenta was creamy in the middle and had a lovely caramelized crispy bottom and sat on a bed of sautéed kale. Eggs were perfectly cooked.  Now, the few things that could have been better...the coffee was extremely bitter--to the point of being undrinkable. We also got our food and then no one checked on us until we were finished. Hubby wanted ketchup for his fries and went without because he could not get the waiter's attention. It was also freezing in there! It was the first truly chilly day of fall and they had the AC blasting, door open, ceiling fans on, and I was sitting right behind a floor fan. If it was 95 degrees out, I get it, but it's 66 degrees outside. Use some common sense. Your customers are all sitting inside with jackets on. Overall, we enjoyed the food and will put it into the brunch rotation, but hope that those few hiccups are better the next time around.",4.0

"I wanted to like this place... I really did! My experience wasn't awful (hence the 3 stars = A-OK), but it certainly wasn't a wow factor either. Highlights: Even though we were told there would be a 25 minute wait (which is not uncommon) we were seated within 10 minutes. The waitress was super friendly and they kept re-filling the coffee -- which is fantastic considering I can never get enough coffee. The atmosphere is super cozy. Its a small place, but I never felt over crowded or anything. Once we ordered, our food came super quick! Non-Highlights: - I was super excited to try their Bloody Mary (they use wasabi, mmmmm), but was really disappointed when it came. The flavor was right on target (seriously, its so hard to get the perfect bloody mary just right), but it was gritty. Yup, gritty... like little tiny pieces of ingredients floating around making me feel like I'm eating my drink. We asked the waitress if it was supposed to taste like that and apparently its just the way they make it. If they had just run the drink through a strainer, it would have been perfect. We asked for the blood orange sangria instead which was pretty tasty, but it didn't quite hit the spot like a Bloody Mary would have.  - I ordered the Pork shoulder sandwich which came with fries and homemade ketchup. The ketchup & fries were REALLY tasty, but the Pork was dry and burnt. I kept thinking it was just that one bite, but nope... almost the whole freaking thing was burnt. *I will say, my friend got the tuna cake and loved it -- I didn't try it, but she's quite the picky eater so maybe it was just my unlucky day.

I had a few sips of the sangria, it was good and the peach flavor didn't make it overwhelmingly sweet. The peach agua fresca definitely outshone it though. I had an espresso and was pleasantly surprised by the taste, as I'm pretty picky. My friends had the fried eggplant sandwich and roasted chicken sandwich, and both got their seal of approval. The portions for both were good and the fries/ketchup they were given were tasty and a great amount of spicy.I had the french toast (because there is NOTHING wrong with having french toast at 2:30 in the afternoon) and initially I was really disappointed with the portion size. Am I the only one who thinks of big, thick slices of Challah when a menu touts ""Challah French Toast""? Anyway, compared to the sandwich plates mine just looked dismally small.

I wouldn't normally get chicken liver as an entree, but OH EM GEE, it was so delicious. It was cooked perfectly, not dry but flavorful and juicy.

I wouldn't normally get chicken liver as an entree, but OH EM GEE, it was so delicious. It was cooked perfectly, not dry but flavorful and juicy. It was topped with a pesto-type sauce and tons of garlic. Once I cut off a piece, swirled it into the runny yolk I broke, and took a bite, I thought I was in heaven. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",4.0
The long wait is worth the amazing food- so fresh- such inventive ingredients! All organic. All the time. Brunch is worth the wait!,5.0
"I don't get the hype about this place. First of all, they told us it would be 20 minutes to get a table for brunch and it ended up being 50. And fundamentally, the food was not worth the wait. I got the roast chicken sandwich, which was smothered in mayonnaise, in an effort to mask the dryness of the chicken. The fries were good though.",2.0
"Oh Rose Water, how much do I love thee? Let me count the ways.First, your amazingly friendly, adorable, and nice staff. Always perfect service, every. single. time. Whoever manages this places needs to manage every restaurant in NYC. Second, your very delicious and affordable seasonal market menus. Arctic char, roasted chicken, and crispy polenta, oh my. Everything is splendid. $28 per person for all this is loco.Third, your incredibly cozy ambiance. Perfect for a date, girl talk, reunion, whatever.Fourth, your awesome brunch! $14 per person for food prepared with love you can literally taste? Every weekend, please. This place is holy crap good. Go there now. Your tummy will thank you.",5.0

"Really good, not stellar. 3.5 Stars. Rose Water was an entirely arbitrary selection. A friend enlightened me on Dine-In-Brooklyn Restaurant Week, and when I saw the name of this restaurant on the list of participating places, I wanted in. Coming in from downtown Manhattan on the 2/3 lines to Grand Army Plaza was a tad tricky. Brooklyn isn't really known for ease of navigation, so needless to say I pulled a Magellan and had to circumnavigate my way until I finally got to Rose Water. This getting lost part was actually a really nice treat. Walking through Park Slope was enormously satisfying especially on a nice day like today (weather in the mid-60s)! Walking alongside all the brownstones really infused a sense of relaxation to a long and hard day. If you prefer a shorter commute, your best bet is the R train (FYI). This place is really sweet and quaint, there are many charms about Rose Water to take heed of and appreciate. First, they have a pseudo-outside-patio. It was cordoned off, so it wasn't actually outside, but you were still essentially sitting on the sidewalk, just enclosed within a tent-like structure. The light oak wood and apparent throws perched atop each chair gave it a homey / country cabin feeling. The potted plants confirmed this ambiance. You get a completely different vibe however, when you enter the main dining room. In here, the mood is more contemporary, kinda hipster chic, with a very low-lit, intimate atmosphere. This would probably be nicer for a dinner date. That being said, the best friend and I decided to eat out in the patio. I wanted to people watch and catch a slight breeze by being ""outside"". Killing two birds with one stone, efficient. I can't help myself. So our waitress was super friendly. She introduced me to RW's amazing ""Hibiscus Iced Tea"" which was refreshing and just a touch sweet. We ordered from the DIB menu (pre-fixe, $25) and had a pretty fab meal. Devoured items included fried goat cheese served with a few slices of tangerines and prosciutto (gorgeous plating, and surprisingly light and airy texture and taste), frisee and apple salad, Roasted chicken, and seared Fluke (done nicely with a little bit of char and ample seasoning). Dessert was the salted chocolate cake and the Buttermilk lemon panna cotta (loved the sweet pistachio topping). Though I had a truly positive experience overall (they even have a really nice bathroom, with a vase full of fresh cut roses), I don't believe I had anything here that stood out and would have me coming back for more. Locals, I can assure will deem Rose Water a stomping ground, and perhaps if I were a Brooklynite, or a resident of Park Slope, I'd frequent often as well. But I can't foresee myself taking the trek for a meal that was short of being exceptional. This is definitely though, a very solid place with great service, lovely ambiance and good food.",3.0
"I have to remember this place. If Rose Water is known for brunch and my dinner here was this amazing, I can't wait to come back on a weekend morning!The setting is cute and casual, which makes the sophisticated food stand out even more. I ordered the yellowfin tuna, which now looks like it is a swordfish dish made the same way. Or maybe it was swordfish all along and I forgot (it has been a while!). Either way, I remember being blown away by the two very different and beautifully complementary sauces. The first sauce, a beet-horseradish sauce, knocked my socks off. The second, a lovely basil aioli, made me feel all warm inside. While the menu is not huge, I imagine most people can find something they will like. The fresh herbed focaccia was wonderful, and they kept it coming after we housed our first basket. It seemed like they should have charged for the bread since it was so great, but they didn't.The service was straightforward and friendly. There was some casual conversation, and lots of efficiency.I would come back here and get the same thing again, but there are so many more dishes I want to try: polenta, fluke, and the salads too.",5.0

I've been to Rose Water quite a few times over the years and was just there last night. Years ago they were always fully reserved. The question is why most tables have no diners on a Sunday night in a wealthy neighborhood. The idea of serving appetizers, medium sized entrees and larger entrees is clever. I had the duck confit, a medium choice, and it was just the right amount of food for me. My companion had venison, a large dish, which I would say, given I do not like game, was very well prepared. The guy who writes that these recipes are too salty, and that other things are too salty, is not correct. The bread is excellent as has been pointed out. Service is excellent. Prices for food are reasonable: not too expensive and affordable. HOWEVER. The wine list is totally absurd. If a restaurant is going to charge $18 for an entree, the wine list can not range from $50 to $85 per bottle. This is not Eleven Madison Park. They could offer wines in the $25 to $35 range that frankly would be just as good. This is a serious problem, and it means in my view that because they aren't filling up the tables with diners they're trying to bring in money by overcharging on wine. The result is empty tables, because the wine list is ridiculous as compared with the menu. My advice is certainly to dine there, but drink tap water and don't have any wine. You'll have excellent food and you can have some wine later you've bought on your own - and you know you can buy an excellent wine for between $12 and $15 at a quality wine shop.If you doubt that, take a look at the Sherry Lehmann online store.",2.0

Everyone had a different entree but the salmon I had was the best ever! We passed around 3-4 of the desserts and every one of them were different but so yummy! Come hungry and try as much as you can!

"I definitely am a fan!We came for brunch on a lovely Saturday morning and waited an hour, but unlike some other brunch experiences that end up a disaster, this one was well worth the wait.  We were hungry, so we sampled the pita bread and dips, as well as fruit and yogurt.  We then had the turnip soup and yummy poached eggs.  Everything was spectacular, and the sweet stuff landing at the tables next to us looked equally delectable, but we were, helas, full.Tonight we tried the dinner, and sat down outside for an early 6 pm meal.  We opted for the $26 market menu and it was simply fantastic.  We started with asparagus soup and the fennel and apple salad.  The fennel and apple won, with the asparagus lacking flavor and being too creamy.  For mains we had the goat cheese polenta and the mackerel.  The mackerel cooked rare actually detracted significantly from its fishiness, and surrounded by freshly sauteed and perfectly salted veggies, was a perfect dish.  For dessert we tried both the chocolate pot au creme and the rhubarb cake.  I loved this meal beginning to end, and even their bread is perfect.  The hostess speaking immaculate French rounded out the experience and we will definitely be back!",4.0
"So delicious!  Even the bread and infused olive oil was incredible.I started with the fried goat cheese.  Mouth watering.  For an entree I had the hanger steak.  So good.  My boyfriend had the tuna, equally delish.All around amazing.  Definitely check it out.",4.0
"After two years where this has pretty much been my local, I am sadly downgrading Rosewater. I am not a brunch person, it may still be good - this is for dinner. The sweet staff that was there about a year ago seems to have been replaced with a less friendly bunch who do things like pour water and then walk away without taking a drink order. The vibe is just DIFFERENT and not as friendly and welcoming as it once was. The food is also slipping a bit. Had chicken with one of the purees on the plate was cold; the chicken which used to be gold standard is now just whatever (not as tender, flavorful and special as it once was). Something has changed and not for the better.

"What a lovely spot to brunch.I was taken to Rose Water by my bff M.O., who lives up the street. There was a 30 minute wait around noon on a Saturday, so we put our names in and went to find some iced coffee. Great trick if you can't decide between coffee/fresh juice in your prix fixe meal! Getting coffee beforehand let me choose a lovely strawberry rhubarb concoction to drink with my breakfast.We shared two items. One savory, one sweet.The goat cheese crepe with pine nut brickle, fresh fruit and rhubarb compote was perfect. I could eat this all day, everyday. It was not too rich at all- fresh and light. The latke special was tasty at first, but ultimately the toppings were too heavy. There were mushrooms, broccoli rabe, poached eggs and a thick smoky spicy sauce that drenched it all. I'm anti-smokiness, so maybe that's why the dish didn't do it for me. I couldn't even taste the potato, let alone tell there was a latke underneath all the mess. Next time I'll stick to sweet over savory at Rose Water.",4.0

"Rose Water seems to be better known for brunch, but we went for dinner. It was crowded, but we were seated quickly because we were willing to sit outside.

The service was attentive and the wait staff was good about checking on ingredients (gluten free, paleo, etc.).I was pretty hungry and very disappointed when my dish (the striped bass) came with only a tiny bit of greens tucked under the fish. The portions aren't universally skimpy - my friend got the short ribs and the quantity of food was easily double. He was happily noshing on his food long after I'd finished mine. In retrospect, maybe I should have ordered a side to supplement my meal, but I'm annoyed that it was necessary.",3.0
"Finaly got back here for the tasting menu and loved it. It takes a little over two hours but is a very nice sample of the menu.

"After a stop in a different part of Brooklyn, a friend suggested Rose Water for Saturday Brunch.  It was a little bit of a walk to Park Slope, but well worth it.The place is very small, couldn't seat more than 40-45 people, and there was a line.  No surprise here.  Once we were seated, we were in the outdoors area that was covered over with a canopy, heat lamps and a blanket on each chair.  The food here is all organic and locally sourced, so you know where your food is coming from.  For brunch, they offer a nice $14 deal of a drink (non-alcoholic) and an entree for $14.  Great deal, as places in Manhattan charge more than $14 for one thing.I opted for the cold spiced cider to drink.  It was muggy and full of flavor.  Just take the average store cider, add more apple goodness, cloves and cinnamon and you have this drink.  For entree i picked the Roasted Pork Sandwich with cheddar cheese, apple, pickled cabbage on a brioche bun.  The pork was tender and pork plus apples means delicious, so you know they got that combo spot on.  The bread was fresh and it was served with fries of course, pimenton spiced fries to be exact. My wife ordered the pear ginger juice, which i didn't care for, but she enjoyed and the baked polenta cake with goat cheese, brussels sprouts, poached eggs, toast and Moroccan spice sauce.  This dish was even better than mine, as the polenta cake was crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside.  The brussels sprouts were gone in a flash and amazing.I would highly highly recommend this place, but it clearly is already extremely popular, so...

"Was at the Brooklyn Public Library and in need of some wine so I Yelped ""white sangria"" and this was what came up as being close by. There is no white sangria here, sadly, There is however a very impressive wine list that was mostly by the bottle so alas, no wine for me. I am a youngish looking black woman who eats out alone often and you'd be surprised at how many times you get less than stellar service because of this. Not so here! Super sweet waitresses and servers, water glass stayed full! I can't abide by my water glass being empty.  And most of all really delicious (and affordable).I did the Winter Market Menu for $26. Had the small plate marinated anchovy bruschetta, medium plate roasted half Cornish hen, and chocolate bread pudding. I wish I had a better grasp of the appropriate foodie words to describe how much I liked nearly everything but all I can say is that it was really damn good. Plus I love love love any place that offers homemade bread with infused olive oil. So simple, so right. Also received a complimentary tasting of a kale whole bean soup that was so very delicious. It was so rich tasting but very light at the same time.Two things that were less than stellar; Pear Ginger Juice. Not bad just meh and not enough ginger for it to be really fun. And the chocolate bread pudding was actual chocolate bread made into a traditional bread pudding. Again, neither good nor bad just weird and I wouldn't order it again.I also liked the bathroom just because they have those really good quality durable disposable napkins to dry your hands off. This place is smallish but it doesn't feel cramped at all. The lighting and decorating are pretty perfect. It wasn't super loud, and at 7PM on a Monday evening there were plenty of tables. I expect this would be a great first date spot.",4.0

"Rosewater has the charming decor, the fine ingredients, the helpful waitstaff, and cozy ambience to be a crown jewel, among lesser gems in Park Slope. Problem is, the price of the menu already reflects this attitude while the execution of the dishes and what's on the plate does not. On a Thursday night, my gf and I stopped in for a dinner. We each had just an entree.  My girlfriend had the polenta while I had the slow-roasted lamb. The polenta cake is better than the lamb. Everything on that plate works together and is delicious. Its worth four stars here on Yelp. The only criticism is that it's a tad over-priced. The lamb dish was incredibly disappointing. When I think of slow-roasted lamb, I think juicy and tender. The lamb itself was flavorful but it was cut in deli-thin slices, as if roast beef and was about as juicy as leftovers that had been in a fridge for a day. I was mystified that $28 at Rosewater got me the exotic experience of deli-cut, ""whatever"" lamb. There was a sauce but one too few drizzles. I was really looking forward to this and expected much better. Oh the bread before our meal was superb, so there's that.",2.0
"I don't really understand the draw for Rose Water.  Let me preface this by saying that I've never been there for brunch--which seems to be its main draw--but I have been there for dinner.  The menu, while seasonal and farm-to-table and all that shit, is far too limited, the portions are way too small, and the prices are way too high.  There are so many great restaurants in Park Slope.  You can skip this one.",2.0
"This is still one of my favorite brunch spots in all of NYC even though the last few times I went the food was slightly less astonishing as compared to say 2-3 years ago. The wait here is usually a good 20-40 minutes and the hostesses are a bit snobby as other commenters have pointed out. However, I do feel as though the food is worth the wait. This restaurant uses the freshest ingredients which thus require less seasoning. The flavors of nearly every dish are layered and rich. The coffee is always great, as are the sake bloody marys. My favorite brunch item is the smoked fish cake. The baked polenta is a close second and my friends who like the sweet stuff rave about the french toast. I still have not dined here for dinner but am looking forward to doing so after hearing about the $27 special!",4.0
Sunday brunch here is the best!! I love coming when the weather is warm and try to secure an outdoor spot. The price is prix fixe and reasonable for the amount of food you get. They serve seasonal food so I've had the pleasure of trying something different every time!Definitely need to get there early or be prepared to wait. If its cold out..the wait can be quite brutal.,4.0
"Quaint place in the Slope! The boyfriend and I stopped by here about a month ago, celebrating our anniversary. We were attracted to the flower decorations and how the outside area looked, keep in mind this was back in August. It's great for summer evenings and days, I am sure. The food was moderately priced for the great quality that was served. Entrees from 18 to 28, not bad. I believe they have their vegetables according to season and their menu surely changes a few times a year, depending on what is in harvest and what not. We shared fried goat cheese to start out with. The bf got the roasted chicken, he highly recommends this. I went on with a veggie entrée. The food was tasty, well seasoned, and you felt like the cook had still put some heart into the matter instead of mass producing it. We found it was a good night to go with the Rosé, and voila, it was an excellent choice!The service was great. I will gladly try out their brunch on occasion!",5.0
"We arrived at 1pm so anticipated the hr long wait but it really was worth. We started with the bread as I read so many reviews not to miss them (we all enjoyed the different selection offered to us.I got the baked polenta which was amazing, the eggs where cooked to perfection.Others on the table got the chicken sandwhich and the pork sandwhich both where hits.I will definirely be visiting here again (maybe next time a little earlier).",4.0

Some of the best blueberry, lemonish, pancakes I've ever had and again I'm not a huge pancake person.  They were so flight and fluffy and huge and truly fantastic.  Great place and can't wait to go back.  I never write on yelp but I loved my meal so much that I just had to post!",5.0
"Was at the Brooklyn Public Library and in need of some wine so I Yelped ""white sangria"" and this was what came up as being close by. There is no white sangria here, sadly, There is however a very impressive wine list that was mostly by the bottle so alas, no wine for me. I am a youngish looking black woman who eats out alone often and you'd be surprised at how many times you get less than stellar service because of this. Not so here! Super sweet waitresses and servers, water glass stayed full! I can't abide by my water glass being empty.  And most of all really delicious (and affordable).I did the Winter Market Menu for $26. Had the small plate marinated anchovy bruschetta, medium plate roasted half Cornish hen, and chocolate bread pudding. I wish I had a better grasp of the appropriate foodie words to describe how much I liked nearly everything but all I can say is that it was really damn good. Plus I love love love any place that offers homemade bread with infused olive oil. So simple, so right. Also received a complimentary tasting of a kale whole bean soup that was so very delicious. It was so rich tasting but very light at the same time.Two things that were less than stellar; Pear Ginger Juice. Not bad just meh and not enough ginger for it to be really fun. And the chocolate bread pudding was actual chocolate bread made into a traditional bread pudding. Again, neither good nor bad just weird and I wouldn't order it again.I also liked the bathroom just because they have those really good quality durable disposable napkins to dry your hands off. This place is smallish but it doesn't feel cramped at all. The lighting and decorating are pretty perfect. It wasn't super loud, and at 7PM on a Monday evening there were plenty of tables. I expect this would be a great first date spot.",4.0
"Consistently excellent. Just a gem of a spot: lovingly decorated, perfectly composed and delicious plates of food. Wish they served cocktails, but wine will have to do",5.0
"Rosewater has the charming decor, the fine ingredients, the helpful waitstaff, and cozy ambience to be a crown jewel, among lesser gems in Park Slope. Problem is, the price of the menu already reflects this attitude while the execution of the dishes and what's on the plate does not. On a Thursday night, my gf and I stopped in for a dinner. We each had just an entree.  My girlfriend had the polenta while I had the slow-roasted lamb. The polenta cake is better than the lamb. Everything on that plate works together and is delicious. Its worth four stars here on Yelp. The only criticism is that it's a tad over-priced. The lamb dish was incredibly disappointing. When I think of slow-roasted lamb, I think juicy and tender. The lamb itself was flavorful but it was cut in deli-thin slices, as if roast beef and was about as juicy as leftovers that had been in a fridge for a day. I was mystified that $28 at Rosewater got me the exotic experience of deli-cut, ""whatever"" lamb. There was a sauce but one too few drizzles. I was really looking forward to this and expected much better. Oh the bread before our meal was superb, so there's that.",2.0
"I don't really understand the draw for Rose Water.  Let me preface this by saying that I've never been there for brunch--which seems to be its main draw--but I have been there for dinner.  The menu, while seasonal and farm-to-table and all that shit, is far too limited, the portions are way too small, and the prices are way too high.  There are so many great restaurants in Park Slope.  You can skip this one.",2.0
"This is still one of my favorite brunch spots in all of NYC even though the last few times I went the food was slightly less astonishing as compared to say 2-3 years ago. The wait here is usually a good 20-40 minutes and the hostesses are a bit snobby as other commenters have pointed out. However, I do feel as though the food is worth the wait. This restaurant uses the freshest ingredients which thus require less seasoning. The flavors of nearly every dish are layered and rich. The coffee is always great, as are the sake bloody marys. My favorite brunch item is the smoked fish cake. The baked polenta is a close second and my friends who like the sweet stuff rave about the french toast. I still have not dined here for dinner but am looking forward to doing so after hearing about the $27 special!",4.0
Sunday brunch here is the best!! I love coming when the weather is warm and try to secure an outdoor spot. The price is prix fixe and reasonable for the amount of food you get. They serve seasonal food so I've had the pleasure of trying something different every time!Definitely need to get there early or be prepared to wait. If its cold out..the wait can be quite brutal.,4.0
"Quaint place in the Slope! The boyfriend and I stopped by here about a month ago, celebrating our anniversary. We were attracted to the flower decorations and how the outside area looked, keep in mind this was back in August. It's great for summer evenings and days, I am sure. The food was moderately priced for the great quality that was served. Entrees from 18 to 28, not bad. I believe they have their vegetables according to season and their menu surely changes a few times a year, depending on what is in harvest and what not. We shared fried goat cheese to start out with. The bf got the roasted chicken, he highly recommends this. I went on with a veggie entrée. The food was tasty, well seasoned, and you felt like the cook had still put some heart into the matter instead of mass producing it. We found it was a good night to go with the Rosé, and voila, it was an excellent choice!The service was great. I will gladly try out their brunch on occasion!",5.0
"We arrived at 1pm so anticipated the hr long wait but it really was worth. We started with the bread as I read so many reviews not to miss them (we all enjoyed the different selection offered to us.I got the baked polenta which was amazing, the eggs where cooked to perfection.Others on the table got the chicken sandwhich and the pork sandwhich both where hits.I will definirely be visiting here again (maybe next time a little earlier).",4.0

I was looking for a brunch place near my house so I read the comments on yelp for Rose Water and decided to check it out. It was fantastic! we probably waited 30 minutes for a table outside and it was well worth it. The service was great and the food was delicious. I haven't been brunching in a while so the food was pleasantly good on the palate. I would probably go back soon and try their pancakes.,4.0
"Incredible.My friend and I came here as I've been longing to eat here for a while and we were seated immediately outside sans reservation. They have the fluffiest, softest bread to start. I got the grilled pork chop and he, the smoked quail. My pork was cooked to order, perfect temperature, wonderful glaze and so juicy. The root vegetables could've been a bit softer but that was honestly not a big deal. My friend's quail was so delicious - just the right amount of smoky flavor. Honestly I was wowed. The ambiance is low-key, the service prompt, and the ingredients (obviously) beautiful AND local! They also offer market prix fixe for dinner - 3 course for $27 Mon-Thurs! Will be returning asap.",5.0
"One of my favorite places in Park Slope. Brunch is a must! Delicious pre fixe for $15! It has never let me down. Be prepared for a wait though. Their space is on the small side and most of their tables are for 2. Dinner can be a bit steep but if you go during the week they offer a $30 three course meal (app, entree, dessert) that is so worth it, and you won't get the brunch crowds.",5.0

"The food here was amazing, but the service the first time I came here was horrendous.First, the service: The staff acted as though we were just lucky to be there but weren't especially excited that we were. It took us about 15 minutes to get our coffee, then didn't get it refilled until about another 10 minutes after it was empty. BUT, the FOOD was so amazing, my mom and I did end up feeling pretty lucky to be eating here. We were there for brunch, and I can't remember what my mom got because I was so taken by my dish--the baked polenta: a polenta cake with goat cheese and what tasted like a chipotle topping, a poached egg, kale, zucchini, and some amazing bread. I quickly became full and was so sad because I wanted to finish every last drop of this dish- that's how amazing it was. The one thing I remember about my mom's meal was an awesome piece of cornbread with whole pieces of corn in it--a little sweet, a little salty, and totally amazing. I think I ate the whole piece. Edit: Service has been better in later trips and food has been just as good. Highly recommended and a mainstay of mine.",4.0
"Very nice place, good and quality food, friendly and helpful servers. We went there for a Sunday brunch. It was pretty crowded inside but we didn't have to wait long time.

"The Good: Cute little restaurant on the corner of Union Street. They have outdoor seating but it was way-y too hot this weekend for anybody to be dining outdoors.

There was a good flavor to the sandwiches and the fries accompanying them were well seasoned.  The Bad: I ordered the roasted pork sandwich and my friends had the special sandwich of the day (roast beef on baguette). Sandwiches were so... OILY. The bottom of my focaccia was soaked with oil. Eventually, I had to take apart my sandwich and eat only the pork.

"Rose Water was super cute and I want to like it so much more than I actually do.  I went to Park Slope (my first visit, if you can believe it) to have Saturday brunch with some friends.  The neighborhood is so incredibly fantastic and I actually can't wait to go back...or maybe move there.  Being a Saturday around 12:30pm, I expected a wait, and we did wait somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes.  It was really cold outside, but they did have some chairs and  bench to sit on, and there was a teeny tiny space inside by the hostess stand that we moved to once the cold was just too unbearable.  Rose Water is very small, with some natural design charm (an arched brick wall and very high ceilings adds a lot to the feel of the place).  The decor is mixed with some mismatched lighting, fake flowers and cool handmade tiles on the walls.  And the staff is very friendly, though clearly overworked on the weekends.  There is a $14 prix fixe brunch menu that has a few normal breakfast options (including the Three Eggs Any Way which I ordered and were so-so, and a French Toast I should have ordered that looked amazing), three sandwich options and a few a la carte side dishes like Scones and Roasted Garlic Potatoes.  The brunch price includes a beverage, but not one that is alcoholic, which is a little disappointing.  But if you order tea, you get an entire little pot for yourself with about three cups in it.  I'd like to give Rose Water a second chance, but perhaps an evening meal (could be really cute for a date or a girls' dinner) or an earlier brunch right when they open on Saturday or Sunday.",3.0
"Superb prix fixe, Sunday-Thursday dinner. Just delish and an amazing price of $29 or $30 for a large salad or soup, a great-sized main course and -- new on the menu, the waiter told us -- a chocolate bread pudding made of cake! Perfect spot for meeting a gal pal after-work or having a mid-week couples evening out. Really special food, and the quiet, high-ceilinged but low-profile interior makes for a delightful ambience. A wonderful ""come out from the cold"" feeling is created here, and the team really wants to please! The only demerit, as others note, is that service can be a bit spotty.

"Ok, Rose Water.  This fairly low rating has nothing to do with your food which is on the whole delicious and nice and all.  I had dinner there one night and it was a lovely low key experience -- the lady server even joked with us a bit.  But on other occasions...I show up with four friends for dinner one evening without a reservation.  The ""hostess"" (which is a term usually reserved for someone who makes you feel welcome) told us that there was a four top that we could have had if we hadn't had one extra person.  Basically like showing a child a puppy that he could have had if he didn't have two legs.  She then looked at one of my friends and asked her is she was ""the fifth wheel.""  Yikes.Then let me paint you a picture of brunch.  Three of us sit down for a Saturday morning ritual when a scene full of comic richness unfolds.  First the waiter gives a long and complicated description of several of the day's specials.  My friend selects one of them and the waiter gets a pained expression on his face and admits that they were currently out of that item.  Why did he tell us about it then?  Insert child and puppy analogy again.  My friend then selects another item.  The waiter returns shortly to inform us that they are out of that as well...  and they don't serve previously requested soy milk... and when we asked for coffee refills, my by now downtrodden friend asked for a regular refill in her latte cup, the waiter responded with, ""We're not really allowed to do this, but OK.""So you can't give my friend ten cents worth of drip coffee, but you can waste our time listing specials that no longer exist.  Your colleagues can make annoyed faces constantly when asked for things.  You can make us feel bad.  The food they did have was delicious.  But if I wanted to feel crappy about myself while eating, I'd go to my Mom's.",2.0
"As I slowly enter into a food coma after eating at Rose Water for a Thursday night dinner, allow me to unbutton and unzip mis pantalones. Picture a humid September night. It is the end of your first week at your new job and you want to treat yourself to something special in your new 'hood. Enter Yelp to the rescue. :) I skip the outdoor seating to avoid a.) pedestrians gawking at your food (hate that), b.) mosquitoes (you are not my friend), and c.) the humidity (the horror!). I enter the cute restaurant and am greeted by a hostess with an accent (French?). She tells me I have a few options but suggests that I avoid the loud party of four at the end of the restaurant. (Thank you! I could clearly hear them from across the room. I can't imagine what it would be like sitting next to them.) I sit against the only wall that has a brick exposed wall. Score!I order the grilled swordfish with the sweet corn succotash, summer squash and green goddess. The chef suggests it is cooked rare. I had never tried a Rosé wine with fish. The server suggests it and it is a nice change. It is the Groulleau/Gamay. The server cleverly teases me with a shot of the cucumber gazpacho, which is absolutely delicious. I will have to order it when I am more hungry. My swordfish comes. Beautiful presentation. Lots of colors. I cut my swordfish, soak and mix with the corn, squash and goddess. Place it all in my mouth and I melt. Willie Wonka, please shrink me so that I may swim in this plate full of tastiness.I wipe the plate clean. I finish the Rosé. I order the cherry cobbler for dessert, which comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I can't finish it all but it doesn't mean that it isn't good. I am just full. I am having a swordfish/cobbler baby. The bill comes to about $45. It's well worth it, believe me. Conclusion of the night:1.) The fact that this place is very close to my new pad is very very VERY dangerous.2.) I must hit the gym tomorrow morning.",5.0

awesome awesome brunch place. i love it when u can really taste the freshness of the ingredients. brunch prixfixe is $14 and includes a drink. i ordered the polenta cake with poached eggs and mustard greens. the polenta cake was definitely unique and had a great texture. and this is really random but my plate came with like two small slices of bread and they were SOOOOOO GOOD. this place didnt wow me but i'd definitely come back cuz their special changes all the time and i love fresh ingredients and bomb ass bread,4.0
My boyfriend and I had brunch here and it was super yummy. The brunch was a fixed price along with coffee refills. I enjoyed an omelette. The portion size is good!

"So I'm new to Park Slope, and upon exploring the neighborhood, my Dad suggested we try Rose Water today for brunch.  We got there at about 11am, and we had about a 45 minute wait.  The whole time, two things were happening; a) I was hoping the food was worth the wait, and b) I was checking out the plates leaving the kitchen, just to get an idea of what I wanted.  Well, let me inform you that it WAS worth the wait, and everything I saw looked extra yummy!My entree selection came down between the lamb burger and the peach pancakes, and the pancakes won.  We had to wait a bit for our food, but when it finally arrived, it was SO worth the wait.  The peach pancakes were deliciously light, fluffy and full of flavor.  They soaked up the syrup nicely without becoming too heavy.  The side of bacon I ordered set the pancakes off perfectly.  I tasted my mom's polenta and my dad's ribs, and both entrees were delicious, as well.The prices are just fine for the amount and quality of food received ...oh, and the music was fantastic!  They played Digital Underground, Johnny Gill and a few other faves...can't go wrong with those guys.  Needless to say, I will most definitely go back to Rose Water, and I'm thinking this just may be my go-to brunch spot here in Park Slope.",5.0
"This place always has a 30+ minute wait for brunch and I know why - it's the best brunch in Park Slope.  Soooooo yummy.  They have the basics down!  All of the ingredients are fresh, local, organic, and of the best quality.  Even a couple of eggs and bacon will be nicer here than anywhere else in the neighborhood, it's like they put magic in as one of the ingredients.Things I've had and would have again:  the bread basket (seriously, so nice), the 3-eggs and bacon, hibiscus tea, coffee, mimosas (they have fun little twists with different juices and whatnot), pork chop, and pork hash.Very much worth the wait!  And worth checking back a little bit early, sometimes people bail out of their wait list and you can get in sooner.",5.0

"Ok, Rose Water.  This fairly low rating has nothing to do with your food which is on the whole delicious and nice and all.  I had dinner there one night and it was a lovely low key experience -- the lady server even joked with us a bit.  But on other occasions...I show up with four friends for dinner one evening without a reservation.  The ""hostess"" (which is a term usually reserved for someone who makes you feel welcome) told us that there was a four top that we could have had if we hadn't had one extra person.  Basically like showing a child a puppy that he could have had if he didn't have two legs.  She then looked at one of my friends and asked her is she was ""the fifth wheel.""  Yikes.Then let me paint you a picture of brunch.  Three of us sit down for a Saturday morning ritual when a scene full of comic richness unfolds.  First the waiter gives a long and complicated description of several of the day's specials.  My friend selects one of them and the waiter gets a pained expression on his face and admits that they were currently out of that item.  Why did he tell us about it then?  Insert child and puppy analogy again.  My friend then selects another item.  The waiter returns shortly to inform us that they are out of that as well...  and they don't serve previously requested soy milk... and when we asked for coffee refills, my by now downtrodden friend asked for a regular refill in her latte cup, the waiter responded with, ""We're not really allowed to do this, but OK.""So you can't give my friend ten cents worth of drip coffee, but you can waste our time listing specials that no longer exist.  Your colleagues can make annoyed faces constantly when asked for things.  You can make us feel bad.  The food they did have was delicious.  But if I wanted to feel crappy about myself while eating, I'd go to my Mom's.",2.0
"As I slowly enter into a food coma after eating at Rose Water for a Thursday night dinner, allow me to unbutton and unzip mis pantalones. Picture a humid September night. It is the end of your first week at your new job and you want to treat yourself to something special in your new 'hood. Enter Yelp to the rescue. :) I skip the outdoor seating to avoid a.) pedestrians gawking at your food (hate that), b.) mosquitoes (you are not my friend), and c.) the humidity (the horror!). I enter the cute restaurant and am greeted by a hostess with an accent (French?). She tells me I have a few options but suggests that I avoid the loud party of four at the end of the restaurant. (Thank you! I could clearly hear them from across the room. I can't imagine what it would be like sitting next to them.) I sit against the only wall that has a brick exposed wall. Score!I order the grilled swordfish with the sweet corn succotash, summer squash and green goddess. The chef suggests it is cooked rare. I had never tried a Rosé wine with fish. The server suggests it and it is a nice change. It is the Groulleau/Gamay. The server cleverly teases me with a shot of the cucumber gazpacho, which is absolutely delicious. I will have to order it when I am more hungry. My swordfish comes. Beautiful presentation. Lots of colors. I cut my swordfish, soak and mix with the corn, squash and goddess. Place it all in my mouth and I melt. Willie Wonka, please shrink me so that I may swim in this plate full of tastiness.I wipe the plate clean. I finish the Rosé. I order the cherry cobbler for dessert, which comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I can't finish it all but it doesn't mean that it isn't good. I am just full. I am having a swordfish/cobbler baby. The bill comes to about $45. It's well worth it, believe me. Conclusion of the night:1.) The fact that this place is very close to my new pad is very very VERY dangerous.2.) I must hit the gym tomorrow morning.",5.0
"Prix fixe was only $15 here. The food was amazing! (no booze drinks included or even available).

Took forever to get our coffee and juice while the table next to us got their drinks almost immediately (we ordered at the same time with the same waitress).  However we got our meals first and they wait a long time for their meal....

I have to admit, my expectations for this place were too high. But I couldn't help it.

And while it may be local and organic it felt really heavy, especially on the butter. I did really enjoy the pumpkin cashew soup. However, the grilled polenta I ordered as my main course did not warrant the $18 they charged. It's a bit ridiculous. We were most disappointed by the service, which was incredibly slow.

"Hate to say it, but I was disappointed in my Rose Water experience. It had been one of the few restaurants in Park Slope that I'd heard was amazing but had yet to try, so my expectations were a little high. First, the restaurant is teensy (which I knew) so at 8 pm on a Thursday we had a 20 minute wait -- and I would've been fine with that if the food was as fantastic as I'd hoped. Things started out fairly well with appetizers; I loved my asparagus soup, the soft bread they brought to the table was outstanding, and the strawberry salad was nothing extraordinary but nice and refreshing nonetheless. It was the pricey entrees that did little for us. My steak was chewy and the vegetables a little soggy; my husband's chicken dish was okay but seemed to lack flavor.

"The menu looked awesome and the atmosphere was great, so my friend and I were really looking forward to our brunch. Unfortunately, it sucked. There's no major story here so I'm just going to write out the reasons:1. The food took forever! We sat down and ordered, then waited more than 30 minutes for our food, and we didn't order any of the specials that required more time to cook.2. The food wasn't that good. We got a single pancake to share in addition to our brunches and it tasted like a Bisquick pancake. But for $7. My food was fine but nothing special.3. The drinks were meh. The apple cider was weird and watery and left an unpleasant aftertaste.4. But most importantly: there was STRING still left in my friend's pork sandwich! It's used to tie up the pork loin while it cooks, and there was a 3-4 inch piece still left in the sandwich.

"I ate here last night after reading other reviews here on Yelp and I must say the positive reviews really tell it!  What drew me into the place is that I LOVE restaurants that get their ingredients from local/regional farms.  I think it's great for the economy and the quality and freshness of the food is uncomparable.Firstly, I need to say that the focaccia bread that they have for the table is the best bread I've ever had EVER in my life.  It's dense and moist and melts in your mouth.  The salt and rosemary are just enough and not overbearing.  I was so impressed I meant to ask if they sold it by the loaf, but I completely forgot.  For an appetizer I had the grilled calamari salad that was dressed perfectly and was the perfect size for an appetizer.  For an entree, I had the sautéed wild striped bass...It was cooked perfectly, not dry....and the side accompaniments were perfect, mushrooms and escarole...perfectly wilted!Now, the dessert...I had the sorbet...pear, cranberry, and apple...Apple was by far my favorite...the pear tasted like it had a hint of ginger in it and I'm not a fan, and the cranberry was a little too sweet for me.  My fiancé had the apple fritters which were delectable.  If I weren't on a diet, I would have eaten his dessert!The service was on point!  Friendly, informative, and knew exactly how the chef recommended that each dish be cooked!Overall, my experience here was unbelievable.  I would definitely go here again.  Everyone I went to dinner with was extremely pleased with everything they ordered!",5.0

"DAMN SON!  delicious!  Rose Water's brunch is soooooo good, the only downfall is that the wait on the weekend is pretty rough.  get there before 11am on Sunday and you should be better off with the wait.the polenta with poached eggs is sooooo good.  my love-muffin got the prosciutto sandwich and loved it more than he loves me.If in Park Slope you have to check out Rose Water.  Thumbs up to the chef!",5.0

"The menu looked awesome and the atmosphere was great, so my friend and I were really looking forward to our brunch. Unfortunately, it sucked. There's no major story here so I'm just going to write out the reasons:1. The food took forever! We sat down and ordered, then waited more than 30 minutes for our food, and we didn't order any of the specials that required more time to cook.2. The food wasn't that good. We got a single pancake to share in addition to our brunches and it tasted like a Bisquick pancake. But for $7. My food was fine but nothing special.3. The drinks were meh. The apple cider was weird and watery and left an unpleasant aftertaste.4. But most importantly: there was STRING still left in my friend's pork sandwich! It's used to tie up the pork loin while it cooks, and there was a 3-4 inch piece still left in the sandwich. We told a waitress who called over the manager, and her comment was, ""Oops, we usually do a good job of removing that kind of thing from the sandwiches.""

"We had a friend visiting and brought them to Rose Water for brunch today. (I had been once before sometime last year and gotten the apple pancakes, they were fine, nothing amazing, but we figured we'd try them again). Today, I ordered the vegetarian polenta with poached eggs, others got the frittata with sunchokes and cauliflower and the special:mushroom bread pudding with poached eggs.My actual meal was a poached egg on a goat cheese polenta cake with cremini mushrooms and brussel sprouts and chermoula. I thought the chermoula would just be an accent, but the entire plate had been doused so every thing I ate was covered in that pungent taste of lemon, cumin etc. The plating was also terrible, I had one poached egg on the polenta, then a pile of creminis/brussel sprouts and a random poached egg on the side. More importantly, the eggs were really runny, and given that my stomach hasn't felt great all day, I think they were underdone... On the other hand, the frittata was over done and greasy, boo! The saving grace of the meal was the special, the mushroom bread pudding, my friend seemed to enjoy it. Also, another strike is that the coffee wasn't good, had a bitterness from over-roasting--  although that also might be because I've been spoiled by Stumptown's hairbender blend.I guess I wanted to like Rose Water because of all the positive reviews, but from a vegetarian's perspective, this place was definitely not in tune with how flavors should sing and dance.",2.0

"The ""Blue Hill of Brooklyn""? I think not.Now that that's out of the way, it should be said that Rose Water, while not nearly capable of the rarefied culinary heights (and service...and ambience) of a certain ""well-visited"" establishment across the river, does aspire to greatness.  Their menu is loaded with clever, abstruse ingredients and flavor combinations (one sauce the chef concocted is known as ""green goddess,"" fish on the menu include cobia and ono) and the wine list features a wide array of nicely chosen varietals from good producers the world over.  (A particularly nice touch is the nearly half page of roses, both dry and not.)  The service has a formal, mannered touch, and if it lacks just the right polish, it makes up for it in good intentions.The food, regrettably, doesn't match these aspirations. A shrimp appetizer tasted mostly of a creamy sauce (aioli-ish, I think) and the carcinogens from the grill.  The entrees, while cleverly conceived (overconceived?) and executed with something similar to fine-dining flair, were just a bit too by the numbers, and landed a bit short of the mark.   Two separate fish dishes were nearly overwhelmed by their accompaniments, which, while flavorful enough, were too heavy and clumsy to give the food any sort of zip, or freshness--the things one would expect from a restaurant that prides itself on the now obligatory ""local, organic, sustainable, fresh"" ingredients.Other things that keep Rose Water from being as good as it wants to be are the kinds of details that true fine dining establishments get right--like avoiding fake flowers (RW has plenty--inexcusable, really) and offering unique, beautiful and flavorful desserts (the one we sampled was sort of like chocolate cereal with pudding and cherry sauce dumped over it.)To be fair, while not cheap, Rose Water's prices aren't quite as steep as those of the truly ""fancy"" restaurants, so perhaps it's not quite right to make such comparisons.  But then again, they're high enough that I'd certainly think twice--perhaps three times--about dropping even that much cash here, when I could have a better meal for the same price at a number of other establishments.",2.0
"Last Sundee I wandered over here for brunch. There was a 45 minute wait so my brunch pal and I hung out and marveled at how many people in Park Slope are super way into jogging. Once we sat down I ordered the mozzarella sandwich with fries. There were a couple of problems with it. The sandwich was just like...okay. There was an overabundance of mayo going on there that really bummed me out. The fries were also kind of disappointing. The kicker for me though was the ""ketchup"" that came with my meal. Now I don't know for sure if this was like a homemade ketchup or a side of marinara sauce. If it was in fact a side of marinara sauce, then it tasted great! But what was it doing there? If it was homemade ketchup, well then, it tasted like freaking marinara sauce, bro.My brunch mate's three poached eggs with bacon and potatoes was  better. The potatoes were actually pretty darn good. Our final consensus was ""Meh.""",3.0
"This place is responsible for my love of poached eggs.I've come for brunch three times and in three different season and eveytime have gotten one of specials (usually some kind of hash with seasonal veggies, fish, and poached eggs)  So fresh, so delicious, minimally and perfectly prepared local ingredients. $14.95 prix fixe brunch comes with an entree and a drink (try their delicious teas or the ginger-pear juice, yum!)This is my go-to spot for a brunch with out-of-town guests of parents.

"After hearing good stuff about Rose Water Restaurant I finally decided to give it a try and it definitely lived up to the hype. We had the calamari salad and cucumber gazpacho to start and the swordfish and sirloin steak for entrees. All were simply prepared and cooked perfectly. Not overcooked or dried out like can often happen. My favorite thing about Rose Water is the extensive wine menu and our waiter's help to pick out a wine that we would both like. There were a number of good dessert options as well but I highly recommend the cherry cobbler, which was freshly baked and served right out of the oven. I cannot wait to go back to this place!If you are planning to try Rose Water on a typically busy Friday or Saturday evening, I highly recommend making reservations as it's a small space with limited # of tables.",5.0

But the rock shrimp and Parmesan cheese risotto was WONDERFUL. It was thick and creamy, and shrimp was cooked well - very tender. The dessert, an apple steam cake, was delicious as well, on its corncake pedestal. Brunches are reasonably priced for an entree and (non-alcoholic) beverage, but the sides are small. I can't complain too much, though, even when there's a wait. This place is just steps away from where I live.",4.0

But if you are a server and you come to my table bearing the bad news that you have three items currently unavailable, shouldnt you just give me a more current menu? After having brunch here, the N train in rush hour will seem like a sunday afternoon drive across the country side in a coupe deville. Loose a few tables and gain a few more fans please Rose water.",2.0
"I love their brunch deal: $15 for an entree and a coffee/tea/juice.  There is an upsell if you get a special, though, which is of course  what I did.  Shrimp omelette with asparagus was awesome.  Hearty portion, with a side salad.  They accommodated my egg whites request too, I recall with no additional charge.  Perhaps the omelette was a tad oily, but the yummy bread served w/ soaked it up nicely.  Pleasant outdoor patio with lots of greenery, too.",4.0
"The ""Blue Hill of Brooklyn""? I think not.Now that that's out of the way, it should be said that Rose Water, while not nearly capable of the rarefied culinary heights (and service...and ambience) of a certain ""well-visited"" establishment across the river, does aspire to greatness.  Their menu is loaded with clever, abstruse ingredients and flavor combinations (one sauce the chef concocted is known as ""green goddess,"" fish on the menu include cobia and ono) and the wine list features a wide array of nicely chosen varietals from good producers the world over.  (A particularly nice touch is the nearly half page of roses, both dry and not.)  The service has a formal, mannered touch, and if it lacks just the right polish, it makes up for it in good intentions.The food, regrettably, doesn't match these aspirations. A shrimp appetizer tasted mostly of a creamy sauce (aioli-ish, I think) and the carcinogens from the grill.  The entrees, while cleverly conceived (overconceived?) and executed with something similar to fine-dining flair, were just a bit too by the numbers, and landed a bit short of the mark.   Two separate fish dishes were nearly overwhelmed by their accompaniments, which, while flavorful enough, were too heavy and clumsy to give the food any sort of zip, or freshness--the things one would expect from a restaurant that prides itself on the now obligatory ""local, organic, sustainable, fresh"" ingredients.Other things that keep Rose Water from being as good as it wants to be are the kinds of details that true fine dining establishments get right--like avoiding fake flowers (RW has plenty--inexcusable, really) and offering unique, beautiful and flavorful desserts (the one we sampled was sort of like chocolate cereal with pudding and cherry sauce dumped over it.)To be fair, while not cheap, Rose Water's prices aren't quite as steep as those of the truly ""fancy"" restaurants, so perhaps it's not quite right to make such comparisons.  But then again, they're high enough that I'd certainly think twice--perhaps three times--about dropping even that much cash here, when I could have a better meal for the same price at a number of other establishments.",2.0
"Last Sundee I wandered over here for brunch. There was a 45 minute wait so my brunch pal and I hung out and marveled at how many people in Park Slope are super way into jogging. Once we sat down I ordered the mozzarella sandwich with fries. There were a couple of problems with it. The sandwich was just like...okay. There was an overabundance of mayo going on there that really bummed me out. The fries were also kind of disappointing. The kicker for me though was the ""ketchup"" that came with my meal. Now I don't know for sure if this was like a homemade ketchup or a side of marinara sauce. If it was in fact a side of marinara sauce, then it tasted great! But what was it doing there? If it was homemade ketchup, well then, it tasted like freaking marinara sauce, bro.My brunch mate's three poached eggs with bacon and potatoes was  better. The potatoes were actually pretty darn good. Our final consensus was ""Meh.""",3.0
"This place is responsible for my love of poached eggs.I've come for brunch three times and in three different season and eveytime have gotten one of specials (usually some kind of hash with seasonal veggies, fish, and poached eggs)  So fresh, so delicious, minimally and perfectly prepared local ingredients. $14.95 prix fixe brunch comes with an entree and a drink (try their delicious teas or the ginger-pear juice, yum!)This is my go-to spot for a brunch with out-of-town guests of parents. There  is usually a bit of a wait time, but its well worth it.I can't wait to come back for dinner some time.",5.0
"After hearing good stuff about Rose Water Restaurant I finally decided to give it a try and it definitely lived up to the hype. We had the calamari salad and cucumber gazpacho to start and the swordfish and sirloin steak for entrees. All were simply prepared and cooked perfectly. Not overcooked or dried out like can often happen. My favorite thing about Rose Water is the extensive wine menu and our waiter's help to pick out a wine that we would both like. There were a number of good dessert options as well but I highly recommend the cherry cobbler, which was freshly baked and served right out of the oven. I cannot wait to go back to this place!If you are planning to try Rose Water on a typically busy Friday or Saturday evening, I highly recommend making reservations as it's a small space with limited # of tables.",5.0
"My friend wanted to treat me out for my belated birthday and suggested this place.  She said its all locally grown, bought etc.  I was expecting foo foo fluffy food and pea sized portions but boy was I wrong!Let's start off our gluttony and say that we got like way too much food and insisted that we finish everything:pear ginger juicecure foie gras torchonbraised beef brisketlemon custard cakegingerbread donutsespressothe bread they give you in the beginning itself is super fresh and hot and the olive oil they give you complements it perfectly!i have to say that this was my favorite dish of the night.  the cure foie gras torchon--weird combination but it comes with nutella! i know right nutella! but the saltiness of the foie gras goes so well with the nutella. its a balance of sweet and salty! the blood orange that comes with it--perfection.  the mix of ingredients is a masterpiece!the braised beef brisket--HUGE! the potato croquette that comes with is absolutely delicious. its a totally different way to present potatoes it reminded me a little bit of biscuits.  the beef was slightly more salty then i expected but the butter --magnificent!  the beef wasn't my favorite but eating with the croquette is a match made!the dessert was ALMOST my favorite. the portions are huge. i was expecting little desserts since the dinner was so huge. but no, still HUGE.  i got the donuts, and it comes with cream cheese ice-cream---like literally heaven!  everything is so fresh you absolutely taste the difference.  my friend's custard cake was also delicious. the peanut brittle that comes with it also great! any place can have great food but its the great service that makes you come back! the service was soo friendly and attentive. i was almost nervous lol. but seriously, great service, great food, CLEAN bathroom! what more can you ask for?!  wait i also forgot to mention...SUPER fast service!",5.0

"Delicious starchy dinner... so full...(Oops, I didn't meant to post it yet... anyways)I had the prix fix dinner on Tuesday night... my friend Angie K. came to visit, and for once she didn't show up at 11pm. We could eat somewhere that wasn't a diner. I started with the turnip soup with tapioca. It was nice, but I think the salad would've suited me better. But the rock shrimp and Parmesan cheese risotto was WONDERFUL. It was thick and creamy, and shrimp was cooked well - very tender. The dessert, an apple steam cake, was delicious as well, on its corncake pedestal. Brunches are reasonably priced for an entree and (non-alcoholic) beverage, but the sides are small. I can't complain too much, though, even when there's a wait. This place is just steps away from where I live.",4.0
I've been to this place at least 3 or 4 times now. Every single time the service is spot on and the food is outstanding. The brunch and dinner menu are equally great.

"We just moved onto 6th Avenue, and have been glancing across the street to Rose Water for a few weeks...  Last night we decided to head in.  We got there around 7:30, no reservation, but they told us they would seat us immediately if we thought we'd be done before their nine o'clock reservations.  If we didn't want to do that, we could wait until the next couple left.  I'm pregnant and pretty much collapse around 9, so we thought an hour and a half was plenty of time...Service:  The service was great.  With a bun in the oven, there's some things you can't eat, and so I had a lot of questions that were (in my opinion) pretty annoying, ""Is the goat cheese pastuerized?""  ""Is it coated in rice flour or wheat?""  blah blah blah.  Our waitress patiently got the anwer to each Q, and never made us feel like THOSE customers, even though the place was super crowded (and we were being THOSE customers).Food:  Delicious.  I had the fried goat cheese and the lamb.  The vegetables are so fresh, not an afterthought but a huge part of the meal.  My husband had the lamb belly appetizer and the sirloin.  He has two things to add - (1) The sirloin was so tender he didn't need a knife to cut it and (2) ""A man can eat more than that.""We will definitely be back soon:-).  Can't wait to try their brunch.",5.0

"Went here for dinner on a weekday and we were lucky enough to drop in on a special they have that includes an appetizer, the main course and then a dessert for $28. I ordered the asparagus soup, the chicken and the chocolate cheesecake. They started us off with bread and oil and that in itself was very good. I'd never had that type of oil before and am always overjoyed at experiencing new types. I asked the waitress what it was but she didn't give me a name so I wasn't sure if it was house oil they created or something out of a bottle. Then we ordered an appetizer, prosciutto with goat cheese balls and honey, it was delicious but I wish the prosciutto had been already finely sliced  instead of piled onto the plate and they'd added a tad more honey, the goat cheese balls were delicious though. The soup was rather good but the chicken was on the salty side. I wish they'd have carefully measured the seasoning on the chicken with the seasoned greens to avoid a sodium overload. My friend ordered the Hanger steak and it was SO well prepared and cooked that I wish I'd ordered that instead. As for the dessert, it was rich but not overwhelming, perfect enough for two people to share with a cup of coffee. Strangely, there is only 1 unisex restroom, very clean but, I went on a slow day not too many people but I had to wait in line a while, regardless.

I'd never had that type of oil before and am always overjoyed at experiencing new types. I asked the waitress what it was but she didn't give me a name so I wasn't sure if it was house oil they created or something out of a bottle. Then we ordered an appetizer, prosciutto with goat cheese balls and honey, it was delicious but I wish the prosciutto had been already finely sliced  instead of piled onto the plate and they'd added a tad more honey, the goat cheese balls were delicious though. The soup was rather good but the chicken was on the salty side. I wish they'd have carefully measured the seasoning on the chicken with the seasoned greens to avoid a sodium overload. My friend ordered the Hanger steak and it was SO well prepared and cooked that I wish I'd ordered that instead. As for the dessert, it was rich but not overwhelming, perfect enough for two people to share with a cup of coffee. Strangely, there is only 1 unisex restroom, very clean but, I went on a slow day not too many people but I had to wait in line a while, regardless. Friendly service, lovely location, I give this place 3 stars and should also mention that it's more of a (3) $$$ place (for dinner not sure about brunch prices) since each plate is around $30 so be prepared to spend especially if you order wine.",3.0
"I think it is great that a restaurant should emphasize local, regional fare on the menu.  Unfortunately, I also like good service.After a longer-than-expected wait, we were shown toward our table, then we got to stand around for a few more minutes while various staff bussed it in phases.  On a busy day, the staff at the average restaurant shows a bit of hustle, but at Rose Water everything seemed to take place with an ease of emotional detachment that might make the Buddha proud.Eventually we were allowed to sit, and order.  I asked if the eggs came with toast, because while this would seem obvious, I was beginning to have my doubts.  The waitress explained that some of the egg dishes came with toast and the one I was interested in came with some sort of home made bread.  At this point my blood sugar and patience had run low enough that instead of asking if the bread were served in the form of toast, I joined the rest of my party in ordering the pear crepes.Drinks were served, and then we waited, and waited, and after some exhausting amount of time the food was at last brought to our table.  Parts of my crepe were crunchy.  I don't know if that is a question of style or of sitting under a heat lamp for too long.The food was tasty enough but just didn't seem worth the higher-than-average price or the way-higher-than-average wait.This would have been a two-star review if at any point during the interminable wait for our food, and later, the bill, anyone had offered to refill my coffee.",1.0
"Ok, 2 stellar brunches in a row doth a 5-star trend make. Rose Water sometimes has a bit of a wait, and the food is never speedy coming out of the kitchen, but that's what you get when everything us made uber-fresh to order...and when it does come, it's nirvana for the belly. My only complaint is that it's so tough to decide between the fabulous sweet, fruity pancakes and the equally stellar savory dishes such as the fritattas. Solution: go with a larger party and order another dish to split. The real winner this past weekend was the fresh corn cakes with eggs and possibly the tastiest salsa verde ever concocted north of the border.Oh, and grab a side of bacon, becasue brunch isn't complete without it, and theirs is some of the best.",5.0
"Meh. Nothing to yelp home about. Had brunch here with friends earlier this year and was looking forward to it, based on other reviews.I ordered poached eggs - which was a plate consisting of eggs sliding around on a plate with a small spoonful of soggy potatoes and 2 slices of toast.  No color on the plate, not even garnish. Sad.  My friends had the french toast and a special, I think.  They weren't so up on their food either.  We were underwhelmed to say the least. Maybe I'd be back for dinner, but def. not brunch.",2.0
"Located in beautiful Park Slope deep in the heart of foodie-ville this farm to table and sustainability  conscious establishment certainly qualifies as special, thoughtful, and very very enjoyable. Loved the food and the out door seating was perfect given the evening we were there but warning....the service could have been much much better. I didnt get a sense of real authentic ""style"" there. You that feeling when the restaurant experience is far beyond just the food but the whole package? Well I didint quite get the feeling with Rose Water.   We got reservations for 2 about 2 or 3 hrs out which was great. The ambiance of the restaurant was quite nice and it was full to capacity which is always a good sign. We started with the asparagus soup and  fried goat cheese with raspberries, prosciutto and honey. The soup was just delightful and no smelly pee-pee either ;) . In all honesty the cheese sounded better than it actually tasted but it was a nice unique appetizer.  For the main course we went with the smoked leg of lamb with fava beans and cavolo nero and sautéed fluke  with marinated mushrooms pea puree and lambs quarters. Both main dishes were utterly divine, of exceptional quality, truly unique and enjoyable. Apps and a main course came to about $50.00 per person with tip so consider accordingly. Its a special place as the food is so carefully thought through. My only tip to the owners to to bring that awareness and conscientiousness to your staff as well. Please know there was nothing ""wrong"" and this is a very very positive review. So enjoy foodies!!!",4.0

"Despite the lovely neighborhood vibe, Park Slope, Brooklyn, can be somewhat cutthroat on a Sunday afternoon.  Many restaurants vie for the brunch crowds.  The really good places for brunch usually have a bit of wait time.  Too often, this atmosphere results in irritated patrons being rushed by impatient staff seeking faster turnover.Rose Water manages to avoid all this, despite being quite popular.  The  interior ambiance immediately conveys a relaxed feeling that is very Brooklyn.  The staff contributes to the feeling by providing excellent service without being intrusive.  The core of the Rose Water's success is the thoughtful and creative menu.  Rose Water is committed to working with local, regional, organic and sustainably raised foods.  Even more important, the kitchen seems committed to offering delicious food.  On a recent visit with some friends, the duck confit sandwich, smoked cod cake and baked polenta with goat cheese were all delicious and wonderfully executed.  The pumpkin bread was disappointing, but pumpkin season is coming to a close.A visit to Rose Water is definitely worth the trip, especially with a $14  prix fixe brunch!",4.0
"I went here for brunch this past Saturday when it was about 7 degrees outside. Although there was practically no wait, we were seated in the covered outdoor patio area. The hostess informed my friend and I that there was an outdoor heater and blankets to help us keep warm. Unfortunately, with the weather as cold as it was, neither blankets, full outerwear, nor hot cider could keep us warm. Looking around I can tell you we weren't the only customers freezing our butts off while trying to eat brunch. I'd love to tell you how the food tasted but after about 30 seconds of having been brought to our table, my caramalized apple crepe was about the same temperature as my frostbitten hands. We ended up asking for our food to go and left.For a Brooklyn-based restaurant, I'm suprised staff would seat unsuspecting customers outside in frigid weather as a means to garner more business...the patio should really be closed off during the winter. I might come back next weekend to try the French toast, though getting in around my face mask and ski goggles might prove challenging.",2.0

"$14 brunch comes with a non-alcoholic drink, is more than enough food. More creative brunch than most in the slope. My duck confit sandwich was good, not great, very rich. The smoked fluke fish hash was fantastic, and they've clearly got poaching eggs down. The polenta with salsa verde was good, but not as bright as I had hoped.

"I went for Brunch on a Saturday. I don't know if brunch is the same saturdays and sundays, but it was just OK. It was really hot in there, first off, and I'm not sure if its lack of ventilation or what, but it was just uncomfortable. Also, of all the places to get brunch, of course I go to the place where alcohol is NOT included in the pre-fixe. Which is just so lame. I need to get my drunk brunch on! So I paid out of pocket for the alcohol. The mimosas were great, I don't really regret that.The food was pretty good, but for the price, I expected something a tad better, or with some more bells and whistles, so to speak. Maybe I'm just bitter for paying for booze, but really, 14 bucks a plate? I mean, it was good, but it was nothing that i was like, OMFG MUST COME BACK. The staff was friendly and nice, the tables were laid out poorly, and in general, it wasn't that special. I think I'll try somewhere else for brunch next time, with breakfast booze included, as there are plenty of those in park slope, i'm not concerned with this search, LOL. I seriously wanted to like this place though, so I'm a little bummed. C'est la vie. To the next P-Slope brunch place.",2.0

"Wow, Jose goes fancy!Brooklyn restaurant week allotted me a meal at this smallish luxury spot, where the boss was a bit short with the fine waitstaff and the setting was pretty basic. The dinner appetizers and entrees, though, were quite good, if a bit boring for vegetarian fare. There was a celery root soup and a tasty salad that were very good, but the main dish of risotto is never the most exciting. The desserts, in particular, I thought were a bit weak but still good. On the other hand, I was happy with the fresh baked bread and the olive oil, and the staff who always offered to bring me more of it.  Perhaps it is better for brunch, as many folks say.I can't judge the wine parings because I just don't love wine, but every time I experience them, I wonder if there's a place in the word for a Rhum Sommelier. If there is, you can find me on Yelp.",3.0

"Went here for brunch this past weekend.  For the area, their $14 prix fixe menu is pretty good (1 entree and 1 drink).  We also didn't have to wait at all, which was great, but I think if there were more than 2 of us, there would have been a much longer wait.  We had: Apple Pancakes and Coffee, Pork Sandwich and Rose Water Lemonade.  All of their food is natural, and I think they try to do as much locally grown stuff as possible.  The apple pancakes were amazing, and I was surprised by how good their coffee was.  The pork sandwich was good, although I think going back, we may just stick with the apple pancakes.  I think the only downfall is that it is a small prix fixe menu, so there is not as much choice about what you can get for food.  For picky eaters, you may have a little bit of difficulty finding something ""normal"" for lack of better words.  They do have their menus online however, so you can browse the menu before deciding to go here.  Overall, great value for the quality of food served (at least for brunch).",4.0
"I love this ethereal and cozy little restaurant in Park Slope.   It feels like you've joined a family in their fairy-like warm home for an inventive and delicious meal, made with love.  From sustainably sourced ingredients to the care with which they treat their customers (reservations highly recommended) makes you feel like a treasured guest.  I just love this spot.  Have never had a bad morsel of food or unsatisfying drop of wine, coffee, juice or tea.  Favorite dish most recently was a grilled rectangle of polenta - crispy, toasty and firm yet crumbly - topped with a braised mushrooms, a toasty/smoky African spice rub, goat cheese and sitting on top of stewed collard greens.  Delicious.",5.0

"Redemption is what Rose Water accomplishes for New American cuisine. Just when you thought that all the US had to offer gastronomy was the cheeseburger and hot dog you discover this gem on Union Street off 6th Ave in Brooklyn. To define the dinner experience as ""pleasant"" or even ""delicious"" is a gross understatement to the sheer spectacle on the palate that the dishes accomplish. I went with a friend who is a very finicky eater and I have only heard of the restaurant. I've passed by on previous occasions but have always found the tight quarters to be filled to capacity with a line waiting. This time, I made a reservation and the service was overwhelmingly polite which is sort of discomforting for a native New Yorker. From the moment we walked in for a 6pm reservation the attention didn't stop. There was constant water refills, regular check ups from the waitress and even --and this really impressed me-- we were offered a table in the outdoor portion when a noisy baby made his wailing appearance for dinner. We politely declined and enjoyed the bread and oil. This is not your typical restaurant. It is a narrow establishment on a corner but it is well lit and cozy. Cozy is not to be confused with cramped. I noticed that the wait staff took extra pains to ensure that customers were not elbowing each other and there was still ample room between tables and chairs to allow clearance for the wait staff to pass. Do not commit the same mistake I did and appear in jeans and sneakers. Although no one appeared to notice, I did feel a little out of place since everyone else was in slacks and shoes. Don't expect a Coke or a Corona either. They only serve very froufrou drinks and a lengthy selection of wine. I was very charmed by the hostess who went through great lengths at demonstrating her hospitality. I've read previous reviews and it appears this may have been an effort on her part to redeem her reputation (or that of her predecessor). Hospitality is a mild description but it was very Non-New York, which is fine. As a matter of fact it was refreshing. Our waitress was very nice and more mild mannered. She brought us the wooden menus and noted that all their dishes changed seasonally and all their ingredients were grown in local organic farms. Kudos to Rose Water for jumping on the organic bandwagon. The meal was sensational, in the truest definition of the word: it appealed to all the senses. I had the baked polenta. OMG I was savoring every bite. It was a complex layering of flavors and textures that created an exquisite perichoresis of a flavor profile. When the waitress approached the table with the dish I was left a bit puzzled. The image was not what I expected the polenta to look like. I had to reassess my understanding of what polenta should be. The waitress explained to me that the chef reduces it to an extreme and out comes a succulent cake that begins as savory on the tongue, evolves to sweet and ends with a salty kick. While you bit there is a crunch then a soft warm center and finally a sweet sauce to enhance the natural sugars. I detected so many herbs that I was overwhelmed but the slow release of flavors made the brain approach a near hallucinogenic state.  I didn't want the polenta to end. I took small modest bites and allowed my mouth to have an explosion of joyful yummyness. The pumpkin soup was a wonderful starter. It is a pureed pumpkin with creme fraiche and it was good. It had a mild cinnamon taste to it and the creme fraiche added an enhancement to the texture of the soup. My experience with anything made with pumpkin is that it is gloppy, and gelatinous but this was smooth, creamy and reminded me of the texture of whipped cream. This is not your mother's thanksgiving pumpkin soup. It's a very hoity-toity home style dish.Dessert was good, not great, just good. I had the apple fritters and it was delicious. Honestly, it didn't measure up to the rest of the meal but that's alright, you can't expect exponential greatness across three courses. American food has a reputation of being fattening, unoriginal, prepackaged and flavorless. We are known for putting a sauce, salt or cheese on anything and everything and then microwaving it. If Rose Water is the New American fare that everyone is talking about then thank God. It makes sense, after all every dish I ate there was like the 4th of July in my mouth. Explosively good.",5.0
"Thanksgiving dinner for two with tax and a generous tip total: $180.  It was the smallest -overpriced dinner I've eaten in a long long time.

"I went for Brunch on a Saturday. I don't know if brunch is the same saturdays and sundays, but it was just OK. It was really hot in there, first off, and I'm not sure if its lack of ventilation or what, but it was just uncomfortable. Also, of all the places to get brunch, of course I go to the place where alcohol is NOT included in the pre-fixe. Which is just so lame. I need to get my drunk brunch on! So I paid out of pocket for the alcohol. The mimosas were great, I don't really regret that.The food was pretty good, but for the price, I expected something a tad better, or with some more bells and whistles, so to speak. Maybe I'm just bitter for paying for booze, but really, 14 bucks a plate? I mean, it was good, but it was nothing that i was like, OMFG MUST COME BACK. The staff was friendly and nice, the tables were laid out poorly, and in general, it wasn't that special. I think I'll try somewhere else for brunch next time, with breakfast booze included, as there are plenty of those in park slope, i'm not concerned with this search, LOL. I seriously wanted to like this place though, so I'm a little bummed. C'est la vie. To the next P-Slope brunch place.",2.0

"Wow, Jose goes fancy!Brooklyn restaurant week allotted me a meal at this smallish luxury spot, where the boss was a bit short with the fine waitstaff and the setting was pretty basic. The dinner appetizers and entrees, though, were quite good, if a bit boring for vegetarian fare. There was a celery root soup and a tasty salad that were very good, but the main dish of risotto is never the most exciting. The desserts, in particular, I thought were a bit weak but still good. On the other hand, I was happy with the fresh baked bread and the olive oil, and the staff who always offered to bring me more of it.  Perhaps it is better for brunch, as many folks say.I can't judge the wine parings because I just don't love wine, but every time I experience them, I wonder if there's a place in the word for a Rhum Sommelier.

The service was awful, however.  This was due exclusively to the hostess, who within 15-20 minutes of us having sat down (keep in mind we got there 15 minutes early for a 7:15 reservation in which we were the first patrons of the night), told us that we needed to hurry up and order since there was another reservation after us.  For the rest of the meal following her comment, servers were constantly hovering over our table and clearing plates immediately after we finished our dishes.  This pretty much killed the mood the rest of the dinner and made us feel rushed as we ate.  What was especially galling was that there were several empty tables and not a single person waiting as we left the restaurant.

I can't imagine anything I say actually justifying the experience of eating at Rose Water. I would recommend anything on the menu. Everything you eat here will be an experience that you won't forget. The lines for brunch are long, but I would wait hours if necessary. Rose Water really represents the calibre of food in New York for me. There just isn't anything quite like it, and it's really the best. I've had multiple best-meals-of-my-life at Rose Water, and I will be living off the memories of this place forever.",5.0
"I came out to Rose Water for Dine-In Brooklyn 2009 (3 course meals for $23.00, sweet deal) and I'm sooo glad we chose this place!!!  Everything was prepared and served perfecto.It's kind of a hole in the wall, but everything about this place seemed perfect.  Although it was small, 3 friends and I fit comfortably, lighting was nice and dim.The menu showed convenient wine pairings for each dish (which I think was included in the Dine In Brooklyn special).Squid salad - not too fishy, nice tangy bite, fresh veggiesRoasted chicken - tender, juicy, flavorfulCaramelized brioche - crispy, but smooth, soft, melts in your mouthRisotto - perfectly boiled, creamyWe all picked off each other's plates because everything was so good and left this place feeling stuffed and satisfied!!  We had to literally force ourselves to go out afterwards we were so stuffed.  One day I'm coming back here for sure.",5.0
"I haven't actually eaten here due to my vegan diet, but I just had a wonderful email exchange with the owner and they've just recently added a vegan entree upon request to all their menus including brunch, lunch and dinner. I can't wait to try it!",4.0
"I went with the reviews and ordered a bread basket, the polenta with poached eggs, and the three eggs style with bacon, potatoes, and salad. I enjoyed the scone from the basket but everything else tasted like regular bread... Not worth an extra $7... Also the bread assortment filled us up so much that we couldn't finish our actual dish.The brunch prefixe for $14 is a good deal... It comes with any entree and a non-alcoholic beverage. I would recommend trying their fresh juice special. I had the strawberry rhubarb... It was light and refreshing.We preferred the polenta without the goat cheese... It was very tasty. The bacon and potatoes from the other dish was very flavorful as well.The wait for two on a Sunday was 25 mins. The place is small but cute. Service is a bit slow. If you order more than one beverage your free drink will be the one of lesser value.  (That annoyed me a little.)Overall, it's a nice brunch spot... skip the bread basket and go for the entree.",3.0
"We stopped in here for the Dine In Brooklyn promotion last night - we were more than happily surprised. The waitstaff and (I'm guessing) owner were attentive and sweet. The atmosphere is cozy. The food was PHENOMENAL. Each dish was flawless. Really. My husband and I had the fried goat cheese, butternut squash soup, chicken, pork, chocolate cheesecake, and the lemon cake. All perfectly balanced.  I highly recommend. We will certainly be back and will try the wine pairing next time.",5.0
"Rose Water's delicious brunch fare (prix-fix that goes for $14) is served in a cozy, well-appointed space . The dinner is not bad either, but the price is not nearly as reasonable. On the minus side the brunch bread basket that used to have delicious fresh breads is now full of stale unappetizing slabs; the wait tends to be long and they are very strict about $14 minimum per person. Not to mention that they would never sit your party if your group is missing a person.",4.0
"We've had brunch here a few times, and it was fine, but not outstanding. Solid A-. Not much you couldn't do at home, if you know how to cook even a little bit (and are willing to use lots of butter).But just had dinner, and it really was outstanding. Had a great brandade app on oily (in a good way) toast w fried egg and chopped olives, and thoroughly enjoyed asparagus soup, grilled tuna, seared fluke, blueberry cobbler and homemade ice cream. Everything was excellently prepared, with rich, creative flavors and without being too busy or  'precious.' The service was lovely and friendly, and they let me try two wines before choosing one (both were great). It's not geared toward children at all -- not having high chairs in Park Slope is taking a strong stand -- but they were still wonderfully accommodating to our toddler daughter.We do the whole wait-on-line-for-brunch thing and sort of take it for granted, since it's always there and not hip and new like stuff on 5th Ave. or in Prospect Hts or on Smith St., but this really is a fine place, and we'll be back!",5.0
"I went for brunch here a couple of weeks ago, and it certainly left something to be desired. The food and service weren't memorable. And the selection for brunch was pretty limited. The place gets pretty crowded - and hot. You kind of feel like you're eating over people.I also was kind of hoping that the Rose Water lemonade was going to be made with rosewater. So it goes.",2.0
"The food was pretty good although we thought the food at Al Di La we had the night before was better.  I'd give a 5 for pumpkin soup, 4 for polenta (although a little rich), 4 for tuna, and 3.5 for both an apple crisp salad and a vegan option that was the chef's creation. The service was awful, however.  This was due exclusively to the hostess, who within 15-20 minutes of us having sat down (keep in mind we got there 15 minutes early for a 7:15 reservation in which we were the first patrons of the night), told us that we needed to hurry up and order since there was another reservation after us.  For the rest of the meal following her comment, servers were constantly hovering over our table and clearing plates immediately after we finished our dishes.  This pretty much killed the mood the rest of the dinner and made us feel rushed as we ate.  What was especially galling was that there were several empty tables and not a single person waiting as we left the restaurant. We won't be going back as a result.",2.0

"I have to fasten my seat belt before gushing over this truly stunning champion of the Brooklyn restaurant scene. Frankly, Rose Water holds my title for ""Best Brunch of All Time"", thanks to an extremely well thought out menu with perfectly executed culinary innovations. This is my favorite place to blow apart jaded Manhattanites' common tendency to poo-poo NYC's largest borough. In fact, the city's other chefs should train under the folks responsible for a menu that somehow manages to be creative while simultaneously offering something for everyone.Yes, I wish it was larger. And yes, I wish they took reservations for brunch, on those busy Sunday mornings... But I'll gladly stand in line as long as necessary for one of their perfectly cooked fritattas, served beside fresh greens with a startlingly subtle warm red lentil salad -- or the Granny Smith apple pancakes, with a hint of cardamom in the batter, pistachios sprinkled on top -- soft, but with slightly crisp edges. Hell, make it the fritatta AND the pancakes. I'm hungry. I'm gonna need a nap after this one.",5.0
"I love, love, LOVE Rose Water.Four of us came here during Dine In Brooklyn week and took advantage of the prix fixe menu. There were only three choices per course, but the limited selection was irrelevant, as every option was crazily delicious. For the first course, I chose the celery root soup: creamy and earthy and tangy, sprinkled with bits of melt-in-your mouth bleu cheese and crunchy croutons brushed with olive oil. Seriously YUMS. I ordered the sauteed mahi mahi as my main course, and was happy I did so. The fish was cooked perfectly; tender and moist inside, with a perfectly crisp sear on the outside. I'm a big fan of crunchy/crispy fish, and they've perfected the art of searing. The parsnip puree was decadent - super rich and creamy. Oh, and I can't forget the spinach... sweet, sweet garlickly wilted goodness.I took one bite of someone else's risotto dish, which was equally awesome, but I was too in love with my mahi mahi to turn on it now.When the dessert menu came around, we made sure to order one of everything, so we'd be able to sample each option. The mint chocolate chip cake was dense and (somehow) refreshing all at once. The coffee pot du creme was intensely flavored and creamier than your average custard. But my favorite was the caramelized brioche. The name pretty much says it all. A slice of brioche toast with candied caramel drizzled on top, and a healthy scoop of almond ice cream. Sweet baby Jesus, kill me now. What made the food at Rose Water taste even better is the fact that most (if not all) of their ingredients are purchased from local and regional organic farms, and their menu rotates seasonally to take advantage of what nature has to offer at that time of the year. Such sustainable and responsible methods for purchasing and serving food means a hell of a lot to me. If you're going to feel guilty about polishing off the remainder of everyone else's desserts, at least you don't have to feel guilty about where your food came from.",5.0
"Dropped by for brunch on a Saturday morning - wait was only 20 minutes or so for the two of us.  Definitely worth the trek.  Definitely worth the wait.Their brunch menu offered so many wonderful choices, we had to ask the waitress to come back twice because we had such a hard time selecting what to eat.  The other thing I love about their brunch menu is that they offer a free non-alcoholic drink, which offers you an opportunity to try their fragrant, home-made teas, something that I wouldn't have taken advantage of if it didn't come with brunch.  I'm glad it did!  One of the highlights of the brunch, not to mention the restaurant's namesake.The decor of the restaurant is cozy, brick-exposed and offers a size-able outdoor seating area.  Will definitely have to make a trip back out here when the weather warms up.",4.0

The herb mayo and pop of spice from the jalapenos complemented the duck nicely too. The downside was that there was too much challah bread.

I have been here about 3 times since my last review and I still love it.  We took my super snobby foodie brother in law for his birthday and he loved it.  We also came to Rose Water with another couple for the New Year's Eve Prix Fixe and it was amazing.  We all decided to go with the wine pairing option that came with each course and were thrilled with how perfectly matched each course was (plus it was great not to have to decide on one bottle of wine that everyone would agree on).  And the service was friendly and unpretentious.  I would definitely recommend that you check them out!,5.0
"It was my birthday, and my boyfriend and I, being the newly-arrived-in-Park Slope Omnivore's Dilemma-reading yuppie couple that we are, wanted to try this place's prix fixe menu for dinner.  We expected to be served delicately decorated little plates of delicious seasonal foods and then walk down the hill to Uncle Louie G's for dessert. We had the ""delicious"" part right.  And everything was definitely pretty.  But we were dead wrong about the ""little"" part.  Worst of all, it was all so amazing that I couldn't stop eating.  Seriously, the food was giving me some kind of disorder where I couldn't leave a crumb on the plate - troubling when the portions are as huge as they are here.  An enormous bowl of the best corn chowder I've ever had was followed by an enormous bowl of risotto and an enormous chocolate dessert.  Everything augmented, of course, by an enormous bread basket with local olive oil for dipping.  When there was finally nothing left to eat, we got up and sloshed on home to mid-Slope. I was more than a little ill for the rest of the night.    Happy birthday to me.  We'll be back, of course - just not often enough to make gluttons out of us.",5.0
"Lovely place. I had a great pasta with duck confit. Soup was okay.

The service was okay. The menu not outstanding, but that changes quite often I believe.I'd go back if just for the local food concept, and I want to try dessert - the couple next to me were raving over theirs!",3.0
"For $14 prix fixe brunch I was treated to a full vegetarian plate of 2 poached eggs, kale and cauliflower, and baked goat cheese polenta with an oregano pesto- along with a bottomless cup of coffee (and let me tell you, on this particular morning it was much needed). The polenta was by far the best part - soft but crispy on the bottom. They don't take reservations for brunch, but our group of 5 arrived just before noon and only had to wait about 10 minutes. Basically: great food at a very reasonable price.",5.0
"Had all the makings of a good spot, but wasn't. Strawberry rhubarb juice was like watery guava and as brunch went on I noticed most tables around us left 3/4 full glasses of it on the table. We ordered the starter breakfast bread which was just all right, and the most interesting piece (the strawberry ginger) was so strongly ginger flavored that it tasted medicinal. My dining companion had the frittata which had too much garlic, and I had the fried feta panini which was waaaaay too salty (feta is salty to begin with -- and then they served it on rock salted bread). The fries that came with it had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a long, long time... and they were too salty too. Felt like I'd eaten a rock. The one bright spot was that the hostess and the server were both cheery and pleasant, although service was extremely slow.",2.0
"My bf just bought me the New Brooklyn Cookbook and we have been working our way through the list of featured restaurants. We tried Rose Water during Brooklyn Dine-In week. Very generous prix-fixe options and portions. Nice, low-key vibe (for Park Slope).Pork loin was OK (not a giant fan of sauerkraut with my pork). Very good polenta cake! Very good desserts (chocolate pot de creme & lemon pound cake). Their specialty are little fried goat cheese balls which were very good, lightly fried & served with bitter greens and honey. All in all I would go back for dinner sans prix fixe as they change their menus seasonally and the food was interesting enough to want more.",4.0

"Ive been to Rose Water twice in two years and each time was great.  I cant recall exactly what we ate, because it was a year ago, but I had to review them!The dining room is small but very cozy and the lighting at night is PERFECT for dates, very romantic.  There is also a really nice outdoor seating area in the summer - who doesnt LOVE outdoor seating?  They have a great wine selection and the waitstaff is pleasantly pleasant!  Rose Water encompasses the ""neighborhood restaurant.""I wish I still lived in Brooklyn, New Hampshire needs more restaurants like Rose Water!",5.0
I have been here about 3 times since my last review and I still love it.  We took my super snobby foodie brother in law for his birthday and he loved it.  We also came to Rose Water with another couple for the New Year's Eve Prix Fixe and it was amazing.  We all decided to go with the wine pairing option that came with each course and were thrilled with how perfectly matched each course was (plus it was great not to have to decide on one bottle of wine that everyone would agree on).  And the service was friendly and unpretentious.  I would definitely recommend that you check them out!,5.0
"It was my birthday, and my boyfriend and I, being the newly-arrived-in-Park Slope Omnivore's Dilemma-reading yuppie couple that we are, wanted to try this place's prix fixe menu for dinner.  We expected to be served delicately decorated little plates of delicious seasonal foods and then walk down the hill to Uncle Louie G's for dessert. We had the ""delicious"" part right.  And everything was definitely pretty.  But we were dead wrong about the ""little"" part.  Worst of all, it was all so amazing that I couldn't stop eating.  Seriously, the food was giving me some kind of disorder where I couldn't leave a crumb on the plate - troubling when the portions are as huge as they are here.  An enormous bowl of the best corn chowder I've ever had was followed by an enormous bowl of risotto and an enormous chocolate dessert.  Everything augmented, of course, by an enormous bread basket with local olive oil for dipping.  When there was finally nothing left to eat, we got up and sloshed on home to mid-Slope. I was more than a little ill for the rest of the night.    Happy birthday to me.  We'll be back, of course - just not often enough to make gluttons out of us.",5.0
"Lovely place. I had a great pasta with duck confit. Soup was okay. And astoundingly I was too full for dessert. :( Next time, next time...Small restaurant with a nice atmosphere - saw the chef come out near the end of the night to chat with a table of 4. The service was okay. The menu not outstanding, but that changes quite often I believe.I'd go back if just for the local food concept, and I want to try dessert - the couple next to me were raving over theirs!",3.0
"For $14 prix fixe brunch I was treated to a full vegetarian plate of 2 poached eggs, kale and cauliflower, and baked goat cheese polenta with an oregano pesto- along with a bottomless cup of coffee (and let me tell you, on this particular morning it was much needed). The polenta was by far the best part - soft but crispy on the bottom. They don't take reservations for brunch, but our group of 5 arrived just before noon and only had to wait about 10 minutes. Basically: great food at a very reasonable price.",5.0
"Had all the makings of a good spot, but wasn't. Strawberry rhubarb juice was like watery guava and as brunch went on I noticed most tables around us left 3/4 full glasses of it on the table. We ordered the starter breakfast bread which was just all right, and the most interesting piece (the strawberry ginger) was so strongly ginger flavored that it tasted medicinal. My dining companion had the frittata which had too much garlic, and I had the fried feta panini which was waaaaay too salty (feta is salty to begin with -- and then they served it on rock salted bread). The fries that came with it had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a long, long time... and they were too salty too. Felt like I'd eaten a rock. The one bright spot was that the hostess and the server were both cheery and pleasant, although service was extremely slow.",2.0
"My bf just bought me the New Brooklyn Cookbook and we have been working our way through the list of featured restaurants. We tried Rose Water during Brooklyn Dine-In week. Very generous prix-fixe options and portions. Nice, low-key vibe (for Park Slope).Pork loin was OK (not a giant fan of sauerkraut with my pork). Very good polenta cake! Very good desserts (chocolate pot de creme & lemon pound cake). Their specialty are little fried goat cheese balls which were very good, lightly fried & served with bitter greens and honey. All in all I would go back for dinner sans prix fixe as they change their menus seasonally and the food was interesting enough to want more.",4.0
"I'd heard how great their brunch was and the whole place looked so cozy, that I had to check it out.  But I've now gone twice and I've been disappointed both times.  They use top ingredients and have great, smiling service, but I just don't enjoy their flavor choices.  It's such a cheery place that I wish I liked the rhubarb dish I had the first time and the goat cheese sandwich I had the second time.  I will say, though, that they have some of the best lemonade I've ever tasted, and I can see why their sunny atmosphere would be appealing to anyone who liked their food.",2.0

"More like 3.75 Very inventive take on classics. I went there recently for brunch and I must tell you the descriptions and ingredients reminded me of a IRON CHEF judging table (Drizzles, Ancho Chilli This, Foam this yada yada) Nice fun cozy place worth the try",3.0
"I've been to Rose Water multiple times in recent years, and I usually enjoy my meals but don't go home dreaming about them for weeks and weeks. However, the last time my partner and I went for dinner (earlier this summer), I had a dish that I just can't get out of my mind -- the roast chicken. It was a half chicken, almost entirely deboned, extremely succulent, and the skin - THE SKIN! - was perhaps the best I've ever had on a roast chicken. i suspect they finished it in a skillet on the stovetop, but other than that, I have no clue what they did. Regardless, it was mind-blowing. I don't even remember what sides it came with (though I know they were lovely). The chicken was the star. The fried goat cheese appetizer was also tasty, and I always like their summer salads. I think we may have had a pot de creme, which was also nice. But get the roast chicken, go, get it!",4.0

"The food here is quite good - nothing that will blow your socks off, but everything on the menu is solid. Lamb burger special, cooked medium was delicious. Bloody marys are different (wasabi and sake), but just ok - the service is garbage. also, enjoy a 10 minute wait for the only bathroom.",3.0
"Went here for the first time at the end of the brunch rush last Sunday. The food was ok. Just ok. It's really hard to mess up 3 poached eggs and a couple of strips of bacon, but the eggs were overcooked. Overall the dish was severely under seasoned and I am not one of those people that puts salt and pepper on everything.What was really surprising was the terrible service. The place is tiny and since I enjoy people watching (read: eavesdropping), here's what transpired: a 4-top two tables over was politely asked to leave by the waitress right after paying because ""[they] had people waiting for that table."" Fine, that's kind of rude but ok.  Next, a 3-top next to us discovered what they believed to be hair in the butter. After finally getting the waitress' attention... she brought back new plate of butter... no apologies. The diners got upset, asked to speak to the manager and were given the ""What do you expect, we are busy. Don't you know we serve 250 covers every brunch"" excuse.  They obviously didn't appreciate it and I saw them leave a penny as a tip along with a ""nice"" note written on the back of the check.Our own experience: other than the hit or mostly miss with the food, we literally had to wait for 17 minutes (I timed it) to even ASK for the check. This is after the busboy cleared the table and after the brunch was winding down. Any attempts to make eye contact with the waitress failed as, every time, they strategically disappeared into the back before reaching our table.If it was only my experience, I would dismiss it as a bad day for the wait staff, but seeing and hearing other people's experiences tells me that there's a systemic problem with this restaurant. I'll take my business elsewhere, where they don't run the place like a conveyor belt.",1.0
"This is a must for anyone living in or vying to live in Park Slope. The food is essentially local ingredients and simple dishes that are bursting with flavor.The meal starts with fresh, homemade bread with a delicious olive oil infused in-house.

The dessert was not as strong as I'd hoped, which is why I did not give this place 5 stars. I recommend the carrot cake fritters but the chocolate mousse dish was not so good, in my opinion, because of the orange infusion. I'm not comfortable with the combination of chocolate and orange, personally.Overall, it's a fantastic meal at a place with a cute ambiance. Great for dates or catching up with a friend.",4.0

"It is easy to overlook Rose Water, on the corner of a residential street but you would be wise to stop in. I've been for brunch - which I had no complaints but after dinner, last night, I can say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. As a vegetarian, it is often a struggle to find a solid , delicious entree other than your standard veggie plate. Rose Water has succeeded. The Baked Polenta was absolutely delicious as were the brussel sprouts and chantarelle mushrooms on the side. The staff/service was attentive and personal. I highly recommend and cannot wait to go back.",5.0
"Very small restaurant, so be ready to wait. Went here for brunch for the $14 prix fixe brunch. Staff was very friendly and attentive, constantly filling our water. Worth waiting in line for 30 minutes-- maybe not an hour though.Food was creative-ish. For example, I had the wahoo fish cakes (mixed with fish and potatoes), that came with 2 poached eggs (perfectly poached), a bitter salad with sweet salad dressing (great combo) and then a home made blueberry bread (not overly sweet). I feel like I had a sampler for brunch! Very good. My friend had the duck confit that came with cucumbers, guac, and a side of fries-- but the dressing for the fries was like tomatoe/carrot based puree? Didnt bother asking for  ketchup, it was good! We also shared a side of slow cooked pork (we both wanted the pork sandwich on top of our main meal, so we opted for a side dish instead). Id get the sandwich next time for the full impact. Next time, Im definitely trying one of their sweet dishes-- the pancake looked amazing!",4.0
"Rose Water calls you from the street with its verdant porch as if it were some kind of urban oasis. On any given Sunday you're likely to wait 30 minutes to an hour for a table (they don't take brunch reservations). In a small annoyance, they don't take phone numbers so you're made to stand out front, though the time is easily spent hemming and hawing over the enticing menu. The restaurant is cozy, if not a bit cramped in areas. The decor is simple, light and bright. Brunch is a prix fixe menu with $14 including an entrée and non-boozy drink, which is not a bad price. The menu changes frequently to offer the best seasonal fare. The loose teas were really nice and the cucumber water was pretty much incredible. The smoked bass cake with poached eggs was straight up delicious, though a bit heavier than expected. Aioli was a perfect addition.  The plum crepes were scrumptious. It left me a happy fatty.  The service, however, did not leave me as so happy a fatty. Everything from ordering to drinks to food went really slowly and some requests were forgotten entirely.",4.0
"When my friend suggested we stay in Brooklyn for my birthday dinner I was at first apprehensive. She named Rose water and I went with no great expectations. However, I was blown away!!!!The patio area is very charming with potting plants blocking the street, and the interior is ever so New York with exposed brick and candles illuminating the quaint artwork and simple tables. Another perk of the restaurant is the kitchen is completely visible, which is always nice in a restaurant.We went for the market prix-fixe for $26, I also enjoyed the wine pairing which was only an additional $14, for all 3 courses. Which in Manhattan $14 would only get you an overpriced, fancy named martini.I enjoyed the strawberry and frisee salad. The portions were large, with big mounds of blue cheese and fresh strawberries. For my entree I had the Seared Fluke, it was served with a puree of peas and mushrooms and it was delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection and was the freshest fish I have enjoyed in a while. My roommate had the baked polenta, which was served with goat cheese and seasonal vegetables, it was an A+. The wine pairings that went along with the meal were divine, expertly paired. We both had the chocolate pana-cota for dessert and it was a perfect way to end a superb meal!!!The only negatives I have was that the server took a while to take our orders, which maybe just the charm of the Brooklyn lifestyle. And my wine glasses had a bit of towel or dust residue on the rim but nothing i couldn't remedy on my own.Overall it was a lovely evening, and I cannot wait to go bacK!!!!",5.0
"I love this place, I really, really do. The food is delicious, I've never had a soup I've anything less than loved. The spring onion I had recently was probably the best soup I've ever had in my life. The service is great, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the $26 3-course deal on weeknights is a really good deal. And I love that they get less well-known wines. I've never been for brunch but that's the next thing I need to try.",5.0
"Went for brunch and had a very fine time. It was noon on Saturday so there was hardly any wait for three people, and I absolutely loved the cosy space. The service was attentive and helpful, and fantastic given the crowd.As for the food, it was plenty tasty but nothing really wowed me. A fried butternut squash sandwich is an interesting idea, but I could hardly taste the squash it was so thin! And honestly I don't think the cornmeal breading really added. After all, most of the crunch will be coming from the bread in any event. The french fries were very tasty, though they could have been a little crisper. And I got the cold apple cider, which I was absolutely not expecting to have nearly as much cinnamon as it did...but it was decent all the same.Maybe next time I'll try the french toast, which looked delicious going by the table.",3.0
"For those willing to make the hike to BK, Rose Water is definitely worth the trip.  Rose Water has a nice, cozy atmosphere with the option of sitting outside.  They have a DELICIOUS farm to table menu with seasonal ingredients and dishes.  We definitely recommend that you take your date here, split a bottle of wine and enjoy some great food on the main drag in Park Slope. @datenitenyc",5.0

"delicious Delicious food. Went for brunch yesterday and it was worth the wait. Was given the complimentary bread for the four of us for waiting so long.. and the organic eggs were just so creamy and bright yellow and wonderful. I had the sweet potato hash with the fried egg special over kale  which seemed like an amazing balance of healthy eating and savory eating, and the warm spiced apple cider. It was a food experience indeed as every taste was of fresh ingredients.. I have nothing bad to say about the service. Everyone was very nice to us. Will definitely return to try their dinner specials.",5.0
"It is easy to overlook Rose Water, on the corner of a residential street but you would be wise to stop in. I've been for brunch - which I had no complaints but after dinner, last night, I can say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. As a vegetarian, it is often a struggle to find a solid , delicious entree other than your standard veggie plate. Rose Water has succeeded. The Baked Polenta was absolutely delicious as were the brussel sprouts and chantarelle mushrooms on the side. The staff/service was attentive and personal. I highly recommend and cannot wait to go back.",5.0
"Very small restaurant, so be ready to wait. Went here for brunch for the $14 prix fixe brunch. Staff was very friendly and attentive, constantly filling our water. Worth waiting in line for 30 minutes-- maybe not an hour though.Food was creative-ish. For example, I had the wahoo fish cakes (mixed with fish and potatoes), that came with 2 poached eggs (perfectly poached), a bitter salad with sweet salad dressing (great combo) and then a home made blueberry bread (not overly sweet). I feel like I had a sampler for brunch! Very good. My friend had the duck confit that came with cucumbers, guac, and a side of fries-- but the dressing for the fries was like tomatoe/carrot based puree? Didnt bother asking for  ketchup, it was good! We also shared a side of slow cooked pork (we both wanted the pork sandwich on top of our main meal, so we opted for a side dish instead). Id get the sandwich next time for the full impact. Next time, Im definitely trying one of their sweet dishes-- the pancake looked amazing!",4.0
"Rose Water calls you from the street with its verdant porch as if it were some kind of urban oasis. On any given Sunday you're likely to wait 30 minutes to an hour for a table (they don't take brunch reservations). In a small annoyance, they don't take phone numbers so you're made to stand out front, though the time is easily spent hemming and hawing over the enticing menu. The restaurant is cozy, if not a bit cramped in areas. The decor is simple, light and bright. Brunch is a prix fixe menu with $14 including an entrée and non-boozy drink, which is not a bad price. The menu changes frequently to offer the best seasonal fare. The loose teas were really nice and the cucumber water was pretty much incredible. The smoked bass cake with poached eggs was straight up delicious, though a bit heavier than expected. Aioli was a perfect addition.  The plum crepes were scrumptious. It left me a happy fatty.  The service, however, did not leave me as so happy a fatty. Everything from ordering to drinks to food went really slowly and some requests were forgotten entirely.",4.0

"This place has a very upscale, gourmet menu with a cozy neighborhood feel.

The fresh peas tasted like spring blossoming in my mouth. Overall, the menu is organic, new american with some abnormal dishes like pork belly. Service was great - very helpful and friendly.

"Brunch is possibly my favorite meal. Meaning, I've tested and tasted a lot of brunches in NYC. This being said, although I love brunch food, I'm often quite disappointed with the lack of variety and originality of brunch menus. Omelets, Benedicts, burgers... as good as it gets, it turns out boring at a certain point, especially when it feels that you can't order and eat anything new.Which is why I love, love Rose Water. For the first time in a very long time, I can say that brunch food blew my mind. Dishes are simple but full of flavor, food is original without being too sophisiticated or fancy, ingredients are very fresh, and portions filling. My boyfriend and I got the vegeterian baked polenta with goat cheese and the daily special, duck confit hash with eggs. - The polenta came with veggies, mushrooms, and poached eggs, and was topped with oregano pesto and crumbled goat cheese. It was delicious... So good I couldn't stop eating it. And bf with whom I was supposed to share got really anxious he wouldn't even get a bite. We ordered a side of bacon to go with it (I just can't order vegeterian dishes, it goes against my meat-lover principles!), and it paired really really well. The salty crispy bacon added a nice touch to the soft on the inside but crispy on the outside polenta, and the marriage between both the bacon and oregano flavors was amazing.- The duck confit hash was also excellent. It wasn't dry at all, as it's sometimes the case, very subtle and tasty with some caramelized peppers and tomatoes. It was topped with two sunny-side up eggs and came with a small salad and roasted potatoes. Flavor wasn't as intense as for the polenta dish, but since I started with the duck, it was just perfect. I can't say which one I loved best, I could have eaten both (and wanted to do it really badly, but bf was there to remind me that we were supposed to share).We weren't supposed to order dessert since we had a very filling breakfast in the morning made of home-made lemon and raisins scones with home-made raspberry butter cream and jam. But we couldn't resist to the buttery apple and walnut pancake. Pancake was warm and fluffy, with the melting lemon butter and syrup it was to die-for! What was really disappointing though was the ginger and pear juice. I wouldn't recomment it, it was very watery, sugary and didn't taste like pear at all. Go for the regular fresh squeezed orange-juice that's included in the prix-fixe instead. Prices are very reasonable ($14 for the prix-fixe menu and $16 for the daily specials). Atmosphere is cozy and charming, even if the interior and decoration are nothing to be remembered. But again, you come for the food! Service was impeccable and performed by a very nice and friendly staff. And rare enough to be noticed when it comes to popular brunch places, we were seated almost right away (without a reservation).I probably could have skipped all of the above by just saying BEST BRUNCH I'VE HAD IN NYC (and believe me, I have a nice benchmark).",5.0
"i came twice in less than a week, once for dinner, once for brunch. this place is right next to my friend's place in brooklyn, and what a great restaurant she has nearby. this place is AWESOME, in both dinner and brunch. for dinner i had the prix fix menu which consisted of turnip soup as the first course. it was just the right amount of creamy, and fantastic when coupled with their soft bread. i did envy the other first course option, the salad, that looked just as yummy. the entree was a shrimp risotto rich with the taste of parmesan. we finished with an apple cake. the apple was mounted on a cornbread, and ice cream was on the apple. it was my favorite dish of the night. they have brunch with a great deal - $14 for an entree and any beverage. i had the frittata. it was slightly mild in taste, but nonetheless tasted fresh and organic as they promised. highly recommend the hot apply cider in the mornings. kudos to the manager who seated us. i had complained that it was cold that morning. he sat us down next to a window that was open, but closed it to block the wind from blowing at us. very considerate of him.",5.0

"Checked this place out for brunch on the sweltering day of July 8th.  We didn't make a prior reservation, so our wait was 15 minutes (for two).  Rather than bake in the sun and find some reason to complain, we walked over across the street to kill time at the Union Market.  If one tries the Small Tilefish Cake dish as I did that day, it may be hit-or-miss; for you may find that the fishcake itself can use a little bit more kick when it comes to a certain kind of aromatic spice.  The Fennel Red Leaf Salad and poached egg were the perfect complement to the cakes...yummy.  The Strawberry Rhubarb juice can be a tough call as well, since rhubarb can taste a bit too tart and it doesn't really add enough sweetness to balance the strawberry unless the strawberries are in season...maybe a little honey could help during the hot summer unseasonal.  Having said that, I can certainly see myself enjoying brunch there once more...just to sample the colorful array of choices.Our waiter was quite accommodating so no complaints there.Needless to say, this is a rather charming place jewel in the Park Slope area...the outdoor seating area is intimate and somewhat concealed by the draping plants.I have yet to give dinner a shot, but maybe when I get back in neighborhood again.  We'll soon see.",3.0
"My significant other and I eat here a lot. In fact, this our go-to place whenever we need a good meal. The atmosphere is great - romantic without being stuff, and cozy without being tight. I liken it to being in a french country cottage, all it needs is a fireplace at night. The staff are also totally wonderful and are one of the reasons (besides the food) that  we keep coming back.Having dined there extensively, we love discovering the way the chef adapts the menu to accommodate fresh seasonal ingredients into his food. The food is thoughtful and well-executed, the portions substantial. And the deserts..mmn...incredible! We've also been pretty happy with their wine selection in general, although to be honest, we haven't really ventured far from the staff's recommendations. The Mon-Thur prix fixe is not only an excellent value, it is always cooked perfectly and not just an afterthought, which I find to be the case in many other establishments.In fact, the only reason we don't give it 5 stars is because I think their brunches could be a little better!

"To be fair, I have only been to Rose Water once, and this experience was well over one year ago.  So, the information that follows may or may not be reflective of the restaurant now, but this was my experience:I was excited to find a restaurant in Park Slope that reflects my beliefs of organic, local food, cooked with care for a limited number of tables.  That often produces the best and most honest food, and that's admirable.However, I can still remember what I ate - braised pork belly, which was truly awful.  Our food arrived at room temperature, and my impression was that the people cooking the menu were fresh out of cooking school.  That means while the food COULD have been good, inexperience was the kitchen's dominant flaw.  Perhaps this has changed.  But after spending $100 on a most mediocre meal, I'm not willing to find out.",2.0

"A truly organic restaurant.  All their menu items are purchased from the local, regional and/or organic farmers and they only serve what is currently in season, so it's not hard to imagine the quality of the food - fresh, tasty and inventive!  It's your typical brunch fare in that they have egg dishes, pancakes, French toast, and sandwiches, but atypical in some of the ingredients they use, definitely worth a try.  At $14 fixed price for an entrée and beverage, it is worth a try!",4.0

"Checked this place out for brunch on the sweltering day of July 8th.  We didn't make a prior reservation, so our wait was 15 minutes (for two).  Rather than bake in the sun and find some reason to complain, we walked over across the street to kill time at the Union Market.  If one tries the Small Tilefish Cake dish as I did that day, it may be hit-or-miss; for you may find that the fishcake itself can use a little bit more kick when it comes to a certain kind of aromatic spice.  The Fennel Red Leaf Salad and poached egg were the perfect complement to the cakes...yummy.  The Strawberry Rhubarb juice can be a tough call as well, since rhubarb can taste a bit too tart and it doesn't really add enough sweetness to balance the strawberry unless the strawberries are in season...maybe a little honey could help during the hot summer unseasonal.  Having said that, I can certainly see myself enjoying brunch there once more...just to sample the colorful array of choices.Our waiter was quite accommodating so no complaints there.Needless to say, this is a rather charming place jewel in the Park Slope area...the outdoor seating area is intimate and somewhat concealed by the draping plants.I have yet to give dinner a shot, but maybe when I get back in neighborhood again.  We'll soon see.",3.0
"My significant other and I eat here a lot. In fact, this our go-to place whenever we need a good meal. The atmosphere is great - romantic without being stuff, and cozy without being tight. I liken it to being in a french country cottage, all it needs is a fireplace at night. The staff are also totally wonderful and are one of the reasons (besides the food) that  we keep coming back.Having dined there extensively, we love discovering the way the chef adapts the menu to accommodate fresh seasonal ingredients into his food. The food is thoughtful and well-executed, the portions substantial. And the deserts..mmn...incredible! We've also been pretty happy with their wine selection in general, although to be honest, we haven't really ventured far from the staff's recommendations. The Mon-Thur prix fixe is not only an excellent value, it is always cooked perfectly and not just an afterthought, which I find to be the case in many other establishments.In fact, the only reason we don't give it 5 stars is because I think their brunches could be a little better! But only a little better, because that's pretty good too!",4.0
"To be fair, I have only been to Rose Water once, and this experience was well over one year ago.  So, the information that follows may or may not be reflective of the restaurant now, but this was my experience:I was excited to find a restaurant in Park Slope that reflects my beliefs of organic, local food, cooked with care for a limited number of tables.  That often produces the best and most honest food, and that's admirable.However, I can still remember what I ate - braised pork belly, which was truly awful.  Our food arrived at room temperature, and my impression was that the people cooking the menu were fresh out of cooking school.  That means while the food COULD have been good, inexperience was the kitchen's dominant flaw.  Perhaps this has changed.  But after spending $100 on a most mediocre meal, I'm not willing to find out.",2.0
I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. I was there a few minutes before they opened and I'm glad because it filled up very quickly. The brunch menu wasn't very extensive but that was okay because it's all very good. I will definitely go back for dinner some time.,4.0
"Ate brunch here for first time in yrs and was really glad I went back. I had one of the specials which was sweet potato latkes with some kind of pesto(?), kale & poached eggs and it was really amazing (and popular; I apparently got the last one)...just a great combination of ingredients. Our table split an order of the apple pancakes too...I def left happy.",4.0
"They really listen to  diet-challenged diners, like my sister in law who has wheat, vinegar, dairy, and who knows what else stomach issues.

The salad was great too - market greens, thin sliced daikon radish, strawberries, and macadamia nuts. Now that's what I call service.",5.0
"A truly organic restaurant.  All their menu items are purchased from the local, regional and/or organic farmers and they only serve what is currently in season, so it's not hard to imagine the quality of the food - fresh, tasty and inventive!  It's your typical brunch fare in that they have egg dishes, pancakes, French toast, and sandwiches, but atypical in some of the ingredients they use, definitely worth a try.  At $14 fixed price for an entrée and beverage, it is worth a try!",4.0
"We went there for brunch and I have to say I don't understand the high ratings for this restaurant. Yes, it's cute inside and the waiters are rather friendly, but the food didn't do it for me.

You always have to wait for a table and they don't serve soy milk otherwise I'd give them five stars.",4.0
"A bit too frou frou and expensive for my taste. I had some cocoa glazed duck when I went last and it was the first time in my entire life I haven't enjoyed duck (and I friggin love duck!). The sides were pretty delicious however, and I did enjoy the cheese platter. The place itself is cozy but a bit cramped...not one of my faves, to be honest.",3.0
"Ate there one early evening. Superb food, starting with the focaccia and oil, then beet salad, merguez sausage, superb chicken with lemon zest and smoked lamb, followed by cherry fritters. Had to ask three people for the source of the name,but clearly the North African or Mediterranean influence is here. Service very professional and brisk. Will return.",4.0
"I keep going all the way from Manhattan to Brooklyn just for their brunch. The food is fantastic (especially the cod and eggs and the bread plate!) and its really reasonably priced. They make the bloody mary mix fresh as well and its delicious. There is often a wait, especially when the weather is nice, but worth it.",5.0
The food is usually good. It seems like this place has become too popular for its own good -- the waiters seem to feel that they are doing you a favor.,3.0
"I've been there for brunch 3 times.  The law of diminishing returns has reared its nasty head.  This time I got the curried chicken sandwich, which is served in a pocket pita.  When have you ever had a a sandwich in a pocket pita that was actually worth your stomach real estate?  They're always dry, leathery, and hard.  If you're lucky, they don't break, thus completely defeating the purpose of the pocket concept.  It's all the more regrettable when you consider the fact that Rose Water has fresh focaccia .  What else can I say?  The fries were a little undercooked, my girlfriend's frittata was a little overcooked, and my request for extra ketchup had to be made twice.  I think the pancakes are pretty solid, especially if you get them as the $6 side instead of the $14 brunch.   Before today's visit, I would have argued that Rose Water is a diamond in the rough in terms of Park Slope brunches.  No free mimosas, but definitely quality grub.  However, today's mediocrity has spurred me to continue searching for something better.",3.0
"only here for brunch. love the prix fixe... staff was attentive, if slightly self conscious brooklyn hipsters. (ok, sorry, all of brooklyn is staffed with brooklyn hipsters and everyone wears their hair the same way and i find it a little ridiculous). the food was creative-ish and well executed. really fresh ingredients! almost californian :)",4.0
"The owner of this place is the sweetest person in the world with two adorable children. That being said their food is great! Their soups are amazing, the corn chowder is the best I've ever had. The scene is also great, cozy and lively without being overly ""hip"".",4.0
"My whole family loves this place!  It's location kind of sucks, but it works out well for me since I live a block away.  I have only been for dinner, but I have loved it every time!  Service is great, I love the risotto and the scallops.  I wish they had a bigger menu, but the have perfected everything that is on their menu!",5.0
"been here a bunch of times, and they are pretty consistent and solid.  the food is very good, and just unique enough to be interesting w/o getting to weird.  the organic/locavore angle is a big plus to my wife (I'm a cheapo and will eat that if it doesn't cost too much more).  oh, that pear/ginger juice is sublime.  i just need to figure out how to make it, and then put vodka in it for the summer.",4.0
We're almost ready to never make brunch at home again after finding Rose Water.  They have a lot of vegetarian options and change their menu periodically.  Not only is the good delicious but the decor has a way of making you feel relaxed.  Try the cucumber mint juice and the rose water lemonade.,5.0
"Rose Water is one of ""those"" restaurants... the supporter of locally grown produce, a restaurant for the people. I was intrigued having never been to one of these types before. As we walked up to the restaurant I kind of felt like I was walking up to a produce market. There was nothing remarkable about the exterior even with the nice little patio-like seating out in front. Inside was more interesting. It was decorated with a living room feel down to the bookshelves along the wall. My biggest complaint has to be the size of the tables. They were just too small and the waitress had trouble even finding room for our glasses of water. The menus arrived on wooden boards (a nice touch). We tried the mezze with three dips (not terribly impressive). I've had better. Also we tried the Grilled Calamari with eggplant caviar, cranberry beans, and chorizo, which was very unique and interesting. A non-fried calamari option was welcoming. Dinner consisted of the wild striped bass (good fats) while I also got a taste of the duck breast. Both were very good. The wine selection was another place that could have used some work. There just wasn't very much selection by the glass or much selection in general. Aside from the calamari, nothing really blew me away here.",3.0
"After reading so may adoring reviews, I had to check this place out. My girlfriend and I went yesterday for brunch, and we cant stop telling our friends about it. The dishes were well thought out, creative, and perfectly executed. We go out to brunch a fair amount, and I came to Rose Water with very high expectations based on the reviews. I had one of the specials; two corn pancakes topped with poaches eggs, feta, greens, and a tomatillo sauce. It was unreal. My GF had the strawberry panckakes with cardamom butter and pistachios. She couldn't have been happier with her choice. This is now our new place to take visiting family and out-of -towners. Just plain great.",5.0
"The experience at RW is nothing short of wondrous.  Their standard menus for brunch and dinner are eclectic and, with their culinary wizardry, thoroughly delicious.  The savory appetizers and main courses, with the fresh ingredients mixed together by their master chef, will leave your mouth wishing you could  move into the kitchen...to live.  They also have special dining events that I am rather reluctant to discuss b/c they sell out so quickly:  Crab Boil, Smoked Feast and the famous ( and infamous) Porkapalooza, to name just a few.  John et. al. are courteous and set you up right.  The wines selection?  Just leave it to John to make the pick...you just won't go wrong. The Tasting Menu is excellent, especially with the parings.  I try to dine there as often as I can...Thanksgiving with family and friends tat RW is spectacular.  My only regret is they're not open on Christmas Eve...but...for New Year's Eve...there is no better place to dine.",5.0
"i've only eaten dinner here a couple of times because it's too expensive for my meager budget, but the food was always delicious.  and, the good news is that they offer an excellent brunch: $13 prix fixe, which gives you an entree and a beverage.  the pulled pork sandwich is as good as it is messy (meaning extremely so), and the smoked monkfish hash served with poached eggs is amazing.  i was a little underwhelmed by the peach ginger waffle but maybe that's just me.  prepare to wait for a table, and for your coffee refills, but otherwise the service is consistently good.",4.0
"The food here is in a sort of under-cooked, self-consciously ""organic"" vibe. Super chewy farro, some things had a sort of herbal tea taste. Not pleasurable for me or my wife, and at a pretty high price.",2.0
"this is one of my favorite places in brooklyn.  everything from the cheese plate to the pork chop to the dessert is wonderful.  i think the thing that i love the most here is that the staff really knows their stuff.  they don't just recommend the most expensive bottle of wine, they listen to your preferences and will have a full on conversation about the subtle nuances of why a certain wine will fulfill all of your needs.  this never fails to impress me in the usual rush-rush world of nyc dining.  my sister is a chef and we go here every time she is in town and just luxuriate over a nice long meal in their adorable dining room or weather permitting their little sidewalk cafe.  the owners are the nicest people too.  a wonderful experience start to finish.",5.0
