"This place is a gem in the middle of a very changed Greenpoint.  I remember when Greenpoint used to be all Polish stores and bodegas, and now...it's..cringe..hip.  Still, I'm happy we stumbled upon this place thanks to my yelp guidance.My group and I came here after an Isles game at Barclays, since it's not far off the highway. We weren't starving, but we wanted a snack and sit down/unwinding time.  We came in at 5pm, when they opened (Saturday), and it was automatically buzzing with people from 5:01. Great sign.We sat at the long hightop which is a nice feature. Happy hour specials were happening, beer, wine, sangria included.  We had a bunch of different tapas, all traditional Spanish cuisine. Everything was SO tasty!! We had:+Selecció de formatges (cheese plate)--comes with crackers and apples. The highlight was the Manchego cheese (from La Mancha region), and our waitress was from La Mancha as well!  She really knew her stuff.+Selecció d'embutits (Spanish cold cuts)+Pebrots shishito (grilled soshito peppers)+ Croquettes with ham inside (SO yummy!)+ Gaspatxo de temporada (Seasonal veggie soup)--this one was beet based+ Fried Green Tomatoes (forgot the name on the menu!) which I took a chance by ordering, having never had them before, they were delish!I definitely recommend. Great date spot or place to catch up with someone!",5.0
"I haven't had a full meal at El Born, just a drink and a snack. The space itself is a little tight, but the decor that strikes a good balance between quaint and minimalist so you don't feel too overcrowded. They were clearly still in transition between brunch and dinner but a server let me know what the kitchen could do, and I jumped at the chance to order some Boquerones. My food arrived quickly. Three simply-seasoned, plump anchovy fillets on a nice thick piece of bread. Every ingredient was good quality and made for a tasty mouthful. My drink (Gintonic #5) was extremely strong, with alcohol and citrus battling for dominance. To be honest it was a bit difficult to finish, but I suspect that more tapas would have solved that problem. Unfortunately I didn't have time to order a second plate. But if you want to get your money's worth in gin, count this as a plus.",3.0
"Went here on a Friday night for dinner with the lady and was generally pleased with my experience. We sat at a 2-top across from the bar in a surprisingly pretty empty place. We ordered some drinks - my girlfriend had the sangria and I had one of the 'gintonics' which was pretty good, but for being their house drink, I would have expected a bit more. For tapas, we ordered the charcuterie plate, patatas bravas, cauliflower, carpaccio, cod, and wild boar which was just too much food for 2 people, but we wanted to try new things! Our favorites were definitely the patatas, cod, and boar. The cauliflower notable, but also notably lacking something. The charcuterie was also very good, but you cant really judge a place on their cheese plate! Or can you? Anyway... The bechamel on the patatas combined with the tangy spicy tomato sauce provided for a very balanced dish with just the right amount of richness. I would have liked the potatoes to be a little more crispy, but the softness didnt ruin the dish. The cod was perfectly cooked so that it was not too soft and still maintained its shape, and the garbanzo beans served on it gave each bite a very dynamic texture in each bite. The wild boar came out last, and I wish it hadn't because we were so full by that time. That being said, it was still a very enjoyable dish. It almost reminded me of a single layer lasagna. The filling was packed with just bigger than bite size chunks of boar in a smooth low key brown gravy, as to not overpower the taste of the boar. On top, the 'freestyle' pasta was basically just a lasagna shell, but supposedly hand made. I recall it being a bit tough, but had a full taste. Topped with cheese, the boar dish was overall on the rich side, but a must-have nonetheless.The service was a bit lacking, as I had to wait quite some time for my second drink, then to find out it was forgotten, and then it happened to my girlfriend as well. But, then again, the drinks weren't that great as well, so I guess it let me focus on the real star of the show here, the food.",4.0
"Stumbled upon this place with a friend and I'm happy I did!We got the fish sandwich and meat paella. The paella takes about 20 min., which is normal, but it is totally worth the little extra wait. The brunch portion was a generous portion and was absolutely delicious. The meats were juicy and the chicken tender, but my favorite part was the chewy rice! The fish sandwich was simple, had great crisp, and bomb flavors! Highly recommended",4.0
Very good Spanish restaurant which Catalan influence. The chef is from Madrid and the food is excellent. We had the octopus (so tender) and the calamari sandwich (calamari was ever so lightly breaded) which had the most tasty squid ink spread and came with a salad and fries.Ambiance was also quite nice.We'll definitely be back!,5.0
"Two friends and I came in around 5 PM for an early dinner. This was recommended to me by friends who live just up the street. We started with a board of some spicy chorizo, thin slices of iberico, and olives. Then we orderd the octopus, and a tuna belly seared and over some confit potatoes. The pulpo was cooked tender and not rubbery. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was  surprisingly light, refreshing and not overly sweet, so all in all we had a wonderful little meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and we all got out of there spending around $35. Would definitely come back here for a pre-dinner bite.",4.0
"I came here on a Monday, so wine bottles over 49 dollars were half off - yay! It is nice to come with a group of three or four, as everyone can have a bite of lots of different tapas. If you have more in your party than 4, I would order more than one of each dish so that you have enough. They brought up bread with a delicious and refreshing tomato paste on it (pan tomate), which was a great way to start the meal. We had the shisito peppers, beef carpaccio, croquette of the day, tuna belly and olives. The tapas were excellent - they tasted clean and fresh. We also got the paella for 3, as the fourth person in our party wasn't sure they would like it. It was more than enough with the other small plates. We tried the squid ink version. It was good but a bit salty (I mean, it IS squid ink) and I felt the seafood taste overpowered the dish. There were mussels, clams and calamari. The white fish was basa, and while it was tasty, I wish they didn't use the cheapest white fish. I guess it is more sustainable than cod. It was not bad by any means, I just wasn't blown away. I will try a more traditional flavor next time, as I missed the saffron goodness or stick with tapas.You should definitely try this little gem out, the service was great and we had a really nice time.",4.0
"I ordered delivery. At first I was skeptical. I thought I was gonna be disappointed but o was pleasantly surprised. It was really good!  And it arrived warm even though it was like 10 degrees out. I ordered the Braves El Born (my favorite now), Cols Amb Pernil and Costelles de Porc (both pretty good). And had left overs. Will order again. The way they packaged items was great too, arrived neat and everything in place, not messy at all. Definitely recommend.",5.0
"The neighborhood of El Born is my favorite thing about Barcelona so I had to try this place. It was cute, friendly staff, pretty good food. The potatoes bravas and cheese plate were really good, but I would skip the chorizo dumplings. Monday's they have half off bottles of wine and Thursday's are buy one get one free gin and tonics (weird choice for a Spanish place but no complaints here).",4.0
"My husband and I wandered in here for brunch on the Sunday of the storm in January.  What a great find!  I thoroughly enjoyed my smashed eggs and my husband gave the thumbs up to his omelette.  The atmosphere was excellent (we sat at the bar) and the place filled up quickly.  I enjoyed my sangria while we had a great visit with the owner's husband who came in to help out because of the storm.  We'll definitely return.  They offer different specials every night of the week, with Wednesday featuring Flamenco guitar which we're both excited to take in.I can highly recommend this place.",5.0
"Cute little Spanish Tapas restaurant with a romantic backyard. Unassuming and inviting from the main street, you pass through the restaurant and pleasantly surprised by the secret garden-esque backyard.

We had a bottle of their house red, which was also (most surprisingly) excellent. 6 stars for the service. P.S. I also recently dined at Casa Mono, but I definitely prefer El Born.",5.0
"Came here with a Pulsd deal but even without it, you can still get the same deal for brunch. My boyfriend and I had the 5 minute eggs and the burger of the day, which was fish.

"Came here on a Thursday night using a gilt deal I had purchased for a paella dinner with 1 bottle of wine and dessert.  The restaurant was a bit empty on the inside because most of the patrons were dining outside.  We opted to dine outside, but later moved in because of the mosquitoes. The inside is nice, and my favorite are the wooden barstools. It was a rather warm evening and I dont believe there was any AC.While our server was nice, we were notified that there was a misprint in our gilt deal and our wine selection would be more limited and had to be under $35 though the deal printed read under $40.  We tried the cod fish with raisins, potatoes and baby pork belly to start and it was tasty. The fish paella was impressively sized, and had generous portions of fish, calamari and octopus.  The dessert however, crema catalana, one of my favorites, was a bit too sweet.Overall, this is a decent restaurant, we had some issues in attempts to confirm that the fish paella was absent of any shellfish, but had a nice meal.",3.0
"People literally need to chill out with the hype of any new restaurants in bk. Seriously. Fucking tricks me everytime.This place is fine. It's not good, not bad, just fine.But I can confidently say that their tapas or paella isn't strong enough for me to ever go back though. I mean if you've ever been to old school NYC Spanish restaurants like Sevilla and Spain, this place isn't really a 'Spanish restaurant', it is a bar / restaurant  ( their drinks are good) Especially knowing greenpoint /wb has so many tapas place that are just way better for much better quality/price.The infamous potatoes were soggy and oily, tuna belly is FULLY COOKED and so dry without any hint of salt in the meat ( absolutely their weakest dish), oxtail was PICKED OFF of the bones to only be sandwiched between toasted hot dog buns ( why would anyone pick the meat off oxtail when eating the bones is the best part? Where is the texture? ) pork ribs were just blobs of fat in really bad sauce with semi raw random stupid veggie chunks, and the beef carpaccio is just the most simple dish since the ingredient speaks for itself so it was not bad - but the sauces and ingredients they used..duck drowning in Worcestershire sauce with absolutely overcooked orzo, again the oxtail with hotdog buns..what the hell CUISINE is this? Isn't this a little bit more of a 'new American' than 'Spanish?'And the portions are way too small. People who say they're big, I'm  very confused about why they may think so. I actually thought their portion size was OUTRAGEOUS. When you start a new restaurant, you can't be stingy with the portions, I was very surprised by their choice. I mean believe me, I don't ever want to see Cheesecake Factory portions anywhere and that's not what I expect. But since the quality of the dishes aren't so high, why not compete with another thing? Compete with your 'generosity' ( add a shrimp or two in the paella or a lobster lol. For $30 something per person, you'll be ok) To be honest. I understand you're in greenpoint and you're supposed to be as hip as possible, but 'hip Spanish' restaurant just isn't a strong enough idea. I go to Spanish restaurants for their insanely sweet sangria in giant jugs and to eat paella with overwhelming amount of seafood on top. For example 'Spain' is far from being a great Spanish authentic restaurant but the atmosphere and the experience is something very special, special enough to go back. This place though... looked exactly like every other bar in bk with a confusing menu, then paella..idk. I mean, We got duck, pork, oxtail, 2 potatoes sides, tuna belly, beef carpaccio, and squid ink paella for 4 ppl. Would have gotten more but we felt crazy ordering MORE than what we did and to wait longer so we ended it there. For $300 for 4 is very very fair, but for how much we ate..Especially the lack of seafood in their paella..that was strange. I was so surprised by that. Their squid ink paella is not bad though, perfectly cooked rice with the basic seafood but it's nothing special. I'v gotten paella so often to assume that what they give you here is almost laughable. (Taste, quality and portion wise)P.s And the foreign lady waitress! Please chill with  the most aggressive 'do you want another drink'. As soon as I'm done. And stop asking me after i tell you 'I'm all set for now'. I think she asked us maybe 7-8 times.",3.0

"Now I decided to update my review after a letter from the ""person in charge "". She indicated to me several things in her message that prompted me to update1. "" Person in charge"" stated  my review was not fair as I had not actually tried the food and while she apologized for the service indicated she trust her staff ( to me an insinuation that there is no way service was less then up to par.) She also said "" I assumed you looked online and saw our style of brunch""Reviews on any and all establishments should be based on one's own experience, as mine was based on my experience. Therefore if I choose to express my satisfaction with 2 stars and I had the option to select more, that is MY interpretation of your establishment and the service.No I did not see the menu as it was NOT my event and I was a guest invited to celebrate a birthday ( meaning I had no choice in the menu. I attended to support my friend and THEIR choice in dinning, trust I would NOT have attended on any other occasion solely based on the brunch menu.)2. ""Person in charge"" also indicated that there was a sangria option that was unlimited. Also naming off other food options that where not pork/ ham which consisted of ""Braves El Born, Cheese plate, Kale Salad, Tuna Salad, Spanish Omelette, Kale Omelette, Burger El Born ( which was beef on Sunday), Calamari Sandwich, Seafood Paella, Veggies Paella.""I refer back to my previous review and statement. And will say there were a few more options than previously listed. While none of these still sparked ANY interest.In closing I would like to say this, ""person in charge"" seemed very passionate about the restaurant and the food service even welcoming me back offering a free drink.Here is my suggestion to you:1. Don't make a habit out of sending Yelp messages like the one you sent me, it lacks professionalism and serves to incite further negative reviews, be it online or word of mouth. Even it you try and end it apologetically with a free drink. 2. Don't assume because I wrote the review I made the reservation, or that anyone will already know your menu. Yes being knowledgeable before going to a restaurant is good and will likely provide a better experience, but what about the people who randomly stop by knowing nothing about your food? Or like in my case are invited to an event at your establishment?3. Lastly, and most importantly it is up to you and your staff to sale your food and restaurant. Meaning, if you have guest that are not familiar with your style of food (as most of the guest aside from the guest of honor were) convince us to stay! That doesn't require begging or demeaning oneself either. That can be something as simple as ""you don't like pork/ham try the kale salads it's amazing and it's goes great with the Sangria! And if you love the Sangria, which you will, for only 15.99 it's unlimited!""What your servers did was mumble and run back and forth to the kitchen to ask question because they were not knowledge about the food, and then just keep asking, "" So are you ready to order?!?""I hope my update better helps ""person in charge"" to understand my review.Good day.",1.0
"Do Spanish accents really make the food taste better or is it just hot?The bf treated me out for a date night, and El Born was the destination. We arrived a little earlier than our reservation, and while they did have a table ready, it was too close to the door and drafty. We took a seat at the bar and waited for another.Ordering drinks was a little confusing as we tried to order from the bartender, but it's a strict server restaurant. We got the gin and tonic No. 5 and the tequila cocktail (forgot the name...), which took longer than anticipated, after we had been seated at the table. The server described the gin and tonic as really cinnamony, but I thought it could've been spicier; I even chewed on the cinnamon sticks for that extra sweetness. The starter bread is served crisp, with a clove of garlic to rub on, cold tomato salsa, and sea salt to sprinkle on. This was a great, fun start to the evening.For small plates, we got the popular crispy brussels sprouts and a special, dates stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon. The greens were amazing. Fried perfectly, crispy and not too oily, the bits of ham added a salty layer to the already complex flavors. I wasn't the biggest fan of the dates' texture, but blue cheese and bacon can never taste bad, and in combination with the sweetness made for a tasty first course.Next came the octopus and suckling pork. While not the largest portion, the octopus so good: tender and clearly fresh, I appreciated how El Born seasoned it lightly and let the octopus flavor come through. The pork was cooked very well, although I'm not sure the flavor was to my liking. The skin was so crispy, and the meat was so tender. The stringy zucchini on the top made for a great contrast in textures, and I thought it was very well put together.Our green tea flan was disappointing. Presentation was beautiful, but the bottom of the custard was a little burnt and made for a weird flavor combination. The green tea flavor also didn't carry through that well. I could tell they tried to use matcha to capture the essence, but the custard was just too heavy to let it flourish.We split a pitcher of sangria throughout the meal, which was a refreshing addition to the meal, but nothing I'd rave about. Needless to say though, we were both stuffed by the end. I actually couldn't move with cramping, and the walk back to Bedford Ave was every bit of a struggle.Overall, I appreciated what El Born is trying to do, and while every dish wasn't a showstopper, I could definitely see myself coming often if I lived in the area. If it's still up, buy the Gilt City deal as it's actually a good deal!",4.0
"Went here during the marathon. Originally was going to go to 5 leaves for brunch but they were packed and for a 5 person table, it was a 2 hour wait. Checked Yelp and saw El Born that has great ratings and brunch. Decided to go check it or expecting a hour wait atleast but they were pretty available and got a corner booth right away. Although there was only 1 person waiting and making coffee, he was very attentive and friendly. Not to mention he's got a very authentic Spanish accent which matches the food perfectly. We started with a Braves El Born (potatoes in brava sauce) and Pop a la pedra (grilled octopus), both were delicious. But the octopus stole it, it was perfectly grilled with tender. No sauce needed and perfectly seasoned. Definitely a must if you are a seafood eater. For drinks we ordered a pitcher of aigua de Valencia, which tastes like fresh OJ but with gin. The cafe bombo was bomb as well! I ordered a entrepa de calamars (calamari with squid ink sandwich), the waiters favorite and my gf ordered a entrepa de chorizo picant (spicy chorizo sandwich) both were delicious and fries were fresh. All in all, great place to go for brunch, would definitely come back.",4.0

Great tapas restaurant in Greenpoint.  The food is beautifully presented.  The patatas bravas were the best I've had in the city.  The complimentary pan con tomato was much appreciated.  The bacon wrapped dates were smokey and absolutely delicious.  The octopus was just ok.  Nice service and atmosphere and a good wine list.,4.0
"Went back to El Born to give it another try at the request of a friend. Had white wine sangria- was just wine with ice a few very small pieces of green apple and lemon. Had seafood/ squid ink paella. Very cheap on seafood- a few clams, squid, two to three chunks of white fish and some mussels. Aside from that a few lima beans were on top as well as uncooked cut up cherry tomatoes.I asked for some type of spicy sauce, last time they had given me a homemade one. This time it was a cheap Mexican brand from grocery store.In also had creme brûlée- was vanilla pudding that tasted like jello brand. It was SUPER sweet and artificial tasting. It was in a drink glass with whipped cream type of topping. Lastly was finished with a cinnamon mocha tasting powder sprinkle. Nothing was crisp on top, NO caramelized sugar. NOT AT ALL brulee!!Overpriced. Sad excuse for paella. Stunk. Worst dessert I had all year. Dont go.",1.0
Amazing food! Truly surprised by how incredible the food was. My husband and i will be returning there soon.,5.0
"Stumbled upon this on a Saturday night and loved it!  A group of four of us ordered the giant pan of paella (with rice, not noodles!), delicious roasted cauliflower, and lamb skewers with roasted peppers!And we paired it with goblets of refreshing gin and tonics, flavored with plum and ginger.  Such a solid meal and experience!",5.0
"I used to be a Greenpoint resident and this place is one of the things I miss most about the neighborhood. Owner Elena and the staff provide an awesome take on Spanish cuisine with elements of basque and Catalan flavors. I highly recommend the Braves el Born (Patatas Bravas) which are a more complex version of the classic Spanish fried potato dish. This item is great to enjoy as part of a full meal or for something to much while enjoying one of their unique gin and tonics.For a more expansive option, the paella is first-rate. The seafood-ink variety was delicious and satisfyingly filling.Also try to check out the resident musician Achilles play some dope tunes on acoustic guitar on Wednesdays /Sundays (His flamenco sets on Sunday used to start around 8 and would provide a super cool and unique soundtrack to a wonderful dining experience.",5.0

"Now I decided to update my review after a letter from the ""person in charge "". She indicated to me several things in her message that prompted me to update1. "" Person in charge"" stated  my review was not fair as I had not actually tried the food and while she apologized for the service indicated she trust her staff ( to me an insinuation that there is no way service was less then up to par.) She also said "" I assumed you looked online and saw our style of brunch""Reviews on any and all establishments should be based on one's own experience, as mine was based on my experience. Therefore if I choose to express my satisfaction with 2 stars and I had the option to select more, that is MY interpretation of your establishment and the service.No I did not see the menu as it was NOT my event and I was a guest invited to celebrate a birthday ( meaning I had no choice in the menu. I attended to support my friend and THEIR choice in dinning, trust I would NOT have attended on any other occasion solely based on the brunch menu.)2. ""Person in charge"" also indicated that there was a sangria option that was unlimited. Also naming off other food options that where not pork/ ham which consisted of ""Braves El Born, Cheese plate, Kale Salad, Tuna Salad, Spanish Omelette, Kale Omelette, Burger El Born ( which was beef on Sunday), Calamari Sandwich, Seafood Paella, Veggies Paella.""I refer back to my previous review and statement. And will say there were a few more options than previously listed. While none of these still sparked ANY interest.In closing I would like to say this, ""person in charge"" seemed very passionate about the restaurant and the food service even welcoming me back offering a free drink.Here is my suggestion to you:1. Don't make a habit out of sending Yelp messages like the one you sent me, it lacks professionalism and serves to incite further negative reviews, be it online or word of mouth. Even it you try and end it apologetically with a free drink. 2. Don't assume because I wrote the review I made the reservation, or that anyone will already know your menu. Yes being knowledgeable before going to a restaurant is good and will likely provide a better experience, but what about the people who randomly stop by knowing nothing about your food? Or like in my case are invited to an event at your establishment?3. Lastly, and most importantly it is up to you and your staff to sale your food and restaurant. Meaning, if you have guest that are not familiar with your style of food (as most of the guest aside from the guest of honor were) convince us to stay! That doesn't require begging or demeaning oneself either. That can be something as simple as ""you don't like pork/ham try the kale salads it's amazing and it's goes great with the Sangria! And if you love the Sangria, which you will, for only 15.99 it's unlimited!""What your servers did was mumble and run back and forth to the kitchen to ask question because they were not knowledge about the food, and then just keep asking, "" So are you ready to order?!?""I hope my update better helps ""person in charge"" to understand my review.Good day.",1.0
"Do Spanish accents really make the food taste better or is it just hot?The bf treated me out for a date night, and El Born was the destination. We arrived a little earlier than our reservation, and while they did have a table ready, it was too close to the door and drafty. We took a seat at the bar and waited for another.Ordering drinks was a little confusing as we tried to order from the bartender, but it's a strict server restaurant. We got the gin and tonic No. 5 and the tequila cocktail (forgot the name...), which took longer than anticipated, after we had been seated at the table. The server described the gin and tonic as really cinnamony, but I thought it could've been spicier; I even chewed on the cinnamon sticks for that extra sweetness. The starter bread is served crisp, with a clove of garlic to rub on, cold tomato salsa, and sea salt to sprinkle on. This was a great, fun start to the evening.For small plates, we got the popular crispy brussels sprouts and a special, dates stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon. The greens were amazing. Fried perfectly, crispy and not too oily, the bits of ham added a salty layer to the already complex flavors. I wasn't the biggest fan of the dates' texture, but blue cheese and bacon can never taste bad, and in combination with the sweetness made for a tasty first course.Next came the octopus and suckling pork. While not the largest portion, the octopus so good: tender and clearly fresh, I appreciated how El Born seasoned it lightly and let the octopus flavor come through. The pork was cooked very well, although I'm not sure the flavor was to my liking. The skin was so crispy, and the meat was so tender. The stringy zucchini on the top made for a great contrast in textures, and I thought it was very well put together.Our green tea flan was disappointing. Presentation was beautiful, but the bottom of the custard was a little burnt and made for a weird flavor combination. The green tea flavor also didn't carry through that well. I could tell they tried to use matcha to capture the essence, but the custard was just too heavy to let it flourish.We split a pitcher of sangria throughout the meal, which was a refreshing addition to the meal, but nothing I'd rave about. Needless to say though, we were both stuffed by the end. I actually couldn't move with cramping, and the walk back to Bedford Ave was every bit of a struggle.Overall, I appreciated what El Born is trying to do, and while every dish wasn't a showstopper, I could definitely see myself coming often if I lived in the area. If it's still up, buy the Gilt City deal as it's actually a good deal!",4.0
"Went here during the marathon. Originally was going to go to 5 leaves for brunch but they were packed and for a 5 person table, it was a 2 hour wait. Checked Yelp and saw El Born that has great ratings and brunch. Decided to go check it or expecting a hour wait atleast but they were pretty available and got a corner booth right away. Although there was only 1 person waiting and making coffee, he was very attentive and friendly. Not to mention he's got a very authentic Spanish accent which matches the food perfectly. We started with a Braves El Born (potatoes in brava sauce) and Pop a la pedra (grilled octopus), both were delicious. But the octopus stole it, it was perfectly grilled with tender. No sauce needed and perfectly seasoned. Definitely a must if you are a seafood eater. For drinks we ordered a pitcher of aigua de Valencia, which tastes like fresh OJ but with gin. The cafe bombo was bomb as well! I ordered a entrepa de calamars (calamari with squid ink sandwich), the waiters favorite and my gf ordered a entrepa de chorizo picant (spicy chorizo sandwich) both were delicious and fries were fresh. All in all, great place to go for brunch, would definitely come back.",4.0

Portion size was good but the rice was slightly undercooked.

Haven't been able to go back to my family's homeland in 2 years and this is the closest I've been without leaving the city. David & rest of gang there were totally amazing. The fare is mostly Catalonian/Valencian, with a few things borrowed from other regions of Spain, including my beloved North (where you will find the best gastronomic experience of course - sorrynotsorry). I had the paella, which was made to order (as it should be), which was great - very impressed with it actually, considering the chef is a Madrileño (it's an inside joke for all you non-Spaniards). He also made a 'crema catalana"" cojonudisima. Finally, a cortado & some patxaran (amazing they  even had this Basque digestif - it's almost next to impossible to find in the US!) for a proper ending. Gràcies/eskerrik asko!",5.0

"Came here for Sunday brunch! It's pretty good, the food isn't life changing or revolutionary but definitely good enough to make you feel like the relatively steep prices are worth it. The cocktails are pretty great, or maybe having a beautiful Spanish server recommend it to you in Spanish makes it great. The restaurant itself is very pretty, a little rustic but still looks chic and trendy. Very cozy, but nothing beats sitting outdoors, which, surprise! they offer in their backyard! Fundamentally, the foods good, a bit pricey but it hits the spot. David the server is stunningly beautiful, left him a great tip. Love the seating in the backyard!",4.0
"Came back with friends after the owner wrote a polite invitation to return for a glass of wine and tapa - introduced myself and she was sweet, but no wine or tapa. Nevermind, wanted to get the experience I'd missed out on the first time. Didn't happen unfortunately. Waited 25 mins (told 15) to be seated. Very cramped space (coldest night of the year, so couldn't wait outside). When table was finally ready, we were told to sit, but a chair was missing. It was just there, so no idea what happened. Stood there for a few mins in the middle of the dining room waiting while my friends sat, finally caught someone to ask and firmly told I'd get a chair. And I did - a short folding chair from outside ICE COLD. Now with the table at my chin and my rear a popsicle, I can enjoy my meal! No. Large table of out of control drunk girls next to us made that impossible. Croquettes and dates were excellent / chorizo dumpling weird (see pic, sauce/presentation not appetizing) / octopus cooked well but bland, served with plain boiled potatoes? Paella wonderfully flavored, but the rice was hard in the center. Service was far more attentive, but still confusing (attended by at least 3 people), our bill and one card was snatched from our table and almost run - and no one curbed the screaming and rapping (yes, 7 white girls rapping in unison at dinner) next to us... just a mess start to finish, again. Should have skipped the wait and gone anywhere else.",2.0
"The squid ink paella is exquisite in the way the rice and fish are cooked- absolutely to perfection! Unfortunately the dish lacked pizzazz, it needed salt, garlic, a hint of heat, anything to make it tastier. The wine list was not impressive, but the cheese selection for the cheese and fruit appetizer was nicely composed. Charming atmosphere on the patio, friendly staff.

"Delicious!  This is a great local spot for a date night or just to grab a few small plates.  We shared the octopus (delicious, although we prefer grilled, we would still get again), the croquettes (addictive), the cauliflower (one of our favorites of the night -- filling too!), and the filet mignon carpaccio (our other favorite of the night) was even better than we expected it to be.  We paired the caramel and pistachio ice cream with the lava cake for dessert and it was amazing.  We also had the mulled wine cocktail, the Gin #5, the Martini Vasco and the Wawa, and all brought a little something different and delicious with it.  Overall, we are glad we found it, and will be going back again to try the paella.

"Really loved this place - great neighborhood spot with excellent food and warm service.Highlights:Gazpacho with watermelon - very fresh and lightGrilled vegetables with romesco sauce - sounds boring, but it was a true assortment of baby veggies, beautifully presented, with a great sauce. Probably my favorite dish.Flatbread with mushroom spreadTomato salad with strawberries, goat cheese, and balsamic - a cool flavor combo, although a bit big for two peopleThe portions are actually shareable, too, rather than having one scallop for four people, and our waitress was just SO DELIGHTED that we were enjoying ourselves.

"I want to clear that my review is strictly on the service. The cheese plate and tapa I had were really good, and I'm sure that everything else is too.I've been meaning to come here for a while and I heard so many good things from several people. I really wanted to have a good experience. But I had a horrible one.I made reservations and came in around 6:30. They open at 5pm and they where barely set up. All the barware, bottles and garnish where still covered with caps and plastic wrap.We set down and the server (one of the French girls) came and told us of the specials, I didn't quite understand how it worked so I asked again. Then she got annoyed and explained it again with an attitude. We decided to move to the bar so we'd have a better experience.My wife asked the bartender (who clearly showed no experience in bartending) if she could make a cocktail with the ingredients of the hot toddy but as a cocktail instead. She simply poured everything in a mug, added water and stirred with a straw. (Wow)... So we said we'd have just some wine instead and ordered a Chardonnay and a rosè. She gave my wife a Cabernet (red). She was then surprised my wife didn't want to drink a cocktail made with water (my wife is a bartender) Really politely I said that maybe I wasn't clear and that I wanted a Chardonnay. At that point we had just ordered a board of cheese. She gave us our cheese in a clumsy way so the presentation of the cheese just crumbled- all the cheese fell over. She left without letting us know which cheese was which and went to chat with her French coworker. Clearly she didn't assume I didn't speak French otherwise she wouldn't talk badly about her customers in front of the in that language. They discussed in French how we were being "" difficult "" , when really we were being very nice about the whole experience and trying to help her by ordering wine and being polite.At that point I just asked for the check paid and left.I really wanted to like this place and I'm sure the food is great but with a FOH staff like that your business won't be able to sell it.

"Went to El Born this past Thursday with a group of friends.

I had the cinnamon and orange, and my friends tried the cucumber black pepper and the ginger and plum. Deliciousness! But what was even more amazing was the food. We started with some croquetas that frankly were some of the best I had including in all my trips to Madrid and Barcelona. Excellent patatas bravas and probably some of the best octopus I had in NYC (where do you guys get it from?). As a second we had the squid ink paella.  Crispy and full of taste (they bring you alioli which is another sign that they know how to eat). We finished everything with the deserts. Had the chocolate coulant and the crema catalana, both great but my personal favorite was the catalana: light and fresh reedition of the classic desert.

Both good.While the plates are small and expensive, they are decadent. The cocktails are quite affordable and also decadent (I recommend the Gregoni).

"El Born! A new and very cute, very modern and romantic place to take my first ever Tinder date! We started with a couple glasses of wine (a word of caution - the pinot noir that they serve isn't like the usual red wine I am used to - theres is unexpectedly sparkling and served in a champagne flute!)   The conversation flowed, as did the delicious but quickly melting dessert ice cream which was served on flat peices of slate. (Perhaps they should reconsider that presentation and go for bowls). Highlights of the night were the goat cheese croquettes, which were tasty, and artfully arranged, the rich onion soup - yum, and the potatoes. The potatoes were seasoned perfectly! My only wish is that you got more than 5 on a plate.Definitely order a few plates if you are hungry. Overall a positive dining experience!",4.0
"I know there's a certain idea about Spanish food, particularly tapas: it's overpriced, too small, not enough flavor, not enough veggie options, sangria sucks/is for moms, etc. El Born disproves all of these misconceptions. All of the food and drinks we tried were delicious, exquisitely prepared, and reasonably priced. The aigua de valència is like an atomic mimosa that everyone MUST try, and the veggie paella I had a rich array of flavors, including nutty roast brussel sprouts and roasted tomatoes. My boyfriend really loved the pork paella and patatas bravas. (We did the brunch special: unlimited drinks and 2 entrees for $39.) The service was excellent and they seem to have a variety of events/specials every night that I can't wait to try. Really glad this is in Greenpoint.",5.0
"Not enough of that delicious sauce on my bravas, whole potatoes? Its more thought out bravas than i like, but an interesting choice.. Everything was just fine, the duck canelon fell apart very easily like a good canelon. The croquettes were cheese balls (tho I guess I do like cheese balls) and i did like those croquettes, the octopus was a bit dry but a good amount. They tried to charge us for a different wine than the one we had - and the owner lady came and apologized.  I'm probably not gonna make el born a tradition, I love me some tapas tho and their happy hour of free snacks with your booze (very spanish) seems like a winner.",3.0
"Have a lot of the same to say as many of the other reviewers. Had an awesome dinner at El Born this past weekend and will return without hesitation. Incredibly friendly service, really nice interior, and amazing food! My personal favorite was the tuna over fava beans. I very unexpectedly loved the duck confit as well (surprising because I generally don't like duck dishes!)Another bonus: beers on the menu for $3-5 and very reasonable drink prices otherwise, which makes it a great place to stop in just to have a few drinks. Tried the Mahou on draft, which is a lighter beer than I generally order but I enjoyed it!No negative comments! This is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
"I wanted to really love this place, which opened on a dreary block of Manhattan Avenue that's home to a bunch of other restaurants, most of which are ragtag and uninspired. El Born, on the other hand, is a breath of fresh air -- a very well-designed space that gracefully sidesteps most of the musty, faux-historic design cues that still seem to be de rigueur for Brooklyn restaurants these days. El Born's interior is clean and intentional, with nice detailing throughout. It doesn't feel like anything else that's around for miles. It's also excellently lit, and very enticing from the street. I wish I could praise the food as much as the design, but it just wasn't that good. Every dish my girlfriend and I ordered was too rich and without much subtlety -- a big disappointment, especially at this price point. A dish described as being served with fava beans came out with cannellinis, which, come on, is kind of a big difference. Other dishes were suffocated by fatty, bland cheese and cream fillings and toppings, ladled on with a heavy hand. I thought tapas were supposed to be light and good for sharing. At least you can't fault the service, which was warm and attentive throughout. I hope things improve! I'd love to go back, but I just wasn't that impressed by the food.",3.0

"I've been to nearly every restaurant in the neighborhood and I can say with total confidence that this place is a perfect new addition to the area. The quality of the food is amazing. You can tell a lot of thought has gone into every detail, and it has a wonderfully relaxed, cozy, stylish atmosphere. I'd go there on a date, or have a big meal with friends - especially in the big booth at the back - or just for drinks. I went last night for a meal with my mom who was visiting, and a couple friends. Everyone walked away having had an awesome experience thanks to the food and the wonderful service. I hiiiighly recommend the cod collars, the croquettes (who can say no to goat cheese, I mean really), the lamb, the duck, the cauliflower (I need to figure out how to recreate that), and especially the tuna over fava beans. To finish, don't forget the chocolate croquettes - I'll go back just for those, and perhaps the Spanish Hot Toddy.... dangerously delicious especially on a cold night.Keep in mind that you're signing up for a Spanish meal, and the style of the food is tapas, meaning the dishes are meant to be shared and come at intervals - some reviewers below probably didn't take that element into consideration.",5.0

"Had my eye on this place for a while.  It looks great from the outside and the menu was always alluring.Had dinner there despite the few bad reviews.  Every dish was first rate.  Succulent lab chops, tender octopus, perfectly seared tuna were all perfectly cooked and presented.  We feasted on some great starters and the cocktails were delicious.  Cheeses and dessert were similarly very tasty and beautiful.I couldn't find a single problem with the restaurant and was stunned at the quality of the food which in Greenpoint usually is just OK but nothing here often garners high praise.My dinner guests didn't find the chairs on the outside deck comfortable.  The staff were a tad overworked but we never felt neglected.  If there is a new executive chef then he/she is very talented.Highly recommended but be prepared to dig deep into your wallet but it is worth every penny.",5.0

"El Born! A new and very cute, very modern and romantic place to take my first ever Tinder date! We started with a couple glasses of wine (a word of caution - the pinot noir that they serve isn't like the usual red wine I am used to - theres is unexpectedly sparkling and served in a champagne flute!)   The conversation flowed, as did the delicious but quickly melting dessert ice cream which was served on flat peices of slate. (Perhaps they should reconsider that presentation and go for bowls). Highlights of the night were the goat cheese croquettes, which were tasty, and artfully arranged, the rich onion soup - yum, and the potatoes. The potatoes were seasoned perfectly! My only wish is that you got more than 5 on a plate.Definitely order a few plates if you are hungry. Overall a positive dining experience!",4.0
"I know there's a certain idea about Spanish food, particularly tapas: it's overpriced, too small, not enough flavor, not enough veggie options, sangria sucks/is for moms, etc. El Born disproves all of these misconceptions. All of the food and drinks we tried were delicious, exquisitely prepared, and reasonably priced. The aigua de valència is like an atomic mimosa that everyone MUST try, and the veggie paella I had a rich array of flavors, including nutty roast brussel sprouts and roasted tomatoes. My boyfriend really loved the pork paella and patatas bravas. (We did the brunch special: unlimited drinks and 2 entrees for $39.) The service was excellent and they seem to have a variety of events/specials every night that I can't wait to try. Really glad this is in Greenpoint.",5.0
"Not enough of that delicious sauce on my bravas, whole potatoes? Its more thought out bravas than i like, but an interesting choice.. Everything was just fine, the duck canelon fell apart very easily like a good canelon. The croquettes were cheese balls (tho I guess I do like cheese balls) and i did like those croquettes, the octopus was a bit dry but a good amount. They tried to charge us for a different wine than the one we had - and the owner lady came and apologized.  I'm probably not gonna make el born a tradition, I love me some tapas tho and their happy hour of free snacks with your booze (very spanish) seems like a winner.",3.0
"Have a lot of the same to say as many of the other reviewers. Had an awesome dinner at El Born this past weekend and will return without hesitation. Incredibly friendly service, really nice interior, and amazing food! My personal favorite was the tuna over fava beans. I very unexpectedly loved the duck confit as well (surprising because I generally don't like duck dishes!)Another bonus: beers on the menu for $3-5 and very reasonable drink prices otherwise, which makes it a great place to stop in just to have a few drinks. Tried the Mahou on draft, which is a lighter beer than I generally order but I enjoyed it!No negative comments! This is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
"I wanted to really love this place, which opened on a dreary block of Manhattan Avenue that's home to a bunch of other restaurants, most of which are ragtag and uninspired. El Born, on the other hand, is a breath of fresh air -- a very well-designed space that gracefully sidesteps most of the musty, faux-historic design cues that still seem to be de rigueur for Brooklyn restaurants these days. El Born's interior is clean and intentional, with nice detailing throughout. It doesn't feel like anything else that's around for miles. It's also excellently lit, and very enticing from the street. I wish I could praise the food as much as the design, but it just wasn't that good. Every dish my girlfriend and I ordered was too rich and without much subtlety -- a big disappointment, especially at this price point. A dish described as being served with fava beans came out with cannellinis, which, come on, is kind of a big difference. Other dishes were suffocated by fatty, bland cheese and cream fillings and toppings, ladled on with a heavy hand. I thought tapas were supposed to be light and good for sharing. At least you can't fault the service, which was warm and attentive throughout. I hope things improve! I'd love to go back, but I just wasn't that impressed by the food.",3.0
"Amazing food and outstanding service! The duck! The octopus, the potatoes, the ham and cheese where incredible and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Try this place. We were happy we found it!",5.0
"I've been to nearly every restaurant in the neighborhood and I can say with total confidence that this place is a perfect new addition to the area. The quality of the food is amazing. You can tell a lot of thought has gone into every detail, and it has a wonderfully relaxed, cozy, stylish atmosphere. I'd go there on a date, or have a big meal with friends - especially in the big booth at the back - or just for drinks. I went last night for a meal with my mom who was visiting, and a couple friends. Everyone walked away having had an awesome experience thanks to the food and the wonderful service. I hiiiighly recommend the cod collars, the croquettes (who can say no to goat cheese, I mean really), the lamb, the duck, the cauliflower (I need to figure out how to recreate that), and especially the tuna over fava beans. To finish, don't forget the chocolate croquettes - I'll go back just for those, and perhaps the Spanish Hot Toddy.... dangerously delicious especially on a cold night.Keep in mind that you're signing up for a Spanish meal, and the style of the food is tapas, meaning the dishes are meant to be shared and come at intervals - some reviewers below probably didn't take that element into consideration.",5.0

"I'm sorry, but I really can't back up these 4 and 5 star reviews... I met up with a few friends for a going away dinner and, overall, the service and food was just not there.We started with drinks and appetizers including the goat cheese croquettes, warm zucchini, oven baked cauliflower and the olives. The croquettes were great (seriously), the zucchini came out cold, the cauliflower was bland and the olives never made it to the table the entire time we were there. Appetizers were all brought out at random times leaving 3 or 4 people just sitting there waiting for their orders to come. Drink wise, it was pretty standard; wine, a hot toddy and a beer. Only issue with the drinks is that it took my friend 3 times of asking to get her glass of wine refilled.For main dishes, we ordered the octopus, duck confit and then the thin sliced filet mignon. The people who ordered the octopus seemed to enjoy it (the potatoes being the better part of the meal), for the duck, they actually ended up bringing the chestnut flour crispy rabbit. When we told our server that we had ordered duck, she left and then came back with the manager/owner to double check with us to make sure we knew what we had ordered... maybe as if we were mistaken. After a bit of confusion, the manager brought the table a complimentary serving of the rabbit that they mistakenly made for us. There was more bone and breading than meat but it was served in a paper bag, came with something that looked like ranch dressing (and at this point I was just about ready to dip anything into anything) and was doused in rosemary so, ya know, there's that. The duck entrees finally showed up maybe 2 hours after initially ordering it while the filet mignon never came. We know it's early and we know these things can and most likely will be worked out.  Collectively though, I still don't see any of us coming back here and won't hesitate to let people know our experience. We're not food snobs but we've all been in the service industry and, as servers AND managers running a kitchen, when you're realizing that your service is less than par and almost on the abysmal side, you want to be right there with those customers assuring them that everything will be taken care of. Hell, maybe comp something off the final bill or get us a round... anything to let us know you're thinking 'Hey, I'm sorry this hasn't been the best experience but I'm going to do my best to make up for it.' There was none of that. After surveying the bill and noticing things on there that never made it to the table, we just decided to cut our losses and go to a bar.

El Born in a really nice atmosphere with very tasty + affordable wine /Tapas. I highly recommend the octopus. The back porch is really simple and pretty with a beautiful weeping willow and covered roof. I am happy to know there's a place like this in Greenpoint. Great if you are looking for delicious food and a place to talk with your dinner companion. It a great getaway from the hipster scene. I found the staff and service to be very good. Regarding the  negative reviews left here. I would say that some people are just never happy and don't know how to enjoy themselves. It's a shame that they use Yelp to as a sounding board for their own personal frustrations but then again- it's pretty obvious they are CA- CRAZY!I feel the owner and chef have put their heart into this restaurant and it shows in the overall experience I had.

"A great new authentic spanish restaurant opened up in the belly of greenpoint. The food is light and fresh while still having that warming effect for a guy who just traversed some frigid January evening winds. We tried a bunch of things: shishito peppers and lemon, goat cheese croquettes, mushroom and oil'd flatbreads, olives to start. potato balls (one of the many items in spherical form!), the tuna, octopus, lambchops, duck cannelloni and a couple of desserts. All of which were delicious. My favorite of the night were the octopus and the fava beans that were gently flavored and tucked under the tuna. A nice and not-overly-done smothering of oil, fresh herbs and chunky-salt really is right up my alley.In addition to the food, the drinks were delicious with Spanish Vermut (served with orange and olives) as well as red wine and mexican coke, and 4 different gin and tonic cocktails!Lastly, the decor of the place is simple yet stylish with some nice lighting and a long communal bar-height-table runs the length of most of the restaurant which really allows for a fun atmosphere and kept us at the table for 4 hours having drinks and a fun time.",5.0

"The food here was good, and we don't have enough real restaurants in GP for me to complain about one of the few that seems to be trying. I will say however, that 75 bucks for two drinks and 2 apps is pretty pricey, especially for a windlowless den right by Nassau ave, and that will be in the back of my mind any time I consider going in to eat here. They also refused to seat us at a proper table, and told us to sit at the long communal table ""just in case"" despite the fact that there were about a dozen tables open and it was like 6 pm, which is always sure to piss me off. It somehow suggests that the invisible person who ISN'T eating there, might somehow be better than you in one ay or another. I personally think from a service perspective, I should be able to sit wherever I feel comfortable, and I hate communal seating when I'm trying to have a conversation. If I'm about to drop 100+ bucks, the least I could have is a seat and some privacy. That's my choice not yours, as long as it isn't packed. Also, the out of work male model bartender kept coming over to us after we'd already ordered, to ask us what we'd like, and it became kind of obvious that he just wanted to make conversation with the girl I was with, which is only mildly annoying, because it was obvious that he needs lots of attention, but sometimes I just want to eat my food and drink with who I'm with, and he definitely wasn't the type to take a hint. He kept asking what we had ordered and telling us how it was his favorite, then the next thing was his 2nd favorite, and so on and so forth. Pretty annoying dude, and obviously not an experienced bartender or service person. My main gripe was the lack of comfort in the space, price for portion size, and unnecessary constant contact with the wait staff and other patrons. It'll probably cost you about 130-150 bucks for 2 if you want to get full and have a couple drinks here, so keep that in mind. But I wouldn't call it a ripoff, so much as slightly overpriced, because the food is actually pretty well done. If this was a real tapas place, I'd be able to sit wherever I want, eat and drink sporadically for hours and be left along when I felt like it. This is not that.EDIT: Reducing my rating from 3 to 1 star after the insane and rude message that the owner sent me. Essentially she sent me a long winded message that suggested that I must have lied about everything. First telling me that I must not have paid what I paid, then telling me her restaurant isn't expensive, following up with ""we are in the most expensive city in the world"" just in case I needed justification; (no, you're in Greenpoint, don't open a restaurant in my neighborhood and then tell me how it is.) and then  she apologized for her bartender who she hired with no service experience and is ""just trying to make it in NY"", apparently at the expense of customers. Please, you must have been El Born yesterday. You clearly have no restaurant experience if you treat customers this way, and if you insist on hiring inexperienced staff in a city full of experience service professionals. I will DEFINITELY not come back here now, because I don't like giving my money to awful people. I feel sorry for your chef. Your behavior is disgusting.",1.0

Also, the out of work male model bartender kept coming over to us after we'd already ordered, to ask us what we'd like, and it became kind of obvious that he just wanted to make conversation with the girl I was with, which is only mildly annoying, because it was obvious that he needs lots of attention, but sometimes I just want to eat my food and drink with who I'm with, and he definitely wasn't the type to take a hint. He kept asking what we had ordered and telling us how it was his favorite, then the next thing was his 2nd favorite, and so on and so forth. Pretty annoying dude, and obviously not an experienced bartender or service person. My main gripe was the lack of comfort in the space, price for portion size, and unnecessary constant contact with the wait staff and other patrons. It'll probably cost you about 130-150 bucks for 2 if you want to get full and have a couple drinks here, so keep that in mind. But I wouldn't call it a ripoff, so much as slightly overpriced, because the food is actually pretty well done. If this was a real tapas place, I'd be able to sit wherever I want, eat and drink sporadically for hours and be left along when I felt like it. This is not that.EDIT: Reducing my rating from 3 to 1 star after the insane and rude message that the owner sent me. Essentially she sent me a long winded message that suggested that I must have lied about everything. First telling me that I must not have paid what I paid, then telling me her restaurant isn't expensive, following up with ""we are in the most expensive city in the world"" just in case I needed justification; (no, you're in Greenpoint, don't open a restaurant in my neighborhood and then tell me how it is.) and then  she apologized for her bartender who she hired with no service experience and is ""just trying to make it in NY"", apparently at the expense of customers. Please, you must have been El Born yesterday. You clearly have no restaurant experience if you treat customers this way, and if you insist on hiring inexperienced staff in a city full of experience service professionals. I will DEFINITELY not come back here now, because I don't like giving my money to awful people. I feel sorry for your chef. Your behavior is disgusting.",1.0

"Had a fabulous dinner at El Born - so fabulous, in fact, that I finally created a yelp account just so I could tell other people how great this place is.Went with four other people and tried a variety of dishes, all of which were delicious, with a broad variety of flavors and foods. Plenty to choose from for both the carnivores and the vegetarians at the table. Particular group favorites were the pa de coca, croquettes, and duck canelo. The food and drinks were super tasty, and the happy atmosphere in the restaurant only added to the overall experience.A great addition to Brooklyn in general and Greenpoint in particular. I'll be going back often!",5.0
"Awesome Barcelona style tapas with really nice staff and really good food.  Would probably give an extra half star if I could because we were really impressed by the service, but I was just wishing for a little more as far as portions go.  The beef montaditos and cod collar were definitely our favorite dishes.  We also had the goat cheese croquettes, the radishes with anchovy, and the canelo filled with duck confit.  Everything was really tasty and beautifully presented, and the wines were very reasonably priced, with a bottle of tempranillo at $21.   The meal is served in tapas style, one small plate at a time.  Plates came paced really nicely so we didn't feel rushed at all.  Everything on the menu is meant for sharing, and there aren't any entree sized portions.  Also, another reviewer mentioned that they were confused by the number of gin and tonics on the menu, but its because they're an extremely popular cocktail in Barcelona.   Excited about the new addition to the neighborhood!",4.0
