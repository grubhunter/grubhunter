"I stopped by here NYE with my BF for dinner. There was enough people and we had to wait a couple minutes for seats. But the staff there was very nice. We got our seats in 10-15 min and ordered. We started off with tostones as our appetizer. It was amazing!!! The green sauce mixed with the cheese on the plantains... I'm salivating thinking about it. You will not be disappointed. For entree, I had the pabellon criollo. They had the similar thing in the arepa that we ordered. But it came with plantain, rice and beans on the side. Last, we ordered a pabella arepa. For drink, I had the papelon con lemon which is molasses with lemon. It pretty much tasted like honey tea with lemon. I liked it although it had the bitter sour taste. I will def be coming back since it's close to my house and work!!",5.0
"Like Colombian food, I'm a huge fan of Venezuelan restaurants, particularly of their arepas, pabellon, and sangria. I'm glad to report that you will find all three here. The location is a block or so off Knickerbocker Ave., a walk from the L or J train. I'm a Bronxite, so this was a bit of a field trip for me.You will notice that this restaurant includes huge windows that allow lots of light in, communal-style benches, and a ""bar"" counter top. I immediately found a place at the counter where I was promptly given a menu. The staff was attentive, industrious, working with cheerful salsa music playing on the speakers. What's cool about this place is that the ""kitchen"" is behind the bar, in plain sight, so you can literally watch them make your food. It was an added bonus to see la arepera--the arepa making woman--stirring a huge caldera (pot) full of black means while monitoring the fluffy white arepas on the griddle top, turning to a light toasted brown. I started with a glass of red sangria ($7) while I waited for my pabellon arepa. The glass was the size of a standard wine glass, flavorful, but not particularly strong of memorable. I was also quickly greeted with a glass bottle of water and cup, which I happily drank--and soon finished.My arepa arrived pretty quickly, in a basket adorned with a paper towel. The arepa was a thick, fluffy, and piping hot. In terms of quality, I'd say that it was on the higher end, having tastes burn, overly great, and stale ones. Because of the open air kitchen set up, the food is fresh and just off the stove. The fillings were average to good, utilizing a green ají-like hot sauce to adorn my meat. I couldn't help myself and went for a second arepa--a paisa--adorned with a thick layer of salty, grated cheese, which I savored for several minutes. I saw several very appetizing-looking salads, mini arepas featuring cheddar cheese, among other items I watched be prepared as I waited for my own food. While far from home, if say that it was worth the trip and if I lived or worked closer, it would be a must have addition to my restaurant repertoire. It offers a little something different than most of what you'll find around the neighborhood. I'm an arepa aficionado, as is mentioned earlier, so that was well worth it for me--check it out.",4.0
"The Arepas here are so on point. This hole in the wall place is bestowed with cheerful yellow walls, a smiling waitstaff and the best dam Arepas you'll have in your life. Do not miss out on the Pernil  (slow cooked pork) arepa or their house special:  black bean, queso, plaintain and pork arepa. The pork is so tender it melts in your mouth. The arepa dough is fresh, crispy and has that oh so appealing crunchy corn texture. Snag some of their special hot sauce or green sauce to adorn your arepa. This place is a neighborhood gem in Bushwick.  If you're chilling in the neighborhood or taking in some street art this is an absolute must try while you're in the area.",4.0
"Superior food, inviting atmosphere and the staff is efficient and warm. A wonder date night spot, and even if I could make fresh arepas as well as they do, I'd still want to support this delicious local spot.",5.0
"I needed a place to charge my phone and decided why not get a beer and an empanada. I normally never come this far out, but it's worth a trek to Bushwick for bars and events. I ordered a vegetarian empanada; which had coconut in it (so I had to get it no matter what). They have a surprisingly vast selection of beers, I was able to get an Imperial, which I haven't seen since I left Costa Rica. The prices were decent- $5 an empanada and $5 a beer. They hand make all their arepas and empanadas- I had a fun time watching the guys make them behind the bar. Authentic, affordable, and delicious! The empanada was pretty big too, not those small ones you get in a truck, and came with a green sauce. Mm my mouth is watering at the thought of coconut, plantain, and beans in a fried shell... I'll come back soon!",5.0
"I passed by this place on the way to another restaurant thinking ""I definitely want to try this at some point."" We ended up leaving the initial restaurant after drinks to come to Arepara Guacuao. Anything with 'guac' in the name has to be good! And it was really amazing. The sangria was on point and the very helpful server suggested that my friend and I each get a arepa and share an empanada. We probably should have gotten our own empanada because they were AMAZING too! And large! I will definitely be back. Anyone who is within walking distance of this place needs to take a walk there!",5.0
"One of NYC's best meals. But let me tell you. I repair a lot of things. When arepera car, I save a lot of money on auto service bills. When arepera bicycle, my father is proud since he spent his life building a bicycle business in England. When arepera dryer, then it saves my housemates and I having to go to the damn motherf***ing laundromat (launderette). But it's when arepera broken friendship or a rift in a relationship that I am most happy. However, since I do not know what a Guacuco is, I have to admit I have no idea how arepera Guacuco.What to get: Pabellon Arepa and a Cocada drinkWhat else: It's one of the most amazing things you'll taste in NYCWhy: Hot, wet, juicy, filling, and absolutely packed with plantains which are the best partBetter than...: Yes, it's better than the one at Arepas Cafe and most othersWhy is it so good: Because Michael's beard is sexyI'd had this place on my ""to try"" list for a long time, but (blush) because it wasn't in Queens (yes I'm serious, I'm addicted to Queens), I kept skipping it. My loss. Recently, my good friend Michael said to me ""Fox, you gotta check out this spot in Brooklyn it was my favorite as an omni: Arepera Guacuco."" And that sealed the deal. I detoured out of Queens in Sept 2015 to try it. And, wow. And this review is dedicated to Michael (the Vanilla Gorilla) for this amazing rec, for being such a nice guy, for being an inspirational Vegan, and for, well, for the beard of course.My main complaint is they don't serve any Mexican Avocado-based dishes. So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Guacamole""?So, on my recent Queens food tour, I braved Brooklyn traffic, parked illegally (as usual) to dip in to the Hipster Borough and pick up the Pabellon Arepa that I ordered. I already know that Pabellon is *the* Venezuelan standout. This turned out to be one of the most delicious Pabellon's I've ever had.My main complaint is they are Venezuelan (S America) and are not at all from Central America. So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Guatemala""?Why is the Pabellon so good? It has shredded beef, black beans, fried sweet plantains, sprinkled with aged white cheese. It's similar to the Surena at Caracas Arepa (except that has chicken and sausage), or the Ropa Vieja Arepa at Cleveland's Barrocco. It's simply one of the best things you will ever put in your mouth (not including human body parts). Every bite is heaven. Every morsel is delicious. It just *works*. My main complaint is they don't serve tropical fruits. So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Guava""?So try the Pabellon. If I was going to be permanently trapped on a desert island with my fave Yelp girl (hi!), I'd ask for Guacuco to provide daily Pabellons to make the eats as delicious as, well, the ""eats.""My main complaint is they aren't owned by mercenaries in camos with automatic weapons and war-paint. So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Guerrilla""?Actually, considering who told me about this place, I suppose it should be renamed ""Arepera Vanilla Gorilla.""I did have a complaint though. I was parked illegally and in a hurry, and their computer system froze, and it took them (no exaggeration) five minutes or so just to take my money and give me my change. I thought they could have done a better job of getting me out of there. But I didn't get a ticket, and the food was still piping hot, so I guess it's no big deal. Still, while they were friendly, customer service could have been much better.My main complaint is they don't serve chewy sweet kiddie candy. So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Gummybears""?Others have complained about the pricing. I found it to be fair. The Cocada (Coconut Shake) was 4-ish and the Arepa was 8-ish. Considering how filling, spectacular and delicious it is, I find this price to be fine. As in, you so fine, you make me wanna eat you. Arepa.My main complaint is they are in NYC, not Buffalo, and don't sell Black Balloons or Slides and nobody named Iris works here (and if they did, I wouldn't tell you her name). So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Googoodolls""? You think these jokes are bad? This is one of my ""Better Days.""Speaking of the Cocada, it was very delicious and is well worth a try. It wasn't too thick, it was more like ""Coconut Horchata"" if that makes sense. And I loved it. You know what else is white and not too thick? I can show you. Hold on.My main complaint is they aren't owned by an actor named Steve who once looked after a baby, then a little lady, attended a police academy, and hit on Veronica Mars. So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Guttenberg""?So make sure you come to Guacuco (not literally) just like Michael said. These Arepas taste almost as good as his beard. I will definitely be back and will recommend this to all visiting Brooklyn.But my main complaint is there were no female servers for me to flirt with, hit on, and try and make excited. So why the hell are they named ""Arepera Gooeydownbelow""?",5.0
"Had lunch here and enjoyed a few Venezuelan delights.For the food, I had two of the Arepas, The Pernil and a chicken one that I can't remember the name of. Both were great but the Pernil was the winner. For the drink I had the cocada. Soooo soooo good, I would drink this all day long if possible. Cool ""hipster"" vibe here but slightly overpriced.",4.0
"I've lived near this place for years, so it was finally time to give it a try. It's always crowded, so it must be good!  I got the pork and cheddar arepa. It was good, maybe a little plain, but the sauces on the table helped it out quite a bit. If I were to go back though, I'd probably get a little more adventurous with my order in hopes of getting more flavor. There are many to choose from. It was the perfect size for me, not too big, not too small, and I think around $7.00. My friend said he would need more than one to fill him up. He got a full entree that included rice, beans, and plantains for about twice the price, but I feel like my order was a better value. I have heard they have fantastic fresh squeezed juices here. I'll go back again to try something different, maybe bring it up another star.",3.0
"Arriving at 9:30pm on a Sunday night when operating hours are until 10:30pm, one would think you'd have plenty of time to finish a solid evening meal.Dining experience was next to awful. Obnoxiously loud music led the waitress to asking me three times for what I would like to order.  The first waitress stopped tending to us after delivering a portion of our meal. The second waitress asked if we were waiting for more food which we answered yes to. She was clearly confused and reconfirmed what we were still waiting for. After 7 to 10 minutes, my arepa arrived however my guest's food was still not ready...? I asked our second waitress how long it would be before the food would come out and miraculously she misunderstood and our food was STILL not made. To make matters worse, the entire kitchen staff and the first waitress, who apparently was now off and sitting at the bar stool right next to our table, were all talking about our table in Spanish. ""What are they waiting for? I want to get out of here"" they would tease one another RIGHT IN FRONT OF US assuming that we didn't understand what they were saying.I have never experienced such a disrespectful dining experience and am ashamed this beautiful country, food, and culture is shamed by these employees.",1.0

We had the pitcher of sangria and it was huge, delicious, and strong! The original appetizer we ordered was sold out so we tried the sweet plantains instead and they were mediocre - the main issue was that they were somewhat dried out.However, the arepas and empanadas were excellent!

It's not that hard to make 4 arepas it's a week day lunch is over for the average working person so I was a bit confused at how long it's taking. The arepas are good not amazing there's no need for them to take this long. Last time ordering from this place.,3.0

I said ""Aw man, the sauce is the reason I come here, I love it."" He just shrugged. That's it. So about 20 minutes later, our food comes out and we start eating without the sauce. A few minutes later, we see the green sauce come out and he brings it over to another table which sat down after us.I made eye contact with him kind of wondering why the hell he exaggerated the time the sauce would be done and why he would give it to someone who came in after us especially with the enthusiasm I asked for it. He looked at me and swiftly looked away and walked back to the bar where he was hanging out. I wave him down and ask for the sauce and THEN he brought it over. It's like he gave us terrible service on purpose.This is the 2nd time I've dined here with him as our waiter (I really wish I got his name) but he needs an attitude adjustment. Maybe this kind of service is not for you my friend!",2.0
"Love it. All of the appetizers are good. All of the arepas are good. The arepas themselves are crunchy and yet soft and doughy at the same time. Always impressed and leave feeling fat and happy. Cheese empanada is great. So crispy and two types of gooey cheeses.  The cocada is delicious and the parchita is just sweet enough with a great flavor to accompany your meal. Sangria isn't bad either. Always full, but never had to wait for a table. Eat here when in Bushwick. If not in Bushwick, take the L and eat here anyways. Delivery is worth it as well.",4.0
"I have officially dined in and dined out once. Dining in was a pleasant experience, the kitchen is wide open and exposed so you can watch the cooks do their magic. I dined in sometime in the spring (Marchish) and recently had them deliver (Dec). The staff was friendly, chatty and willing to make food recommendations. The 2nd time around (Delivery) we placed the order via GubHub knowing exactly what i wanted, which was easy. Only issue was the delivery took over a hour. The app warned us which is great and appreciated but holy damn (!) That's a really long time to wait for 2 arepas and 2 empanadas, the food was still piping hot which was great. The delivery time is my only compliant, about the delivery. I also dont remember the empanadas being greasy the first time I was there (eating in). I guess I'll have to eat there a 3rd time and check it out :-p",4.0
"Came here for lunch with a couple my colleagues a few weeks ago. We had been in the area a few days earlier and noticed the cool facade of this place and had to try it. I Had the chicken salad  arepa, which was absolutely delicious. Also had the pabellon empanada which was heaven in my mouth. To finish off this great meal, the coconut milkshake is amazing. Truly looking forward to coming back soon to try some of other items on the menu.",5.0
Pretty good. Solid arepa but I've had better. Cocada was really yummy.,3.0
So far no complaints. My mini sandwich is tasty. The host was welcoming. I kept being attacked by a nat.  The table sauces are really good.,3.0
"We came here in the early late afternoon, snatched the last two seats at the bar right before the place got super packed. The staff was efficient and kind--they even brought us things to try when it was completely packed with people waiting inside and outside. The atmosphere was open and relaxing.We ordered the following items:The pulled pork arepa--tender, juicy with excellent texture. Not spicy--lots of spices but not hot. Goes well the the sweet mayo and cheddar cheese--much more exciting new than this sounds. The shredded fish arepa--juicy, flavorful, not fishy at all. Very tender with a tofu like texture but with a lot of spices but not salty at all. All ingredients taste very fresh. The vegan arepa--the vegetables retained their taste while absorbing the flavor from the spiciness. They were amazing. It feels like a tropical veggie garden bloomed in your mouth. I would eat them everyday if I could.The shell of these arepas are crunchy and sticky at the same time! Definitely not mushy but not dry and flaky either--you have to try them yourself to get the idea. The English language doesn't have the set of terms to fully describe them.Soursop--delicious, sweet, tart with a tropic undertone.",5.0
"Delicious arepas and other Venezuelan treats.  Been here a couple times and enjoyed it each time.  Sauces are vegetarian but some are not vegan (if you're looking out for that kind of thing). Had both the tostones and the tanadas (sweet plantains).  Perfectly fried tostones and deliciously dangerous tajadas with a crumbly cheese on the side.  The vegetarian empanada was super interesting.  Both sweet (coconut and sweet plantains), savory (black beans) and spicy (jalapeños)!Vegetariana arepa is full of avocado, cheese and sweet plantains.  Great with any of the table sauces.  Also try the Vegana Picante if you're vegan and like your food spicy!  The jalapeños in that one really pack a punch. Had some Venezuelan beer that wasn't anything to write home about but really rounded out the meal.",4.0

"SO GOOD. One of my top three places to eat in all of NYC. Best arepas in the city and by far the best price I've seen for this quality. I've been to other places that have much smaller, more expensive arepas, but at Guacuco you can literally spend $6 on an arepa and leave feeling very satisfied and impressed. Very consistent great flavors and OH THE SAUCES EAT THOSE SAUCES. I've tried making arepas at home HA, and it is not as easy as it looks, but somehow they make them perfectly crispy yet fluffy every time and the food is always hot when served.

Best tasting arepas I have ever had. Hands down. I had the vegan picante arepa and the shredded chicken arepa. Both were exceptionally good.

I've only had tostones from Cuban restaurants and friends so I don't know if this is a different culture thing or just the restaurant but either way they were fantastic! I liked adding a little bit of the green sauce to them too! I tried the vegetarian arepa - good! I would like to try the vegan one next time. All in all, I'm very pleased and will definitely order from them again or go for their breakfast arepas. Oh and also that green sauce - so amazing! It has garlic in it and I would bathe in it if I could!",5.0
The food is delicious. Arepas are their #1 dish in my opinion. Their shredded beef and shredded chicken in any dish is a hit. The coconut shake is a one of a kind party in your mouth. This was my 3rd visit but I wasnt alone and the service was not quite what I expected it to be. The waiter was not warm or welcoming to my family and I but he sure was to other guests. This made me very triste bec I really enjoyed this place. Take Out I guess from now on IF I were to go back. Que lastima.,3.0
"Came here for brunch. While the empanadas are amazing, the arepas are nothing to rave about. Based on food alone I'd say this would be four stars, but tbh the service aint the best.

That shit is dope.. If you're netflixed up and chilling with your Tinder date have 4 of these delivered ASAP. If you're contemplating where to eat..eat here. Guacuco is the besssstttttt,5.0
"Mmmmm. I ordered delivery and it hit the spot!! I had the pabellon arepa which was good but I'm not a big sweet plantain fan so I took those out. But the quality of meat was excellent and the black beans were delish! We also had tostones. I've only had tostones from Cuban restaurants and friends so I don't know if this is a different culture thing or just the restaurant but either way they were fantastic! I liked adding a little bit of the green sauce to them too! I tried the vegetarian arepa - good! I would like to try the vegan one next time. All in all, I'm very pleased and will definitely order from them again or go for their breakfast arepas. Oh and also that green sauce - so amazing! It has garlic in it and I would bathe in it if I could!",5.0
The food is delicious. Arepas are their #1 dish in my opinion. Their shredded beef and shredded chicken in any dish is a hit. The coconut shake is a one of a kind party in your mouth. This was my 3rd visit but I wasnt alone and the service was not quite what I expected it to be. The waiter was not warm or welcoming to my family and I but he sure was to other guests. This made me very triste bec I really enjoyed this place. Take Out I guess from now on IF I were to go back. Que lastima.,3.0
"Came here for brunch. While the empanadas are amazing, the arepas are nothing to rave about. Based on food alone I'd say this would be four stars, but tbh the service aint the best. If this is your first time trying Venezuelan food, go for it, but otherwise I'd recommend staying on the M for a few more stops until you hit Bella Caracas.",3.0

"The quick 'n' dirty:- Arepas are really good. They have a bunch of veggie-friendly options, and three different house made sauces to smother your cornbread creation. I liked the spicy cilantro sauce - adds a bit of kick (whatever that means). - For a more filling option, the platters are basically a ""build your own"" arepa + some rice. I don't think anyone at the table talked once the shredded beef was set down in front of us. - Them tostones! For real. Amazing. Friend green plantains, perfectly crispy and topped with cheese & chipotle mayo (or something like it). Yumo.- Wine is decently priced - house red is $6, but I got the Rioja which was decent for $8 - Ambience is chill. The whole operation - restaurant, bar, kitchen - is one big room. Decor is simple meets industrial, and dotted with some Venezulan flair. But yeah. Those tostones...",4.0

"My boyfriend and I came with our friends to Arepera Guacuco. One of them whom lived in Bushwick Brooklyn suggested this restaurant that she had once gone to and enjoyed. This was my first time eating in Bushwick and Venezuelan food so I was quite excited.I really like this restaurant because it has a relaxing ambiance with Spanish music playing in the background. The service was on point and the food was just excellent.We started off with drinks and worked our way towards the food. Cocada (Coconut milk shake) - Yelp reviewers were right on about this drink! I'm  not a big fan of coconut, but man... this drink wasabsolutely refreshing and light. I highly recommend this drink if you ever try this restaurant.Papelon con lemon (molasses with lemon) - My boyfriend ordered this drink. It tasted a lot like lemon tea, but the taste is a little more milder.Pabellon Oriental -  This was my entree. The dish had a lot of elements to it - shredded fish, rice, black beans, arepa, and fried sweet plantains sprinkled with salty dish. I've never had an arepa before and I wasn't sure how to eat it. I sliced it open as if it were a pita and stuffed it with the shredded fish, black beans, and rice. The shredded fish packed a lot of flavor. The black beans were cooked to the perfect consistency. I liked the plantains. They were sweet and moist, but I didn't really like the cheese that was sprinkled on it. $12.00 for this meal.Pabellon Criollo - My boyfriend ordered the same exact dish as mine with one exception.  He had shredded beef in his dish. His dish was made up of the same elements as mine - arepa, rice, black beans, and plantains sprinkled with salty cheese. He let me try some of his beef and man, it was so flavorful and just cooked to the right texture. Ham & Cheese Empanada - I was itching to try an empanada so I ordered it. Unfortunately I didn't like it. It was huge, but it tasted a lot like a Hot Pocket especially with the cheese sauce inside. Arepas - Mariscada - Our friends wanted to order this. It's an arepa and a combination of squids, shrimp, and mussels in a red, flavorful tomato sauce. I tried it and loved it.The food here was great. It was presented nicely and tasted authentic.This was a nice change from what my boyfriend & I usually eat and nice change of atmosphere. I will definitely be back here again.",4.0

"There's a new arepa in town and this one is just as tasty as any other's I've had (Caracas in Manhattan and Arepa Cafe in Queens). The classic Venezualen national dish, pabellon (shredded beef, sweet plantains, black beans, and salty cheese) is available as both an arepa (about $7), and a plate with white rice (about $12). I've still never eaten anything as amazing as that particular combination of textures and flavors so I doubt I'll have anything else here. The one at Arepera Guacuco did not disappoint. The service was also on point and the place is in an inconvienient area so it was almost completely empty when I went, pretty much the opposite from the cramped busy Caracas on the LES. Learn from my lession though, one arepa for a big appetite isn't enough but two is too much (with a big one like the pabellon). Get an appetizer and/or dessert. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the coconut milkshake. I felt as though it was too watery/icy, had a funny flavor to it, and was garnished with way too much cinnamon.",4.0

"This review has nothing to do with the food, but the absolute arrogance of the cooks. I ordered an arepa with no cheese, because um, I am allergic to cheese. Now that we've established that, the order came with cheese melted in. Okay, fine, whatever, I'll just send it back and just wait a little longer for them to remake it, right? Wrong. So the food is sent back, and they half ass scrape the cheese off, leaving quite a bit of it still melted on there. I inspect it the second time around noticed this, and brought it to the attention to the server - ""Actually allergic to cheese so it's not a matter of just scraping it off because there are melted particles on here"". Okay, great, just a little longer for the food right? What happened next brought me to yelp. I haven't yelped in quite a while, but here it is. It was the exact same freakin sandwich they brought back, cheese and all, not even an attempt to cover it up. Un-freakin-acceptable. This battle was done. I suppose it's my fault for not sending it back a 4th time, but at that point I just wanted to eat (we did have other dishes). So I left about half the sandwich that didn't have any melted cheese particles in it and paid and left. Can't see myself coming back after having this frustrating experience.",1.0

"I received a Groupon for this place as a gift earlier this year. My husband and I came here for a date night shortly after that. We love that it's in Bushwick.  It's a great neighborhood with awesome spots for great food, like this one.  The Groupon included a pitcher of Sangria and we were definitely on that. The Sangria wasn't amazing. It was actually a little watery but still very refreshing and nicely served. Better Sangria would have been nice. The Arepa's are really something! The size is great cus they fit in your hands yet are jam packed with food.  The arepa I ordered came with shredded steak and plantains and rice and beans on the side. I liked how sweet the food was. The food didn't taste like I expected but it was definitely tasty.  I look forward to visiting again and trying some more menu options. The servers were cool, they took our orders correctly, and were attentive to keep refilling the water bottle at the table.  No complaints there. The atmosphere, the service and the food is just good old comfort, we went in the summer and look forward to going in the fall when we can enjoy the coziness of it all. :) I recommend!",4.0
"The food is amazing! It was the first time to eat areperas and it was a great introduction. I ordered one filled with steak, chicken and veggies but there were also vegetarian options. We also tried a few of the specialty drinks and both were tasty (and very sweet).",4.0

SOO GOOD! Loved the arepas after a day of trekking through the city. Loud music = sad face but the food was THA bomb.,5.0
"I had the beef arepa (w/ green sauce) and a cocada, both yummy. I do wish the arepa came with more as it is not very filling. I've been here a couple times, takeout & dining in, will definitely return and hopefully sample more of the menu.",4.0
#1 pork arepa is SO GOOD.  Tender meat and perfectly seasoned.  I'd give ten stars if I could.,5.0

"Bushwick's superior version of Caracas arepa bar in Manhattan. The service here is good and the food is amazing! I moved here not too long ago and already this place has become one of my favorites. The portions are pretty decent for the price. I've gotten the pulled pork, the juicy chicken with tomato sauce, the steak and chicken, and the ham and cheese. They were all so delicious. My favorite is definitely the steak and chicken though! All the arepas come with 3 different sauces. I'm not exactly sure what each one is, but hey, try them all. They're all pretty good. The passion fruit juice was really tasty-not too sweet and just a little tangy. The coconut milk shake was surprisingly filling and they have a spice in it that makes it really unique. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!",5.0

"Just horrible service. Rude waiter somehow managed to blame us for our simple order taking 40 minutes to prepare. The food was delivered in two groups for some reason. Half our party had to sit and wait. On the plus side the food was really good. But damn, really shitty service.",2.0
"Hubby and I came here late one night, and honestly we were not impressed. A friend of mine recommended it, but apparently we do not enjoy arepas. Nonethless, we are willing to give it another try based on our friend's strong review.Specifically, the food seemed very bland and the service was not good. We order a pernil arepa to share, I ordered the Pabellon Criollo (venezuelan national dish-  shredded beef, white rice, black beans, and fried sweet plantains, sprinkled with salty cheese with plain arepa) and hubby ordered the cachapa (a pancake made with sweet tender corn with guayanes cheese). We are incredibly in love with pernil (especially from Puerto Viejo) so we were extremely saddened at how uneventful this lace's pernil arepa was. My dish was good (despite lacking rich flavor), but I really just don't like arepas because that was the only thing that I did not eat from my dish. Hubby liked his dish a lot. We also had the malta, but it was weird. We prefer the local boedga malta brands rather than their malta polar.

"Ummm... Discriminate much? I just read a review similar to our experience, so our hunch must be correct. I placed an order online via Yelp for ASAP pick-up since my fiancé offered to take the quick drive over to the restaurant. When he got there and spoke to the guy behind the counter, the guy told him our order would be ready in 5 minutes. 5 minutes turned into 25... Still no food. Yet, during that 25 minutes, THREE customers had come in, ordered food to go and left - all girls (Based on the other review, the customer thought the servers were racist against Latinos. My fiancé is a Latino male.) So my fiancé approached the counter again to ask where our food was. Again, the guy said 5 minutes! However, it was obvious that they ran out of arepas after serving everyone else and needed to make more now. WTF?!? While he continued to wait (and they seemed to be annoyed that he was standing at the counter), another couple girls came in and asked what was available right away since they were in a hurry. The guy tells them what WE ordered is available right away! He was going to give them OUR food! Fortunately, the cook glanced at my fiancé and shook his head ""no"" at the guy. We finally got our food nearly an hour after placing our order.The absolutely awful service was enough for my fiancé to say, ""We are never getting food from there again."" Agreed. It's a shame, though, since the arepas weren't bad and so close to home.",1.0
"Horrible first experience here. I will not be back. I stopped in earlier this week to order 3 arepas, 1 order of tostones, and a coconut shake for take out. The guy who took my order told me it would take 15 minutes so I went out and came back in 15 minutes. He said it'll take 2-3 more minutes so I stood by the counter to wait. I waited for almost another 15 minutes before he told me oh sorry it'll take another 2-3 minutes because we ran out of arepas so they need to make more. But it ended up being another 10 minutes before I actually got my food. No apologies or anything from the guy who lied not 1 time to me but 3 times about when my food would be ready. Basically I waited about 45 minutes for my food when at first it was supposed to be 15 minutes. And when I got it, the arepas were not even cooked, it was still soggy and doughy. And the tostones were hard as hell, almost broke a tooth. Flavors of the meats were okay but it doesn't make up for everything else. It was inexcusable.",1.0
"Food is ok, portions are on the smaller side, and a bit salty and pricey for what is .It's not expensive place but I've gone to dozen of places that have, rice, beans, pabellon/ropa vieja and they serve a lot more for the same price.

"The food here tastes good, but I really feel that it is overpriced.  I spent $25 bucks on take out: 2 arepas and a salad.  My wife and I were still very hungry afterwards.  The arepas were pretty small, and the salad was a few leaves of spinach covered with some beans,  and a measly portion of artichokes, red peppers, sundried tomatoes.    Unless you are an upscale place, which this place is certainly not, I feel like $25 worth of food should at least make you feel full.  This much money on take out will feed 2 people from almost any other restaurant.",2.0
"Fantastic arepas and empanadas at this place! Everything from start to finish tasted ah-mazing. We had the cocada milkshake and the Guanama soursop to drink. They also brought us water from these crazy glass bottles (every table has a different kind). Then came the vegetariana empanadas (black beans, fresh coconut, jalapeños, and green peppers). They have three different sauces on the table: one vegetable green sauce, one mustardy yellow, and a red spicy sauce. The green sauce was great for the already spicy veggie empanadas. We also had the vegetariana arepas. Soooo good. It was a thick fried pita with sweet plantains, avocado, and a salty white cheese. The red spicy sauce was best with this. Finally, we finished it off with a chocolate concoction of a thick fudge over ""Maria cookies"" whatever those are... Regardless, the only thing dancing more than my hips to the Latin music playing throughout dinner, were my tastebuds to this deliciousness. And with a total bill of about $30 for two people, I have a feeling that I will be back here quite often.",5.0

Yet, during that 25 minutes, THREE customers had come in, ordered food to go and left - all girls (Based on the other review, the customer thought the servers were racist against Latinos. My fiancé is a Latino male.) So my fiancé approached the counter again to ask where our food was. Again, the guy said 5 minutes! However, it was obvious that they ran out of arepas after serving everyone else and needed to make more now. WTF?!? While he continued to wait (and they seemed to be annoyed that he was standing at the counter), another couple girls came in and asked what was available right away since they were in a hurry. The guy tells them what WE ordered is available right away! He was going to give them OUR food! Fortunately, the cook glanced at my fiancé and shook his head ""no"" at the guy. We finally got our food nearly an hour after placing our order.The absolutely awful service was enough for my fiancé to say, ""We are never getting food from there again."" Agreed. It's a shame, though, since the arepas weren't bad and so close to home.",1.0
"Horrible first experience here. I will not be back. I stopped in earlier this week to order 3 arepas, 1 order of tostones, and a coconut shake for take out. The guy who took my order told me it would take 15 minutes so I went out and came back in 15 minutes. He said it'll take 2-3 more minutes so I stood by the counter to wait. I waited for almost another 15 minutes before he told me oh sorry it'll take another 2-3 minutes because we ran out of arepas so they need to make more. But it ended up being another 10 minutes before I actually got my food. No apologies or anything from the guy who lied not 1 time to me but 3 times about when my food would be ready. Basically I waited about 45 minutes for my food when at first it was supposed to be 15 minutes. And when I got it, the arepas were not even cooked, it was still soggy and doughy. And the tostones were hard as hell, almost broke a tooth. Flavors of the meats were okay but it doesn't make up for everything else. It was inexcusable.",1.0
"Food is ok, portions are on the smaller side, and a bit salty and pricey for what is .It's not expensive place but I've gone to dozen of places that have, rice, beans, pabellon/ropa vieja and they serve a lot more for the same price. Welcome to world of Williamsburg...One thing that did stand out was the cocada(coconut shake) they make an outstanding one  that is reasonably priced. I actually did return just to pick up 2 cocadas to go..other than that...everything else is forgettable",2.0
"The food here tastes good, but I really feel that it is overpriced.  I spent $25 bucks on take out: 2 arepas and a salad.  My wife and I were still very hungry afterwards.  The arepas were pretty small, and the salad was a few leaves of spinach covered with some beans,  and a measly portion of artichokes, red peppers, sundried tomatoes.    Unless you are an upscale place, which this place is certainly not, I feel like $25 worth of food should at least make you feel full.  This much money on take out will feed 2 people from almost any other restaurant.",2.0
"Fantastic arepas and empanadas at this place! Everything from start to finish tasted ah-mazing. We had the cocada milkshake and the Guanama soursop to drink. They also brought us water from these crazy glass bottles (every table has a different kind). Then came the vegetariana empanadas (black beans, fresh coconut, jalapeños, and green peppers). They have three different sauces on the table: one vegetable green sauce, one mustardy yellow, and a red spicy sauce. The green sauce was great for the already spicy veggie empanadas. We also had the vegetariana arepas. Soooo good. It was a thick fried pita with sweet plantains, avocado, and a salty white cheese. The red spicy sauce was best with this. Finally, we finished it off with a chocolate concoction of a thick fudge over ""Maria cookies"" whatever those are... Regardless, the only thing dancing more than my hips to the Latin music playing throughout dinner, were my tastebuds to this deliciousness. And with a total bill of about $30 for two people, I have a feeling that I will be back here quite often.",5.0
"There are a million things that make this place great, but I think I can sum it up in a few points:-Paisa cheese like manna from heaven-Multiple delicious sauces to get crazy with-The cocada. My GOD, the cocada!-Isaac who works here is an Italian-speaking babeJust. Go.",5.0

"I can't stop eating their arepas. Specifically their Pabellon Arepa - they are reasonably priced and definitely filling. I also recommend the coconut milkshake.

Everyone at my table, myself included, has worked in the service industry so we were blown away at how she was handling the stress.

They also put three sauces on your table and the green one was extremely delicious - creamy, garlicy, good. The only gripe I had, were the drinks. My bf had a coconut milkshake which was kind of too sweet and nothing spectacular and I had the sangria which was plain out not good. I don't know what kind of wine they used for it, but it was definitely not a good one. And the three pieces of apple in there were also kind of disappointing.

"I ordered take out from here for my lunch break at work. A Venezuelan co-worker suggested it and said I MUST try it. What's a better endorsement?! I ordered something simple but delicious.

Coconut oil for cooking, my hair, my skin, coconut milk, coconut water...The cocada out did them all and I really want this recipe enough consider working there part-time.The pork arepa was well made, juicy and flavorful. They didn't mask everything with cheese just enough to get that salty melty goodness here and there. The star of the arepa was really the pork. It could stand well alone as just a side of pork with veggies or something. A nice crispness without being dry and wet without being oily. Well done.It was a bit high priced considering the abundance of Latin flavor in the area but it is restaurant style and serves a trendier crowd. Not a daily meal but maybe once per week until I can afford to employee my own cocada maker. I can't wait to try more things from here!",4.0

"Dined here for a second time last night. I was craving the cachapas since the first time I visited and they were sold out. I finally tried it and it was HORRIBLE.

It wasn't heated up all the way. We actually waited 20 minutes after receiving our appetizers for this, and it seemed as if they took the cachapa corn cake out of the freezer and put it on the grill for 2 minutes and nothing happened to the cheese because it was so disappointing I ate half of it and left the rest on the plate. Cheese looked like it was all still there. I'm surprised the server didn't ask me what was wrong.Service was alright.

"Arepera Guacuco is located in Bushwick on  the very corner of Irving Ave and Troutman. It is a quaint dim lighted restaurant that specializes in Venezuelan food. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar where you can see the kitchen and everything being cooked right before our eyes. We used a Groupon that was for one appetizer, two entrees and two drinks. However, the waiter allowed us to use it for any orders up to a $45 value. With that being said I had a pabellon empanada(corn like patty) with tajadas (sweet plantains with grated cheese on top) and my boyfriend had the pernil arepa with tajadas. By accident they gave us a pabellon arepa and let us have it for free. The empanada was huge. I never had one so big and heavy in my life. The pabellon was very filling consisting with shredded beef, sweet plantains, black beans, and white cheese. It was very yummy. The pernil arepa (shredded pork) was good but lacked a little flavor so it went well with the green sauce. We also had 3 drinks each. They don't serve hard liquor, however their sangria was very tasty. Overall, the service was quick with a friendly staff and very affordable prices with good portions will definitely come back.",4.0
"Went here for a date on a Friday night - it was crowded but we got a seat right away.  While the service was somewhat slow, our arepas were incredible!  The seafood was cooked excellently and the beef was just the right amount of spicy.  I could tell they had *just* been cooked because they were very hot.  I would definitely come here again, maybe on a weeknight when they weren't quite so crowded.",4.0
"Typically I don't like to try things for the first time as takeout but I was around the corner at Three Diamond Door and was hungry so I could chow on some arepas while drinking some beer.

"Such delicious food! Their signature item, arepas, are amazing. The pabellon (shredded beef, plantains, salty cheese, and black beans) is the best, though I usually get a pernil (roast pork) arepa and a pabellon empanada, the empanadas being more food and less money than the arepa (and I guarantee it will be the best empanada you've had anywhere).Oh, and to top it all off, the best part is the guasacaca sauce: a magical green concoction with fresh herbs and vegetables and honestly if I knew all that was in it I'd be mass-producing it already.

"Such delicious food! Their signature item, arepas, are amazing. The pabellon (shredded beef, plantains, salty cheese, and black beans) is the best, though I usually get a pernil (roast pork) arepa and a pabellon empanada, the empanadas being more food and less money than the arepa (and I guarantee it will be the best empanada you've had anywhere).Oh, and to top it all off, the best part is the guasacaca sauce: a magical green concoction with fresh herbs and vegetables and honestly if I knew all that was in it I'd be mass-producing it already. It will be incorporated into the centerpieces at my wedding and should have been put into the Voyager spacecraft.",5.0

"SO YUMMY!! A friend introduced me to this place. The food was UH-MAZE-ZING. The service was lovely. The waiter was friendly. The sangria was actually sangria, instead of the fruit juice and ice that a lot of palces give you these days. My friend and I shared two arepas and an empanada. I thought Mama's was good, but WOW! Also, the food came out pretty quickly, and was piping hot and obviously freshly made instead of frozen and then warmed up, another plus. OM NOM NOM!",4.0
"Excellent, excellent food, ambiance and service. I love coming here for Sunday brunch with friends. The food is fresh, delicate, very well-prepared.

"My bf and I went here one night off of a groupon. We had the sweet plantains with cheese to start. They weren't the way I like them...they were very dry and not that sweet. I like them cooked when they are very ripe and they have a nice crust but mushy on the inside. It was my first time having it with cheese on it and that was definitely interesting. Not bad but different. Next we had two empanadas...the vegetarian and the pabellon. The pabellon was really good and the meat inside was very tasty. The vegetarian was good. The empanada crust was sweet tasting and that was different than what I am used to. I liked it at first but after two bites or so I found myself not really enjoying it so much and drenching it with green sauce. I guess I'm not into sweet and savory flavors mixed together. We had the arepas next. I had the pernil and he had the steak and chicken mix. This was the most disappointing part. My pernil was just greasy and had no real flavor...a major bummer. I doused it in green sauce to help but it still didn't give me the flavor I craved. My bf said the same about his meats. That they weren't very well seasoned or flavorful at all but the sauces gave it a boost. I love their sauces, but I feel like they shouldn't rely on the sauces to give their food flavor. I had the passion fruit juice and my bf had the coconut milk drink. They were both delightful. Overall, it was different and I enjoyed it. Nothing mind blowing but definitely not bad.",3.0
"Delicious arepas 5 mins driving from my house!  The arepa itself was very crispy (hit or miss, the first few were crispy the second round not as much-maybe this is why you should eat in and not order out) which is something I have not experienced at Arepas Cafe, Guayoyo, Patacon Piaso or Caracas Arepas Bar.  My friends ordered the special of the day which was shredded chicken, cheese and avocado, vegetarian and the grilled chicken and steak.  They all hit home especially with the green and orange sauce.  The hot sauce was decent too but didn't really hit it out of the ball park.  The coconut shake was amazing.  Get it as a dessert!I also ordered a seafood soup which was delicious.  I'm very found of Latin American food and I've been to Venezuela before so I was expecting it to be salty which is very typical and yes it was.  There was some rice that was in the soup which gave it a nice touch and the only suggestion I have is if they served the soup with a side of rice to make it more hearty and to dilute the saltiness.  Or if they served the soup with a plain arepa to dip it in. MMMMmmmmm.  It was too cold to get the papelon con limon but next time I will try it!  Try this place.  It's so good, won't disappoint and doesn't have long crazy lines like some other places.  I'm so glad I found great arepas within 5 mins from my house.  No need now to go into the city!",4.0
"A great addition to the Arepas wars in NYC!This is one of the best NYC restaurant experiences we have had in a long time! I have been to a half a dozen restaurants  lately that were so bad that I can't review them! So this was a welcome change!

It is much better than mine!I have tried different styles of Arepas. I like The Arepas from Venezuela. And these are from Venezuela.Everyone is comparing it to Caracas. I have never been to the Manhattan location but tried each and every menu item from Caracas in Rockaway. I think I prefer Caracas only because it was at the beach. Anything at the beach tastes better. I had the Pernil (pork)  and the Arepas at Caracas seemed to be more marinated, This was a little dry compared to Caracas. The board walk at Caracas was destroyed so I do not know if they will reopen it depends on whether they rebuild the board walk.And I won't go to the Manhattan location. It looks like it is super cramped. So since I can't go to Caracas in Rockaway I will go here!The decor is nice and clean and I have no problems with the location. In fact I used to live in the neighborhood when it was really bad. I lived there for about 3 months. It has changed a lot for the better.The most outstanding part of the meal was the Coconut milk shake. It had a Marciano cherry in it and Cinnamon! It is too cold to enjoy fully for me. For me it has to be at least 80 degrees but it was uber delicious!For those of you that have not tried an Arepas, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar…thedomesticman.com/2012/…It varies because of how they make Arepas but many are gluten free if you have wheat allergies or sensitivities. glutenfreegirl.com/arepasI have some wheat sensitivities not a full blown allergy but I am able to eat Arepas with no problem.Bottom line 4 and a half stars for everything except service.

Who wants to be watched constantly as they perform their job? The cook was the only one there and she sat us down herself.

Cook was very nice and warm in taking our orders and bringing over our dishes.APPETIZERS:1) We started off with Tajadas (sweet plantains with aged cheese). Plantains were thinly sliced, dry and not too flavorful. Cheese gave it a good effect. I like my fried plantains moist and surrounded by caramelized sugar.2) Ham and Cheese Empanada. Huge but lacked flavor. You're better off with Hot Pockets. The orange sauce that came with it made it better.MAIN:1) Veggie Arepa (avocado, guayanes cheese, sweet plantains, and tomato). Bland. Slather on dressing for this one.2) Pabellon Arepa (shredded beef, white, salty cheese, black beans and sweet plantains) After eating this, I realized I'm not a big fan of the corn dough. Just lifeless to me. But the filling itself is amazing. Wish I had rice with it. This arepa is really messy and I guarantee you'll be using your fork to finish it off.DRINKS:1) Guanabana Juice (soursop). Served with ice and it's tasty for the first couple of sips but then it loses it's appeal. I've had this in the Philippines served blended with ice and it's amazing. Wish it was served this way.  This is a real gem of a fruit.2) Cocada (coconut milk shake) This was definitely the highlight of the night. I'm not a big fan of coconut but this drink was heavenly.

"Not much to add.  Yes to the coconut shakes, vegetarian arepa, and black beans! Yes to the plantains of any shade.  And the house salad and papelon con limon deserve notable mention too.  The non-vegetarian arepas probably contain the amount of meat you need in a month, but suitable for the deeply carnivorous.  My only complaint the arepas in takeout orders are sometimes soggy and tasteless--not at all like they are in the restaurant?  I have yet to get to the bottom of this.  Also the flan could use some work.  Still, five stars for being the best go-to place around.",5.0
"OH. EM. Gizzle. I mean Gee. I mean jizzle. I mean... I just creamed my jeggings this place is so darn GOOD!!!!! WOOO HOOOO!!!!! AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DELICIOSO.... Let me tell you: one time, in Venezuela, I flew to Caracas for like, FOUR days because I am gangsta like that and it was American Thanksgiving... Whoo whoo hah hhah so yea we had some bomb empanadas down there. My wealthy Argentine friend Val had a housekeeper (who lived in her sick apt in the 'big (beeg) sticks' year round while her parents only resided there maybe six weeks out of the whole year. Mega bucks. Like those subway ads that are so gauche they're all ""Yeah, THAT kind of rich..."" But she was!!! I think I had a good intro to empanadas and since in the states I have only really scoffed at the ones I've seen here. They are just not that good-looking. I'm gonna review Tabare soon too because their empanadas are also amazing. So WHERE is the review, you ask? Of THIS place? Ok. Here goes: Got a vegetarian empanada, it was about 6"" long and 4""across and maybe 1.5"" deep. Maybe 2"" deep... stuffed with the most delightful of things: caramelized coconut flakes that squirted their delicious sweet greasy juice onto the black beans, the fried/caramelized plantain and sauteed green peppers with a bit of jalepeno (or jabenero? either/or) spread throughout for extra amazing spice. Comes with three sauces: TRY THEM ALL!!!! I loved the green one. It was slightly cucumber-y, then the green one was actually really spicy (good) and a sort of mayo-esque one... We wanted to get the coconut milkshake but they were out. We also split the arepa with beef/plantain/salty queso.... WOW.... perfectly stewed beef, totally tender, amazing flavors, in an authentic corn type flatbread. It was like, so effin dreamy that I was stressed out about it ending. And I was stressed out about the trio of sauces, which also all proved to be unbearably delightful, so I was all... ""Should I squirt some green sauce in there? Or will it dilute the already awesomeness happening inside?"" So mind-bendingly awesome that I couldn't take it. I'm still stressed about it. This is like what my Buddhist lamas say is the kind of food that maybe creates attachment and so pay attention to that. I can definitely see getting all wrapped up in a fantasy about this beef while trying to calm-abide. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I mean, om. Whatever. It's so good!!!! Empanadas are $5 each and probably enough for a meal alone, but your mouth will want more. Trust. The arepa was like $7. So altogether we got this great lunch with tax and tip for about $11 each.

I do tend to drench my arepas with the green and pink sauces on the table, I cant help it. The green sauce has cilantro and lime. The other is a ketchup/mayo combo. I also tried my mother's arepa, the Pernil. Great pick also. My second time around i had another Parillada (because i cant get enough) and also tried the chicken. I'm not a fan of the chicken. It's a tomato based chicken. If it were grilled chicken, i'm sure it'd be delicious. Any who that was my sister's pick and she loved it. It depends on your taste buds i suppose.",4.0
"DO IT! It's so good. So, so good. Sweet plaintain appetizer? Cocadas coconut smoothies? The arepas? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, and put that green sauce on everything. EVERYTHING. The service is slow, but still...5 stars. It's just that good.",5.0
"Not much to add.  Yes to the coconut shakes, vegetarian arepa, and black beans! Yes to the plantains of any shade.  And the house salad and papelon con limon deserve notable mention too.  The non-vegetarian arepas probably contain the amount of meat you need in a month, but suitable for the deeply carnivorous.  My only complaint the arepas in takeout orders are sometimes soggy and tasteless--not at all like they are in the restaurant?  I have yet to get to the bottom of this.  Also the flan could use some work.  Still, five stars for being the best go-to place around.",5.0
"OH. EM. Gizzle. I mean Gee. I mean jizzle. I mean... I just creamed my jeggings this place is so darn GOOD!!!!! WOOO HOOOO!!!!! AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DELICIOSO.... Let me tell you: one time, in Venezuela, I flew to Caracas for like, FOUR days because I am gangsta like that and it was American Thanksgiving... Whoo whoo hah hhah so yea we had some bomb empanadas down there. My wealthy Argentine friend Val had a housekeeper (who lived in her sick apt in the 'big (beeg) sticks' year round while her parents only resided there maybe six weeks out of the whole year. Mega bucks. Like those subway ads that are so gauche they're all ""Yeah, THAT kind of rich..."" But she was!!! I think I had a good intro to empanadas and since in the states I have only really scoffed at the ones I've seen here. They are just not that good-looking. I'm gonna review Tabare soon too because their empanadas are also amazing. So WHERE is the review, you ask? Of THIS place? Ok. Here goes: Got a vegetarian empanada, it was about 6"" long and 4""across and maybe 1.5"" deep. Maybe 2"" deep... stuffed with the most delightful of things: caramelized coconut flakes that squirted their delicious sweet greasy juice onto the black beans, the fried/caramelized plantain and sauteed green peppers with a bit of jalepeno (or jabenero? either/or) spread throughout for extra amazing spice. Comes with three sauces: TRY THEM ALL!!!! I loved the green one. It was slightly cucumber-y, then the green one was actually really spicy (good) and a sort of mayo-esque one... We wanted to get the coconut milkshake but they were out. We also split the arepa with beef/plantain/salty queso.... WOW.... perfectly stewed beef, totally tender, amazing flavors, in an authentic corn type flatbread. It was like, so effin dreamy that I was stressed out about it ending. And I was stressed out about the trio of sauces, which also all proved to be unbearably delightful, so I was all... ""Should I squirt some green sauce in there? Or will it dilute the already awesomeness happening inside?"" So mind-bendingly awesome that I couldn't take it. I'm still stressed about it. This is like what my Buddhist lamas say is the kind of food that maybe creates attachment and so pay attention to that. I can definitely see getting all wrapped up in a fantasy about this beef while trying to calm-abide. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I mean, om. Whatever. It's so good!!!! Empanadas are $5 each and probably enough for a meal alone, but your mouth will want more. Trust. The arepa was like $7. So altogether we got this great lunch with tax and tip for about $11 each. Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum. Love.",5.0

Terrific food and excellent service in a quaint little corner place with great music in Brooklyn.  Our first time eating Venezuelan cuisine and we loved it!  The plantains with salty cheese were amazing starters.  We also had the pernil arepas... tasty and filling and vegetarian empanada.  All freshly made.  We also had their typical national dish of pulled beef... also excellent.

I have been here quite a few times now. I moved to Bushwick a month ago and have been to Arepera Guacuco at least one third of those days. Their cocada coconut milkshake is immaculate.

a pretty decent price for NY and the food is definitely tasted. Menu is simple without excessive options. kitschy decor,4.0
This place is amazing! I came here with my Venezuelan girlfriend and she even said it was like being back home! The areperas where so good and they make the empanadas from scratch and as soon as u order them. Plus the owner Leonardo was friendly and very attentive .. He knew it was our first time and sent my gf and I over a coconut shake to share. Can't beat that.,5.0
"These little sandwiches are lights-out delicious. Incredible bread, slow-cooked meats, great sauces. Easily one of my favorite places to eat in Bushwick. We didn't try it, but it's worth noting that they offer a $19 bottle of wine. That could come in handy in the future. I'd agree with previous reviewers that it can get spendy in a hurry, at least as far as places in this neighborhood are concerned.",4.0
Best arepa spot ever! You can't leave guacuco before trying out the arepa pavellon! It's delicious,5.0
I have been here quite a few times now. I moved to Bushwick a month ago and have been to Arepera Guacuco at least one third of those days. Their cocada coconut milkshake is immaculate. I recommend the pabellon empanadas. The platanos really set it off; and also the homemade orange sauce(don't know what its's called). Besides food this place has a nice intimate vibe at night and good quick service. My only complaint is they don't have guacamole but that's extraneous so 5 stars. I love this place!,5.0
"First time having arepas!  Feeling kind of sheepish that we've lived here so long without having had this great dish.  We randomly came upon this place while exploring Bushwick. Price looked right and in we went.  Definitely order the coconut milkshake.  Or two.  It was a very satisfying meal, and on top of that there was a coupon on foursquare offering 50% off.  Score!",3.0

4 stars because every other arepera joint I have been to has not touched this place!I always feel uncomfortable asking someone if they would like to get arepa because I cant say it in the right accent. It ends up sounding like I should goto jail.Coconut shake is AMAZINGGet it as a dessertThe sweet plantains are also a mustEvery arepa I have gotten has been good.

"I must say I was utterly disappointed in this place. I paid 23 dollars for three areperas with dry meat and chalky tasting vegetables. In South America an arepera on the street costs no more than 75 cents and has a ton more meat and filling in it. These were merely appetizer portions at best.

"Was hanging out with the best friend at her place in Bushwick. Eager to try the new place up her block, we endured the 3 minute walk to Guacuco. We were greeted warmly by a bilingual server, who proceeded to explain the menu and tell us about some specials. My friend ordered a fancy coconut milkshake. I was fiending for a Diet Coke, which they did not have, but the server was totally cool with me picking one up from a local bodega. The bff and basically wanted every arepa on the menu but we decided on splitting the fish empanada and ordering one arepa each. My friend got one with sweet plantains, shredded beef, and soft cheese. I was ruminating between the mixed seafood arepa and the chicken/steak one. The waiter told me to go with the seafood one. The food breakdown: Fish empanada had a great crust but was too tuna-fishy for me. Friend liked it though. My seafood arepa was a bit rubbery, but the tomato sauce that it was cooked in was delish, so I was willing to ignore the overcooked squid. My friend's arepa was the real winner. She gave me a bite, but nicely allowed me to take like 20 more. The accompanying sauces can only be described by one word: TITS!! The corn sauce was naturally sweet and blended well with the green sauce, which tasted tomatillo and cilantro-ish. YUM! Dinner was very reasonably priced. I got the most expensive arepa, at 8 dollars. Dinner for 2, with the app and the milkshake was 25. Not bad. I'd definitely return, but I'd order what the bff got. Guacuco doesn't taste as fancy as Caracas, but is a nice substitute when I'm craving arepas and I'm too high to take the L to Bedford.",4.0
"5 stars for really REALLY patient service staff! We walked in a few days post 'Blizzard of 2010' with a hungry crew of adults and kids during lunch time. Although we were the only ones dining there at the time, the kids were going bananas with all the snow outside and rushing in and out of the place, practically tearing the joint apart that at some point we thought we might have to offer to buy the whole restaurant before they tore it down!We had a bunch of things on the menu but some standouts were the tostones- each one was a perfectly seasoned/dressed two-bite starter that definitely put to shame most tostones I've had before these. The empanadas have a perfect crunch- I wish they had more vegetarian choices for empanadas other than solamente queso. They got the cocada down, but too bad they don't have a liquor license yet (nor will they let you BYOB, sadface) to throw in a shot of ron/rum to make that shake really come alive!The food was great, but I was left wishing they had more vegetarian arepa choices other than the 1. I asked to have black beans added in mine which they did, but it made me appreciate Caracas' menu for having several vegetarian choices (something that'll keep me going back!) than only one on the menu.I hope this place continues to grow and add some more vegetarian-friendly choices to the menu as well...that'll keep us coming back for more!",4.0

After about four calls I had enough and drove there myself. The guy was unapologetic and only gave me a discount after the manager came by. Tonight, I ordered delivery again at 9pm and the guy who answered said they were closed. I had their website open and it clearly said ""open till 1030pm"".

"I can't help walking by Guacuco without an intense urge to stop in and get a ""Cocada"" which is basically just a refreshing, light, coconut milkshake topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Now when I crave sweets, this is what I want.  When I went, aside from trying their heavenly shake, we tried 2 arepas, the shredded chicken with avocado and the chicken in red tomato sauce. Both were great, but I did favor the chicken in tomato sauce. They come with two very light, fresh sauces that are incredible!The staff was friendly, the food was good and very affordable, and the coconut milkshake is beyond!",5.0
"Totally laid back place, with friendly staff and great food. I ordered a few empanadas and did not realize how BIG they are. So, be advised! The beef empanada was delicious. Not a typical dried, pulled meat...this was juicy, flavourful and just right. Also, the pollo arepa is absolutely worth a trip. This is not a flaky arepa shell it's fatter dough and just a bit crunchy. I dug it though in the red sauce.Be sure to try to green sauce.",4.0
"This is my favorite restaurant to gather with friends. It's got cheap wine and good food. I took some Venezuelan friends here and they all loved it--although they were a bit indignant about paying $7 for what was to them cheap street food. Ambience is a little off during the day but once the sun goes down they bring out the candles and the whole mood shifts. I especially like it in the summertime when they have outdoor seating. While you probably came for arepas, the seafood soup is incredible. They deliver on Grubhub and last time I checked there was a Groupon deal available.",5.0
"Was hanging out with the best friend at her place in Bushwick. Eager to try the new place up her block, we endured the 3 minute walk to Guacuco. We were greeted warmly by a bilingual server, who proceeded to explain the menu and tell us about some specials. My friend ordered a fancy coconut milkshake. I was fiending for a Diet Coke, which they did not have, but the server was totally cool with me picking one up from a local bodega. The bff and basically wanted every arepa on the menu but we decided on splitting the fish empanada and ordering one arepa each. My friend got one with sweet plantains, shredded beef, and soft cheese. I was ruminating between the mixed seafood arepa and the chicken/steak one. The waiter told me to go with the seafood one. The food breakdown: Fish empanada had a great crust but was too tuna-fishy for me. Friend liked it though. My seafood arepa was a bit rubbery, but the tomato sauce that it was cooked in was delish, so I was willing to ignore the overcooked squid. My friend's arepa was the real winner.

We had ordered some other random things and didnt realize we were not charged for 2.

Their credit card machine was down (again, which has happened to me before there) and they made my friend walk over to another block to an atm to get out money. You would think they would have taken off an arepa or give you something for the inconvenience, since she now has to pay money for bank fees, but no.

"I've driven past this place several times and I'm so happy I finally stopped in to try it. My original plan was to get a late night bite at the Peruvian place up the block, but it was extremely full so this place was a backup plan, and I am so happy that it was. Let's start with my initial experience upon walking in. Nice decor, nice lighting, and a very warm host/waiter who greeted us upon entering. GREAT START! As I read the menu, I started to get excited. I LOVE Arepas, I have several Colombian friends and have spent many Sundays eating Arepas topped with butter, queso fresco, and eggs. This place is Venezuelan which borders Colombia so the cuisine is very similar, with one major difference in the serving of arepas. Just to give you an idea on what an arepa is, it's a white corn meal cake, the flavor and consistency of the inside is very similar to grits but less gritty almost like polenta, but in a flat circular shape, and with a slight crunch on the outside as they are normally pan or griddle fried. The size and exact flavor can differ in recipe and application. Venezuelans stuff them kind of like a South American pita sandwich. At this point, I know I'm either going to love  or hate it. Here is my breakdown on each one:Tostones (fried green plantains with a combination of sauces and cheese):The tostones come out, they have been sliced very thin lengthwise, and some have a cilantro based sauce, others have a very popular South American sauce very similar to French dressing, all are garnished with crumbled aged, white cheese. The tostones are fried well, nice crunch on the outside, while the inside is soft. They are fairly thin so the it's only a small section is soft and creamy. The aged crumbled white cheese with the sauce mixture add a comforting richness to them, and the play of the saltiness of the cheese and the slight heat from the sauces work very well. Arepas:Mariscada (squids, shrimp, and mussels in red tomatoes sauce)This comes out and the mixture of seafood is actually not inside of the arepa, it's served seperate with the arepa on the side. My first reaction is slightly confused, as the filling is normally stuffed, but I decide to slice my arepa open and stuff it myself. My first bite into the arepa and I'm extremely happy. The maza (corn meal mixture) is PERFECT, creamy, a slight hint of salt which really brings out the corn flavor. I try a little of the seafood mixture and it's also GREAT. Everything is extremely tender (even the squid) both the shrimp and mussels are cooked perfectly. I can taste the garlic, tomatoes, and Spanish Olive oil under the flavor of the seafood. It's saucy but not soupy. It's GREAT. As I scoop the mixture into my arepa, and begin to stuff my face. :D I realize  why they don't serve the mixture inside the arepa. There is just too much! I can't stuff it all inside the arepa. My arepa is completely packed and there is still more of seafood on the plate. Also the sides of my arepa have sauce and filling coming out of it. They clearly know what they are doing and I've been SCHOOLED! :D Salchicha (sausage in pink sauce)It says it's sausage but in reality it's hotdogs in pink sauce. The hotdogs are thin in 1/4 slices and served with the ketchup/mayo based pink sauce. I should have known these were going to be hotdogs, as in many South American countries, Salchichas refers to hotdogs and not sausage (salchipapa). This one is okay, it taste good, the arepa is delicious but I can't say I'm blown away by it. I mean, it's sliced hotdogs with ketchup and mayo. It's... aight.Empanadas:Pabellon Empanada (shredded beef, black beans, white salty cheese & sweet plantains)This empanada comes out and it's HUGE! I assumed they would be smaller in size, as that's what I'm accustomed to in other places. It's huge, and it's smoking hot! I finally cut a piece off the end and take a bite. AMAZING!!! The skin of the empanada is not a flour based skin, but rather the same corn based maza used in the arepas, with a one huge difference. They add a little sugar and a little more salt to the maza. It may not sound as a big deal, but the the slightly extra salt, and sugar make the corn flavor scream! The mixture of the melt in your mouth tender beef, the earth creaminess of the black beans, the saltiness of the white aged crumbled cheese and the sweetness of the sweet plantains make this absolutely amazing. At one point I think I actually pulled the empanada away from my mouth and stared at it in amazement. The empanada skin brings it all together, literally and figuratively. Jamon Y Queso (ham and cheese)Queso fresco and ham. Good combo, good flavor. The filling is good, but nothing that really awed me. The skin of the empanada like I stated earlier was amazing.All in all I really enjoyed the food. Solid food, great service, and great prices. I will be returning soon!",4.0

"I have on good authority that the proper name for this establishment is ""Guacuco"".  Other than that, than isn't anything I can say that is not positive about this welcomed addition to my block. 1.I have never had an empanada this delectable in my life. It could just be the fried fish-style batter but because of my dinner last night I will never be visiting an empanada cart again.2.Opened late: Where else in Brooklyn can I get arepas after 9 pm?3.The pink sauce: I used to think nothing could make tartar sauce better.

The hotdogs are thin in 1/4 slices and served with the ketchup/mayo based pink sauce. I should have known these were going to be hotdogs, as in many South American countries, Salchichas refers to hotdogs and not sausage (salchipapa). This one is okay, it taste good, the arepa is delicious but I can't say I'm blown away by it. I mean, it's sliced hotdogs with ketchup and mayo. It's... aight.Empanadas:Pabellon Empanada (shredded beef, black beans, white salty cheese & sweet plantains)This empanada comes out and it's HUGE! I assumed they would be smaller in size, as that's what I'm accustomed to in other places. It's huge, and it's smoking hot! I finally cut a piece off the end and take a bite. AMAZING!!! The skin of the empanada is not a flour based skin, but rather the same corn based maza used in the arepas, with a one huge difference. They add a little sugar and a little more salt to the maza. It may not sound as a big deal, but the the slightly extra salt, and sugar make the corn flavor scream! The mixture of the melt in your mouth tender beef, the earth creaminess of the black beans, the saltiness of the white aged crumbled cheese and the sweetness of the sweet plantains make this absolutely amazing. At one point I think I actually pulled the empanada away from my mouth and stared at it in amazement. The empanada skin brings it all together, literally and figuratively. Jamon Y Queso (ham and cheese)Queso fresco and ham. Good combo, good flavor. The filling is good, but nothing that really awed me. The skin of the empanada like I stated earlier was amazing.All in all I really enjoyed the food. Solid food, great service, and great prices. I will be returning soon!",4.0
"Great for take-out or eating in (they're also on seamless and deliver to the entire Ridgewood/Bushwick area), arepas are filling and cheap, green sauce is INCREDIBLE. Try the pork arepa and a cocada for desert. Perfection.",5.0

"This place is terrific. Family-run and pleasant. A little out of the way, but worth the trip. We especially liked the vegetarian arepa and beef empanada. The sauces they offer are great, too. Don't skimp on the guasacaca. The crillollo plate was a little skimpy for $12.50-- not quite enough beans or meat-- but very tasty. Have a cocada-- kind of a coconut shake/smoothie thing. Also, the quesillo (a kind of Venezuelan flan but better than flan) is as good as any we've had anywhere, including VZ!",5.0
"I have on good authority that the proper name for this establishment is ""Guacuco"".  Other than that, than isn't anything I can say that is not positive about this welcomed addition to my block. 1.I have never had an empanada this delectable in my life. It could just be the fried fish-style batter but because of my dinner last night I will never be visiting an empanada cart again.2.Opened late: Where else in Brooklyn can I get arepas after 9 pm?3.The pink sauce: I used to think nothing could make tartar sauce better. Little did I know...4 thumbs up: I can foresee myself becoming well acquainted with the staff over the next couple of weeks.",5.0

Eat here all the time.Cocada - coconut shake is amazing!I also love their brunch.  The meats are tender and full of flavor.  The Arepes are homemade and taste fresh.  The best part is the restaurant is CLEAN and the staff is friendly.  Also- The food and service is consistent.  I never had any issues.  I can tell the owners are 'happy' and put passion in their food.  Oh and that green spicy sauce is amazing- want to drink it !,5.0
"Oh man. This was my first time trying Venezuelan food and I was not disappointed. The arepas were delicious! I had an avocado one, which was heavenly. Albeit a bit small.

I like the large windows and calming music.Overall, I really enjoyed the food and will definitely return.",4.0
"I got a chicken arepa and it was really yummy, even at $6. The coconut shake was outstanding. The maduros were pretty standard. But wtf with the rice and beans? I expected more than a blob of plain white sticky rice and some gloopy, straight out of the can black beans. The only flavor they seemed to have added was sugar (!?). I can't believe I paid $3.50 for that. Next time I'm sticking to the arepas.",3.0

"The decor was minimal and I say this as a compliment. I don't care for loud or unnecessary flourishes and this place had a casual but clean feel to it. The people that I talked to that worked there were also convivial and nice. And as great as this all is, the real reason I went there was for the food.The fruit juices are indeed delicious. I got the soursap drink (guanábana), which would have benefitted from having less ice in it, which was amazing. It was milky, viscous and sweet, but not too sweet. I want some more right now, actually.The first dish I has was the chicken and avocado arepa. I'm from Miami and the Cuban style arepas are very different than the Venezuelan, the former being about twice the size, heat pressed on both sides and half the price. That said the bread was fresh and hot but the meat and avocado were chilled. It was good, but it surprised me that the inside was cold and I wish I'd known before hand or have had the option for it to be warmed. It was good, just coulda been better. After that I are the seafood empanada, which was filled with what would best be described as the meat in a seafood stew. I saw fish pieces and small tentacles. I shouldn't have eaten the last half as I was already full from the arepa (I normally eat small amounts of food a few times a day so a typical portioned restaurant meal is too much for me). The empanada had a slightly crispy layer above the more succulent cornmeal shell. I found the bread to be overly filling and did think to myself ""fried tamale"" for moment. I like the Argentine style flour pastry-shell  empanadas that are baked better but it was still pretty good. I put a bunch of the green sauce, made of fresh garlic and cilantro, on everything. The pink sauce tasted too strongly of mayo, which I'm not a fan of, and the hot sauce, though good, was not hot. But I take bites of fresh Indian hot peppers and oftentimes tell Thai places to make it so spicy that most normal people would turn it back. And speaking of turning back, I'd go back to eat there but it's not going to be a new favorite place to go. Though I say this without having tried any of their entrees, which looked good.

Since we were obviously still hungry, we ordered the empanadas, which were a lot better as far as flavor. The Beef empanada was especially tasty.

I guess you could say the food was good for NYC standards but not really anything to get overly excited about. The arepa was just like any i've had at ""Los Perros"" or ""Los Verdes"" in Miami (which is good but this took way longer and was more expensive) and empanadas may have had too much dough. Overall the food was slightly overpriced and took way too long to come out for what it was but we were so excited we didn't complain at all.

"I don't think a brunch could make me happier.  Warm pillows of goodness with so many delicious options for fillings, it just makes a day good.It's good other times too of course, there's just something about a brunch arepa that really hits the spot.",5.0
A-mazing.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Friendly and helpful service.  They will be getting their liquor license soon too.  We live in the neighborhood and the buzz brought us in.  We are on our way back right now.,5.0
"Great little spot on the corner. The serving size is at first glance a tease. Yet once it's all done, it's satisfying. Great ambiance, great food, great choice. Oh, and the coconut milk shake is a must.",5.0
"I've been here twice. Had the beef/cheese/plantain (Pabellon) arepa, the shredded beef empanada and some fresh juice. The difference between the arepa and empanada are slight since they both pretty much entail ""delicious things stuff into a pastry/bread pocket"". Both are made with the corn meal dough. For the arepa, the dough is cooked on the griddle first (to order, it seems) then subsequently stuffed with the requisite fillings, resembling a sandwich. For the empanada, the fillings are wrapped in the dough and it's all deep fried. The crispy texture on the empanada, while untraditional, is still very good, but it seems to take longer to make. Then again, the last time I went, it was late so the oil may not have been very hot to begin with.Having said all that, the portions are a little small, but the food is packed in densely and the flavors are amazing! And even though there is no need for salt or pepper, the green sauce (I love this sauce, but I can never remember the name) is crucial to the eating experience. Any time i go to a peruvian or venezuelan restaurant, I ask for extra just so I can have it in my fridge. The passion fruit juice was tangy and fresh. All the raves about the cocada are tempting, but I generally don't like coconut. Next time, I'll take the plunge and see how it is. Either way, it isn't too hard justifying paying the money for the quality. Also, they take credit cards (which is probably the reason the prices are a little high for the food/neighborhood). Also, the people that work there are friendly and don't laugh when I speak to them in spanish.",4.0
"One of the best restaurants in Bushwick, great arepas, great atmosphere, great service. Can get a bit crowded, but definitely worth it. The general vibe is great for a date or lunch.",5.0
"Love the staff here, super chill but friendly...the food is soooo GOOD. I have been the past two days in a row and i am seeing it being a weekly habit. Indeed a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Did i mention affordable? Yep..that too.",5.0

"Came when it was not crowded so the food came fast and hot ! Everything was so delicious, the foods had excellent  textures, flavors, colors - this place has it all! It is clean, cute, the waitress was really sweet. The vegetarian arepera's  were to die for! On a super fresh arepera patte with fresh avocado, cheese, tomato, and fried plantains. The empanadas were delightful with beef, black beans, and plantains. Definably try the coconut milkshake - it will transport you to paradise! So fresh, smooth, and sweet.

"Awful delivery food.  All four of our arepas were covered in grease and too limp to pick up.  One of our pork arepas had inedible joint and bone parts in it.  Extremely disappointing given the high reviews on here.  Maybe it's better at the restaurant, but this place will NOT be getting a second chance.",1.0

"I stumbled upon this place after returning home from a weekend away and too hungry to cook -- I can't tell you how thrilled I was! The food is delicious and I agree with the other posters, the owners and staff are very friendly. So far, everything we've had has been delicious -- looking forward to future visits and trying everything on the menu. The various tropical drinks are awesome and well worth a try. Bonus -- they deliver to my neck of the woods in Ridgewood!",5.0

"COCONUT MILKSHAKE!!! Do I really need to say anything else? I think someone else mentioned this amazing concoction in their review but I really don't know if you understand how delicious this is! I used to go all of the way to the vegan place in New Paltz to get a coconut milkshake, but now it's right here in my neighborhood! I suppose I can add a little more substance to this review. The arepas and appetizers are delicious, the staff is incredibly friendly, they are in the process of getting their liquor license, and did I mention the cocada? right. ok. Plus, they're usually open until about 11 or 11:30 on week nights, so if you're in need of a tasty treat before bed, you can run over. yum.",5.0
what a pleasure to see another gem pop up in this neighborhood! the owners are so sweet and accommodating. food is simply delicious- exactly what you'd want from the perfect arepa. the menu is short and sweet with several arepas and fresh juices to choose from. their decor is still very minimal and hopefully won't be overwrought by hipsters...i guess we can share though..,4.0
