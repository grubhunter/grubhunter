"Stumbled upon this by an accident but the food was amazing. Vegan ramen with spinach, tomatoes and avocado was delicious. Portions are on the smaller side (for the price being charged). Will certainly visit again. Minor complain: the seating is uncomfortable. Also the manager was very nice. We got there about 15 minutes before they opened for the dinner service, and he let us in the restaurant rather than waiting in outside in cold.",5.0
"Is Samurai Papa the epitome of kickass restaurant names or what?! I had pork gyoza and chirashi. The gyoza was homemade and I liked the dipping sauce that came with it. It's milder than soy sauce, which I really appreciated. The chirashi is also good. The assorted sashimi used in this dish is undoubtedly fresh. The sushi rice is seasoned perfectly. Honestly, I can just eat the rice by itself and still walk out satisfied. I took 1 star off just because I don't believe this restaurant to be 5-star worthy. It's great, but it's not amazing.",4.0
"The best ramen I have EVER had in NYC. I am still yet to find a place that has better ramen. All my friends agree! I love meat, but the Vegan ramen steals the show. That's not to say the meat-based ramen's here aren't good, they are equally superstars in their own right. They also have ""shots"" of sushi where they layer the rice and fish in tiny wine glass looking shot glasses...talk about presentation! If it's the summer-time, definitely get the green tea shaved ice. Not only does it look pretty, it has a melt-in-your-mouth matcha taste you'll want to experience over and over again! ITADAKIMASU!",5.0
"Is this the best ramen I've ever had? No. Does it hit the spot on a cold day? Absolutely. This place has pretty good ramen, especially for the area. It definitely has a cozy, semi- hip vibe. I like the lighting and the wooden tables. Yeah, I instagrammed that. #noshame Now let's get to food - I ordered the lunch special, which comes with ramen, salad and an appetizer. All for about $10! I opted for the shio ramen, which comes with pork belly, some green onions, mushrooms, a half cooked egg & eggplant(?). What's unique was that they served it with a small bowl of dashi, which is a stock that you can use to adjust the flavor of the ramen. Very cool. Everything was also served in a cool bowl, so I'm a fan. The ramen was pretty good, the pork belly was tender. I added corn in for an extra dollar, and it was well spent! (LUV CORN) It came with a good amount, and I was still eating corn at the end of my meal. The salad was actually a great start to my meal, and I appreciate that it was a salad of mixed greens instead of the usual iceberg salads at Japanese restaurants. The gyoza was alright. Very gyoza, nothing too special about it. I should also mention that serve was great. The server gave me all my food at the appropriate times, so I never had to look for my food. Whenever I was finished with one dish, the next one came soon after. Want to know what really solidified it though? I was unaware that it was cash only, so I had to find an ATM nearby. I asked her if I could go find one, and she said yes. That's a huge amount of trust! I could've totally been a criminal and dine and dashed! But I AM A GOOD PERSON. And came back after walking around a little.  (Btw there's a deli 2 blocks away that had an ATM that lets you take out in increments of $10).",4.0
"My 4 stars comes with a major caveat - I'm not a huge fan of their ramen but their small and shared plates are amazing. FOOD:Ramen: I came with 2 friends and we ordered the 3 version of Tonkotsu ramen. Believe me, I know my ramen and Samurai Papa is doing something different from 99% of ramen restaurants out there. Their broth is rather thick and almost has the consistency of a stew. It's really not at all like the broth you'd get at a typical ramen restaurant, which is clear and not really muddled with what I can only describe as ""pulp"" from ingredients. The broth at Samurai Papa didn't necessarily have a bad flavor, but the consistency threw me off. They provide you with an additional cup of clear broth to add to your ramen, however even when I added all of this, it was still not what I expected. My party agreed that it was a little odd because typically we eat all the noodles but leave the broth, and it was the reverse here. Appetizers/Shared Plates: I believe this is where Samurai Papa shines. We ordered the fried chicken appetizer and it was incredible! Flavors were incredibly complex and basically came like a salad. It was a big portion and well enough to share among the 3 of us. AMBIANCE: I love the decor in here and the communal tables are very spacious so not at all awkward. The restaurant has a very clean look that is distinctly Japanese influenced, with a twist of hipster Brooklyn. My friends and I definitely got a kick out of the beanies that were for sale on the walls. We referred to it as a ""Ramen shop with a small beanie franchise.""CONCLUSION: I will certainly be back here to order many shared plates and sashimi with friends.",4.0

"This restaurant did a little number on me & has destroyed my life. I live so close by & whenever I'm near I have to talk myself out of cashing out my paycheck here because the food is absolutely delicious & the service was amazing! I've been meaning to come around and write a review because the server absolutely wowed me. She was attentive, kind & made me feel like a priority despite their being 3 other people in the restaurant & she being the only person out front. She answered all of my questions without hesitation & was a doll to me and my younger sister who as a teenager can be a little moody. The food was beautifully presented & best of all was worth every penny. The design is very interesting & the bathroom had a sliding door which made me sorta giggle from how rad & authentic to the Japanese tradition of a Shōji door.

Nice chill place. They have family seating so beware as you may be sitting at a table with strangers. I sat at the bar and really enjoyed myself.

"Delicious, it was my second time going there. I love the broth-it's creamy, and it's served in a traditional style so you add more broth to make it more tame. We also got the pork buns which was pretty decent, but I think the pork buns from tottos ramen is still better.Price wise is reasonable-$12 for a bowl. Oh, and it's cash only.This is a nice little gem near my apartment, and I'll definitely be back.",4.0

"While I was in Japan, I had ramen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner consistently for the first few days.  It was not at my behest and it eventually drove me absolutely mad; I vowed to never touch another bowl of ramen for an undetermined amount of time.Arriving back in the States, I kept receiving suggestions to have ramen at the new hip places that just opened.  I refused since I was still in recovery, and not a fan of waiting outside of any establishment in the frigidity of NY.  Months passed, and in my search for a place to reconnect with a dear friend of mine, I came upon Samurai Papa.  Located in East Williamsburg, it's still far enough from the more popular neighborhoods that we ended up not having to wait.The interior has a very minimalist and industrial feel; grey-themed with two communal tables, the middle being the largest, and seating at the bar as well.  The unmarked bathroom is hidden behind sliding doors on the left wall.My yuzu and ginger iced tea had a hint of yuzu flavor, but totally missed the mark on the ginger.  None of that good spiciness was present, whatsoever- only sweetness.We both ordered the sushi shots to start; I got the hamachi(yellowtail) toro shot.  The shots were accompanied by three types of soy: regular, wasabi mixed, and extra spicy.  The tiny spoons were deceiving; I would suggest two spoonfuls- 3 was too overpowering.  The fish itself was divinely fresh.  However, I thought it was priced too high($6) for what it was: a deconstructed roll in a shot glass.  Slicing the fish into small pieces only served to make it seem like there was more than you were being served.  For the highlight of the evening, I settled on the aori miso ramen.  The menu listed a description of the type of broth and ingredients used.  My particular one read as such: ""stock: chicken, lobster, bonito, mussel, garlic, miso paste, sesame oil. topping: sliced pork, soy sauce egg, mixed vegetables, kikurage mushroom.""The broth was absolutely spot on.  It was not too heavy or greasy.  I usually go with tonkotsu(pork based broth), but this miso broth had a depth of flavor that could rival any of those found in Japan.",4.0
"Cute but cash only. Communal tables which I like. We sat at the bar and got miso ramen, extra spicy.

It's just OK. The broth was weird."" I trust this person - we are, after all, friends - but was skeptical at the news. Wasn't Samurai Mama one of the best places in all of Williamsburg, with its succulent udon preparations and bevy of small plates, all served around a gigantic communal table? Hoe hard is it to transition from one type of Japanese noodle to another?Of course, he was right. Samurai Papa is either a minor failure or major disappointment, depending on how much baggage you bring from previous ventures from the same owners. And that broth is at the core of the problem. Whether is the cloudy-white, ill-advised ""vegan broth"" or a spin on the more traditional shoyu sauce, these creations taste unbalanced. The hearty, slow-simmering flavor isn't here, replaced with a mishmash of flavor. The stringy, unimpressive pieces of char siu in my bowl didn't help. They're usually aren't too many bites of meat in a ramen dish - and each one should be wonderful. That wasn't the case here.Even if the signature product is a bust, everything else is successful. Many of the small plates have come over unchanged from Samurai Mama, and they're all worth trying. The space is rawer, more industrial than the sister, appropriate considering this is a much more up-and-coming neighborhood. It would pare with a better designed bowl of hearty noodles.My favorite addition are the ""sushi shots,"" which resemble temaki served in small glasses rather than wrapped in nori are two or three pieces of raw seafood. Each one is a concentrated flavor bomb, especially when paired with the patented Samurai trio of soy sauces. You really can have an excellent meal at Samurai Papa, but you'll just need to avoid their signature dish.",3.0

Samurai Papa is either a minor failure or major disappointment, depending on how much baggage you bring from previous ventures from the same owners. And that broth is at the core of the problem. Whether is the cloudy-white, ill-advised ""vegan broth"" or a spin on the more traditional shoyu sauce, these creations taste unbalanced. The hearty, slow-simmering flavor isn't here, replaced with a mishmash of flavor. The stringy, unimpressive pieces of char siu in my bowl didn't help. They're usually aren't too many bites of meat in a ramen dish - and each one should be wonderful. That wasn't the case here.Even if the signature product is a bust, everything else is successful. Many of the small plates have come over unchanged from Samurai Mama, and they're all worth trying. The space is rawer, more industrial than the sister, appropriate considering this is a much more up-and-coming neighborhood. It would pare with a better designed bowl of hearty noodles.My favorite addition are the ""sushi shots,"" which resemble temaki served in small glasses rather than wrapped in nori are two or three pieces of raw seafood. Each one is a concentrated flavor bomb, especially when paired with the patented Samurai trio of soy sauces. You really can have an excellent meal at Samurai Papa, but you'll just need to avoid their signature dish.",3.0
"Their tonkotsu broth was pretty good, not so much soup which I thought was weird at first but it's thick and good. Noodles could've been harder, too soft for my liking. Cheap Sapporo beer!",4.0
"They've added a 'new' ramen to their menu with a seafood broth, shrimp, pork belly and soy egg. believe its the 'chong rong'.Also since I've been back a few times I've now had the sushi shot...and well despite it being quite 'cute' I feel at $5-7/shot you're paying a bit of a premium...They papa pork gyoza is quite tasty. The brussel sprouts also pretty damn good.Make sure you stop by graham ave up the street to pick up cash because as some have mentioned CASH ONLY!Still great! Still happy its my neighborhood ramen spot!",4.0
"This place is pretty small with communal seating...so be prepared to get close. Very simple but diverse menu. I got the vegan ramen which was excellent. I wish I could comment on another food item...but, I couldn't try my friends' ramen because they all had mussel in them and I'm allergic to mollusk - yeah, yeah...sucks to be me!! The Coca Cola in a glass bottle was decadent, however (I love Coke). Attentive service and relaxing music. I really enjoyed my visit here and will be back.",4.0
"A huge Samurai Mama fan so decided to drop by Samurai Papa! It didn't blow me away but it's pretty good. Spend about $12 for the ramen and during their ""happy hour,"" you can get some appetizers with the ramen! But even more important than their ramen, Samurai Papa serves the pat bing soo (shaved ice) dessert and that is found almost NO WHERE in Brooklyn so I am so happy I discovered it on their menu. Not the best but perfect for when you are craving pat bing soo!Staff is super friendly, love the decor of this place! Remember CASH ONLY!",4.0
"Absolutely amazing ! Lunch menu price is a steal 12 dollars for a salad, Gyoza and ramen !",5.0
"I've been waiting for that a ramen place is open in this area for so long.. Yep, here finally it is.They have very creative sushi - called ""sushi shot""  basically there's rice and some pieces of sashimi come by a cocktail glass. Very unique! I had an Aji ( pickled horse mackerel ) one which tasted great!Then I ordered spicy ramen with an egg ... YUMMMM!!!! They gave us some side of spice such as spicy oil, garlic&onion flake & picked jalapeño. Apparently those are all homemade and went amazing with the ramen!! The staff was very friendly, decor was pretty and romantic as well. Definitely come back with my friends!! NOTE : CASH ONLY :@",5.0
"The lunch menu/ special is amazing. For 12 bucks you get a light but flavorful salad to start. Then gyoza, clearly made with great technique. Then the best part... The ramen. Flavorful, fresh, nicely seasoned, with a beautiful depth and diversity of flavor. Fantastic deal for 12 dollars. Left very content and satisfied. Food was nicely timed and spaced out. The seats could be a little softer though...",5.0
Finally a ramen place I can walk to!!It is in an odd place next to Food Bazaar. The gyzoas were awesome and pork buns were really good. The ramen hit the spot.

"Loved the ramen broths, and the vegetarian ramen was pretty excellent. Pork tonkatsu was tasty, but not the most amazing ever... and difficult to break up in the bowl.

"I've found my new favorite ramen spot. Being in Bedstuy there isn't anything in my immediate vicinity, so I would always make the short bike ride over to Chuko. I think I can safely say that Samurai Papa has become my new go-to. No pretension and communal seating (like the Mama location in Wiliamsburg) greet you as you walk in. The seating isn't exactly comfortable, but the service makes you feel at home with smiles and attentive, laid back interactions as you mull over a fairly extensive sake list (only a couple 300 ML bottle options (around $23), but at least 10 720ML options (starting at $46)).However, the star here and the real reason this place is getting 5 stars is the ramen. The aori miso ramen was a savory blend of earthy mushrooms and salty pork and a broth that had the richness of a shoyu broth but not the heaviness in my stomach after. I actually slurped and sipped the bowl dry, which I usually can never do with ramen. The sliced pork was melt in your mouth delicious, although the 5 pieces were rather small, I'd say they were about an inch wide square.One of my dinner mates ordered a couple sushi rolls and I would have to say that the shrimp was rather bland and the rice didn't taste like sushi rice at all and was actually a bit crunchy. Then again, this place doesn't come off as a destination for sushi to me. I look forward to returning to have some MORE aori miso ramen and some veggie and pork dumplings!",4.0

"Came here on a Friday night when it was 0 degree outside, so it was not a long wait at all. Just walked in and sat ourselves down. There were a few other patrons in the restaurant. So not too crowded and not too empty. We ordered the Yuzu ginger ice tea, the papa ramen and aori miso ramen. The Yuzu ginger tea was okay, more Yuzu flavor then ginger. As a matter of fact, I barley tasted any ginger at all in the ice tea.Now for the two ramen dish, they were overall okay, not really living up to the hype. The papa ramen broth was very thick but had a nice flavor to it. The minced pork was also good but the ramen noodle was a bit overcooked for my taste. As for the aori Miso ramen, the broth was lighter but was a bit on the salty side. The pork belly that came with the ramen was only okay, I have had better. The ramen also came with a basket of crunchy fried garlic (which was really good), pickled chili pepper and spicy chili oil. I Would probably come back to give it a second chance and order the ramen In spicy broth. But I m more excited to go try their other restaurant, samurai mama instead, which serve udon. I love udon more than ramen and have heard great stuff about samurai mama. Another important fact, bring cash! As they only accept cash and no credit cards",3.0

Definitely a big fan!  They have some of the best Ramen I've had in NYC.  The place gets nice and warm and is a haven of sorts when chilly outside.  I love sitting at the bar and getting a hot bowl of ramen with a Sapporo.  The appetizers I've had have always been awesome.  I suggest either the Papa Ramen or Vegan Ramen.  Both are great.  I love animal products so Papa is my #1 pick.  Add an extra soft boiled egg and you'll thank me.  Love.

"Hmm...the stellar reviews for this place have me confused. I went about six months ago as the food and location intrigued me, and I'm a fan of Samurai Mama in Williamsburg proper. But something was super duper off about the ramen here. It was really really sticky and gummy, like it had been way way over cooked. I've eaten a lot of ramen, even throughout Japan, and never had anything that tasted like this, though we were told it might be the preference of the chef here. I'm really hoping to give it a second try as all the Yelpers can't be wrong.",3.0

"Found this newly opened place on Yelp actually, so decided to give it a try.   This a tiny place with limited seating not like Samurai mama, approximately around 20. So come here early!!    We had two different types of sushi shot, yellowtail and chirashi. It's a great idea that all the sashimi were all cut up in cubes and placed in a shot glass. All the fish tasted fresh and good quality. I want more! Had the fried chicken too. It didn't have those crispy fried coating. However, the chicken were marinated and not greasy. Love the sauce especially. It's sweet and tangy with a salad base, sweet tomato, slices of cucumber, shredded radish and shredded shiso leave. A must-have!   The 3-starred review was actually due to the ramen quality. Two stars off for the noodle itself. We had papa ramen and aori miso ramen. The papa ramen was slight spicy and the ramen noodle was overcooked! Seriously overcooked! Tasted like instant noodle. The broth was good though. The miso ramen noodle was much much better. The style of these ramen taste like a fusion of sapporo and tokyo. I like it but I would expet better noodle quality next time. By the way, they have those little baskets with fried garlic bits, pickles pepper and layou for ramen.    Don't remember to call for a drink and dessert here. We had a lychee-rambutan sake cocktail. It was super delicious. The dessert we had was fruit consumme panna cotta. Super yummy.",3.0

"Am I the only fat person eating ramen in this restaurant? I am surprised that no one complains about the portion size  of the ramen. We had ramen, gyoza and dessert. They are very tasty, especially the gyoza. One of the best I have ever had. However, the portion size of the ramen is definitely not the regular ramen bowl that I normally have in any ramen place. It's more like a small udon or soba bowl. I am willing to pay a little more to get a normal size of ramen.

"Went to Papa Friday evening and was utterly DISAPPOINTED. Having been to Mama many times and loving their food, I expected similar. First off, the gyoza was super greasy with a pool of oil at the bottom of the skillet. The skin stuck to the skillet and tasted mushy. Their sister restaurant Mama's gyoza is cooked way better not as greasy and without the pool of oil at the bottom of the skillet. Next..we ordered some rolls. The rice was hard and not cooked properly making the rolls very mushy. FINALLY...the ramen. A complete disaster. We ordered two shoyu and one papa ramen. All were either overcooked or there was something wrong with the noodle. The noodle texture was too doughy. I've eaten ramen all over the world and ramen even the instant stuff had a better texture. Staff was a bit  slow and not very perceptive or responsive.",2.0
This place has the best ramen in Brooklyn by far.  The noodles are the perfect consistency and not too soggy.  The broth selection and toppings are pretty traditional but prepared perfectly!  I would say this place definitely rivals ippudo or toto ramen.,5.0

"Though I'm not a ramen fan, the papa ramen was pretty tasty. It is the only version available with minced meat rather than pork slices, but it works well. The broth had depth and plenty of rich warm flavor, the noodles with perfect bite. The shoyu ramen had a more clear clean broth topped with square nori sheets, also tasty. Condiments include crunchy tasty bits, chili oil (amazing) and chili chutney (not so spicy). The pork gyoza were delicate and perfectly seasoned. Nice surprise in this area, must be welcome addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"I liked the ramen so much! I got the pork shio ramen and it had beautiful creamy broth (love). It came with a bowl of thinner liquid (not water I think... but some clear brothy stuff maybe) to thin it out to your liking. The sushi shot that came with my lunch special was so good to! There was only one lady working the restaurant but she did a great job even tho there were a decent amount of customers. Prices were pretty good, I'd definitely come back again on a cold day.",5.0

Popped in here for dinner after my shift at the hospital the other day.  Pretty cool little place with a super chill vibe.  Tasty Raman at good price... Especially during happy hour.  Options available for vegans and vegetarians too!,5.0
"What I enjoyed: the deep fried chicken , eggplant appetizer , and of course their ramen Will be coming back with friends",5.0
"Went to Papa Friday evening and was utterly DISAPPOINTED. Having been to Mama many times and loving their food, I expected similar. First off, the gyoza was super greasy with a pool of oil at the bottom of the skillet. The skin stuck to the skillet and tasted mushy. Their sister restaurant Mama's gyoza is cooked way better not as greasy and without the pool of oil at the bottom of the skillet. Next..we ordered some rolls. The rice was hard and not cooked properly making the rolls very mushy. FINALLY...the ramen. A complete disaster. We ordered two shoyu and one papa ramen. All were either overcooked or there was something wrong with the noodle. The noodle texture was too doughy. I've eaten ramen all over the world and ramen even the instant stuff had a better texture. Staff was a bit  slow and not very perceptive or responsive.",2.0
This place has the best ramen in Brooklyn by far.  The noodles are the perfect consistency and not too soggy.  The broth selection and toppings are pretty traditional but prepared perfectly!  I would say this place definitely rivals ippudo or toto ramen.,5.0
"I can't wait to come back here to eat more of this great ramen, really some of the best I've had in NYC. I went on a Friday night with a few friends and it was surprisingly quiet, which I appreciated. The decor is spare but elegant and the price is a deal for the quality IMO.",5.0
"I'm à big fan of samurai mama's udon so I went there on tuesday night, very exited this new location opened just a block from my place.The atmosphere is nice and cosy. Sushi shots are very fresh and tasty but a little bit pricey for the quantity (Got the salmon and salmon roe one)...Rolls are really good and original in a good way!Ramen excellent. Service was perfect.",4.0
"Though I'm not a ramen fan, the papa ramen was pretty tasty. It is the only version available with minced meat rather than pork slices, but it works well. The broth had depth and plenty of rich warm flavor, the noodles with perfect bite. The shoyu ramen had a more clear clean broth topped with square nori sheets, also tasty. Condiments include crunchy tasty bits, chili oil (amazing) and chili chutney (not so spicy). The pork gyoza were delicate and perfectly seasoned. Nice surprise in this area, must be welcome addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"I liked the ramen so much! I got the pork shio ramen and it had beautiful creamy broth (love). It came with a bowl of thinner liquid (not water I think... but some clear brothy stuff maybe) to thin it out to your liking. The sushi shot that came with my lunch special was so good to! There was only one lady working the restaurant but she did a great job even tho there were a decent amount of customers. Prices were pretty good, I'd definitely come back again on a cold day.",5.0

"This place is seriously amazing. We debated writing a review because it's so good we don't want others to find out... But we need them to stay open and open for lunch as well! Just order the pan fried pork dumplings, Brussels sprouts, and some bowls of ramen.. You WON'T be disappointed!",5.0
"Good food, great atmosphere and incredibly convenient that I live around the corner. Super responsibly priced and exceptional service. Happy that new places are coming to the neighborhood and this was a much needed addition.",5.0
"Best meal I've had in long time. The sushi shot is more like a whiskey-sized glass of an extra large piece of sushi. The salmon/roe and tuna ones we tried were amazing, as was our fried chicken appetizer, which was served on an unexpected fresh veggie/lettuce bed.  The ramen broth is rich  and flavorful, and finally our green tea ice cream was the best I've ever had. We ate every bite and woke up the next morning to continue raving about it. Can't wait to come back. We also had perfect service. Note it is communal tables and a bar, so maybe don't count on a private date experience.",5.0
Really great ramen. I took the papa ramen which really worth the 12$. Definitely a very good address. Service is lovely as welle as prices and ambiance.,5.0
"I had the best panna cotta of my life here. The teas are good quality - they will continue to refill it with hot water! The staff is Japanese and courteous, and they provide all the spices you're supposed to get with ramen, which felt like a sign of authenticity. I like their chewy noodles, but it was really all about the panna cotta for me.",5.0
"In out-of-the way East Williamsburg is the sister location of Samurai Mama in Billyburg.  Serving ramen as opposed to soba, this place offers a great happy hour special of ramen and sake/app for under $12.  Good neighborhood place and will definitely come back if in the neighborhood.",4.0
Surprisingly yummy. They have a lot of improvement to do but its a great first step. I went with a party of three and no one complained about the food. I had the yuzu cocktail which was delicious. I don't like the shot concept one bit but the sashimi was fresh. I'll definitely go back again but if it doesn't improve maybe no more than twice.,4.0
"Sushi chef knows what he's doing, and the ramen broth was A+. The interior design is a swing and a miss, however. They went for ""cool raw concrete"" and ended up with ""sticky Home Depot cinderblock."" But whatever. I'll be back, because the food was a cut above.",4.0
"This place is a gem in bush wick. One of the reasons i love living here is places like this. I live around the corner and have been here 4 times. Every time its been great and its a really good value for the quality of food. Great date spot, really chill decor. Im a sushi snob ill admit that and the quality is there. The ramen is also great. Really can't go wrong here. Would give 6 stars.",5.0
"I can't imagine have anything but 5 stars at this place. LOVE the fast that this is close by and I don't have to travel to Manhattan to get GOOD Ramen.  Came here on a cold Wednesday around 8pm- no wait and seated immediately. Adorable menu that keeps it simple- sushi, some appetizers and ramen.  Great selection of sake!  The Ramen was to die for- I recommend the Miso Ramen.  Anyways- I will be coming back A LOT.  Good prices and super convenient.",5.0

Hooray! So good! Menu is pretty much the same as Samurai Mama in Williamsburg but the Ramen is delicious!! They have amazing vegan options for ramen which gets a plus definitely. Cozy restaurant and good friendly service.,5.0
A very tasty lil gem from these guys. Ramen was better than average and for a reasonable price and no wait whatsoever at 6 pm. Perfect for the bitter cold winter and after some drinks. They have a great sake selection and a decent sized bar that you can taste at. Ramen was a normal size and the broth was exceptional. There is also creative sashimi/crudo to start the meal. By far the best restaurant in its vicinity (Montrose L). Attentive hipster service- oxymoron? No. This place is run by Japanese people.,4.0

"Just a bit hard to get there by subway, but otherwise, the whole experience and the food is a delight and will highly recommend going.

"I've been waiting for something like this in the neighborhood...by happenstance I was passing right through coming from Grand St. saw the sidewalk signage and did a double-take and even though I had just bought lunch...thought I'd still give it a go...sure enough brilliant food (dipping style ramen) and to go service was quite pleasant, Been looking for a good ramen place since my last visit to Japan especially a place near work that didn't require crossing the bridges. And while there are plenty others and I have tried most around the whole ""BIllyBurg"" area...none compare...A little Gem I'm going to enjoy a bit before the Trendoids find it.",5.0
"amazing ramen ,amazing fried chicken salad to die for!!!! great service, so polite and respectful the staff. hopefully it will stay like this,which i am sure it will since all the other places they owe is fantastic. try samurai mama and Bozu ,you will leave very happy!and its quiet so you can actually hear eachother and talk!",5.0

"recommended by my sister, this was the latest stop on my quest to find the best ramen in brooklyn, and it's definitely up there. i had the aori miso ramen while my hubby had the chang pong ramen. we both really enjoyed our selections, though i would've liked to have had a tonkotsu option -- partly because it's my favorite, and partly because it would give a more accurate comparison to other ramen spots i've tried -- it's hard to say how Samurai Papa ranks against Chuko when i'm having totally different broths. SP's miso ramen was certainly flavorful, and while the pieces of sliced pork were definitely small as other reviewers have commented, i have to say, the soy sauce egg might just be the best ramen-egg i've ever had, that thing was delicious. that being said, the standout of our meal was the pork gyoza, which were light, not too greasy or overly fried, and really yummy -- they might have even been better than the gyoza i had in Japan.in the end, i'm a little torn... on the one hand, this is less convenient for me to get to than Chuko. on the other hand, it's nice to be able to be seated immediately at 8pm on a Saturday and not have to wait an hour for a table. and ultimately, neither Chuko nor Samurai Papa are as good as my favorite ramen joint in Manhattan, which is really what i'm trying to achieve here. so we've got two places tied for second but the search for #1 still continues.",4.0
