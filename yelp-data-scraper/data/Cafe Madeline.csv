"Great cafe, close to where I was staying in Brooklyn. My party frequented this place like three or four times during our stay visiting family and it was delicious every time. The brunch menu is really varied and interesting. I saw savory oats, which I thought was a neat idea. I ended up trying the Mexican Brekkie Bowl, which was quinoa, chorizo, avocado, and a perfectly cooked egg on top. It was perfect and the best choice for a super long day of walking. I also tried the cardamon latte. It was great as well. My sister got the hot chocolate there and couldn't stop raving about it.The location is a little tight in the front but there is lots of seating in the back. It gets pretty crowded but the line moves quickly.",5.0
"Probably the best café in the neighborhood. And it's where I used to buy my coffee beans. I will upgrade this to five stars AS SOON AS THEY START SELLING STUMPTOWN BEANS AGAIN!Yeah, I've heard it from all the people behind the counter: ""We like the Toby's Estate coffee better. You really have to try it."" Well, I've tried about four varieties now, some of them a couple  of times, including the single East African bean they ever seem to have, and I have not made a cup of coffee that was better than drinkable. They offer another brand, also, but at something like $22 for 12 ounces, I'm not falling for it.And yeah, everyone, you have every right to lambast me for coming from such a place of entitlement and wasting your time with my 1st world problems. I might as well carve GENTRIFIER into my forehead. But look: we're all here reading and writing Yelp reviews for a fancy coffee shop in Brooklyn--so what are the choices?Anyway. I've been walking many blocks down the street to Market for Stumptown's Ethiopian beans, which are in a completely different category.Now some positive stuff, in the interests of fairness. The pastries are excellent. And they do a respectable job with their espresso drinks. Sometimes they're good, other times very good.  I can't comment on the savory dishes.It's is a great place to work away from home, with good wi-fi and enough outlets for everyone (if you don't mind crawling under your neighbor's table to look for one). When my girlfriend and I are both working from home and she kicks me out of the apartment, I come here, and pay rent on my table with pastry, cappuccino, macchiato, and a stream of espressos. It gets a little crowded, and the back-room ambience is a bit challenged (in a basement-cock-fighting-parlor sort of way), but it's a fine place to caffeinate and work.",3.0
"This has become my go-to cafe in the area.  I've been going here for about a year now.  They take cards which is great for a person like me who never carries cash.  It's also why I lean towards going here for a bite instead of Qathra or Milk & Honey who are cash only.Expressos are pretty good.  They carry soy, almond and coconut milk.  The Almond Butter Latte has replaced my morning Starbucks run. They use Justin's almond butter and it tastes so good!  I just did the Whole30 program and this latte is pretty compliant.  They have other unique lattes including hazelnut, cardamom, even an oatmeal latte.  The french butter latte for those who want bulletproof coffee.Food wise, my go to is the Avocado & Egg on a cheddar chive biscuit.  It's just...delicious.  Perfectly filling breakfast sandwich.  The place can get packed, especially on the weekends.  But for a freelancer like me, it can be a good place to get work done when I zone out with my headphones.  I've seen a lot of folks have quick coffee meetings there too.  There are plenty of outlets in the back and free wifi.  Service is friendly. They'll bring your food to you if you're eating in.  They have a 8 person square table out in front if you want to sit outside.",4.0
"Cute cafe to grab a quick bite while finishing work on your laptop! Everything about this place is so cozy and welcoming. The indoor seating is pretty large, extending to the back room. So you'll never wait super long for a table. I ordered a cold matcha drink and it was alright, nothing out of the ordinary. I stayed there for probably around three hours finishing up some homework and no one told me off for overstaying my visit, so that's a plus!  I love how extensive the food AND drink menu is, and I plan on returning to try out more food and drink options!",4.0
"Such a disappointment. I stopped in here on my way to work hoping to be pleased because of all the great yelp reviews and I was sorely disappointed. I got the whitefish bagel with cucumbers and spinach. This sandwich was like $8 and the amount of whitefish was straight disrespectful (check out my pics). The dressing they added to the sandwich was delicious so the flavoring was on point, but it's a whitefish sandwich and I literally had a tablespoon of whitefish on the bagel. If that's the serving size, don't charge $8. Or if you are running out of whitefish let me know so I can order something else.I also got a coffee, it was good but overshadowed by my whitefish bagel experience.",1.0
I've been hearing about Cafe Madeline for a while from friends who live in the neighborhood. They told us that they serve great food and Stumptown coffee so I was very excited! Upon walking in I noticed that it was very busy.... With laptop users. Ugh those darn laptop users ruin everything! But we looked at the huge menu and orders a Ginger Twist tea and a Soy Matcha Latte. They were both big sizes and tasted great. Just wish the matcha had more.... Matcha flavor? I worked with Matcha before it should taste like matcha! This was more diluted but I finished it because it wasn't awful. The staff was fast and friendly. Now the food was fantastic! Cheddar Clive biscuit egg sandwich which was the bomb. And I got the Crispy Eggs with brioche. It came with cubed avocado. It was perfect! On the way out I got a fresh OJ and a Belgium waffle! So so good. Paid about $30 for everything. Not bad for how good everything was.I just knocked one star down because switching coffee suppliers all the time isn't good! They now have Toby's Estate and Parlor. No more Stumptown! You have to keep a consistent! Get one thing and stick to it!  I'll be back to Cafe Madeline!,4.0
"Love this place. I come here to work some days even though I live in Prospect Heights. Food is amazing with a huge selection, and lots of fun albeit diabetes-inducing lattes to choose from (Nutella latte, s'mores latte, almond butter latte, lavender latte, etc.). Food-wise I have ordered the cheddar chive biscuit bowl and the spicy potatoes and eggs bowl. Both amazing. Will be back (many times).",5.0
"I go here sometimes as I go to Brooklyn College a few blocks away. The food is good. The coffee is great. The only complaint I have is the ventilation. The kitchen is always smoking up bacon or chicken and it feels like your basking in oil if U sit in the area across from the counter. I usually sit in the back room. A lot of people do work here because it is quite and nice atmosphere. I've enjoyed the lox bagel, eggs but did not enjoy the eggs Benedict on a biscuit as I expected an English muffin and don't enjoy biscuits.",4.0
"I always come here for breakfast/lunch. Their coffee is really good, food is also really good. The only downfall is that it gets soo packed with so many people & it's so narrow by the seating area to where customers stand in line :(. Also, their kitchen is open so you leave the place smelling like a kitchen lol, but other than those cons, it's really delicious here :)",4.0
"This cafe makes my neighborhood a better place. seriously. its such a cozy gathering place. the food is always amazing and they often add new delicious stuff to the menu.  When the weather is nice, i like sitting at the big table outside and watch people walk by as i sip on my coffee. oh and they always have amazing flavor of coffees. they also have wide selection of really delicious smoothies. my two complaints would be; the price and the indoor seating. yes maybe good food comes pricey ? not sure but it is expensive. also, i can never sit inside. because the kitchen is also behind the counter, it gets stuffy inside and there is not enough air circulation,",3.0
"I was in the mood for a latte and something sweet so I searched for a nearby cafe on the yelp app.  I saw cafe Madeline appeared and it's in my neighborhood so I walked there.  Courtelyou road is very hip place now for dinning, a clean working class type of hip not Williamsburg hipster hip. I like the area so I wanted to check it out.  I got there noonish and it's packed! They got a grill behind the counter and people are cooking! The counter is full of desserts and they all look really good & fresh.  The lady at counter was super friendly and smiled which is not expected from baristas.  Sorry most baristas I encounter have stank attitudes but the service here is customer orientated.  I appreciate good customer service! They made me a latte and heated up the apple turnover for me.  This apple turnover I had was really good! It had a crispy butter crust with an apple pie filling.  Incredible taste.  Also they use stumptowm beans.  As of recently I've noticed that their beans are really good and makes a difference.  The latte was bold with a nice creaminess.  This place is good and has a great vibe.  I'm going back again!",5.0
"This spot is a gem. So many healthy options (New Year's Resolutions what up?!) and delicious coffee and treats. It's by no means inexpensive in comparison to the rest of the ""coffee shops"" in the vicinity but worth every penny. They're Brekkie bowls are bomb. Their plated presentation is on point.  They're always pretty busy so when I drop in for a smoothie I wish it'd come a little bit quicker. But that's probably just a personal problem. Oh. And they have tons of options. From the Brekkie bowls - all come with quinoa, soft-boiled egg, sautéed greens and choice of protein - to their egg sandwiches, grilled-cheese sandwich varieties to salads!!! There is definitely something here for everyone. Cheers!",4.0

"My namesake cafe that I adore. I'm convinced that it was conducive to my passing my NCLEX exam on the first try. In any case-- super comfortable and the ambience is really inviting. One of the first cafes to pop up in the neighborhood and it's been a staple since. My go to drink is surprisingly not coffee, even though they carry Stumptown. I love the lavender mint tea as it just lightly opens up my nostrils and relaxes me as well. The cheddar chive scone in BOMB. I mean, just... Yes. Also, the bacon, eggs and sourdough with butter and jam is TO DIE FOR. And their cheese quiche is just... Overload. Absolutely delicious. I've apparently been here way too much to count and have just gotten around to writing this review. People, if you're in the area, come and enjoy this lovely little cafe. Disappointment is not possible. As always... Happy Eating. -Marie-Madeleine.",5.0
"Fantastic place for some interesting brunch dishesThey have quite a large menu of sandwiches, bagels, oatmeal, and breakfast bowels- and they are all interesting fresh flavored and combinations We ordered a bacon, maple oatmealA croissant with prosciutto, avocado, egg And my absolute fave grilled goat cheese with apple and fig jam- must tryThe place gets super busy and though there is a lot of seating, it's difficult to find a seat and all the tables are really close to each other.

"The slowest service you will find in Brooklyn. Every time I go for a sandwich it somehow takes them 30 minutes to make it. I ordered two sandwiches to go. The sandwiches had four ingredients: chicken, avocado, lettuce, and tahini dressing. Should that really take longer than 10, 15 minutes? There wasn't a line or many people in there. I walked home to eat and there was barely any chicken in the sandwich. Such a letdown. Spend your $20 elsewhere.",1.0
"I liked the coffee here, and occasionally grab something to eat on the run. The high octane Red Eye Brew tastes wonderful and gets you going. The mini quiche they have is pretty awesome, savory and nice flakey pastry crust. The service has been so so.. Depending on who helps you. Some help, I've felt, as if I've inconvenienced them by ordering.. I'd agree with other posters as well, it's a bit pricey.",4.0
"The food here is amazing, but a tiny bit overpriced. I love the big communal outdoor table when there isn't some guy with a dirty laptop taking up half of it, smoking a cigarette. I also am not into this place when it's a stroller wonderland, but off hours in the evenings or late afternoon on weekends it is great. The pastries are incredible and I live for those cheddar chive biscuits.",4.0
"This was our first visit. We went for Sunday brunch. The place is small/narrow and chaotic. As a first timer, it was not so clear where to go for what. Turns out that you order/grab a table first. The seating is first come first served, self service and apparently cutthroat. We ordered the Madeline Breakfast and Grilled Cheese Omelet. While the plates get served to you (after a bit of a wait), the drinks do not. You have to listen for the drinks getting called and grab your own when called. On to the seating... As mentioned before the place is small/narrow so the seating is super cramped. Each chair was touching the back of the chair behind it. I couldn't get up or down without inconveniencing the lady behind me, and vice versa. While seated, I also had the pleasure of getting my foot rolled over by a stroller or two. We received the food and drinks and pure delight. The food was really fresh and delicious. It was for the best because we needed the food to be good to make the experience worth it all. Like really good. Oh and here's a tip - if you think you'll want a cup of water with/after your meal, order it when you order your meal/drinks. If you don't then you'll be added to the end of the current drink queue and may end up waiting 20 or so minutes for an uniced cup of tap. They do have a fridge with bottled water so buying one of them probably would have been faster. Anywho, long story short, the food is really good and there's a lot to choose from, so we'll probably go back to try other things that we were interested in. Though, next time, maybe we'll order for take out instead of enduring their chaotic space.",3.0
"Cafe Madeline is a sweet little getaway that's great for everyone; couples, singles, families, and freelancers. The division of the restaurant into two spaces works really well. Those who are only here to eat can sit up front, and others who want to work and eat, or work and sip coffee usually go to the back. The space in the back is good for groups. Today, I decided to have the eggs and cauliflower. At $7.95 USD it's a good deal. The dish comes with two eggs any style; cauliflower with red onions; and toast with salted butter and jam on the side.I almost left because I thought the AC wasn't working -- it was humid out -- but it kicked in after a while. It's pretty quiet on weekday mornings. However, I've been here on the weekend and it can get loud and crowded. However, the food is always expedited pretty fast. The crew is really sweet and courteous.",4.0

"Not your standard Bathazaar loaf cake-and-croissant place. I'd swear nothing in Cafe Madeline's was hanging on the doorknob at 6 am. Great food!The cheddar chive biscuit sandwich was fantastic. The cafe was busy but the energy felt great. The workers behind the counter were rocking but not nuts, despite a tricky menu. Maybe because there were ample folks on shift?My latte was delicious, milk spot on (and this from a former barista of 10 years). Our new local spot.",5.0

That cheddar choice biscuit sandwich with bacon is maybe the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.

I really wish I could get my $37 back. Seriously. It's crowded. It has very little room to move around in. The dirty dishes/kitchen wares can be seen on the counter. The pastries looked stale and the single outdoor seating table is not cleaned after each customer. I wished I had just taken my son to Shake Shack instead and saved my dollars. The couscous salad was nothing to phone home about and I have made better at home. Smoothies...meh. It's froufrou and hipster for no reason at all. It's not a horrible place but I won't return.

After figuring all this out, I ordered their banana, strawberry, and almond butter smoothie (about $8) along with the cheddar chive egg biscuit sandwich ($5.50) I have read so much about. Both were extremely delicious but the cheddar chive biscuit (which I added bacon to) stole the show. You must try it!Aside from the food, the service was great (didn't take too long given the lengthy line and brunch rush), the staff was friendly, and the vibe was chill.

The avocado was a great touch. I was not expecting the aioli which was alot and I scraped off. The remaining aioli left a slight spice to the sandwich which was a nice touch. The bacon was thick and crispy but not burnt. The atmosphere was nice, a bit bare, music was interesting but a bit loud. I would definitely come back here.

"My husband and I eat at Cafe Madeleine often. I always enjoy their Buttermilk biscuit sandwich; rarely do I venture with any other dish. Its consistently delicious with crisp maple bacon, sharp melted cheddar, soft scrambled egg, and melt in your mouth biscuit. The other plates I see come out look equally tasty. The cafe does get crowded in the mornings and around lunchtime, with some snooty hipster folks with a bit of 'tude (including some of the cashiers). Just ignore and enjoy your meal, your coffee, and/or smoothie. Tasty food, but be prepared to pay a little extra. I think my sandwich costs $8.99, a glass of fresh OJ is about $4, and their almond croissants (when I do indulge) is also about four bucks.

The coffee is very strong and I don't suggest drinking it on an empty stomach. It made me dizzy! The coffee is also expensive and not that big.

The way this restaurant works is interesting, you order your food then wait for your name to be called so you can go grab your food. The strawberry smoothie was really good as well as the mango one.

"I'm not crazy about Cafe Madeline. + very poor ventilation+ snobby patrons - hipsters/ stroller moms who shove their strollers with no regard for other people without saying excuse me or sorry or anything.+ cramped space to order & sit+ staff is either friendly or looks super annoyed --------------------------------------------------------------+ they continuously mess up my orders (i mainly order their salads or sandwiches)+ anything with chicken - be prepared for the thinnest slice of chicken ever. + the food takes FOREVER once the order is placed. I'm not trying to wait 45 minutes for a salad. -------------------------------------------------------------+ they've forgotten/lost my order 3x that i've patronized this establishment, and never apologized nor offered anything to me for the time i had to waste for them to correct their mistake. ------------------------------------------------------------+ their mint lemonade is good, can't comment on coffee drinks since i don't drink coffee. + pricey",2.0
"I have to admit I love this place.  The food is top notch, and the staff are incredibly efficient and kind.  I'm assuming he's the owner, but dude in the flip flops IN THE KITCHEN AREA cracks me up.  I don't mind the open-toed situation, but I'm always thinking it's probably not the best attire for the kitchen; hot food/liquids don't seem to exist in harmony.  Anyhoo, my only gripe is with SOME of the folks who frequent the joint: GET YOUR SORRY ASSES UP AND ALLOW OTHERS TO SIT AND PATRONIZE THE BUSINESS.  I've been often enough to see the same cast of characters hogging tables for hours on end without care to those who might want to sit and experience the place, or the business' need to welcome those spending.  As a matter of fact, I've actually found myself just leaving without ordering anything because Bohemian Bobby & Betty laid claim to several tables hours ago. Again, GET YOUR SORRY ASSES UP AND ALLOW OTHERS TO SIT AND PATRONIZE THE BUSINESS!!!",4.0
"This is a sweet neighborhood coffee shop with a fun grilled cheese menu and all the baked goods you would expect. Including donuts from Dough, which are delicious. There are plenty of tables, all of them small, so it's good for studying. And there are outlets as well for convenience. One thing though, is that the ventilation is not tremendous, so the place smells strongly of bacon any time they make some. That can be good or bad depending on your taste.",4.0
"I wish I lived in Brooklyn because I'd come here every weekend!  They had such a wide variety on their brunch menu and very decent prices! After a lot of going back and forth, I went for it and chose their poached eggs!  They come on sourdough bread, and with roasted baby tomatoes.  I also opted to put some ham on there.  Very delicious, although the bread was a bit hard to cut through.  Friendly service, pretty quick considering the huge crowd there on a Saturday around brunchtime, and great quality food.  I'll be back the next time I'm in Brooklyn!",5.0

"One of my newly discovered favorite spots on Cortelyou. I am a frequent The Farm connoisseur and recently decided to give Cafe Madeline a try. I was so pleasantly surprised. This is a very hip place with SO MANY options for breakfast. I've been twice and about to go again. They serve breakfast all day and close at 8pm. Last time I ordered their biscuit breakfast with bacon, my bf ordered the biscuit with avocado. Both were absolutely delicious. My biscuit was the perfect amount of sweet and light. The second time I got the Cauliflower and Egg breakfast. Loved everything about it, the eggs were over easy and nicely done, the cauliflower was deliciously cooked and the toast with butter and also delicious. Coffee is good too. They have many kinds including cold brew, many kinds of teas and smoothies and a good choice of cold drinks. Definitely recommend going there!",5.0
"Great, friendly community cafe. Good food. Crazy selection of drinks. Could do with ventilation at the back (I would get rid of/move the fridges from the prime area and open it right up at the front) but relaxed enough that you can still get work done if that's why you came - which is a rarity.

But they really need to do something with the air. It isn't a cozy comfortable place either. Very cramped.",1.0
"Boy has Cafe Madeline been transformed by Adell, the new owner and Paige, the very capable and friendly General Manager. The food is excellent and the prices very reasonable considering the quality. It is such a joy to have Cafe Madeline located so close to me. I can walk there even in the dead of winter! This is my all-time favorite coffeehouse, hangout space and food joynt. I can't wait until springtime when they are opening up a full-service restaurant right across the street. Yes, it does get crowded, but everyone is patient and understanding.You can order using the square order app which helps with the line.All in all a great Brooklyn experience.",5.0
"This place is great--amazing (although very pricey) food, lovely baristas, and you can stay for ages. I wrote my doctoral exams here. Open early and late. Cons: it's dark, they are constantly (but constantly) playing a Red Hot Chili Peppers album all the way through, and once when I left a library book on a table for half an hour (without leaving the cafe!), they treated it as lost property and let someone else ""borrow"" it.Definitely go. Great smoothies and you eventually get your books back.",4.0
"After a recent shift in my diet, I mostly eat eggs for breakfast.  And not the egg-white omlettes I used to eat, but real pasture raised eggs with orange yolks.  It's not easy finding such eggs in San Francisco, but being a visitor to NYC it's almost impossible.  So I was extremely glad to find Cafe Madeline.  I've been twice, and both times I got the poached eggs, which is a poached egg on sourdough with cheese and cherry tomatoes.  You can add extra eggs for a dollar; both times I added two, which fills the bread (highly recommended).  I rounded out my meals with a pink Harmless Havest coco water, one of the best coco waters on the market, and a hot chocolate (with organic milk, naturally).  In addition to having delicious food, the atmosphere is also very welcoming.  Many of the tables are occupied by people with laptops using the excellent wifi, and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The meal wasn't cheap, but $16 for an amazing breakfast is entirely worth it.Definitely my favorite breakfast place in all NYC so far.",5.0

"It's really great  to have Cafe Madeline in the neighborhood. They make excellent food here, though some of  the portions are not huge. The way I look at is they manage to offer reasonable prices for very high quality ingredients by not including things like side dishes with the meals. So maybe I'm not always quite full after a breakfast sandwich, but I only paid $5-7 for high quality instead of $10-15 for the same quality + french fries or something wack like that. Instead, if I'm still hungry I'll have a croissant or mini pastry (only $1). Fruity/sparkling/healthy drink selection is really amazing, but the selection seems to change every few days so I often can't get some things twice. The staff is really accommodating and friendly, and Paige really holds down the place like a boss. And she's the boss. Left off a 5th star only because the small size of the kitchen (there isn't one) means that the food order line can get really bogged down, making the wait for food pretty long sometimes. I try to just avoid rush times, but sometimes it isn't possible. Seating space is clearly a big concern for Cafe Madeline, but personally I'd convert half of the back seating room (which is not very inviting anyway) into a food prep area.

"Oh no Cafe Madeline, what happened?Noticed all the changes going on recently with your interior and it all seemed really cool, until I went for coffee on Sunday morning and realized the entire atmosphere of the place changed :( The staff is still super (though it looks like there was some serious turnover) but  it felt like I entered Williamsburg the moment I walked through the door.

"This spot is in my neighborhood, so I consider myself a regular.... They recently expanded the seating area and menu.Well..... Initially I was happy, but w/ the improvements came some pitfalls.... The food takes forever to come out, it's not as great as it used to be and the customer service took a turn for the worse. I don't blame the staff, I just don't think they have enough people on staff to handle the weekend crowd. Such a a disappointment... The universal motto.. If it's not broken don't fix it!!",3.0
"Comparing this place only to other places with similar menus and prices, this is about as good as it gets.   It was really nice when it first opened and wasn't jampacked with non-brooklynites 24/7.   Now it feels like everyone who lives in the area but isn't from there congregates here.  Oh well, nothing to be done about that.  However the food is DEElicious and that's what matters.  I am so happy that they've steadily expanded their menu over time.  Standouts include ALL the sandwiches and salads.  But to be specific, the spicy egg on cheddar chive biscuit...absolutely addictive, get it with an egg over-medium rather than scrambled...anything on that cheddar-chive biscuit would be good.   The grilled cheeses are yummy also and splitting a sand/salad with your dining companion is the way to go.  Let me just say that whenever I am there, I have to fight back the temptation to get two items just for myself. :-|  The quality of their ingredients is quite high, especially the bread...I can see they've worked on sourcing and vendor relationships.   Weirdly enough, there is better coffee at other places nearby so I almost never get one but if you can stomach the baby stroller hell and bad manners of the patrons, the food is more than worth it.",5.0
"Cafe Madeline is one of my best finds on Cortelyou. It is my go-to spot when I want to cozy up with a book or my laptop, a good cup of coffee and some delicious eats. Their menu is wide and varied, they have everything from breakfast to pastries to gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches to salads. They have an impressive selection of cheeses as well. I have never been disappointed by anything I've ordered from there. A bonus is that all of their ingredients are fresh and oftentimes organic and local.The staff and service is always friendly and nice. The seating options are plentiful. You can either choose to sit in the main area, where it's always warm and bustling, with the employees cooking and serving food nearby with a mouthwatering aroma wafting around. You can also sit in the back room where it's more quiet, roomy and cooler or you can choose to sit outside on sunnier days where this is one big communal table. Bonuses include free wifi, and you can also bring your laptops there on weekends. Their menu is always changing and they serve a damn good cup of coffee. It is definitely one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood.",5.0

"Oh no Cafe Madeline, what happened?Noticed all the changes going on recently with your interior and it all seemed really cool, until I went for coffee on Sunday morning and realized the entire atmosphere of the place changed :( The staff is still super (though it looks like there was some serious turnover) but  it felt like I entered Williamsburg the moment I walked through the door. The music sounded trendy-obscure and the patrons seemed a bit haughty... even the food tasted a somewhat stale. What happened to the laid back vibe?",3.0
"This spot is in my neighborhood, so I consider myself a regular.... They recently expanded the seating area and menu.Well..... Initially I was happy, but w/ the improvements came some pitfalls.... The food takes forever to come out, it's not as great as it used to be and the customer service took a turn for the worse. I don't blame the staff, I just don't think they have enough people on staff to handle the weekend crowd. Such a a disappointment... The universal motto.. If it's not broken don't fix it!!",3.0
"Comparing this place only to other places with similar menus and prices, this is about as good as it gets.   It was really nice when it first opened and wasn't jampacked with non-brooklynites 24/7.   Now it feels like everyone who lives in the area but isn't from there congregates here.  Oh well, nothing to be done about that.  However the food is DEElicious and that's what matters.  I am so happy that they've steadily expanded their menu over time.  Standouts include ALL the sandwiches and salads.  But to be specific, the spicy egg on cheddar chive biscuit...absolutely addictive, get it with an egg over-medium rather than scrambled...anything on that cheddar-chive biscuit would be good.   The grilled cheeses are yummy also and splitting a sand/salad with your dining companion is the way to go.  Let me just say that whenever I am there, I have to fight back the temptation to get two items just for myself. :-|  The quality of their ingredients is quite high, especially the bread...I can see they've worked on sourcing and vendor relationships.   Weirdly enough, there is better coffee at other places nearby so I almost never get one but if you can stomach the baby stroller hell and bad manners of the patrons, the food is more than worth it.",5.0
"Cafe Madeline is one of my best finds on Cortelyou. It is my go-to spot when I want to cozy up with a book or my laptop, a good cup of coffee and some delicious eats. Their menu is wide and varied, they have everything from breakfast to pastries to gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches to salads. They have an impressive selection of cheeses as well. I have never been disappointed by anything I've ordered from there. A bonus is that all of their ingredients are fresh and oftentimes organic and local.The staff and service is always friendly and nice. The seating options are plentiful. You can either choose to sit in the main area, where it's always warm and bustling, with the employees cooking and serving food nearby with a mouthwatering aroma wafting around. You can also sit in the back room where it's more quiet, roomy and cooler or you can choose to sit outside on sunnier days where this is one big communal table. Bonuses include free wifi, and you can also bring your laptops there on weekends. Their menu is always changing and they serve a damn good cup of coffee. It is definitely one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood.",5.0
"Great coffee, lots of tables have plugs, very crowded so locals seem to love this place",4.0
Nearly every table is taken by someone with a laptop and a drink. Lunch customers are lucky to find a table. Food is great. I guess take out is the answer. Don't know how they pay the rent. I would reserve more table for diners especially during lunch. I've walked past dozens of times due to lack of places to sit,3.0

"This is that really great cafe you wish every neighborhood had.  I haven't had the hot coffee but the iced is excellent.  They have it on tap and will get it in your hands quickly while you're in line to order food, and trust me you will want to order food.  The biscuits are solid and make for a great egg sandwich.  The yogurt/granola is tasty and ridiculously large.  They don't disappoint at lunch either, serving up some tasty sandwiches.  You may also be tempted by their assortment of sweets.  If you live in the area, it's a must.  And even if you don't (like me), it's still worth the trip.",5.0

"If I could give partial stars I might give it 3 and change. I do like the place, however, there was a time I would have given it 5 stars, but like others am disappointed by recent changes. The Good: They recently expanded and there's always sitting room and it is a nice neighborhood spot to grab coffee and bite. The loud often strange music can get on your nerves a little bit sometimes but generally not a big issue. The food is very decent and there's a great selection. The Bad: It's a little pricey for what it is and compared to other cafes in the area. They claim to source ""as much local and organic as possible"" but on closer look, although most breads/pastries are local, not a single one is organic and so they aren't trying very hard. Not sure about other food, but bread/pastries are the majority of what they serve. And last, although the sitting areas seems clean enough, they can't seem to hold on to an ""A"" rating (they have a ""B""). Judging by some of the places I've seen receive an ""A"", I don't think the bar is set very high and so I sort of expect there's stuff going on in the kitchen I'd rather not know about.",3.0

I used to come here all the time for their delicious and flavorful coffee but the last 2 times I was very disappointed.

I checked out their menu online and was drawn to their French Toast and Full Breakfast. The décor is super cute and we were lucky to snag 2 seats at the communal table up front. It's a self serve restaurant - you place your order, pick up your coffee, grab a seat and they bring the food to you. We both ordered a full breakfast - I had scrambled eggs and my friend had sunny side up. Nothing spectacular but it tasted fresh and it's cheaper than the local diner. If they put butter/ jelly on my toast that would be heavenly.They also have a good variety espresso and cafe options - a much preferred choice over the local diner. My chai latte was very refreshing!",5.0

This is a terrific little spot, and I am so very glad it's down here in DP instead of way up in Williamsburg.",5.0

After we chose a quiche and sat to wait for it, menus were placed by the cash register. (face palm) Oh well, I guess we'll have to come back tomorrow to try something else. The quiche with side salad was BOSS.",5.0
I used to come here all the time for their delicious and flavorful coffee but the last 2 times I was very disappointed. The drip coffee I usually order was watery and flavorless almost like DD or McD just twice the price. Also some of the people working there seem to have an attitude for no reason and don't care about customer service.I used to recommend this place to all of my friends but unfortunately it has changed too much and I am going to look out for better coffee shops in my neighborhood.,1.0
"I'm live close to church avenue, found this spot here and tried to get breakfast there. It was in weekend, there had some available seats. People, who works there are nice and friendly. Mocha and farm sandwich I ordered were delicious.",5.0
"Please oh please let this place not turn into how park slope has become. I've been coming here for almost 3 years and I love its expansion but not the company it brings.Strollers blocking 3 otherwise empty tables. Parents letting their screaming child run free while they sip and chat unaware with their friends. Toddlers jumping back and forth through the middle wall hole. This once was a laid back place to do some work and have a coffee.The food and staff are amazing as always. And I am not complaining about all children, just those parents who are inconsiderate to the other patrons just trying to sit and unwind.",4.0
"I stayed over at a friend's house in the neighborhood and randomly found out about Café Madeline so we decided to come here for breakfast on Sat. I checked out their menu online and was drawn to their French Toast and Full Breakfast. The décor is super cute and we were lucky to snag 2 seats at the communal table up front. It's a self serve restaurant - you place your order, pick up your coffee, grab a seat and they bring the food to you. We both ordered a full breakfast - I had scrambled eggs and my friend had sunny side up. Nothing spectacular but it tasted fresh and it's cheaper than the local diner. If they put butter/ jelly on my toast that would be heavenly.They also have a good variety espresso and cafe options - a much preferred choice over the local diner. My chai latte was very refreshing!",5.0
"I've only been here twice, but I've already discovered my ""thing"" - Cheddar Chive Biscuit sandwich! So buttery and fluffy! I love the spice too. Their Nitro cold brew coffee is awesome too (and I'm a coffee snob). I should also mention that they carry fresh Dough donuts! So amazing! I don't have to go all the way to their shop to get them! This is a terrific little spot, and I am so very glad it's down here in DP instead of way up in Williamsburg.",5.0
"The food, while of excellent quality, is actually quite the ripoff if you want more than the smallest of snacks. I ordered a Large iced mocha and received an 8oz cup... This was not a mistake as I asked directly. The turkey sandwich consisted of 3 thin slices of turkey and the bread made up 80% of the sandwich. I am left hungry and very disappointed. I will not come here again.",2.0
"Went here on a Saturday morning, it was busy and loud, which is the type of environment I enjoy. I ordered egg & cheese on an everything bagel (yum!).

Really thrilled to have this place in DItmas Park. Its been great to watch it rise up from a hidden gem to one of the most popular places around. Food is excellent and creative. Service is kind and attentive. Only issue is that they are very slow during peak hours.

I get the best coratdos and the latte art is beautiful. I've tried a number of their sandwiches and the cheddar chive biscuit + egg sandwich is a great deal plus it is delicious. Cafe Madeline is also a great place to go to on weekends for brunch-type food without paying exorbitant brunch prices - I got a HUGE bagel sandwich with avocado, egg, cheese, tomatoes, and onions for under $7.

Love Cafe Madeline. The food is great and the atmosphere is perfect for working but are they really charging $3.50 for an iced tea??? Maybe it's just me but it seems a bit absurd. Will be back but definitely staying away from the pricey tea and coffee.,4.0
"The lack of customer service and business practices are the reasons I happily pass by Madeline's on my way to a truly local neighborhood coffee shop that values the fact that people choose to spend their hard earned money there and makes an effort to employ people from the community.THIS IS THE STORY THAT FINALIZED THE 1-STAR- When I ordered a latte, the barista did not fill the cup nor make my latte more than luke warm. I asked him to heat up the latte and he literally snatched the cup, didn't say a word and remade it. This time he still didn't fill up the cup. I wasn't going to complain but when I said ""thank you"" and he gave me a dirty look, I asked for a manager. The manager was nice. She remade my latte BUT all the owner's hipster friends who bike in from Williamsburg every day were laughing at me, literally, in the background. WOW. Should I have paid extra to breathe your Madeline air? Ridiculous, childish, customer service.Go to John's Bakery, Catskill, a bodega, even Dunkin Donuts who hires locally, really anywhere but this place.

"Great little coffee and tea shop that offers a great alternative to (always full at brunch time) farm on aderley and picket fenceThe coffee and tea selection is amazing.

Love their Salmon Avocado Sandwich! This thing is huuuge! Tons of salmon and avocado!,5.0
"So, I really like this place! It's a cute little cafe that serves good food. I usually get their avocado smash on toast with scrambled eggs. Their bread selection is awesome but they tend to over toast and it gets hard to bite so make sure you ask not to over toast. You can also get their blistered cherry tomatoes on the avocado which gives it such a flavorful and juicy taste. My favorite is their pressed spinach and mozzarella sandwich. It's just all the right flavors combined into the perfect sandwich. I also love that they sell dough doughnuts which I always have for dessert. The staff is very friendly and nice. The only thing I really don't like is that I smell horrible when I leave. I literally have to run home and change my clothes. I guess because it's pretty small but they def need a better ventilation system. Another thing that kind of irritates me is that since it's small it's always hard to get a table and you have people who come with their laptops and mooch off of free wifi and think that because they bought a coffee they can literally sit there all day! Come on people have some courtesy, seating is usually a problem there. Otherwise I really do like this place and go there at least twice a week.",4.0
"Very good coffee, tasty pastries, friendly atmosphere, better hours than most Brooklyn cafes.  I'll edit my stars up to five if I figure it's not fair to hold their city health inspection grades against them.  I've never seen an A in the Madeline window, just B and Grade Pending.  Restaurant grades are pretty lenient in NYC.  Maybe the owner could make a comment here about this aspect of an otherwise lovely place?",5.0

There are a lot of milk options which makes me happy.  The food is NOT an afterthought- I love that they have savory choices (biscuit sandwich is hugely popular) as well as the baked goods selection.  Excellent prices. Quick weekend turnover.  Weekdays is my favorite time here.  The guys at the counter do their best to make you feel at home.  They refill your coffee, bring you water, and don't rush or pressure you.  Free wifi- does cut out from time to time and not enough plugs to make this a coffice destination, but I've found everyone who has a outlet is happy to share.",4.0
"Can't understand the complaints about the food. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CAFES IN THE CITY, people! Not just Brooklyn. I didn't think it could get better, but over the last few years it has. Original ideas, incredible variety (a whole section of different avocado toasts alone!), extremely fresh ingredients, lovely presentation. This place knocks every other Ditmas Park cafe FAR out of the water. I walk all the way over here from the other side of the neighborhood as often as I can. The impeccably sourced pastries alone are worth the trip--then there's the excellent tea selection--the bagel options--the grilled cheese. My only problem with the place is that there's no way I can sample everything on the menu.

Instead, the brooding, slightly annoyed, counter staff (You know that hipster barista meme?  I'd swear that guy works here.) and lo-fi, ironic dance music apathetically ""welcomed"" me to the far-flung reaches of north Brooklyn.  The wifi campers had claimed every last table so I took my coffee to a shelf and, perched nose-to-nose with the faux-unfinished, plaster wall attempted not to notice as self-absorbed patron after self-absorbed patron kicked the leg of my stool as they passed by.  The coffee was quite good but the atmosphere dulled my joy considerably--which I think was the point.",2.0
"Good location, friendly staff, tasty teas (loved the cranberry hibiscus lime iced tea I recently had), and most importantly, delicious pastries. The interior is cute and the music selection is usually very good.  I just stopped in for a tea and wanted to finally try one of their sandwiches, but spotted a freshly baked quiche and luckily ordered that instead, delicious.  Their breakfast (weekend) menu was also very tempting.  I think if I lived nearby, these folks would know me well.  I would also recommend their pain du chocolat.  I have no idea if it's the best around, as I think chocolate pastries are pretty much delicious no matter what, but it was great, even though I saved it for later rather than devouring it immediately.",4.0
"I prefer this place to Qathra or whatever the other one is called.  I get tea so can't comment on the coffee, the pastries are alright.  There are plenty of outlets and tables and they have the heat on unlike Qathra.  The staff is very friendly, I can't comment on the changes or the owner as someone else did in another post as I've just started going there, but for a cafe it's a-ok.",3.0
"It seems like every new cafe, bar or restaurant that pops up on Cortelyou is stylish enough to put Soho to shame. Cafe Madeline certainly continues the trend! Absolutely beautiful interior design/decor. Elegant, minimalist space. Free wifi, newspapers and magazines to read. Nice amount of seating. Super tasty coffee drinks, and small but interesting menu of light breakfast & lunch fare. I have not found many gourmet coffee shops that also do food well, but they certainly seem to hit both notes. Places like this make me want to move to the neighborhood!",4.0

"It's hard finding that cafe that stands out from the rest but this might be my favorite yet. Cafe Madeline has simple food and beverage menus that make it easy to choose from.

They used to only accept cash but they've upgraded to credit cards which makes it easier for me. Did I mention they have free Wi-Fi!? Forgot about gluten free options as well.

Even though a week ago it wasn't even open, this Sunday it was as if this low key new neighborhood cafe had been open for years. It's smallish, with a few tables in the back and one large table up front,  but it is charming, with a white tin-pressed ceiling and raw, unpainted walls, save for a strip of wallpaper in the back. They have a snazzy new espresso machine, high quality beans and treats, and since I believe the owners are Australian, something called Australian style coffee, which is two shots of espresso with vanilla ice cream on top. Um, wow.The servers are friendly, nice, and know their stuff. They have a hanging magazine and newspaper rack if you want to borrow reading material and sit and chill out.If I lived in the area, I'd definitely come back soon!",4.0
"it's cute and the food is good, but the crowd is powerfully douche-y and it's overpriced (a cup of tea is $3 here). I usually go to Qathra, right down the street, and between the two, I think Qathra is in general better.",3.0
"Awesome cheddar, kale, and roasted pepper sandwich on sourdough bread.  Phenomenal selection of loose teas--  Kusmi from Russia and some nice domestics.  Super-friendly and enthusiastic baristas.  The only possible downside: the back room feels like a 21st C. sweatshop for web 2.0 content producers.  It's full of 20-somethings with their Mac Books ablaze.  But maybe this is your thing?  The big communal table in the front where it's light and airy is awesome (and serves as ballast for the back room).",5.0
Awesome chai tea latte and pastries. Very good vibe. Went twice last weekend when visiting a friend in BK,5.0
"I want to like this place so much. It's adorable inside, they actually serve a decent brand of coffee and its the only non chain coffee shop in my neighborhood. However the staff are rude rude rude. Every time I go in they are having some sort of problem and service is slow. Today I ordered a large mocha - it was $5 - and it was served in a 10oz cup. But the worst was that it was barely even warm. Get it together over there guys! In the mean time I'll be getting my actual large lattes for $3 from dunks.",2.0
"I believe Madeline is under new ownership and it's gotten so much better.  Stumptown coffee now, which holds up great as iced coffee.  But the food is the real surprise.  Bacon is amazing.  A little bacon & eggs breakfast (with great bread) was just over $5. The music is great too.  This is now my fav coffee shop in the neighborhood.",5.0
"cafe madeline makes me want to move back to ditmas park.  8 years ago, when i lived there i frequented the cornerstone, 773, cinco de mayo, georges, and once in a while, picket fence.  vox was ok, but i always felt i lacked enough political literacy to hang out there.  plus the babies were noisy.  but cafe madeline is absolutely lovely.  i had a stumptown soy latte, which could have been hotter, but it was so flavorful i didn't even mind.  the assortment of baked goodies were mouthwateringly alluring.  i almost tried an almond croissant, but ran out of time.  the selection of reading materials in the back of the cafe made me happy.  i perused the nytimes magazine and men's health.  the crowd was young and pleasant, fueling up on caffeine and delicious smelling paninis.  the boys behind the counter were pleasant, industrious, and knowledgeable. if madeline was here when i moved away from ditmas, it would have been incentive to stay.   i'm looking forward to returning to try their flat white.",5.0
"I understand that there was a bunch of controversy surrounding the recent change in management, which resulted in the tacky ""We Love Ditmas Park"" sign in the window.  It's really too bad that the previous owner made himself persona non grata in the 'hood, because they produced a mean latte.  Now, it's a serviceable latte, but not worth walking all the way there to drink.On the other hand, I had an absolutely terrific sandwich here.  Stand up and cheer good.  Sandwich worth walking all the way over here to eat.Just wish they would bring the lattes up to the level of the sandwiches.",3.0
"We couldn't be more thrilled to have a cafe on the ""wrong side of the tracks"" end of Cortelyou.  I love that they're open early and serve a variety of breakfast options - all very delicious.  Best iced coffee since Cafe Tibet stopped serving ""breakfast.""  I also dig the French country/parlour decor.  Prices are high for the neighborhood, but it's a great place when you want to treat yourself or have an early weekend brunch with a friend.",4.0
"ambiance and amenities. the style is rustic cute AND they are super nice about camping out all day.its not cheap but the coffee is good, but you are really paying for is the ambiance and the amenities:-free and strong internet- they installed many outlets so there isnt a struggle to plug in and no ugly jocking for a good table near the outlet. - they crank the AC during the summer which was much needed this month and last.great place to actually get work done and the meals are yummy.and yah the staff is nice.",4.0
"A pretty little cafe with a work-of-art espresso machine and beautiful baristas. I picture myself going here with girlfriends on an early Sunday afternoon, snacking on croissants and sipping Madeline's strong, single-serving coffee. Though, since my girlfriends and I are more or less broke, we'd only go on special occasions. Nevertheless, yay for new coffee shops on Cortelyou Road!And yes, that ""Australian coffee"" does look scrumptious.",4.0
Best coffee joint in the neighborhood. Just went on Sunday and they had their coffees on sale. 2.00 large cups. Excellent stumptown coffee.  Get the almond croissants as well... delish,5.0

"good coffee and food but the service, woof. it's not like anyone working there has a particular baditude, they're just all super space cadets, maybe they should drink some of the product before opening so they can focus up. if you're in a hurry you should probably just skip this place. expect to place your order more than once and if you're getting something to go be sure to check it before you leave the cafe. if they do get your order right, you'll be chomping on hella tasty muffins or breakfast sammies and drinking awesome lattes and their nonsense won't matter. there are also mad babies and strollers in here but madeline i ain't mad at cha, that's just a symptom of brooklyn.",4.0
"I love this place! The coffee is great, the baristas are nice, and the overall design is impeccable. It's a little expensive but it's all high quality food so it's worth it. The turkey croissant sandwich is amazing and reasonably priced. Last time I was in there they were playing my favorite band ""The Unicorns"" - that says more about this place than I ever could.",5.0
"Their food is kind of expensive for nothing really special, but their lattes are fantastic - the foam is so thick and rich you could float a quarter on top. Nice ambiance: bright enough to read without feeling like you're in a cafeteria, decent music playing not too loudly, and plenty of seating - a large communal table at the front, bar against one wall, and 2-tops in the back.

A new blue haired, coffee goddess has recently started working here. She makes the best espresso imaginable. They have a good selection of teas also. The idea of a small pot of tea for in store orders really makes me happy. It's even the same price as to go teas. The sandwiches and soups blow my mind. I've tried a handful of sandwiches and I haven't been disappointed. A chive biscuit; genius! I haven't tried many of their pastries but they sure look good! The prices are also decent.

"I can't exactly remember what life was like before Madeline.  Living a little farther out in Brooklyn, it's nice that one of my favorite cafes happens to be two blocks from my apartment.  Although if it weren't, I'd still make the trek (plus it's practically across the street from the train).  As a student, and a coffee addict, Madeline fits the bill.  Awesome beans (Counter Culture), expertly brewed by unpretentious and friendly baristas.  The food food is delish and surprisingly substantial.  Kinda beautiful; white granite counter-top and royal blue espresso machine, artfully stripped walls and some vintage looking wallpaper in the back, high-ceilings.  Free wifi and lots of outlets.  On the weekends it gets a little more crowded with families, but I've never had a problem getting a table; and never felt like I was unwanted when I stayed for an hour or two to study.  My only request would be that they were open later!",5.0
