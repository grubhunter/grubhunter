"An old favorite of my girl friend's and maybe a new favorite of mine, right along the N line in the heart of brooklyn.She mentioned to me that it's a cafeteria, but it's a restaurant, and it all made sense once I saw the line across the front, patrons breathing heavily on the glass as they watched italian delights crafted right in front of them.While many were in and out collecting food, we chose to sit, and got right to the point, calamari. I wanted something cool to cut through the zesty crisp calamari, so I got a chicken salad too.The calamari itself, crisp, wild, so flavorful and unique complete with spicy marinara sauce(you have to request it be hot). Note to everywhere else, you SHOULD season the calamari too! They played no games with theirs, it may be the best you've ever had.Somewhere in the meal, I realized our server never asked what dressing I wanted, so I wondered what I'd get. She delivered this nicely dressed salad, the ingredients fresh, and the chicken warm, soaked in balsamic vinegrette. I expected a little simple salad since I requested a small because we were on the go, but this was sit up and lay your napkin over your lap for. This is the boldness too many olaces need.Will return again whenever I can!",4.0
"I've been meaning to dine in at this establishment for the longest only because I grew up in the local area. I finally got to dine here and it was a bit of a disappointment. Rocco's Calamari, their calamari must be amazing ... Nope. People might start criticizing me for saying so but I will still stand by my opinion. The calamari was one of the dishes that I was very unsatisfied with. I wasn't feeling the vibe and atmosphere upon entering. I didn't feel like I belonged in there. It took long enough before they acknowledged us. The whole dining area is an open space ... there's no way you didn't see me walk in. Note that there were only like three occupied tables. Was not busy at all. The first impression and service provided wasn't great but it got a bit better in the end. This place is very very casual. As for the food, I played it safe with the typical Italian dishes that you can't really go wrong with. The Penne a la Vodka, I wanted to send this dish back if it was possible. It was very plain, not even sure what flavor it was aiming for. This dish wasn't hot and didn't seem fresh to me. The Chicken Parm .. I definitely had better. I can probably cook better Chicken Parm than the one they have. I don't even want to go into how I feel about the rest of the dishes if the Penne a la Vodka and Chicken Parm wasn't up to par. I'm sorry Rocco's, but I'd rather satisfy my Italian food cravings elsewhere.",2.0
"One of the best Calamari spots, the portion was huge as well! When I crave for this place, it's closed, when I don't crave for it, I see it open! It has a very huge variety of Italian food and placed out for you to see what you like. You can order from there and ask them to heat it up for you or you can order from the menu. It's a pretty good spot!",4.0
"Very wonderful service and feel to this place.Rocco is super nice and out waitress, Cookie was great!We got half dozen baked clams, stuffed mushrooms and went to town on the complimentary bread. The eggplant parmigiana platter with penne alla vodka and fried shrimp with penne alla vodka. Huge portions and worth the price!The amaretto tartufo is amazing! Delicious ice cream, nuts and chocolate chips on the shell and it's not even too sweet! With the whipped cream and chocolate syrup they dress it up with, it is even more delicious!",4.0
"Been going to Rocco's my entire life and have never been disappointed. Their food is always so fresh and delicious. The Calamari is to die for, hence the name. Love their chicken Parmesan. My dad always brought me here as a kid and I'll continue to bring my kids here one day. Travel from Jersey for Rocco's all the time.",5.0
"Ordered out and I must say I was surprised at how  the calamari tasted. It was good but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I was upset because I spoke to someone on the phone and I asked how many orders of the calamari would be enough for 4 people, I was told 2 but really one was more than enough. So they pretty much ripped me off. I also ordered the penne a la vodka and the fettuccine. It was good but it had way too much sauce. The bread that came with the whole meal was soft, they should've toasted it. Definitely not worth what I spent.",3.0
"I've been a regular here for 13 years, very good food, great quality, great cooks their very friendly an remember what I usually like to order. Their is always seating available kind of like seat yourself. The parking lot is a bit tight, an their is never street parking. Rocco is always standing at the register in a black t-shirt he's the owner, Nice man a bit flirty but I get straight to the point. I would recommend their garlic bread, their penne vodka, garlic pasta with olive oil roasted peppers an sundried tomatoes. Um the mozzarella an tomatoes baked clams their salads. Pretty much everything is great. Definitely a good go-to quick an great quality restaurant for lunch and dinner.",4.0
Roccos is ok but I find their pastas watery. Also seems like the man that picks up the phone also changes the prices a lot. Sometimes the pasta is $10 sometimes $12. The seafood salad is great very fresh though they do not use real crab meat. I do like that when theyre in a good mood they'll give you garlic bread if you ask. Delivery is extremely fast.,3.0
"Lets start by saying I'm only giving it one star because you can't give a zero. Don't waste your money at this place, there are so many better Italian places to eat. This place is far from authentic. The owner is a complete jerk, unprofessional, and rude, he acts if we have no other options. The food is prepared In a filthy , disgusting kitchen , pots and dishes are barely cleaned when preparing a new dish. The cooks are not Italian and have no idea how to prepare real authentic Italian cuisine, do not be fooled by this fraud owner.     Calamari is rubbery and over cooked, eggplant is sour tasting, chicken is greasy and oily, terrible place, meatloaf is just meat, no seasoning at all, please take your hard earned money elsewhere , oh yeah watch out for the critters ( rats and roaches )",1.0

"I really love calamari but I dont like calamari thats chewy or not prepared right. The calamari from here is border line good...too just plain sad. They do offer 3 different types of sauces with the calamari - regular, mild and hot. But that is not gonna make up for chewy under cooked calamari.And I ordered a steak hero which was not steak. I know the difference between steak and short ribs. Short Ribs is part of the cow, but not a steak cut of meat. I liked the hero cause short ribs are not bad. But the chalk board said steak so I didnt get steak.The food from here is mostly steam table style with many options but this place has really lost its flare from years gone by.I will stick with Ginos for my Calamari from now on!!!",3.0
This place used to be so great! I went for a lunch date and the food was extremely disappointing. The calamari looked and tasted like frozen calamari that was deep fried and slapped onto a platter. I took my partner because I had such wonderful experiences before. The waitress was also inattentive and rough. It felt like I blended into the establishment and therefore was forgotten by the waitress often. I've had so much better. Will not be returning.,2.0

I've been to Rocco's calamari many times in the past over the years and it's always been good and fresh- however my last few visits there I noticed that the restaurant is dirty the portions are small and the precooked food is reheated and it taste like it came out of the freezer and a cardboard box. The calamari  were  greasy and old tasting with old frying oil or precooked then reheated..something not right and they've lost the consistency of the food.  I hate giving an old neighborhood restaurant that's been there for many years that I've been to many times a bad review but maybe it will serve as a little wake up call.,2.0

"I would prefer to give 3.5 or 3.75 stars, but feel it is closer to 4 than 3. The menu is varied, but not too extensive, so that you know what they make is something they have fresh. The specials were pretty varied as well. Authentic, with a lot of garlic, the sides compliment the portions, which, thankfully, unlike a lot of Italian places, are not too huge. The pasta that came with the sausage and peppers was obviously pre-cooked, which wasn't great, but the peppers and onions themselves were great, as was the sauce, which had just a little spice. Not open late, or on the prettiest street, but worth a trip to.",4.0

"Rocco's is simply amazing. I've been going here for over half my life. Just recently I was coming back from a friends house, driving down Fort Hamilton Parkway and I hit the brakes......... There was a dog with a puffy tail and had to chase it. After doing so I noticed I was in front of Rocco's. Very fond memories growing up going to this classic Italian eatery. You can sit down and get waiter service or proceed to the food yourself. Super friendly staff will help you make your selections. They even do half orders if you want a little bit of everything. Obviously as the name suggests, the calamari is fantastic. A must if you've never been here. Also I love the eggplant, the penne a la vodka and those mini rice balls. I suggest getting the real hot red sauce for your calamari. Rocco will be in the front to check you out, give you some bread and always chat it up with you for a bit. Great owner.In an area of Brooklyn lacking diversity of food, especially at such an amazing price, you can't go wrong at Rocco's.",5.0
"My meatballs parmigiana with spaghetti tasted exactly like it was made from chef boyardee. my friend had pasta with clams and the clams were obviously from a can. the prices are also on the high side considering it was subpar food. the calamari is chewy and too salty. considering it's the only italian restaurant around the ft. hamilton area, i can see why this establishment is still open.By the way, I think the high reviews from other people are either fake or paid by individuals to write them.",2.0

The glass of sangria was also perfect in proportion and it definitely caught my eye when I walked in! Very authentic Italian taste and the staff was exceptionally friendly and always ready to recommend you anything if you don't know what to order! They are knowledgeable of the menu and dishes! Workers there always acknowledge that a customer has entered the restaurant and it's such a welcoming environment! I will be returning as a regular!",4.0
"My name is Alan and I am a Calamariholic. I don't blame Rocco's I was born this way. I personally love the way this place makes their fried calamari, not over cooked. (I also love squid sushi.)  Some folks don't like it that way... OK. so instead of hating on Rocco's why not just ask for yours well done? Eh?",5.0
"I'm a regular at this place. Owner is friendly and interacts with customers all the time. Food has always been consistently good for me and my whole lot of friends that I introduced this place to, which has now become a place we routinely visited for years. Must try the Penne vodka with calamari/chicken masalaThey also serve good breakfast sandwiches and platters starting around 6:30 am.P.S. they are closed every Sunday and Monday",5.0
Best calamari in brooklyn.  Excellent home cooked reasonably priced food.  Spotess clean place with a really nice old fashioned atmosphere.  Kitchen is out there in the open.,5.0
"I would prefer to give 3.5 or 3.75 stars, but feel it is closer to 4 than 3. The menu is varied, but not too extensive, so that you know what they make is something they have fresh. The specials were pretty varied as well. Authentic, with a lot of garlic, the sides compliment the portions, which, thankfully, unlike a lot of Italian places, are not too huge. The pasta that came with the sausage and peppers was obviously pre-cooked, which wasn't great, but the peppers and onions themselves were great, as was the sauce, which had just a little spice. Not open late, or on the prettiest street, but worth a trip to.",4.0
Used to really love this place until today. We walked in the to order our dinner to go. Not only we waited 45 minutes for an order of chicken franchise but they served it over vodka sauce! Since when is vodka sauce a part of that dish?,3.0
"Rocco's is simply amazing. I've been going here for over half my life. Just recently I was coming back from a friends house, driving down Fort Hamilton Parkway and I hit the brakes......... There was a dog with a puffy tail and had to chase it. After doing so I noticed I was in front of Rocco's. Very fond memories growing up going to this classic Italian eatery. You can sit down and get waiter service or proceed to the food yourself. Super friendly staff will help you make your selections. They even do half orders if you want a little bit of everything. Obviously as the name suggests, the calamari is fantastic. A must if you've never been here. Also I love the eggplant, the penne a la vodka and those mini rice balls. I suggest getting the real hot red sauce for your calamari. Rocco will be in the front to check you out, give you some bread and always chat it up with you for a bit. Great owner.In an area of Brooklyn lacking diversity of food, especially at such an amazing price, you can't go wrong at Rocco's.",5.0
"My meatballs parmigiana with spaghetti tasted exactly like it was made from chef boyardee. my friend had pasta with clams and the clams were obviously from a can. the prices are also on the high side considering it was subpar food. the calamari is chewy and too salty. considering it's the only italian restaurant around the ft. hamilton area, i can see why this establishment is still open.By the way, I think the high reviews from other people are either fake or paid by individuals to write them.",2.0

"Great Calamari, Cold Shrimp, and Pulpo!  Haven't had more than that, because these are my favorites.  Four stars this trip.  The sauce satisfies for the calamari but not enough kick .  When I ask for hot sauce, I want some good 'ol mott street hot sauce.  Overall very good quality food.  Shrimp are nice sized, calamari cooked perfectly, and where else are you going to find a pulpo salad like mom makes.  Ask for Carmela. She has a great attitude and is a very accommodating waitress.  I have returned more than once already.",4.0

Tried this place today for the first time and was a bit disappointed. I don't like giving negative reviews unless it truly is warranted. This is one of those places. The decor needs updating for sure. There wasn't much of a welcome and we didn't know if we should sit on our own or be seated until someone motioned us to sit on a table for two which had minimal table space. The waiter was nice but everything very rushed. We ordered the calamari which was pretty good. We ordered it with the mild sauce which was very tasty. For my entree I ordered Penne a la vodka which wasn't bad but wasn't good either. It was warm but it probably would have been better hot. My husband ordered spaghettis with garlic and oil. It's suppose to come with fettuccine but since he wanted chicken with it they changed it for spaghetti. It was pretty bland unfortunately. I don't think we will be returning unfortunately.,2.0

Fried Calamari - This was my favorite!! Crispy and hot when I ate it and their marinara sauce was also delicious.Salmon with Pasta - Presentation of this dish was a little too simple. Salmon fillet over a bed of pasta and there was barely any sauce on it, making the pasta bland and tasteless. Chicken Ceasar Salad - This came in a big plate, definitely made to share with others. Chicken was grilled to perfection and their lettuce was fresh and crisp. Overall rating : Four Stars!If you haven't tried it yet, definitely should try it out!",4.0
What can I say eating at Roccos is like eating at Nonnas house!!! His namesake dish is fried Calamari and he deserves a medal for it.

Be sure to get a large if you have a group of people. I also remember the crab cakes being really good. The owner likes to chat up with customers and give some personal opinions on the food.

"Rocco's is one of Brooklyn's finest family run Italian eateries. It's open five days a week for lunch and dinner, and they even do catering. The food is modestly priced, the quality is amazing and the portions are generous.

Ordering off the Menu or picking your meal by pointing to it from behind the glass food counter is your choice. It's always nice to see what the food looks like, before ordering it. Remember to leave room for desert, because your gonna want to have a cannoli :) Order a cannoli  and watch them make it in front of you. The staff is friendly and happy to make suggestions .

"A great place to take your grandmother for some decent, no frills homemade Italian food. We ordered a small fried calamari, which came tender and lightly fried. A seafood salad - very fresh and delicious. An order of escarole and beans which was nice and garlicky. The eggplant parmesan - not overly cheesy - was very good and did not take up an entire plate, so no stomachache there. A plate of sausage and roasted yellow peppers in a lovely red sauce. Good service until the end when we had a hard time tracking our waitress down for the check. I'd go back but I wouldn't rush back.",3.0

The service was so friendly. The calamari was delicious and not too breaded. I knew i liked the calamari even better when some of the breading fell off. It tasted fresh. The sauce was a little salty and not really spicy. That is why I did not give it five stars. The prices were so reasonable.I will be back!!!",4.0
"A great place to take your grandmother for some decent, no frills homemade Italian food. We ordered a small fried calamari, which came tender and lightly fried. A seafood salad - very fresh and delicious. An order of escarole and beans which was nice and garlicky. The eggplant parmesan - not overly cheesy - was very good and did not take up an entire plate, so no stomachache there. A plate of sausage and roasted yellow peppers in a lovely red sauce. Good service until the end when we had a hard time tracking our waitress down for the check. I'd go back but I wouldn't rush back.",3.0
Place is a classic. Great lunch spot food is awesome and extremely fresh. The roast pork is my favorite slow cooked and tender as can be. Healthy options available but not recommended! Same faces there for a long time too which is nice to see.,5.0
"Whenever I'm in the area around lunchtime I hop over to Rocco's for a quick seafood lunch. Food is always fresh, service prompt, reasonable prices, what else can one ask for? Not a date place and I don't know about dinner, but for a quick, casual lunch it's perfect. It's kind of a Brooklyn institution. Would certainly recommend it.",4.0
"Very good food and the service is terrific, everything in there looked and smelt so good. I had the filet of soul and broccoli with steak. But I'm definitely looking forward to going back there.",4.0
"Really great home made Italian food, service is great, food is fresh and ready to be served. Calamari was really good, lasagna was delicious,  chicken parmigiana and pasta a la Vodka sauce was out of this world... Price wise it is very reasonable.",5.0
"Love this place.  It's an annual tradition to go there for dinner before or after seeing the Christmas lights in Dyker Heights.  The calamari were a huge hit, so were all the veggies.  Kiddos loved the pasta of course.",4.0
"I like Rocco's a lot. Food is cheap and well portioned. It is a basic, non fancy in the least restaurant. You go here for the food, not the atmosphere. They have the food set out lunch counter style, but with wait staff.  This is no way effects the food quality. Not dry, tastes good, and gets brought over quickly.Their lasagna is great, so is the penne alla vodka. I am not a calamari fan so I can't judge but I hear from others it is good.",4.0
"When the Calamari is fresh, it is very good. Other times, you can easy get bottom of the barrel chewy calamari. Hit or miss kind of deal.",2.0
Hands down best food in sunset park been going there as far back as I can remember service is great very friendly,5.0
"Finally tried the place after passing by here numerous times while i was on the bus, it seems like a well established italian place, and it is what it seem like! a gf and I went on a weeknight, it was kinda quite even at dinner time, so I thought it could be resulted from the snow storm a day ago. we were greeted by a italian mama waitress, i'm sorry, she was in no help recommending even though we told her it's our first time, we ended up ordering whole bunch of things from grilled veggies (completely blant), rigatoni w marinara sauce and meatball (pasta was cooked el dente, but the sauce was so thin and flavorless i was convinced i could do better job at home!  their most famous fried calamari-disappointingly flavorless and chewy, and the crab cake (taste like the frozen ones you got from the supermarket)! service was slow, we're pretty much ignored after the foods were bought to us.  If anything i do like from everything, it's the meatballs, it's juicy, flavorful and huge!",3.0
"Great neighborhood place.  Rocco mans the register and roams the room, greeting regulars and newcomers alike.  The waitresses have been there forever and are sweethearts.  Everyone at every table is clearly enjoying the joint.  The food?  Check out the board on your way in for daily specials and scan the trays of food behind the glass barrier.  The calamari is always awesome.  Salads excellent.  Fried zucchini fresh and hot.  Pastas, eggplant and veal pram, red sauce classics all done well.  Portions huge.  Get a carafe of red and enjoy a night out with friends or family.",4.0

"Amazing food at amazing prices!Located on Ft Hamilton Parkway, not far from the N train, Rocco's is as good as it gets. A decent sized place and they even have seating outside on nice weather days.  Walk in, find an open table and a waitress will bring a menu. Or, if you want you can walk up to the counter and see all the fresh food that's out that might not even be on the menu.  Once the food arrives, it's hot, fresh and delicious.  Last time I was here I had the meatball parm hero and it was amazing.  Plus, the portions are huge. The staff is very friendly and very attentive to your needs. The tables are not on top of each other so you have plenty of space and it never feels crowded, even on full house days.",5.0
"Owner adds 20% tip to the bill when you use a restaurant.com certificate even though the service may not have been worth 20%, like maybe 15%.......I could understand if we were a party of 8 or 10, but it was just 4 of us.......

I used to like roccos and maybe it was the fact that I came at 3pm but I paid $11 for a plate of chicken marsala and rice which was heated up in the microwave.  Dude cmon-make smaller batches cause all it did was make my chicken chewy and the rice mushy.  This is a trucker stop so its not fancy...and I'm just not into it anymore.,2.0
"Walked in to take out.. and everything looked so good it took a few minutes to figure out what we wanted.I got the beef with peppers and onions with mashed potatoes.The beef was so tender the sauce was so yummy.My cousin got the fillet of sole w roasted potatoes, he said the fish was super fresh and flaky with a great tasting sauce.Also got a rice ball. which was pretty good toowe both loved our dishes and all for  25 bucks!!!!  Thats a great price for a lot of  food and came with a few pieces of Italian bread!!! Cant go wrongBtw the guys behind the counter were super nice!",4.0
"Thank goodness I wore a loose fitting shirt when I ate at Rocco's for lunch.  I left with my tummy protesting at the amount of food it was carrying.  Rocco's portions are humongous, and during lunch, it really does feel like a cafeteria where you walk up to the register and declare what you want while people scoop heaping portions of food from hot trays for you.  I had the eggplant parm, and it was delectable.  Paired with a mound of linguine (you can choose your pasta) and a sweet tangy marinara sauce, I had no shame in tearing into my plate like a toddler eating cake, sauce on chin included.  Service is quick but pleasant, there are many tables for seating, and they've got a fridge stocked with a variety of drinks.Parking is a problem (as in, there is no parking, and street spots are scarce).  Come here if you've got an appetite, they've also got a crazy salad, olives, cold apps and sides bar,and their fresh mozz w/ tomatoes and basil?  You best be ready to unbutton your pants.",4.0

"I recommend! Great place if you live around there and don't want to head out in the rain (which was my situation). Delivery came in 15 minutes literally and the food was hot, huge portions, and cheap!My friend ate with a bias cause someone told him it was eh. But being totally unbiased and open to trying new things, I thought this place is definitely a place I'd order from again. For two people, we ordered stuffed mushrooms, two riceballs, two potato croquettes, and an order of penne alla vodka. The penne alla vodka actually came in rigatoni, but eh, doesn't matter to me. The sauce was very creamy and flavorful, but it wasn't anything extraordinary. I've had better, but not bad at all. The stuffed mushrooms came with 7! even though the menu said 6. That made me happy haha. They tasted okay also. I don't know what they were stuffed with, but tasted like breadcrumbs? Strong fresh mushroom taste as well. The potato croquettes were a little dry, but they were huge, and it cost 75 cents. (what?? really??) According to my friend, the riceball was more potato-y than rice, but I didn't get to try it cause there was so much food. All under $20! We couldn't even finish everything!Our order also came with free bread! WHAT! How many places you know give you free bread when you order takeout?? It was good bread too, and it came with butter and lots of utensils and napkins. Definitely a plus here!Also, saw the delivery guy from the window and he biked here in the rain. Props.

Delicious, creamy penne ala vodka (damn, you, wedding diet!) and generous portions of veal parm? I'm a fan. Plus, there are awesome waitresses, who call you sweetheart and don't take any shit.

"We came, we ate (eggplant Parmesan and cannolis), we disagreed (I liked the place a lot, she was less enthusiastic).It was our first visit to Rocco's and based on the previous reviews, we went for the eggplant Parm.  It is more of an eggplant lasagna than what one thinks of when one says Parmesan). My friend felt it was lacking taste but I liked the flavor. Our salads were not fancy but far better than what she was served at a far more expensive Italian restaurant last Saturday night (though their bread was much better).  For dessert we split a cannoli as well as our opinion. I thought it was great, she felt it was okay.  Service as many others have noted was fast, efficient and friendly. The place itself is informal and has a neighborhood feel which I personally enjoy.So basically I think the restaurant is quite good for the price, she thinks it is average at best, and lucky for Rocco, I am writing this review!!    :-)",4.0

Everything is delizioso!There is outdoor seating, parking and wine. A very good place to bring friends and family. Is this place good for a date? Depends on the girl: If she likes to eat, yes.

"Old school?  You bet!  Home cooked old school Italian comfort food served in a boisterous cafeteria/restaurant setting.  Don't feel one bit bad about yelling across to your friends 4 tables over - it's great for families and groups and my 3 year old loves it.It is a go to lunch time spot for locals and due to it's ""MAN"" sized portions it lures a lot of them in here.....SIDE NOTE:  if you are a single woman this is a GOOD thing!I've been coming to Roccos since I've had to place my order on tip toe. My taste buds first learned to love and appreciate eggplant parm here and it remains consistently perfect throughout the years.  It is the eggplant parm I use to measure every other one against and few measure up. Despite what some of the reviewers wrote below, the waitresses will take your order when seated but you have to let them know you haven't ordered yet.  There is also some sidewalk seating for the warmer weather and the B16 stops right out front. Definitely CLEAN, they take this seriously (if you ever stick around late enough to get closed out you'll see lol) so I always feel great about eating here. I am so happy it has survived despite the ever changing neighborhood around it. I LOVE YOU ROCCO!!!!",5.0

"Many times I walked or drove past Rocco's, on a busy stretch of Fort Hamilton Parkway in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn. Watching the diners inside and out who seemed to be enjoying their food, I was eager to try this Italian outpost in a neighborhood that's become mostly Chinese.We went on a Saturday night around 6pm and were seated quickly. (Later, the place became quite full and busy). Rocco's is not fancy in any way. The menu has most of the typical things you'd expect in storefront Italian and you can see most of the entrees because they are in big stainless steel warming trays visible behind glass.As you probably already know, linguine in a warming tray is never gonna be ""al dente.""Because this place is called ""Rocco's Calamari"" we did have to try the calamari as an appetizer. It was good, but not special. The red dipping sauce was pale in color and flavor. An order of shrimp cocktail yielded 6 HUGE shrimp, nicely peeled. I was disappointed that the pulpo (octopus) salad on the menu was no longer offered.I ordered the baked ziti based on eyeballing it in its tray. My 2 companions ordered chicken parm and the linguine with garlic and oil. We ordered a carafe of wine as the waitress brought a basket of excellent fresh Italian bread. No fancy seasoned olive oil for dipping -- just little packets of butter like you get at a diner.My baked ziti was fine, but just like you'd get at any storefront Italian place. Its red sauce seemed canned and not even as good as Ragu. The chicken parm was the same. The linguine was of course over-soft, and it tasted like garlic from a jar in the oil & garlic.The bill, including tax, came to only $53 for the wine, 2 appetizers, one soft drink, and three entrees. So this is what Rocco's is: a good value destination. You can sit and drink and talk and eat a lot without spending a lot.On balance, we were disappointed and won't return. I will say, the place was full and lively and most folks seemed quite happy. If you aren't a serious foodie, it's a decent choice.I am Pizza Quixote!",2.0
"Ok so I like calamari when is comes with the little tentacles attached and generaly prefer thinner rings and a more crumbly coating, but apparently these people know a thing or two about the calamari frying because after a few bites of these wide rings of very fresh cephalopod with a crisp and fine-grained batter, I was hooked. The food is delicious despite coming off a steam table, I guess the food here moves fast enough that things stay fresh because everything looked delicious. The decor is extremely not fancy. It's the kind of place where half the patrons are wearing sports jerseys. The service is incredibly friendly, like at the extreme edge of Regular New York Friendliness ALMOST bordering on a South Philly level of Friendliness but not quite. Which means that, as a New Yorker, to me these people are literally as nice as you could possibly want. Prices are almost at Philly levels too. A huge plate of calamari, served with a choice of mild, medium or hot Marinara and bread on the side, with a Peroni, was $14.50. I brought home half the calamari.  I will definitely be back.",5.0
"I don't understand the rave reviews about this place. They are truly misleading. The staff are nice and welcoming but overworked. They are tired and it shows. Upon entering, we were not greeted and waited until we were told to sit wherever. We waited for 15 minutes for menus in the sweltering heat. By the way, this place only has fans and no ac. But it feels like no sanctuary at all in the summer with their ovens running. The calamari was decent but very oily and rubbery. The baked clams were so minuscule! And I nearly broke a tooth because there was broken shell baked inside one of the clams-unacceptable. The ravioli is yummy but ricotta cheese based and different. The spaghetti and meatballs had no sauce and the meatball was mostly made of beading with very little meat within it. None of the food was finished because it wasn't worth the calories. Not worth it. You would expect to find some good Italian food in this neighborhood but you can definitely make much better Italian food homemade with a fraction of the cost and much more tastier.",1.0
"This place has the best calamari I've ever had. Lightly battered, incredibly fresh, crispy, salty, and just so tasty! I couldn't get enough! The service is casual, friendly, and frankly just funny -- you're guaranteed a good time. Let them push their house-made sangria on you. It's delicious and goes so well with all the delicious Italian food they serve up. You can check out the prepared food bar and order from there, or order from the menu. Both options seem to work out quite well! We loved the penne for the kids too.",5.0

"Coming back to eat here after a few years felt like I never left...You feel welcome when you come here. It's casual, the service is quick, but not rushed and the aroma of the food is to die for. There is a small bar area to the left and a large food court style area that has everything you would expect in an Italian sit down type restaurant. I don't know where to start... Everything is delizioso!There is outdoor seating, parking and wine. A very good place to bring friends and family. Is this place good for a date? Depends on the girl: If she likes to eat, yes. (Shouldn't be dating girls who don't like to eat anyways!)All around Rocco's Calamari is a great place, yes, I will go back soon!",3.0
"Old school?  You bet!  Home cooked old school Italian comfort food served in a boisterous cafeteria/restaurant setting.  Don't feel one bit bad about yelling across to your friends 4 tables over - it's great for families and groups and my 3 year old loves it.It is a go to lunch time spot for locals and due to it's ""MAN"" sized portions it lures a lot of them in here.....SIDE NOTE:  if you are a single woman this is a GOOD thing!I've been coming to Roccos since I've had to place my order on tip toe. My taste buds first learned to love and appreciate eggplant parm here and it remains consistently perfect throughout the years.  It is the eggplant parm I use to measure every other one against and few measure up. Despite what some of the reviewers wrote below, the waitresses will take your order when seated but you have to let them know you haven't ordered yet.  There is also some sidewalk seating for the warmer weather and the B16 stops right out front. Definitely CLEAN, they take this seriously (if you ever stick around late enough to get closed out you'll see lol) so I always feel great about eating here. I am so happy it has survived despite the ever changing neighborhood around it. I LOVE YOU ROCCO!!!!",5.0

"This is the Holy Grail of old school urban Italian.  I found Rocco's just driving by years ago.....and I have been back numerous times, even though  I work in NJ and dont live anywhere near it.  Great eggplant parm, of course the fried calamari and everything else....Worth the journey and even better if you happen to pass by.  Dont forget to get food for dinner the next day once you re there, you'll be happy you did.  And thank me.",5.0

There are fresh cannolis prepared and espresso served.  There is wait service available in a sort of hybrid buffet/restaurant feel.  Sort of like, pick out what you want and we'll bring it to you.  Rocco's impresses with it's unique presentation, home style service and authentic food.  And like any Italian eatery that is worth it's weight, their is one famous photograph hanging on the wall.  The patron saint of Italian Dining.  Gandolfini.",5.0

"This is hands down, the best calamari I've ever had.  The other seafood especially the crab cakes are fantastic too, and the chicken and veal parmesian are also solid choices.  Best of all prices are reasonable so you can fill up on a lot of different dishes, but bring lots of friends as serving sizes are on the large size.",5.0
"I love Rocco's, ever since a friend took me there in the 70's. Back then, they only served breakfast and lunch which I thought was so cool. You know you've come to a place where the food is great when you see so many large, Italian men (a lot of Sanitation guys) eating there. The whole experience is great from the cafeteria -like ordering (Say what you want and they'll bring it to you) to the matter of fact way they deal with customers. The food is wonderful, particularly if you've been brought up in an Italian home with a grandmother who can really cook. Don't miss the potato croquettes, and of course, the calamari. No parking, but it's worth the bother to find a space and walk to the restaurant. This is a no frills place that will delight and surprise you. Come hungry.",5.0
my boyfriend took me here. he swears by this place. it was okay. typical americanized italian food. the penne vodka tasted so bad it tasted like  pasta and ricotta. too cheesy and too thick. the chicken parm was good... but typical and the potato croquette was good too. if i was hungry i would go again but i would like to try something else. but not making it a point to go again either... wasnt that serious to me!,3.0
"Definitely worth a try if you are nearby. I am a calamari nut, so the very name of this place was intriguing as I drove by it on my way to work. I finally trekked over there with a former chef and calamari aficianado. The calamari was quite quite good, absolutely recommended. I had the grilled shrimp and grilled vegetable appetizers and they, too, were above average, and at a great price. The former chef had spaghetti with white clam sauce which he declared ""defensible"" ... The crab cakes were a bit too breaded for my taste, but again, generous portions and not at all greasy.",3.0
"Colin B. wrote, ""Make sure you know what you want by the time you reach the front of the line, or else...""* blush *You mean you order first?  Is that how it works?My boyfriend and I sat at Rocco's for a good fifteen minutes watching other people get served some really amazing food.  Every customer in the place seemed to know every person on the floor staff.  Everyone seemed to know each other's whole family.  Waitresses ignored us.  I didn't realize we were supposed to order at the counter, then wait for the waitresses to bring our order to our table.I got embarrassed knowing I somehow wasn't performing my part of the ritual right, until at last I gave up and we walked out.  I guess the boisterous activity there made me (uncharacteristically) shy.Thus I declare Rocco's a ""cool"" place in the Marshall McLuhan sense (among others); unless you've been here before or someplace similar, maybe you should be prepared to ask how to do it right.I give it five stars since I'm in no position to doubt the other reviewers.We'll try again.",5.0
"Bimini.  Shangri-La. Utopia.  Eden.....Rocco's Calamari.These places might make you think that Rocco's is some mythical place that men, particularly Italian men, might spend their adult lives searching for, and it is. I was perhaps, unwittingly, one of those men.  I passed by Rocco's for years thinking it just another relic from Bayridge's proud Italian past.  Why would I have stopped?  It's located next to a gas station at a busy intersection. There is no parking.  There is nothing from the outside to indicate the genius that is inside.  I had only eaten at Rocco's out of coincidence last year.  Now, I'll sit in traffic on the BQE because it will take me past Rocco's around lunch time.Rocco's is not an Italian Cafeteria as much as it is smorgasbord of Italian seafood (calama') delicacies, pasta creations and salads.  Every dish is offered with a couple of slices of fresh semolina bread for dipping or ""spunz""ing. There are fresh cannolis prepared and espresso served.  There is wait service available in a sort of hybrid buffet/restaurant feel.  Sort of like, pick out what you want and we'll bring it to you.  Rocco's impresses with it's unique presentation, home style service and authentic food.  And like any Italian eatery that is worth it's weight, their is one famous photograph hanging on the wall.  The patron saint of Italian Dining.  Gandolfini.",5.0
"My husband and I were looking for an authentic Brooklyn (old  school) Calimari in medium sauce type of restaurant.  After reading the reviews we journey to Brooklyn where we had both grown up.  Sorry, but we were extremely disappointed.  It seemed like cafeteria or frozen food quality!  The waitress was nice, but that doesn't make up for subquality food that is mostly previously prepared (cafeteria style).",1.0
"i really like this place, its quick and pretty food for take out (you can eat in as well)prices are not to bad, for two it can run you some place in the $40-50 range. appetizers are pretty good.i really like their calamari in the spicy marinara sauce as well as their chicken caesar salad. i highly recommend those, but almost everything on their menu is very good, i havent had any bad experiences really.the only bad thing i can say is, they close pretty early - they start packing up at 7 and close at 8 and they dont open sunday or monday.",4.0
"The calamari lived up to its name.  I crave for it once in awhile and my parents who don't like fried food, asks me to get it sometimes. I also got the eggplant parm hero, which was alright, it was nothing special to me.  But the  calamari really is a must try for here.",3.0

I was a bit disappointed; the calamari itself was good but the sauce was uninspiring. I am a big calamari fan and this place  is no Vincents.,3.0
