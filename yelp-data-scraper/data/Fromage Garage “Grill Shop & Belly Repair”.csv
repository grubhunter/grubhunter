"FROMAGE GROBAGE!!!  Great Idea and creativity, poor execution and service!This review is based solely on the service or extreme lack of service three weeks ago on a beautiful and warm Saturday afternoon.  Hope things turn around and adjustments are made. It was the worst experience I have ever had in terms of service.Upon arriving I approached the bar and asked if we were to order at the counter and then sit or if we should sit and wait for someone to take our order.  We were instructed to take a seat and someone would be right with us (from the actual server, the only employee besides owner/chef).  The place being 3/4 full, we sat down and were given menus about 5 minutes later.  About ten minutes from sitting down, people continued on coming in as we shifted down for a family of four so they could have seats. Around the same time another family seated to the right of us sat down as well (table not cleared yet from the previous diners).  Meanwhile 15 minutes later and still no service (drinks or food) a couple comes into the business and are immediately greeted by the chef/owner and fellow gear head.  They are immediately sat down, the server comes over and gives them drinks and takes their food order.  This is where the real nonsense begins.  The server walks by and and speaks out loud ""Ok you guys and then you and then you"" stating the order and what tables she still needs to get to. She comes back shortly after and takes the families order right next to us aka the same family who we had moved over for probably 15-min earlier.  I will hold back from explaining what a piece of sh*t he was for not even saying thank you for moving over for his entire family or telling the waiter that we were next in line to order.  Also, the table next to us where the other family was sitting still hadn't even been cleaned and the daughter was playing with the empty water bottle from the previous diners.  Thank god there wasn't leftover tots smeared all over the table.  Or maybe there was and I just didn't notice.We then asked the waiter if we could finally place our order and she said she would be right back which we patiently waited for another 5 minutes and maybe gave her an additional 5 courtesy minutes. This being now we past my patience threshold.  I lasted way longer than i thought.So after about 35-40 minutes of waiting we were never able to order food nor drinks and we watched the chefs friend pay the bill and we walked out of the restaurant in disbelief. RECOMMENDATIONS:1) Maybe direct people to order food first and then take their seats for the food to be served to them (at this time they can also order a drink to sip on while they wait).2) Maybe hire an additional employee especially being at lunch time on a Saturday in Williamsburg serving what appears to look like a pretty decent menu.",1.0
"Wandered in and fell in love. Eddie has out s lot of love and thought in every detail of this place. I had great fun looking at all the clever, practical uses of garage gear while waited for my food. My gazpacho was creamy and perfect and my fundito and toasts were over the top. Served with a smile and genuine sense of caring. I'm telling you, I cannot wait to go back!",5.0
"Cheese and an auto shop themed concept? I don't know much about cars but I do know  my cheese and Fromage Garage, despite some customer service issues has a formula (one) for success.Situated near the BQE, Fromage Garage goes full speed with the garage concept in Williamsburg. The menu is fun with all the names such as routine maintenance (make your own sandwich), custom builds (house-made sandwiches), fuel (drinks), and sweet rides (dessert). It's really cool especially if you're a gear head.The food is delicious. I ordered the Timing BeLT which had chive buttah, kale, chipotle mayo, and bacon and it comes with a taste of the tomato soup. The soup has a balanced acidity and sweetness coming from the tomatoes and works really well with any of the sandwiches. Next time I visit, I'll get a larger size. Despite my recommendation food wise, the service was a major issue and hence the three stars. I know they're fairly new but I waited 10 minutes to finally order and another 20 minutes to receive it. That's 30 minutes of waiting for a sandwich. I could've walked out but I didn't. Eddy, the owner, was the only one working which is the main reason it took so long. Unfortunately, I can't let Fromage Garage slide for that. Still a cool concept and hopefully next time the staffing  issue is resolved. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",3.0
Just had a quick brunch here with my husband as we hunt for apartments nearby and it was perfect. They've got a great selection of fancy grilled cheeses/melt sandwiches plus brunch and make your own sandwiches. Plus they refilled our coffee liberally which is always a bonus. The decor follows the garage theme nicely and the service was great. We'll be back,5.0
Awesome place to go and relax and enjoy your favorite grilled cheese. The ambiance is fun being in a garage setting with none of the grime. The owner/chef loves being with the customers and will explain anything you want.,5.0
"Unique, delicious and served with passion. Great little spot (with the coolest bathroom sink in NYC!!) for some comfort food and good conversation.  Went in w my kids and had a variety of sandwiches. Kids and I all loved it. All were crispy and cheesy and sublime. Served w a little taste of soup to bring back memories of childhood. Eddie, the owner, is energetic and passionate, qualities I admire and keep me coming back to a restaurant. If you're looking for fun and simple comfort food, served and executed with passion, Fromage Garage is it.",4.0

"Great new place on Metropolitan! They bake bread in house, make the pork in house (pork is awesome, get it on the side), and everything is just delicious. Bonus points for auto garage-themed menu names!",5.0
"Really enjoyed my time here. My server was a young lady with "" pineapple hair"" as she explained it. She was very cool and attentive. We had a full length convo and service was never lacking. I had the exhaust sandwich and had a bite of the bf Timing Belt. Both sandwiches were really good and you can see them being put together. Def a great after drinks meal , I can see myself coming here again",5.0
"Just tried this new place in town. We loved the place, decor and the very friendly people. They took good care of our 18 months old baby, making her taste her first grilled cheese! We'll come back!",5.0
This neat place met and exceeded my expectations! I am so glad I stumbled into this spot- the decor is so cute and in general what a genius theme!! I ordered the soup of the day which was tomato and the BELT. My mom had the Mechanico ! I pride myself on being a grilled cheese afficianado and this place brought me to my knees! You can definitely tell all the ingredients are fresh and the bread was perfectly toasted!  Gah! I'm totally coming back and you should too!,5.0
"Hallelujah!!!  There is a fromage heaven in Brooklyn. 10 STARS.  5 is not enough for this gem. Let me start with a few weeks ago I tried Cheese Grill on Allen Street because I was craving a grill cheese and wanted the best. I searched yelp and they had the best reviews. I was so pumped to have the best and then so let down that I lost that craving due to bad service and a overpriced grill cheese lacking everything. Over weekend that craving returned again.  I searched yelp again. Read reviews from Fromage garage. It was a new place and slaying the reviews. So off I went thinking here we go again praying it wouldn't be another let down.First thing. I walk into smiles from the customers and staff and the owner is talking to me like a long lost friend while engaging with the other customers in perfect harmony with cool music that has my head bobbing with a smile like everyone else. Before I can even ask about a sandwich the waitress and owner sincerely want to know what I really like or not like on my cheeser as they called it. So many choices and combinations but they were so inviting like family I went with what they suggested for me. It was there concept of a BLT grill cheese hybrid (The timing belt) THEE best reinvented cheezy BLT on earth!!! Tomato soup so legit and out of this world fantastic!!  Now I'm just in aaww  The in house baked bread just knocked me off my feet. The love and passion you taste and feel in your soul with every bite and just had me melting in my seat. The ever so kind and friendly waitress suggested I try the grease monkey dessert and my knees buckled thought I was having a orgasm lol.  Just try it and you'll see for yourself. The bathroom has the coolest sink ive ever seen to match the mechanic shop theme while maintaining a clean fresh appearance and smell. The windshield sneeze guard everything tying together and everything is just perfect. The sandwich, the tomato soup,the dessert, the staff, the cleanliness, the vibe and I then I realize I found a lil heaven in Brooklyn. Do yourself a favor and let this place warm your heart as it did mine. The word is out The Fromage Garage is serving up heart and soul perfectly",5.0
"Great atmosphere with awesome food! The garage theme is a really cool idea (note the sink in the bathroom!). We got the Smokey and El Bandido for an appetizer and it was original and delicious. Made our own grilled cheeses which were great and the chickpea spinach dipping sauce was a pleasant addition. Ended with the Tres Grease Monkeys for dessert, it was sweet and creamy. I rarely order dessert and I'm happy I did. The owner was super friendly too! Note: Beer and wine license is coming soon.",5.0

Finally went in to Fromage Garage today. I was craving a grilled cheese and finally decided to try it. Lot of different options from make your own to their own. And everything was super fresh and tummy. Great prices and the owner and the server who was working were super friendly. Glad I found my neighborhood grilled cheese spot!,5.0
"If you're overwhelmed by the cheese/bread/flavored butter combinations, take a breath. You just can't go wrong here.  Eddie, the enthusiastic owner, reassured me and I allowed myself to go outside the box and was rewarded tenfold.

"The grilled cheeses here aren't super greasy which is a plus. But the smell of new rubber tires is so overwhelming that it affects the taste of what you're eating. Also, if ever you see a brunch special of eggs and home fries for $9, don't get this. The fries are pre-made (maybe frozen Ore Ida brand?) and the serving of the omelette is too small for it to be $9. Instead, stick with the grilled cheese. Also the potato kale soup is legit - you get a taste of it with your grilled cheese. The taste made me wish I had ordered a whole serving of soup!",3.0

He took the time out to really talk to the few people in the place, hear what they liked and didn't and gave a little back story to the idea behind the look and the recipes.
