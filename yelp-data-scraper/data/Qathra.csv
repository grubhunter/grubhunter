"No laptop on weekends. Good or bad, I guess sole will love it, some waist like it that much. Hipsters coffee shop, with back patio which is the best on the right season. Decent food, maybe little over priced. Cute place, I will eat here more, but one on week days. I need my wifi...",4.0
"I hate you, then I love you. Then I love you, then I hate you. This is how I feel about Qathra. Celine always knows how to sum it up in a song, ay.Qathra is this cute little hipster spot on Cortelyou and it fits right in with the attitude and vibe of the neighborhood. My first hate is because it's cash only. (It makes me rage... )I have a love hate relationship with the food. Some dishes are truly sexy, comforting and hearty while others are super meh, bland and you know, nothing to write home about. Like this morning, my Mediterranean eggs with Zaatar were delicious but my friends egg dish had frozen portobello mushrooms. (As if they forgot to defrost it and just dumped it on the plate) who does that?They do have outdoor seating which is awesome when the weather is nice. And the price to portion ratio is perfect. So yes Qathra. I hate you, then I love you. Then I love you, then I hate you.",3.0

"Came here w my gf and son for brunch. Had to get my own menus, cutlery, etc. No waitstaff. No drinks. Not even a glass of water. Not so welcoming either. If I wanted to do it myself, I would have stayed home.",1.0
"Love the food and coffee! Very warm and caring staff, my praises to the barista. Love the Mediterranean  omelette and the banana bread. Note that you order at the counter, but the food will be brought to your table. There is a nice outside sitting area. Will definitely return for more!",4.0
"I came here recently wanting to check out some spots on coutelyou road - it's suppose to be a hot spot now.  I came here cause they offer lattes which is my fav drink.  I walked in and saw non-hipsters inside.  Okay we are off to a good start, tired of seeing hipster coffee shops.  I ordered at counter and got food.  The counter to sit down ratio is weird but I get it cause slot of coffee shops that sell food have an Awkward set up. I ordered Egyptian poached eggs and latte.  The poached eggs were good but I hated the arugula.  Plus not sure how authentic this is because my Egyptian friends never heard of it.  I digress as the eggs were good, after taking off the arugula it came together better.  Bread was soggy though. Latte was solid though.  I would come back for another latte.Update - 3/20/16 - I just recently came back and the service is way better, music is from the 90s - love the music and the food is off the hook good.  I really love that they don't sell pork products, from a Muslim prospective that's A+.  I'm definitely coming back more often.",5.0
"LOVE THIS PLACE!  The food is absolutely delicious. And the service is fast. Not to mention the prices are super reasonable. This is my go to place before work and I haven't been disappointed yet! I recommended the Qathra breakfast ! Comes with hummus, scrambled eggs, quinoa and warm pita bread! They serve breakfast all day !",5.0
"A nice spot for breakfast! My latte was the perfect temperature. Hot but still drinkable!The asked salmon bagel was tall and hard to keep together when eating. There was also way too much red onion, but overall it was good. The egg sandwich was simple and did it's job.The servers were overall friendly and there is a good amount of seating. There were plenty of seats when we were there.",4.0
"Inexplicable ""no laptop policy"" on weekends .... Only cold water in the bathroom to wash your hands (I prefer if at least the employees would properly wash their hands)....

"I live and work in the neighborhood (that means - i was born in this neighborhood and have lived here my entire life).--------------------------------------I've ordered a Chai latte here twice.

Both visits I was completely IGNORED by the people working here, even though I was the only person standing by the register... maybe Qathra jumps to serve ""hipsters"" or those who seem pretentious/snooty/hip/trendy/whatever..------------------------------------------------------------If i really want chai, I'll wait to go to my grandma's house for REAL CHAI.

"I like the ambiance at Qathra and especially the back patio when the weather is nice. Service has generally been fine and seating not a problem before 10:30 or so. They now take cards so that is also a bonus. It's cozy and the decor is unpretentious, a little dark but I like that. A couple ""heads up"": if you're sensitive to air quality, this is not the place to go since the kitchen is open and the space is small. So on cold days when the doors are closed it can be stuffy and smelly. Also, the Eggs Benedict is not great - dry English muffins, drizzle of hollandaise (if that's what it is?) and everything else a little overcooked, including asparagus. Haven't sampled a wide variety of their food so not sure how standard this quality is, but at New York coffee shop prices, I thought I should issue the warning!  It's all good for a coffee and laid back surroundings, tho.",3.0

Having to use a non bank ATM is not always fun. The deco makes this a must visit eatery all the same :-) FYI there is an outdoor space be sure to visit when the weather is pleasant.,4.0
Simply...wow! I had the chipotle omelette and french toast. My cousin had the eggs benedict...that came with mushrooms which were absolutely delicious.  I really loved my chai latter. Qathra is my new spot. Remember - cash only.,5.0
I walked past this place for over a year before going in. From the outside it's not very inviting but thankfully I stopped judging a cafe by its signage. Great place. Tasty coffee and food. The staff is super warm and the garden is oh so lovely!,5.0
"I like the ambiance at Qathra and especially the back patio when the weather is nice. Service has generally been fine and seating not a problem before 10:30 or so. They now take cards so that is also a bonus. It's cozy and the decor is unpretentious, a little dark but I like that. A couple ""heads up"": if you're sensitive to air quality, this is not the place to go since the kitchen is open and the space is small. So on cold days when the doors are closed it can be stuffy and smelly. Also, the Eggs Benedict is not great - dry English muffins, drizzle of hollandaise (if that's what it is?) and everything else a little overcooked, including asparagus. Haven't sampled a wide variety of their food so not sure how standard this quality is, but at New York coffee shop prices, I thought I should issue the warning!  It's all good for a coffee and laid back surroundings, tho.",3.0

"I would've given more stars but... I got brunch, just me, wanted to read my book and eat some eggs Benedict, drink some coffee, which did happen and did taste good. My contention is in the coffee prices.... Ok I get that you don't want me to sit here all day getting free refills, but when I just spent $13 on brunch, don't charge me an extra $2 for a refill of coffee. That's not necessary. And don't be a dick when I suggest maybe it should be only $1 as a courtesy to customers who aren't there to just drink coffee and use wifi. Or free, like almost anywhere else in brooklyn that you might have brunch... Whatever qathra. You gotta lose the attitude.

"I love coming here in the mornings with my friends as we can sit, chat and drink coffee for as long as we want. The baristas are friendly. I enjoy the ambiance as it's kind of dark and chill. That being said:The almond croissant is amazing! Extremely soft, just the right amount of almond flavor and sweetness, flaky and buttery without being greasy. The breakfast sandwich on a croissant with avocado- equally delicious. Eggs fluffy with fresh lettuce, no complaints here. The hot chocolate & coffee: *sigh* WAY over priced. The first time I ever went to Qathra I ordered hot chocolate. They told me it was only one size and cost $3. Mind you I can get a large one at Connecticut Muffin down the block for 50 cents less though it's not as good. The next day I went and ordered the same thing and it was $4.50. WTF?!?!? Do they have little Dwarves like Keebler elves or something milking cows in the back? Do they fly fresh cocoa beans daily from Ghana and the Gold Coast  and process them on site?  And to add insult to injury, they only give you one size- the small to go cup or the small mug. It's good but definitely NOT worth the price. I'd be more willing to pay that if it were a large sized cup. I asked for a large caramel mocha coffee and all I got was the small cup as well. So now when I go with my friends, I just bring my coffee from home. If I want something fancy, I'll stick to Starbucks.",3.0

"What a cute little cafe in the middle of Brooklyn! I love it here--the coffee, the food, the music. The only thing I didn't like was how cramped it was; the tables were practically side by side. But I guess there is less space during the wintertime since the outdoor seating is closed off. I feel like this would be an awesome place to chill at during the summertime. The outdoor seating actually looked very nice--too bad everything was covered in snow.I REALLY loved the mocha--it was a good amount of sweet, but not overly sweet. Apparently this place uses Mast Brothers chocolate in all their chocolate drinks and pastries. I was not a fan of the hot chocolate, though. It actually tasted a bit dilute to me. I'd def prefer having some coffee taste mixed in with it. I really need to stop getting hot chocolate at cafes, I'm always disappointed...I know now that you should really get hot chocolate from actual chocolate places, not coffee places. Anyway, get the mocha!As for food, I really like that this place has so many healthy options. I got the Qathra wrap, which isn't on their menu. It's a wrap with feta cheese, spinach, eggs, mushroom (and maybe turkey sausage? wasn't sure...). It was pretty good, but I would have preferred if they used more feta cheese... there were literally like two bites with feta cheese in them. The hummus platter was also pretty great.Would definitely come back here to do work or just to hang out with a friend or two. FYI, this is a work-friendly environment.

"overall, it's not bad. I cannot rate it more than that. I've been here 3 times in the weekend I spent in Brooklyn as it was close, good coffee. In my 3 visits, the counter service varied from extremely friendly and helpful, to the guy who waited on me Monday morning who seemed to be quite upset that I was disturbing him when I ordered a cup of coffee. The food is good and fresh, the coffee is fine. Not having refills is truly a slap in the face to customers and sends a message that we don't really want you hanging around here. Overall, my expectations were pretty high based on the ratings but over all it was just OK. I did come back 3 times, so it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.",3.0

"Although this place is no where near a subway stop and out in the middle of Flatbush, tucked in between a shop and diner, it's the perfect place to spend your Saturday afternoon.

Soak in the ambiance of chandeliers and brick walls, as patrons seem to be deep in work on their laptops or intense conversation. It's the perfect spot to enjoy a freshly pressed cafe and pastries.

"For me, aura is almost always a necessary aspect that needs to be fulfilled. It all could have been my mood that day, but the first time I walked in and spent an evening there I became very placidly submerged into my novel. It's a cafe, and if it has the right aura to let me sink into my bibliophile state uninterrupted, it's a good place.  I don't know their coffees thoroughly, but they have strong teas, and the sticky buns have stuck to me! I look for those pecan clustered pastries every time I walk in. I only get the coffee of the day  ($2.50) so that I won't have to spend $4 on a cup. Coffee is approximately same to Starbuck's prices. I don't really like brownies or chocolate chip cookies, so those I don't pick up.Also, in the back there is this little backyard space with a water fountain-specimen. One thing that irks me is that it is one of those ""open-doored"" coffee shops, which in the summer and late spring is wonderfully scenic and atmospheric, but not very rapturous in the fall and upcoming winter.

Without fail, my latte is always delicious and has a nice little heart or leaf on it - I appreciate the extra touch. When I get the coffee that's usually pretty good too. No complaints about the food either. Sometimes I get the wrap, usually I get the croissant with avocado, cheese, spinach, egg and in the past, I got the croque monsieur. It's always good and brought out within 5-10 minutes depending on how busy they are. While the food is good what I like more about it is that it's not your typical coffee shop menu. They have some pastries but their menu has a slightly more Mediterranean-y vibe. I go there enough that I know the staff and I appreciate that they know their customers' names, orders and take time to talk to them. I'm never in a rush when I go there so being in a line a little longer because the staff is exchanging pleasantries does not bother me in the least. While some may be bothered by the kids running around or some of the younger patrons, I actually appreciate being in a place that has a diverse group of customers. I can't quite pin the demographic that goes here, age wise probably late 20s-30s.My only ""complaint"" about Qathra is the fact that they don't accept credit cards. It's a pretty hip coffee shop with its own vibe and upon walking in, you know that coffee and grub are going to cost a little bit more than the CT Muffin next door. So, I don't understand why in this day and age they don't accept debit/credit. Previous reviewers are right in saying that your bill can easily add up to $20 and if you're going out with a group of people or your family for a morning brunch, I'm sure that number gets higher very quickly. That is the only advice I would give the owner... Oh, and the sanitation grade pending! Worries me slightly but I love the shop so much I'm willing to be forgiving. Aside from that, well done!

Way to open up a coffee shop with a unique, welcoming, palatable vibe. Qathra is a worthy competitor in a city that is oh so pretentious about its coffee culture. I urge everyone in Ditmas Park to check it out.",4.0
"I've been coming to this place for breakfast for a while now on weekends.  Everything is delicious, I usually get one of the croissants, expresso and fresh OJ.Qathra is especially delightful in the Spring and Fall, when you can sit out in the garden.  The staff is very friendly, courteousm welcoming and helpful.  The place is well laid out, comfortable and there is a good atmosphere.The one negative point I would bring up is that it seems expensive for what it is.  But again, you do get good food in nice place.",4.0
"This little cafe used to be so amazing! My wife and I used to come here almost everyday for breakfast. Now, every time we go, it degrades itself more and more. Their constantly rotating staff is bad enough but each week the menu gets smaller and smaller. And god forbid you accidentally ask for one of the old menu items, because the manager will snap at you with ""you can only order from THIS menu"".  The coffee here is just so so, but it's way over priced.",2.0
"This Brooklyn establishment is not a diamond in the rough. It's more like a piece of coal that is nowhere near diamond standard. I knew something was up when I read all the glowing reviews and saw the pics that looked to be profesionally done. My egg and turkey bacon sandwich looked nothing like the one in the pic. Guess Quathra took a lesson from the ad wizards at McDonald's. When you walk into the place it looks like a quaint, cozy, polished coffeehouse much like a Starbucks. Sadly, a Starbucks would offer better quality. There were rave reviews over the hot chocolate but it tasted like nothing more than heated water with Nestle Quik powder. My friend ordered a coffee and was annoyed that it only came in one size. The worker behind the counter that barely spoke English said that he could not make a large. Something to do with the amount of water used versus the coffee. Either way, it was a poor excuse. How do you not offer more than one size??It seems that a place like this gets good reviews because it is in an area where there isn't much of anything around to compete, aside from a bodega. I'm sure the locals think it's good but stay away.",2.0
Love this place. The ambience is warm and cozy. It's not a loud place. Dimmed lights and peaceful with a beautiful backyard for summer days. WIFI a plus. The tea is delish. A place I go by myself to reflect on things and enjoy my favorite Iced Jasmine Tea.,5.0
"The barista told me he applies specific way in various beans to make coffee, such as cold brew, drip, pour over, chemex etc. So in this shop, I'm not allowed to have my coffee be customized. 15 miles away from my place to this shop, it didn't fail me!

Qathra stepped up and did things right where Vox Pop failed.

"This was my go-to spot for good coffee, chill atmosphere, yummy brunch.  I'm giving it  low rating because of the new no-laptop policy on weekends. I go there to study on both week nights and weekends, always with my ipad and sometimes with a notepad to take notes. I guess I am dismayed because one of the baristas came over to tell me the policy after I had been sitting there for over an hour. And I was just about to order another drink and pastry. I understand the need for this policy to 1) promote less digital environment and 2) have enough seats for those who want to dine in. I get it, I really do, and I respect the intentions. But when I got up to take my leave I glanced around and saw others using tablets pretty freely. Furthermore  more than half the tables were empty so it was not a question of people waiting for a table. I guess all I am looking for is some clarification to the policy..is it zero laptops AND iPads? What about ipad minis?? Is it no studying without ordering another item for more than an hour? Perhaps it should be in effect only during peak brunch hours? I know this review may upset some folks since this is a great neighborhood amenity...I'll happily increase the rating to what it deserves after they clarify the policy.",2.0
"Nice spot, wish I could give it more stars BUT the customer service I received when I went there twice turned me off soo bad. I would always come at a time when it's this mexican man working there. He is very rude, lacks manners & had the nerve to blame me for not paying 50 cents when I gave him the exact amount. I had the exact amount ready & I passed it to him & he started putting in the money without even counting first & then asked me what happened to the rest of the money. Um, maybe you should pay attention to your customers better. Then I ordered a drink and I took one sip & really didn't like it so I asked if I could please change my beverage and he goes ""You're the first person to say you don't like this drink and you already drank it, I can't."" um wow.. Then I asked for iced late and asked him to make it light on the ice, and he started telling me he has to put the regular amount because it'd be ""too much water melting""....common sense would be that the more ice, the more water. Besides, if I personally asked you to make it a certain way, you shouldn't be arguing with a customer. Overall he was very rude and gave me a nasty look and had nooo hospitality skills whatsoever. But today I was there and for the first time saw different workers and it was very nice.",3.0

I am honestly disappointed and hope that they can get their act together because it used to be a great spot.",2.0
"Quirky decor and nice atmosphere. Could stay there for hours drinking their top-notch, creamy, delicious hot chai lattes. Breakfast food is also really good and reasonably priced.

"Wow, this little coffee shop totally surprised me.  The wife and I had just finished a President's Day brunch at Farm on Adderley when we were intrigued by the sign for Qathra a few doors down.  We went in only to find the most comforting coffee shop which was busy yet still really relaxing.  While we had intended to get an americano to go, the atmosphere made us want to stay.  We could instantly tell they took their coffee seriously by both the impressive equipment  and thorough descriptions they had of the blends they were serving.  When we saw they had pour over coffees we decided to go for that over the americano.  It was a wise choice as the coffee came out perfectly.  I had never been that impressed with Counter Culture coffee before, but having it here made me realize the other places I had had it just didn't prepare it properly. My coffee surpassed anything I have ever had from Blue Bottle or the incredibly overrated Stumptown coffee.To top off the excellent coffee the two guys behind the counter were super nice and eager to answer questions about the different coffee options (with no attitude).  It took me back to when there used to be lots of independent coffee shops who approached coffee making as an art form.  The steady stream of people coming in (who were clearly regulars) made me realize that this is a special place.  It's just nice to have both a positive experience and excellent cup of coffee at the same time. I just wish they would open a shop in Carroll Gardens (instead we are stuck with places like Canteen with obnoxious arrogant unfriendly staff)!",5.0
"Exactly Three (3) Starsz.The pastries are pretty hard-core in that super-utilitarian, ""this scone will crumble into a million pieces because that's the way it should be"" way.The food menu seems a bit prone to fancy-hyperbole: the lack of finish in the preparation/presentation leaves a bit to be desired given the prices.The service is a bit spotty.  They seem prone to employing very chatty and high-strung locals prone to hangovers who wish to share their passion for out-jazz (e.g.) at slightly inappropriate AM-hour volumes.  (I love late-era Coltrane as much as anybody, but, you know...)The coffee seems perfectly fine to me, though I wish they had been more confident in their attempt to satisfy my desire for a ""flat white"" following my return from a trip to Australia (where I was assured that the worst coffee is comparable to the best in the US).  That is to say, I wish they would have said ""Sorry, we can't guarantee it'll come out well"" rather than trying to fake it.",3.0

I understand the need for this policy to 1) promote less digital environment and 2) have enough seats for those who want to dine in. I get it, I really do, and I respect the intentions. But when I got up to take my leave I glanced around and saw others using tablets pretty freely. Furthermore  more than half the tables were empty so it was not a question of people waiting for a table. I guess all I am looking for is some clarification to the policy..is it zero laptops AND iPads? What about ipad minis?? Is it no studying without ordering another item for more than an hour? Perhaps it should be in effect only during peak brunch hours? I know this review may upset some folks since this is a great neighborhood amenity...I'll happily increase the rating to what it deserves after they clarify the policy.",2.0
"Nice spot, wish I could give it more stars BUT the customer service I received when I went there twice turned me off soo bad. I would always come at a time when it's this mexican man working there. He is very rude, lacks manners & had the nerve to blame me for not paying 50 cents when I gave him the exact amount. I had the exact amount ready & I passed it to him & he started putting in the money without even counting first & then asked me what happened to the rest of the money. Um, maybe you should pay attention to your customers better. Then I ordered a drink and I took one sip & really didn't like it so I asked if I could please change my beverage and he goes ""You're the first person to say you don't like this drink and you already drank it, I can't."" um wow.. Then I asked for iced late and asked him to make it light on the ice, and he started telling me he has to put the regular amount because it'd be ""too much water melting""....common sense would be that the more ice, the more water. Besides, if I personally asked you to make it a certain way, you shouldn't be arguing with a customer. Overall he was very rude and gave me a nasty look and had nooo hospitality skills whatsoever. But today I was there and for the first time saw different workers and it was very nice.",3.0
Great place for coffee and an early morning bite. Staff are friendly and super attentive. The service is fast. My coffee and morning snack were do delicious! The  watermelon mint juice really wakes up your taste buds! Overall a wonderful experience! I can't wait to go back.,5.0
Hands down the best deal on Cortelyou. The brunch is as good as The Farm's at only a fraction of the cost. Love the egyptian eggs.,5.0
"Last time I reviewed this place I gave it  4 stars. A lot has changed since then. First of all, grade pending! They probably didn't pass their health inspection, which is not surprising because fruit flies were everywhere. Also, the food is not as good as it used to be despite the price increase. I am honestly disappointed and hope that they can get their act together because it used to be a great spot.",2.0
"Quirky decor and nice atmosphere. Could stay there for hours drinking their top-notch, creamy, delicious hot chai lattes. Breakfast food is also really good and reasonably priced. Scones are just right: light, flaky, sugar on top, not dense or heavy. Back garden space is nice as well. I go there on my own or to meet up with friends. Love it.",5.0
"Wow, this little coffee shop totally surprised me.  The wife and I had just finished a President's Day brunch at Farm on Adderley when we were intrigued by the sign for Qathra a few doors down.  We went in only to find the most comforting coffee shop which was busy yet still really relaxing.  While we had intended to get an americano to go, the atmosphere made us want to stay.  We could instantly tell they took their coffee seriously by both the impressive equipment  and thorough descriptions they had of the blends they were serving.  When we saw they had pour over coffees we decided to go for that over the americano.  It was a wise choice as the coffee came out perfectly.  I had never been that impressed with Counter Culture coffee before, but having it here made me realize the other places I had had it just didn't prepare it properly. My coffee surpassed anything I have ever had from Blue Bottle or the incredibly overrated Stumptown coffee.To top off the excellent coffee the two guys behind the counter were super nice and eager to answer questions about the different coffee options (with no attitude).  It took me back to when there used to be lots of independent coffee shops who approached coffee making as an art form.  The steady stream of people coming in (who were clearly regulars) made me realize that this is a special place.  It's just nice to have both a positive experience and excellent cup of coffee at the same time. I just wish they would open a shop in Carroll Gardens (instead we are stuck with places like Canteen with obnoxious arrogant unfriendly staff)!",5.0
"Exactly Three (3) Starsz.The pastries are pretty hard-core in that super-utilitarian, ""this scone will crumble into a million pieces because that's the way it should be"" way.The food menu seems a bit prone to fancy-hyperbole: the lack of finish in the preparation/presentation leaves a bit to be desired given the prices.The service is a bit spotty.  They seem prone to employing very chatty and high-strung locals prone to hangovers who wish to share their passion for out-jazz (e.g.) at slightly inappropriate AM-hour volumes.  (I love late-era Coltrane as much as anybody, but, you know...)The coffee seems perfectly fine to me, though I wish they had been more confident in their attempt to satisfy my desire for a ""flat white"" following my return from a trip to Australia (where I was assured that the worst coffee is comparable to the best in the US).  That is to say, I wish they would have said ""Sorry, we can't guarantee it'll come out well"" rather than trying to fake it.",3.0

I think they're testing out for the new larger place they're opening on Newkirk (YAY), but they shouldn't mess with a winning formula.  I wish instead of expanding the menu into hot food they would carry a larger selection of scones and baked treats.",4.0
"Great place to people watch! It has a european feel to it with the wide doors in the front they keep open. Great diverse mix of music.

"Typically, a coffee shop will hit the mark on a couple fronts, but miss it on others. Now, this is obviously a matter of personal preference, but I look for a few things in my ideal coffee shop. Obviously the coffee has to be good. If the drip coffee is amazing but the espresso drinks aren't, I can let that pass. If the espresso drinks are good but the drip coffee is weak, that's not going to fly. The food is important too, but frankly I am not generally as concerned with this. If the food is too good at my local coffee shop, I tend to make a habit of spoiling my dinner there.Next, the atmosphere is key. Low-key but lively. Not as rare as it sounds. If there's music, it should be good, but not intrusive. Indie stuff is fine as long as it's not too experimental. Folk. Extra points for bluegrass. Playing Postal Service too much automatically loses you a star. Good design aesthetics, decor choices, light, and layout. Pretty standard elements of a good habitable space. The people matter here too. Good baristas make for a good coffee shop. Good baristas are good at what they do, but they're also friendly. Those who can DJ are a real plus (see the part on music).Finally, there are what I like to call the freelancer's fundamentals. Lately there has been a trend toward coffee bars that don't allow laptops and have limited seating in order to encourage a more free-spirited exchange of ideas (and perhaps faster customer turnover). I like this trend, but I still rely on the coffee shop as a workspace. I am a student, not a freelancer, but it's still important. I recognize that some coffee shops aren't meant for working, but if a coffee shop makes a pretense of providing the customer with workspace, it should be done properly. Good tables, comfortable chairs, free wi-fi, outlets to spare. --------------------------------------Qathra reaches a pretty high level on all three scales. They do provide workspace, but banish laptops on the weekends. This is a great compromise, encouraging a more communal, vibrant environment on Sat and Sun, while allowing for coffee-charged students, hipsiters, designers, writers, and the like to wage their daily struggle to get by on friendly turf.The atmosphere pleasant. The exposed brick is a nice warehouse-chic touch, while the large windows at the front and back let in light (maybe sometimes too much of it). I haven't been here in the warm weather, but the garden out back looks incredible. Finally, there's the coffee at Qathra. High marks on this, with one complaint. No pour-over coffee. This is the new standard by which a coffee shop will get 5 stars in my book. It's more common out west, and I understand the east coast is catching up on the coffee front. Still, coffee was meant to be made by hand-pouring the water over the grounds, and no machine can come close. Qathra does do a pretty good job of trying though--their drop coffee is solid. Qathra also gets high marks for their teas, particularly the ginger chai. I have ordered mine dirty because I am a caffeine addict. I haven't had much of the food, except for a scone.

It was one of those moments that helps to define that you're going to love a place, I also mentioned that to the barista behind the counter and he said ""cheers"" (South African? Kiwi? Or Aussie?

It is so common to go to places in *cough Williamsburg* and be handed a scolding hot latte, one that you can't drink immediately and if you do you can't taste it anyway. Qathra sends a clear message just by serving you sipping temperature coffee: ""we've got nothing to hide, taste the coffee"". So I didn't add any sugar and took my sip.

"Nice atmosphere in here. Problem is, for a coffee shop they don't seem to know how to make coffee. General tip -- when you want to assess a new place, always order the espresso. There's nothing they can do to hide, and a good espresso will knock your socks off. If the espresso is good, so is all of their coffee.Here, the espresso was burnt so that I could hardly drink it. Usually I shrug these things off and walk away, but this was bad enough that I had to return it. When I explained the problem, the man behind the counter didn't seem to understand what I was telling him. I must have said it three or four times: the coffee is burnt. When he went back to the machine, he was visibly confused.I got my replacement, and it was burnt just as badly. It was like liquid charcoal. So. It's a pretty place. Nice patio out back. But it's a coffee shop that can't make a basic coffee.",2.0
"The ambiance is phenomenal, with antiques and an eclectic decor that makes you feel at home, while providing conversation pieces.

So friendly and a nice atmosphere. In the summer, the garden is wonderful.I do sometimes wish this and other neighborhood coffee places would put in place internet-free hours, say over lunch, so that you could socialize there and not just be surrounded by laptop worker bees (there are so many people working at any given bkln coffeehouse that I sometimes feel I'm in a library..)",5.0

"Excellent coffee, love the cold brew system for it's lower-acid coffee.  Good selection of noncaffinated iced teas, and the breakfasts are always good.  There's a new girl who works there who always seem to have an attitude.  Avoid her and you'll have a pleasant time.",4.0
"Coffee is great. Baristas very friendly. Garden and ambience is amazing. Haven't tried the food yet.EDIT: Have now had the food plenty of times. Not bad, but not amazing. The omelettes are slightly on the greasy side but are still pretty good. The bagels are really small (but are also inexpensive) and usually taste a bit like meat -- they clearly use the same knife on no-meat and veggie orders, so vegetarians be aware you'll be getting the aftertaste of the ham bagel that was ordered before yours.But *still*, this place gets 5 stars. So friendly and a nice atmosphere. In the summer, the garden is wonderful.I do sometimes wish this and other neighborhood coffee places would put in place internet-free hours, say over lunch, so that you could socialize there and not just be surrounded by laptop worker bees (there are so many people working at any given bkln coffeehouse that I sometimes feel I'm in a library..)",5.0

"This is a nice local coffee shop. Not cookie cutter at all. That being said, I don't usually go to it because the food and drinks are better in other nearby spots. For instance, I can get a pot of tea nearby for the same price that they charge me for a cup of tea. Also, the wifi is too weak to work for my computer -- though it seems to work for others. It does have a lovely back garden though, and the inside ambiance is really good.",3.0
"It might be a little lame of me to review a coffee shop given that I don't drink coffee, but they have really fantastic hot chocolate.  Really fantastic.  The tea is also as good as any I've ever had.  It's a nice place to sit and read, sit and wi fi or sit and chat.",5.0
"This is one of the better coffee shops I've found in the city. The coffee is excellent. The baristas are friendly. I've never been on the weekends, but I can imagine it would get crowded. I recently went there on a weekday morning and had a table to myself where I worked for about two hours on my laptop. But other times, when I've gone in the afternoon, I would have felt bad monopolizing premium space with a laptop (and the other reviews suggest this isn't allowed). Can't wait to check out the nice backyard when it warms up a little.",4.0
This is the best coffee on Cortelyou. The staff is friendly and the outdoor space is fantastic. The interior is really nice and comfortable and they have wifi. Highly recommended!,5.0
"I LOVE Qathra! The staff is excellent and the owner is always there, very dedicated to his amazing coffee shop. For those who can't handle caffeine, like me, they make THE BEST decaf cappuccino. Seriously, it's sooo good and that's not even their specialty. Their food is so tasty and simple. Definitely an asset to Courtelyou.",5.0
"This place is super cute. The over all vibe is very inviting and mellow. This so reminds me of little coffee shops in SF. I totally recommend this to folks and visitors in the area. The counter girl could use some work. But I she is still nice. Just needs to smile more :-D. And i didn't see this posted but they dont take cards, but there is a ATM inside.",4.0

"We ate here for breakfast today, and sat outside. The green roof with plants on top was very cool to admire, and the food was excellent and a good value. We will be returning!",5.0
"Qathra is your average friendly neighborhood coffee shop. What makes Qathra stand out from the rest of the coffee shops on Cortelyou is their breakfast manu, which happens to be very good and the backyard where you can still use the wifi without trouble. The staff is friendly and the place doesn't get overrun by strollers, although you will catch one there occasionally. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with Qathra.",5.0
"My turkey bacon, egg and cheese sandwich has been delicious both times i've had it.  The guys that work there are very friendly! Obviously the design of this place is beautiful.  Great addition to the nabe.",5.0

"i've been writing a review of qathra in my head for so long, i know it's gona meander a little bit - please bear with me as i try to get down as many of the little, charming things i love about this place as possible!!this is the coffee house ditmas park has needed so desperately since i've been here (7 years).  (sorry vox pop).  i loved vox pop's atmosphere - the people were all friendly faces and it was great to be able to linger there, outdoors, on summer nights.  it felt like someone's backyard.  but i didn't like the coffee.i'm addicted to lattes, and qathra delivers, complete with latte art (which is not necessary, but fun).  i loved the way they busted open in the neighborhood.  just when you started wondering what that newly painted black storefront was gona be, boom!  they serve great food (i love their sandwiches and always finish up with a scone) at reasonable prices, and everyone who works there is super friendly, efficient and kind.  max (the owner? i think?) goes above and beyond to make things comfortable.  the atmosphere is perfect - i never went to connecticut muffin due to the horrible music and just sort of stale vibe (and stale pastries).  qathra is everything connecticut muffin is not - a real neighborhood place (with really good, consistent coffee and food).  i love sitting outside, or just inside in the little (what i call) writer's nook - the sun shines in through the window on me as i get my little caffeine buzz, and solar, sugar and caffeine fuel my writing - it's a terrific way to spend a few hours before / after work.  or even during - i see many people on laptops working away happily - there's a very happy vibe, and all who work there (as in literally work there, like on the payroll, or those of us who go to work on our work there) all contribute to this.  they keep up the restrooms nicely, and the outdoor space is soooo beautiful - the best.  AND - i have a bit of gossip!  i was talking to one of the baristas and they told me they're going to be opening a SODA FOUNTAIN soon!!!!!  wooo hooo!!!  just in time for summer!  i'll see you guys there xoxo",5.0
"I would give this delightful coffee shop five stars, except for finding the ""no laptops on the weekend"" policy prohibitive. Yes, I know it's probably a good policy for business but if forces all the people who actually need to get work (and studying) done on a Saturday or Sunday into Connecticut Muffin, which is always packed. Anyways, other than that I have nothing but wonderful things to say. The decor is beautiful. The staff is obliging and the food is delicious. If you're a tea drinker they have tons of variety and the coffee and espresso are well-made and great quality. This place is a winner.",4.0
