"Went here for brunch today with my family, there was a wait out the door ofcourse.. But to me that only means how good the food must be. I do not mind waiting for GOOD food! So our wait was 1 hour long but we are a family of 5 so no complaints!! When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server. I ordered the eggs Huntington along with a side order of bacon, hash browns and buttermilk biscuits to share. My 2 daughters both ordered the ABC grilled cheese, which came with a salad our server asked if I'd like to change the side to fries but since my kids are pretty good with salad they said they'd rather that! My husband ordered the pork chop & waffles, and my aunt ordered a egg scramble with roasted mushrooms, spinach and goat cheese. Everybody was completely happy with their meals and I had a bite of the ABC grilled cheese and OMG!!!! It was so full of flavor I loved it! Everything was amazing, definitely will be back!",5.0
"Returned for dinner with three friends and had an epic meal. First, I'd recommend bringing as many people as possible and sharing everything. We had the chicken and waffles, mushroom barley burger, market vegetable bowl, a pasta special with red pepper and pork, flatbread special with ricotta, spinach and mushroom, plus the pecan pie sundae and apple galette for dessert. The chicken is a must - perfectly cooked and served with amazing coleslaw and cheddar waffles - but everything else that I tried was also incredible. The ice cream here is Van Leeuwen (one of my favorite ice cream spots) so we got to enjoy that in our sundae, which paired nicely with our hot apple dessert. Would give this place 6 stars if I could.Note to self: return to try the duck meatloaf and pork chop that everyone's going on about.",5.0
"This place is a bit further from my house than i expected so getting here was definitely a trek but i had heard great things about the food so i expecting the trip to be well worth it. We were a party of 4, i went in gave my name to the hostess she told me it was a 40 minute wait and I'd get a text notification. I think this is a pretty cool system. It was a bit crowded at the door during this time; people were adding their names to the waitlist, trying to enter, trying to leave, looking to see where the hostess was at one point i was standing really close in-between a party of 2 eating at the bar. In about 35 minutes my phone buzzed letting me know our table was ready. I like the ambiance of the place, very homey environment. It was fully packed and the noise level reflected that. The customers were a mixed crowd which i always like, lots of families with their children brunching. Our server was very pleasant, quick (for it to be that busy) and accommodating. We ordered; short rib hash w/ sunny side up eggs (2x), buttermilk pancakes and bacon, fried pork chops and cheddar waffle. The hash (my order) was decent, i had to add some salt and pepper it needed a bit more seasoning but i was satisfied with the portion, presentation and overall taste of the meal. The pancakes (my daughters order) were ok, she did not enjoy them too much which made me have to taste them because ""come on 7 yr old they are pancake!!"" but i was with her on it; they weren't that great. The fried pork chop (my moms order) i only had an amuse bouche taste and it was delicious. When i later asked my mom if she enjoyed her response was ""ehhh, it was food so i ate it!"" She was thrown off by the cheddar waffle. I would maybe go another time to explore the menu more. I was a bit underwhelmed this first time.",3.0
"Yum, really lucky we only had to wait less than 30 minutes for a table for 2 on a saturday in the dead of winter when i hear the wait can be 1 hour to 1.5 hours!they take down your number and text you when the table is ready so that you can explore or chill while you are waiting for your tableone of the best southern brunches i've had, worth the trek out to brooklyn, very close to the F train--fried pork chop with cheddar waffle: loved the light cheddar waffle! the fried pork chop was good too but some parts were too thick so it got a bit dry--SHORT RIB HASH: i heard people complain that it's too fatty but that's what makes it so good!! sure it's a bit salty but with that runny egg and buttery toast on the side, this was so good!NOTE: they also have bar seating",4.0
"Things look better than they taste. We came here for Sunday brunch and end up sitting at the bar with my two babies which was fine I guess =L. The fluffy pancakes looks delicious but it was bland, totally flavorless. The short rib hash was too bland too. The Maple pecan French toast was really good but the edges can be really hard. The cinnamon bun was ok wish it was a bit more moist.",3.0
"After foregoing this place for a few of the surrounding brunch choices, I finally braved the cold to see what the wait was all about.  We were quoted 30 minutes and were able to leave a phone number for text notification.  However, we never received one.  We walked in to find that most of the others who had jotted their names down at the same time were already seated.My short rib hash dish contained chunks of extremely DRY meat.  Sticking with sunny-side-up eggs offered a nice coating & extra moisture, but it wasn't enough to overcome how harsh the meat was.  My mom had ordered the same dish.  A quick study of the two plates revealed an inconsistency between the two.  She had much less short rib hash and I had only a few cubed potatoes.  While waiting to use the restroom, I was in the direct line of kitchen items being sent out; I noticed the short rib hash plating varied greatly.  Consistent & proper portioning was problematic for them.I left feeling very underwhelmed.  The hype surrounding the short rib hash was unjustified.  The rest of the plate didn't succeed either: the multi-grain toast triangles were hard as heck, & the presentation looked sloppy, amateurish and thoughtless.  Based on these factors, I would venture elsewhere if there was any amount of wait time involved.",3.0
"Huge crowd on a Saturday afternoon, but we were intent on trying this spot. Put our name down and enjoyed the day outside until we got the text to come back (more places should do this). Obviously crowded inside, so expect to get cozy with your neighbors.Looking over the menu, was not going to get the brunch cocktails as they're overpriced. After realizing they don't serve their chicken for brunch (WHY), settled on the Fried Pork Chop w/cheddar waffles ($17) and a side of biscuits ($5). The fried pork chop is well breaded, a bit oily, yet substantial. The cheddar waffles pack a punch - crisp, filling, though a bit on the salty end (best eaten with a sauce). The biscuits are super fluffy; presented with jelly and butter that goes altogether well. To wash it down, ordered an overpriced orange juice ($4) - why is every drink here so expensive?Service here is efficient considering the crowds they have to deal with. I did enjoy my meal, but found the price point to be higher than it should be, especially for drinks. Still, I'd want to come back to try the chicken - 3.5 stars.",3.0
With the exception of the obnoxiously long wait; it was fantastic. The long wait gave us just enough time to get buzzed next door on margaritas and then come back an hour later for our brunch.  There were 4 of us and we all ordered something different - and they were all equally delicious. I had the pancakes. It's a huge order. Way more pancake than one person needs. Biscuits were great too. Overall a great brunch.,5.0
"Amazing Easily a favorite reoccurring spotSo everything We had here was amazing Important tip: this place fills up fast and stays pretty busy throughout the day. Keep that in mind when heading there for a meal.We had smoked salmon, burger, and pecan French toast and a few cocktails.Cocktails were top notch, imaginative and delicious (with the exception of the westlake cocktail)The food was spectacular. Even the damn toast was perfectly toasted, lolThe salmon pieces (4 large) were nice and big and were not too salty. They cure it to perfection over. The burger was very well prepared. Juicy, crispy, flavored well. One of the best I've ever had anywhere.The pecan pie French toast was decadent. Crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. Perfectly flavored- we had it as dessert.Each dish we ordered stood out as something special.It's hard to choose what to order there. Everything on the menu looks killer.Anyway, it's pricey but worth every cent. The service is friendly and attentive Very clean and well kept establishment The patrons are pleasant as wellNot noisy or obnoxious Everything about this place is 5 starsMust try!",5.0
"We arrived on a Sunday afternoon for Brunch and were seated in 15 minutes. Staff here is friendly and attentive. This place does get busy so expect a crowd outside the restaurant. Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles $17 - Not a bad alternative from the chicken & waffles. The skin was crispy, but not over-cooked. The pork chop was very juicy and flavorful. You get a huge pork chop but the waffles were small. The waffles sat underneath the pork chop, causing the waffles to be flattened into a pancake. I dowsed my pork chop and waffles in maple syrup. Best decision ever.Short Rib Hash $16 - Too dry and burnt. My fiancé had to use some of the maple syrup for taste. I was expecting something with more flavor, and bigger. There wasn't much short rib in the hash.Personally, I'd come back for dinner (chicken & waffles). I've had it before and it is much better than the pork chop.",3.0
"Came here for Saturday brunch. Nice wooden decor with a large bar. It was very spacious and solid service. - fried pork chop with cheddar waffles - this dish itself deserves 6 stars. The fried pork chop was crispy on the outside and moist inside. The cheddar was inside the waffle and it worked very well. - short rib hash - I had a taste of the short ribs. It was fatty and delicious. Overall, awesome place to get brunch. I would love to come back to try their fried chicken.",5.0
"Came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night.  We knew this place would be good by the wait that was outside this restaurant before it even opened.  We were the fourth group in line and were able to get a table without a reservation, although I'm pretty sure we were one of the only tables that didn't have a reservation.  Dim, romantic lighting.  Very quaint.  Great for couples.  Seating can get a little tight when the restaurant is completely packed, but it is nothing that isn't expected in this area.The waitstaff was kind, very knowledgeable about the menu, and efficient.  I forgot our waiter's name but he made sure to check back with us a few times to make sure we were happy with our dishes and recommended some cheeses for our starter course that we loved.  My friend and I split a cheese platter which consisted of four different types of cheeses, toast, and honey.  We killed this dish in literally ten minutes.  For dinner I had a cheeseburger and she had the chicken and waffles, both huge in portions, instagram-worthy, and delicious.   I felt like the size justified the price tag.  Neither of us could finish our dinners - not because it wasn't tasty enough, but because it was too much food. Lol.Two dinners, an appetizer, and some wine ran us just shy of $100 to those curious about pricing.Looking forward to coming back here for their brunch :)",5.0
"Came here on a Saturday morning after a visit to other half brewery down the road. It was very small and packed on the inside, so we decided to sit immediately on the outdoor seating. We both ordered the star of the sea Bloody Mary which is celery and peppercorn infused vodka with a shucked oyster on top. It was very tasty and the oyster was very clean and delicious. I ordered the fried porkchop and the cheddar waffles. The porkchop was cooked perfectly and was a very big portion. When in the area, it's definitely a good place to brunch at.",4.0
"Aside from having an awesome name (#1), Buttermilk Channel has been a mainstay in the Brooklyn brunch scene for quite some time. But BC is more than just brunch, it is one of the most underrated establishments in the borough with its eclectic menu and its impressive take on refined American cuisine.Brunch is one of the many reasons folks will come, which is a fabulous time to visit even if the wait is long on the weekends. I love the Short RIb Hash ($16) and the Buttermilk Pancakes ($11) are fluffy yet delicious. While the Eggs Huntington ($13) is really a fancier, perhaps tastier version of eggs benedict, the Fried Pork Chop + Cheddar Waffles ($17) is an upgraded version of chicken and waffles. Hash Browns (5) are also served here but sadly in patty form. Doh.The dinner menu consists of a seasonal variety of dishes grouped by first and second courses. I won't lie, I've been less than thrilled with most of the first course options, but the food in the latter group has been fantastic. The Duck Meatloaf ($28) is exactly as it sounds, but accompanied by a very tasty dirty rice, pickled okra, and pickled peppers. Folks are ga-ga over the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($27) which is full of flavor and crunch, but the Pan Roasted Hanger Steak ($28) has my attention for its juicy preparation and unforgettable bite. Even the Burger ($18) is one of their better choices, which also comes from super crunchy fries as well.Versatility is one way to describe the cozy interior. It's perfectly bright, homey during the daytime and wonderfully dimmed for an intimate ambiance at night. The service is fairly prompt and professional and the prices are expected for the area. Ultimately, BC is a nice establishment for all occasions, be it a date, celebratory dinner, or the occasional bite while hanging around Downtown Brooklyn.____________(#1) Which is the same name for the mile long path between Brooklyn and Governor's Island.",4.0

"Came here for brunch with the bf and we were hoping their weekend brunch menu has fried chicken and waffles (which we've read alot about). Unfortunately, they only serve it on weekday dinners.Arrived on Saturday 1PM and ended up with an hour wait. so get here early or late and avoid the lunch / brunch hours! Ordered the Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles along with the Short Rib Hash.Fried pork chop & cheddar waffles (4) - i'd give the fried pork chop a 4 and the waffles a 3 - 3.5. The pork chop was fried soooo well and the meat was so juicy, HUGE, and tender! The cheddar waffle was good, but wasn't the fluffiest waffle i've ever had.Short rib hash (3) - the flavors were great, but the short rib hash was a bit dry on the less fatty pieces and some were slightly burnt.On a side note, we saw customers with their scrambled eggs which looks reallyyyyyy delicious so if i come back again, that's a side order I'd want to try!",4.0

"BRUNCH - Buttermilk Channel is the definition of ""risk it for the biscuit"" (in terms of seating.) They only take reservations for large parties, so come early or risk it and see how long your wait is for that delicious biscuit. The food is home-y and comforting, no-frills in my opinion, but definitely worth a trip! Would be great if they offered more flavors of mimosas/bellinis, just sayin'.",4.0
"Oh, Buttermilk Channel. I've had your delicious fried chicken at Smorgasborg before, but it was a real treat to finally dine inside you. Is that weird to say? Phrasing, I suppose.Anyway, we had a reservation, which was good because the bar area was super crowded with people waiting halfway into our meal. To be expected.Love the ambience here. Unlike some other stuffy restaurants in Carroll Gardens, Buttermilk Channel is more casual (I mean, they're known for their chicken and waffles). It's boisterous, and everyone's having a good time.But enough with the formalities, let's get to the food. I know that's why you're reading this.Started out with the popovers ($1 apiece), which were a nice alternative to just regular bread. There was honey and sea salt, so if you like savory/sweet, you'll like em. Not much crunch to them though, so they were more like super airy biscuits than popovers.Also had the chicken liver mousse to start. I know liver puts a lot of people off, but I love it, and the one here was no exception. It had pickled grapes for some contrasing sweetness and a generous sprinkle of sea salt. Yum.We also ordered the barbecued oysters (which I hear are a southern delicacy). However, they forgot to bring them out, and when I asked our waitress, she was super apologetic and comped them for us. We would've gladly paid for them, but at $3.25 apiece, we were more glad to not. Can't say I'm a huge fan of cooked oysters. I think the bacon totally overpowered the natural oyster taste, but hey, didn't have to pay for em.For my entree, I went with the duck meatloaf over dirty rice with pickled okra. I did not know I needed this dish in my life, but I do. As someone who never had meatloaf until my teens, I've always had preconceived notions of what it is, or how good it could be. This duck meatloaf was better than I could ever have imagined. The meatloaf wasn't too... loafy. You could easily break it apart with your spoon and scoop a nice heaping of dirty rice and loaf into your mouth. Oh, and that sauce. So great. The pickled okra was unexpected (didn't really read the menu thoroughly), but they were amazing. They were on the crispy side, and not slimey (I know people have texture issues with okra). There were also shishito peppers on the side for added kick. Just a perfect dish all around.Of course, I couldn't go without having the fried chicken. Split a dish with a friend. Every bit as good as I remembered. Gigantic portions. Delightfully fluffy waffle. Crispy skin. The darkest maple syrup I've ever seen. Cabbage slaw on the side. Definitely bucket list worthy.I also have to mention their drinks. We did a handful of cocktails. I went with the Westlake and the Old Gal. Both were great, but I liked the Westlake better. Then again, I'm a sucker for St. Germain.If you're ever in doubt whether you should go to Buttermilk Channel, my answer is an emphatic yes.

"Maybe I should have known that if you order a fried pork chop and cheddar waffle, then a food coma is soon to follow. But it was a great food coma.There are so many great brunch places in NY and Buttermilk Channel is among them. For a Saturday brunch, we only had to wait fifteen minutes to get seated-- which is basically unreal for a solid brunch spot. The service was also great. Never had an empty water glass, always had what we needed to brunch it up.The ingredients are high quality. The waffle has the right balance of cheddar and sweetness while the pork chop was fried to a slight crisp on the outside but was tender and easy to cut. The salad provided the healthy side cutting through the carbs and meat. Mimosas are generally over-priced but I feel like getting a drink with brunch at BC isn't as worth it. It's good but you can plainly see that you can make a pitcher at home for what you pay for here. But in terms of the price for a drink in NY, it's on the more reasonable side. The coffee was standard.Vibes: lowkey hipster. Based on the look of the menu and the decor of the restaurant, you kind of have an idea of the place you're coming too. But don't worry, it's good no matter how you feel about nonprescription glasses and mainstream things.It ended up being about $27 each for brunch... not bad at all for NY. I do recommend trying this place out.",4.0
"Came to Buttermilk on a Sunday evening. We made reservations for 6pm and was about 3 minutes late but we were sat right away. It wasn't very busy anyway.I loved the classic, trendy decor of the place and with the staff wearing blue jeans and tops of their choice, it seemed very down to earth. My cousin and I both ended up ordering a Mimosa with the Fried Chicken. Instead of the waffles, I ordered mashed potatoes.

I know these boutique restaurant prices are somewhat par for the course in Carroll Gardens, but still... Anyhow, my two friends (visiting from France, and thus with the sort of palates one would be wise to place stock in) loved the burger ($16!) and whatever else it was the other got. All said, it's a sort of one and done place for me, just to say I've been, however, this is mostly reflecting what is overpriced in my opinion.

"Ever since I moved to New York, I'd heard rave reviews of buttermilk channel. Now, I have to say - it's fine, but given my expectations, I was sorely disappointed. The biggest foodie I know recommended it and all I could think of was ways to amend the dish in front of me. First - the bread to start was a bit stale. Now I was wearing flannel, so I'm not sure if they wrote me off as a ""low end customer"" and served me stale bread...but it got better after that. I had a wonderful squash tart that really stole the show of the night. It was flaky, crunchy, and loaded with zucchini - really, really good.

"My friend suggested us to try their fried chicken, so we all make a LONG trip to Brooklyn. I am so mad because the fried chicken can't even make it to my top 10. It was less than mediocre. I did not like the breading, it's almost like baked rather than fried chicken. This is the kind of place with table cloth and candle light, where you pay $14 and only get 2 ribs. I understand they try to go to the high-end classy path, but don't mess with the fried chicken. When it's called fried chicken, it's not meant to be healthy, so fry that sh** And the meat itself was pretty tender but tasteless. I have to use my hot sauce tactic (hot sauce makes everything taste better).I did like their appetizers esp. Delicata Squash Tart. My friend had the duck meatloaf. It's good but it's not like you gotta take a 50 min trip to try it. For dessert, I was in love with that peacan pie sundae. Their service was super SLOW. It would be more justifiable if it's like a weekend. We waited around 10 min for the waiter to take the initial order and more than another 10 min for him to take our dessert order. In between, it was very hard to locate him. He didn't come and check if everything was ok after the entree were given to us. You want to be a high-end restaurant right? I'm not even comparing this to Nobu's service. Like maybe take a trip to Red Rooster and see how you can better your service.",3.0
"If Ron Swanson and a hipster had a lovechild, this menu would be their soulmate. This menu is meat-lovers galore, but still has lighter, vegetarian options for those looking to eat their food's food. They have a solid bloody mary and brunch cocktail menu that hits that sweet spot of offering a nice variety of drinks without being too overwhelming. I personally recommend the Star of the Sea bloody mary - it has properties of a bloody cesar but the celery and peppercorn infused vodka gives it a little extra kick. For food, I got the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles and Friend got the lox scramble - both were delicious. The scramble was rich and filling and came with some extra fixings on the side like toast and potatoes, while the fried chop and waffles left me at a loss for words; the side salad it came with might as well have been garnish in comparison to the rest of the entree.  Totally recommend if you're in the neighborhood.

Went for a follow up visit for a friends bday ordered the entire menu... It was nothing short of amazing!Had the soup - not badMushroom Barley burger was amazingOysters were goodLoved the picklesThe pate was on pointThe mussels this time were super spicy - will pass next time.. and i like spicy.Duck meatloaf - was not a fan - hubby liked it thoWaiter did an excellent job at dealing with such a huge party and multiple cc's at the end for the bill.Drinks were all mixed wonderfully as well.Also free shot for the bday girl whoohoo!This is really one of my new favorite places.,5.0
"Maybe I should have known that if you order a fried pork chop and cheddar waffle, then a food coma is soon to follow. But it was a great food coma.There are so many great brunch places in NY and Buttermilk Channel is among them. For a Saturday brunch, we only had to wait fifteen minutes to get seated-- which is basically unreal for a solid brunch spot. The service was also great. Never had an empty water glass, always had what we needed to brunch it up.The ingredients are high quality. The waffle has the right balance of cheddar and sweetness while the pork chop was fried to a slight crisp on the outside but was tender and easy to cut. The salad provided the healthy side cutting through the carbs and meat. Mimosas are generally over-priced but I feel like getting a drink with brunch at BC isn't as worth it. It's good but you can plainly see that you can make a pitcher at home for what you pay for here. But in terms of the price for a drink in NY, it's on the more reasonable side. The coffee was standard.Vibes: lowkey hipster. Based on the look of the menu and the decor of the restaurant, you kind of have an idea of the place you're coming too. But don't worry, it's good no matter how you feel about nonprescription glasses and mainstream things.It ended up being about $27 each for brunch... not bad at all for NY. I do recommend trying this place out.",4.0
"Came to Buttermilk on a Sunday evening. We made reservations for 6pm and was about 3 minutes late but we were sat right away. It wasn't very busy anyway.I loved the classic, trendy decor of the place and with the staff wearing blue jeans and tops of their choice, it seemed very down to earth. My cousin and I both ended up ordering a Mimosa with the Fried Chicken. Instead of the waffles, I ordered mashed potatoes. I'm not a fan of pulp in my OJ or anyone's slaw, but the fried chicken was really good and the mashed potatoes were even better! The food came out fast and piping hot too!I enjoyed my dinner here and I would definitely revisit :-)",4.0

"Only been here once, and we sat outside. Although the place is small, we, a party of 3, had no problem getting a table immediately on an early fall evening (beautiful weather). The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. I had to get the chicken and waffles of course, which was absolutely delicious, but to be honest, is hard to justify at $25 or so. I know these boutique restaurant prices are somewhat par for the course in Carroll Gardens, but still... Anyhow, my two friends (visiting from France, and thus with the sort of palates one would be wise to place stock in) loved the burger ($16!) and whatever else it was the other got. All said, it's a sort of one and done place for me, just to say I've been, however, this is mostly reflecting what is overpriced in my opinion. I could not complain about the food, service, atmosphere whatsoever.",3.0

"Ever since I moved to New York, I'd heard rave reviews of buttermilk channel. Now, I have to say - it's fine, but given my expectations, I was sorely disappointed. The biggest foodie I know recommended it and all I could think of was ways to amend the dish in front of me. First - the bread to start was a bit stale. Now I was wearing flannel, so I'm not sure if they wrote me off as a ""low end customer"" and served me stale bread...but it got better after that.

The coffee was great--really delicious flavor.  And the sticky bun was good and definitely fresh.  I ordered a goat cheese, spinach, and mushroom scramble ($12).  It came with a small ""salad,"" that barely had any dressing on it--it was basically plain arugula.  It was also supposed to come with toast and hash browns, but the kitchen forgot them.  I asked for them and they brought them out--I'm glad I did because they were the best part of the meal.  The scramble itself was served in a small cup and I could barely find any mushrooms, goat cheese, or spinach!  Total letdown!  My friend had the heirloom bean stew ($16), which tasted like an Indian or Moroccan stew.  It wasn't what either of us expected.I wished this place gave me more than it did, but it just felt like a typical brunch spot with nothing special.  I don't see myself coming back to try their dinner if it's as average as the brunch.",3.0

My husband loved their house- cured salmon and house-made sausage (spicy and a bit sweet) but wished the capers were not fried on his salmon dish....said they were rendered tasteless.Had to have extra bisquits of course.Service was excellent and lively atmosphere but never too loud.

The food was good too - the eggs Huntington (Benedict with prosciutto), the short rib hash and the bean stew were all tasty.

"I love this place and the pretty street it's on! I absolutely love brunch and I love Carroll Gardens, so this was the best of both worlds! I'd seen Buttermilk Channel on quite a few brunch blogs and articles naming the top brunch places in NYC/Brooklyn, and I was excited to try it! My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday morning and it was busy. We got a seat at the bar (we wanted to sit outside but didn't want to wait). I like this place because it's casual and great for families. We spend a lot of time in Bushwick and the vibe at restaurants there can be a bit different. This would be a great place to bring parents, family, friends, etc. It's also good for groups! I also really liked the big windows and the light that they let in to the space. We were there on a late spring day as the weather was just warming up, so it was nice to sit in a nice, bright spot! We each got coffee and a mimosa. I got the pecan pie french toast and my boyfriend got the esposito's hot sausage scramble. They were both really yummy! The only thing about the sausage scramble is that it kind of resembled something that you would make in college, like eggs in a cup. The flavor was much better though! My french toast was a really rich and I was too full to finish it, but we switched plates and finished both! I think the menu has something for everyone here, with good portion sizes and prices. I'm from South Carolina and went to college in Charleston, SC, and I felt at home in the atmosphere and with the food!",4.0
"I only have been to Buttermilk Channel twice, and both times for brunch. That means that I haven't tried the fried chicken yet, served only at dinner. But what I have tried here has been amazing every time. My personal favorite is the fried pork chop -- which is so large that it is almost sinful not to split it between two people -- served over a cheese waffle. The pork chops are meaty, and the buttermilk crust reminds me so much of my southern mother's crust and version of the fried pork chop. I also have loved the grilled cheese sandwich here. My friends have raved about the eggs benedict. Few restaurants make a Bloody Mary as good as the one here, and my personal favorite is the one made with bourbon instead of vodka. I love that this restaurant texts and / or calls when the table is available. Since I live around the corner, it makes it very convenient for me to come here without waiting around in boredom until a table becomes available.What to improve? The hosts sometimes can be a bit ""bothered"" or perhaps, in their defense, overwhelmed. A little less New York personality, and a little more warmth at the host stand, would keep the experience aligned with the friendliness and goodness of the rest of the place. But that's small beans. Overall, a great experience, and I'll be coming back time and again.",5.0
"The birthday boy was an avid fried chicken lover, having brought him to countless fried chicken joints, yet none would trump Popeyes in his mind. That is, not until Buttermilk Channel.The thing to get here IS the fried chicken. Crispy, juicy, savory...and a bunch of other adjectives ending in y--nothing else can compare. Except perhaps the honey & sea salt popovers, which were as scrumptious as they were adorable. We ordered two orders for our party of 5. The inevitable fork battle that ensued over the last one would rival that of the Trojan war over Helen of Troy. The beer steamed mussels are alarmingly spicy, but a nice appetizer to begin your meal. What I would perhaps skip are the St Louis Ribs, served with beans and not much else other than two measly ribs. Though the dim-lit, table cloth restaurant is not the usual southern chicken wing joint, I wouldn't underestimate their ability to dole out kickin' fried chicken.",4.0
"One of the best places for brunch - hands down. I've honestly tried almost everything on the menu and it's difficult to choose a favorite. Definitely start with a bloody mary - classic, court street, or star of the sea - you can't go wrong! I personally like the court street bloody mary because it comes with a trio of antipasti (olive, cheese, meat) that puts a big fat smile on my face.The scrambles are always a good choice (I like the mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese) and comes with yummy hash browns. The burger is also delicious and if you're looking for a heart attack overload - the french toast is the way to go. It's hard to choose a favorite, but I've never had a bad meal here. Another tid bit - if you have room - get the sticky bun...it's SO good.Service is usually good, but sometimes a slow - the restaurant is always packed during brunch. Definitely one of my go-to places.",5.0
"So I decided to be adventures on this wonderful fall day. I have bookmarked this establishment for quite sometime now and have finally made it. I give it 4 stars because of the 45min wait. I guess thats a good thing,  meaning people are actually returning.  The food was delicious! Unlike the wait for a table the food came out fast and it was fresh. I enjoyed the pork chops with the cheddar waffles. Something different for the palate. I am an almond lover so I order those as well. They were warm and sweet! I definitely recommend this place, Its worth the wait. I'm sure when it gets colder outside seating will no longer be available.",4.0
"Came here on a Friday night at 8 PM with a friend. Jam-packed but great, cozy, and elegant atmosphere.The mussels were incredible as an appetizer, so much flavor!! Too bad they were all really small. They weren't very meaty.My friend ordered the linguini and I ordered the fried chicken. Her linguini was delicious but I'm very disappointed with my $27 fried chicken (do you know how much food I can get at KFC with that???)My pollo wasn't extraordinary and it was actually quite undercooked. I saw and tasted some blood in my big piece of chicken. The cook probably rushed my dish since it was a Friday night and they were busy. Now, I'm ok with having some blood in my steak, just not in my chicken.The waffles that came with my dish were tasty though! Crunchy with a mild hint of cheese.Overall, would I come back? Nah. $27 for a fried chicken dish... I can feed an entire family for less than $27 at KFC if I want fried chicken!! I'm a fried chicken expert and I can tell you that it's very cheap to make good fried chicken. Nonetheless, it was a nice atmosphere, the staff were friendly, and I still had a decent Friday night with my friend here.",3.0
"Buttermilk Channel has great food and has a exceptional staff. I noticed that they were extremely family friendly. I came here for Brunch with my wife and while the wait was a little long the staff was excellent at keeping you aware if the time remaining.I tried a Brooklyn Pilsner. The walnut cinnamon roll. I ordered the short ribs hash. The flavors were so bright and wonderful. I really liked trying my wife's pork fried pork chop.Be warned though the wait can be long but the staff is quite nice and works to make you comfortable.The food is fantastic, it speaks for itself, the fried pork chop with waffle is crisp, rich and bright with flavor.  Perfect for brunch.  The Short Ribs hash is mouthwatering and good to every bite.

"LET ME TELL YOU MOFO'S SOMETHING...the person who cooks the food here must get insurance on his/her hands because if anything happens to those blessed parts of his/her body, nothing and I mean NOTHING will ever be the same.I've had buttermilk channel in my bookmarks for AGESSSSS. The food looks amazing, the menu is enticing, and the reviews had me SOLD. I came here on a beautiful Sunday evening ready to ""cash out until I pass out"" so with that said my friend and I had the following:1. A really good drink that my dumb ass can't remember the name of...2. Half dozen of East Coast Oysters - somebody slap me! whew! that grapefruit topping was clever3. Buttermilk mashed potatoes - never been so happy to commit a sin in my LIFE4. Corn - LISTEN AGAIN...I HATE corn on the cob but the mexican style I can't seem to pass up on. Knowing that buttermilk offers the mexican style corn on the cob WITHOUT the cob reassured me that Jesus is slowing answering all my prayers yas LORDT. BY THE WAY this was soooooo good5. Buttermilk chicken and waffles - THIS CHICKENNNNNNNNNNN. WHO created this? What's his name/number/brain cell count? Like...I need answers!!! This chicken was sooooo good it's going into my chicken list I just can't resist. The waffle was ok I would have preferred mine way more fluffy, but I was too focused on the chicken to even give a damn about the waffle :-/. The syrup was tasty as well.6. Cole slaw - this isn't on the menu I believe but it came with my chicken and waffles. LISTEN UP FOR THE LAST TIME...I do NOTTTT eat coleslaw. However, since none of the other foods failed me I said to myself ""let me try this"". I don't have much to compare it to but I can almost..ALMOST...guarantee this is the best cole slaw around. I DON'T CARE WTH U THINK!!!SO...the service was okay nothing extraordinary but no reason to complain either. All in all I WILL BE BACK! I want to try the duck meatloaf and the lamb salad.

"This a very popular spot, but a very friendly hostess said come back in 45 minutes and she would have a space for us, and she did. Going all out on a Sunday 2 of us had spicy sausage scramble, eggs huntington (benidict) AND french toast. we were very full when we left but totally satisfied. the french toast is an event all of its own, one giant slice of brioche, heaped with whipped cream and slathered in syrup. unreal!!

"Yes, I am aware that I am late to the party. I have always wanted to try Buttermilk Channel, but somehow the waits and inability to get a reservation at the time I wanted made me avoid the restaurant. We had some great cocktails here and a lovely dinner. Apparently, Beyonce has been here. I don't know. I don't care. But that was the comment from a few friends. After reading the reviews, I tried the chicken liver mousse (should have been shared, but I'm a glutton), duck meatloaf, pecan pie sundae, and apple crostata (I shared dessert!). It was a lot of food and very rich. I don't regret it because I have only a few more days before I have to restrict my eating in the new year and pull it all back in. Would love to return to try the  chicken and waffles!",4.0
"I love this place and the pretty street it's on! I absolutely love brunch and I love Carroll Gardens, so this was the best of both worlds! I'd seen Buttermilk Channel on quite a few brunch blogs and articles naming the top brunch places in NYC/Brooklyn, and I was excited to try it! My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday morning and it was busy. We got a seat at the bar (we wanted to sit outside but didn't want to wait). I like this place because it's casual and great for families. We spend a lot of time in Bushwick and the vibe at restaurants there can be a bit different. This would be a great place to bring parents, family, friends, etc. It's also good for groups! I also really liked the big windows and the light that they let in to the space. We were there on a late spring day as the weather was just warming up, so it was nice to sit in a nice, bright spot! We each got coffee and a mimosa. I got the pecan pie french toast and my boyfriend got the esposito's hot sausage scramble. They were both really yummy! The only thing about the sausage scramble is that it kind of resembled something that you would make in college, like eggs in a cup. The flavor was much better though! My french toast was a really rich and I was too full to finish it, but we switched plates and finished both! I think the menu has something for everyone here, with good portion sizes and prices. I'm from South Carolina and went to college in Charleston, SC, and I felt at home in the atmosphere and with the food!",4.0
"I only have been to Buttermilk Channel twice, and both times for brunch. That means that I haven't tried the fried chicken yet, served only at dinner. But what I have tried here has been amazing every time. My personal favorite is the fried pork chop -- which is so large that it is almost sinful not to split it between two people -- served over a cheese waffle. The pork chops are meaty, and the buttermilk crust reminds me so much of my southern mother's crust and version of the fried pork chop. I also have loved the grilled cheese sandwich here. My friends have raved about the eggs benedict. Few restaurants make a Bloody Mary as good as the one here, and my personal favorite is the one made with bourbon instead of vodka. I love that this restaurant texts and / or calls when the table is available. Since I live around the corner, it makes it very convenient for me to come here without waiting around in boredom until a table becomes available.What to improve? The hosts sometimes can be a bit ""bothered"" or perhaps, in their defense, overwhelmed. A little less New York personality, and a little more warmth at the host stand, would keep the experience aligned with the friendliness and goodness of the rest of the place. But that's small beans. Overall, a great experience, and I'll be coming back time and again.",5.0
"The birthday boy was an avid fried chicken lover, having brought him to countless fried chicken joints, yet none would trump Popeyes in his mind. That is, not until Buttermilk Channel.The thing to get here IS the fried chicken. Crispy, juicy, savory...and a bunch of other adjectives ending in y--nothing else can compare. Except perhaps the honey & sea salt popovers, which were as scrumptious as they were adorable. We ordered two orders for our party of 5. The inevitable fork battle that ensued over the last one would rival that of the Trojan war over Helen of Troy. The beer steamed mussels are alarmingly spicy, but a nice appetizer to begin your meal. What I would perhaps skip are the St Louis Ribs, served with beans and not much else other than two measly ribs. Though the dim-lit, table cloth restaurant is not the usual southern chicken wing joint, I wouldn't underestimate their ability to dole out kickin' fried chicken.",4.0
"One of the best places for brunch - hands down. I've honestly tried almost everything on the menu and it's difficult to choose a favorite. Definitely start with a bloody mary - classic, court street, or star of the sea - you can't go wrong! I personally like the court street bloody mary because it comes with a trio of antipasti (olive, cheese, meat) that puts a big fat smile on my face.The scrambles are always a good choice (I like the mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese) and comes with yummy hash browns. The burger is also delicious and if you're looking for a heart attack overload - the french toast is the way to go. It's hard to choose a favorite, but I've never had a bad meal here. Another tid bit - if you have room - get the sticky bun...it's SO good.Service is usually good, but sometimes a slow - the restaurant is always packed during brunch. Definitely one of my go-to places.",5.0
"So I decided to be adventures on this wonderful fall day. I have bookmarked this establishment for quite sometime now and have finally made it. I give it 4 stars because of the 45min wait. I guess thats a good thing,  meaning people are actually returning.  The food was delicious! Unlike the wait for a table the food came out fast and it was fresh. I enjoyed the pork chops with the cheddar waffles. Something different for the palate. I am an almond lover so I order those as well. They were warm and sweet! I definitely recommend this place, Its worth the wait. I'm sure when it gets colder outside seating will no longer be available.",4.0
"Came here on a Friday night at 8 PM with a friend. Jam-packed but great, cozy, and elegant atmosphere.The mussels were incredible as an appetizer, so much flavor!! Too bad they were all really small. They weren't very meaty.My friend ordered the linguini and I ordered the fried chicken. Her linguini was delicious but I'm very disappointed with my $27 fried chicken (do you know how much food I can get at KFC with that???)My pollo wasn't extraordinary and it was actually quite undercooked. I saw and tasted some blood in my big piece of chicken. The cook probably rushed my dish since it was a Friday night and they were busy. Now, I'm ok with having some blood in my steak, just not in my chicken.The waffles that came with my dish were tasty though! Crunchy with a mild hint of cheese.Overall, would I come back? Nah. $27 for a fried chicken dish... I can feed an entire family for less than $27 at KFC if I want fried chicken!! I'm a fried chicken expert and I can tell you that it's very cheap to make good fried chicken. Nonetheless, it was a nice atmosphere, the staff were friendly, and I still had a decent Friday night with my friend here.",3.0
"Buttermilk Channel has great food and has a exceptional staff. I noticed that they were extremely family friendly. I came here for Brunch with my wife and while the wait was a little long the staff was excellent at keeping you aware if the time remaining.I tried a Brooklyn Pilsner. The walnut cinnamon roll. I ordered the short ribs hash. The flavors were so bright and wonderful. I really liked trying my wife's pork fried pork chop.Be warned though the wait can be long but the staff is quite nice and works to make you comfortable.The food is fantastic, it speaks for itself, the fried pork chop with waffle is crisp, rich and bright with flavor.  Perfect for brunch.  The Short Ribs hash is mouthwatering and good to every bite. Great Brunch Spot.",4.0
"LET ME TELL YOU MOFO'S SOMETHING...the person who cooks the food here must get insurance on his/her hands because if anything happens to those blessed parts of his/her body, nothing and I mean NOTHING will ever be the same.I've had buttermilk channel in my bookmarks for AGESSSSS. The food looks amazing, the menu is enticing, and the reviews had me SOLD. I came here on a beautiful Sunday evening ready to ""cash out until I pass out"" so with that said my friend and I had the following:1. A really good drink that my dumb ass can't remember the name of...2. Half dozen of East Coast Oysters - somebody slap me! whew! that grapefruit topping was clever3. Buttermilk mashed potatoes - never been so happy to commit a sin in my LIFE4. Corn - LISTEN AGAIN...I HATE corn on the cob but the mexican style I can't seem to pass up on. Knowing that buttermilk offers the mexican style corn on the cob WITHOUT the cob reassured me that Jesus is slowing answering all my prayers yas LORDT. BY THE WAY this was soooooo good5. Buttermilk chicken and waffles - THIS CHICKENNNNNNNNNNN. WHO created this? What's his name/number/brain cell count? Like...I need answers!!! This chicken was sooooo good it's going into my chicken list I just can't resist.

Some of the tables were very close together, though, and when it was full, it felt a LITTLE cramped, but what else is new in NY.FOOD: 4 stars- Oysters with Grapefruit Mignonette: the mignonette was great! We ordered a dozen oysters and had a mix of the two types of oysters for the day, one of which was saltier, while the other was creamier. I personally preferred the creamier one, but both were solid selections. Very fresh!- Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cheddar Waffles and Savoy Cabbage Slaw: AMAZING. As someone who takes her fried chicken very seriously (I'm currently at three meals in a row of fried chicken), I must say this fried chicken was really on point. The portions are rather large -- one wing, one drumstick, and one breast, but I couldn't get enough. The skin is perfectly crispy and peppery (mmm), while the inside is juicy, tender, and all kinds of delicious. It went really well with the savory cheddar waffle -- yum. The slaw was also a great complement to add a bit of freshness to the dish. Highly recommend you also drizzle lots of maple syrup on top of the chicken AND the waffles.

Also, I can't be the only one who hates when restaurant restrooms are gross and luckily, this was not one of them.

"YAY, I'm a fan!I went to Buttermilk with some girlfriends for dinner last Friday and I can't wait to go back! We arrived around 8PM and it was packed! We didn't have to wait for seats though (whew).The food was delicious and the service was great. I cannot wait to come back to try out other foods on the menu. One thing I definitely recommend is the corn! Sooooo good!!",4.0
THE BEST BRUNCH. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was nice. The staff was friendly & accommodating. I could go on forever about how great this place is but there are many other reviews about that. Expect a wait (no reservations for small parties) but it's WORTH IT.,5.0
"Came here for Saturday brunch and was oddly delighted when the wait was only 15 minutes (we came around 11am). We took a quick spin around the neighborhood, then came back to a ready table!The pecan sticky bun was neither sticky nor a bun; it was more like a biscuit with pecan and caramel drizzled on top, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. (It is more of a dense texture, though.)I had the Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffle while my friend had the short ribs hash. The pork chop itself was dry and not at all flavorful, but the breading was awesome! Fried crispy and crunchy to bite into. I didn't really enjoy the cheddar waffle, as it wasn't fluffy like normal waffles and the cheddar aspect of it wasn't flavorful either.The short ribs hash, the hash itself is great! Slow roasted and tender, with a nice salty kick to it, it goes really well with the blander eggs. Interested in coming back for dinner!",4.0
"Most things about this restaurant were great, but a couple things really made it stand out.  1) phenomenal cider list.  Tried a number of the ciders.  Great selection of dry, semi dry, local, west coast, etc.  our favorite was a bottle of the Aaron Burr Elderberry Cider.  2) The duck meatloaf.  So good.  Was hesitant to get it as I don't usually love duck, but this was phenomenal.  One of the best entrees I've had a very long time.  Everything else about the place was very good, but the duck meatloaf and cider selection made this place great!",5.0
"Great brunch spot. We did have to wait 40 min to be seated but they have a good system of putting your name down and texting you when the table is ready. Everything on the menu looked great! I started with a Bellini which was pretty standard. For food, we opted for the lox scramble and pecan pie french toast and shared a side of housemade sausage patties. The scramble was light and fluffy just the way it should always be. Their house cure lox are on the chunky side which I loved. The pecan pie french toast is perfectly caramelized with a abundant amount of pecans and the right amount of syrup. The service was speedy and attentive. Loved the vibe and decor.",5.0
"My husband made reservations for 7:30pm on New Years Day. We arrived a bit too early but they were able to give us the table. I had the fair harbour drink which was quite good with the ginger taste. For appetizers we shared the beer mussels. The size of the mussels were huge! Loved the sauce and it had this spicy kick to it. It also came with 2 pieces of grilled bread. But mine was a little burnt. For entrees, we both had the fried chicken and waffles. When it arrived we didnt expect such huge portions. It came with a drum, thigh, and the breast with a side of coleslaw. The chicken was very crispy and moist! The cheddar waffles with the syrup was amazingly delicious. The waitress was very nice and attentive. The atmosphere was very cozy and dimly lit. It was a bit loud because there were babies crying and loud chattering around us. But I definitely see myself coming back here next time for brunch!",5.0
Yummy. I'd once before tried to come here for brunch but the line was impossible. This time I made dinner reservations with 3 girlfriends. Omg - we split a bunch of appetizers and everything was outstanding. For the main course I got the chicken and waffle and split the cod with a friend. Wow. I ended with the chocolate cake - so good! The cocktails were delicious as well - I got the bourbon one. Will definite return!,4.0
"Such a lovely brunch spot!Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and yummy food :).  I ordered the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles.  Wow - the pork was juicy and full of flavor, the cheddar waffles fluffy and delicious, and I appreciated that it came with a refreshing side salad.  We also ordered the pecan pie french toast for the table.  Another big WOW!  This dish was super sweet, but heavenly.",4.0

"Aside from an albeit not so bad wait (20 minutes for a party of 2 for Sunday brunch after July 4th), this place was great!The decor was absolutely adorable, and there was plenty of space inside.

"If the apocalypse hit, and I were stuck in Buttermilk Channel, and all I could eat to survive was their food...I'd be the happiest person alive. Buttermilk Channel is the first place I've gone where you could taste the QUALITY of the food. Despite eating quite a big brunch, I did not feel uncomfortable or sick after eating so much. It is evident that BC uses really fresh and quality ingredients. Came here with a friend for brunch on Saturday. We started with bellinis and the Court Street bloody Mary. So good! Gave you a nice buzz, but not too much of one. The Court Street bloody Mary came garnished with antipasto! After much deliberation, I settled on the A-B-C grilled cheese. I think it's called the ABC grilled cheese, because they're schoolin' people on how to make the grilled cheese. Apples, bacon, and cheddar baked into what felt like butter soaked fresh bread was heaven on earth, soooo good. I got a side of bacon which was absolutely delicious and different than other bacon in its bold flavor. My friend got the burger which she loved and a cheddar waffle which was great. The house made pickles are perfection, you must try them! We could taste a lot of buttery goodness in a lot of what we ate, and it was just amazing. The restaurant 's ambiance can only be described as darling, adorable, country meets Brooklyn, and fun. Our waiter was the best, provided excellent service. Considering I'm not allowed to live at the Buttermilk Channel, I'll settle for visiting all of the time. Place was busy but soooo worth the wait. Conveniently, we were able to take a walk while we waited because they text you when your table is ready :)",5.0
Best grilled cheese I've ever had. My girlfriend and I came here on a late Sunday morning to have brunch. It was a forty five minute wait and they take your phone number down to let you know when it's ready. It was a beautiful a beautiful morning and it gave us a chance to walk around a few blocks. For us the wait didn't bother us at all. Once we were informed that the reservation was ready we came and were seated right away. All of the staff was wonderful and the place itself was very pretty.The food was amazing. I would completely recommend the ABC grilled cheese! This place was great and I definitely would come back.,5.0

"Came here for dinner with the bf and let me say it was definitely a date spot. The place was dark but lit up with white Christmas lights and they had 70s music playing.

Chicken was crispy and juicy combined with the sweetness of the syrup and savory waffle, it was reallllly good. The mushrooms had a lemony yogurt which was also really good to cut some of the fattiness from the chicken. Mussels were good and was a large portion but the bread it came with was wayyy too burnt which kind of ruined it a bit for me since I like to soak up the sauce with bread. I mean I like toasted,crispy bread but this was straight up burnt. Regardless, overall it was a good meal with large sized portions and I will be returning.",4.0

"I waited 1.5 hours for brunch (Thanks Beyonce! J/K, you are my idol.)Yes, hunger is the best spice. Yes, the staff gave us a complimentary mimosa and Brooklyn Pilsner and apologized for the wait. Yes, the staff also gave us a Banana walnut sticky bun (and the walnuts were crispy sweet, I could not get enough of that crunch! So I picked all the walnuts off when my husband went to the restroom.) While waiting, I was irritable, dizzy, and somewhat incoherent (my last snack was at 09:30 and it was 14:00).Yet all those feelings were wiped clean when I took a bite of the juicy fried pork chops and waffles. My eyes widened as I clasped my left hand to my chest. The only way I could express my delight and surprise was involuntary 'OMG!'The food was amazing. Fried pork chop was dusted with a light airy breadcrumbs; it was so juicy and perfectly seasoned. The short rib hash- salty, fatty, fried burnt bits of short rib with a sunny side egg. Break the egg yolk, mix the yellow yolk in the hash with a bite of their salad- in short, it was delicious. Their bacon was great too but by this time, we were so fat saturated, we could hardly taste the smokiness in the bacon.  Thank you for the wonderful meal + the complimentary drinks and snack!",4.0

"A group of friends and I came here for a birthday dinner. I have to say I really find it accommodating and refreshing when restaurants have a vegetarian menu and their regular dinner menu. It just makes things a lot easier when you go out with a group and either you or your friends are vegetarians. That aside, the food here is impressive. The cauliflower-leek soup is a good choice for 1st course. It's creamy and just the right temperature (don't you just hate burning your tongue at the beginning of the meal?!). I also ordered a side of the corn bread with the chile-maple butter which was I think only 1 piece of cornbread maybe 2? I'm forgetting because the portion was so small. Definitely thought they could've given more cornbread...definitely try the chile-maple butter - it's to die for! Second course was the New England Hake. The Parmesan crust wasn't overdone or too salty ensuring that I could enjoy the fish in balance with the other flavors: mix of the orange-fennel broth and beans. Next time I go to Buttermilk Channel, I will definitely order Caputo's fresh linguine all to myself! I could only sample a small portion from my friend and it was the ideal pasta dish. Tasted fresh and perfectly portioned. I salivate at the thought of it! Another dish I was able to try was the buttermilk fried chicken. It reminded me of southern-style fried chicken - another hit.

"Been here multiple times, it's ridiculously reliably excellent. Only downside is we've never run into to Jay & Bey, although we just missed them once. Buttermilk Channel sets the standard in the zip code and further. Great food deftly prepared, excellent service, and an overall elevated and comfortable experience. It's our go-to in the price range in the borough. Our most recent meal is a fitting example of what ""the Channel"" has to offer.

A very busy and popular spot so expect a 20-30 minute wait on the weekends for brunch. I like Buttermilk's decor and staff who are so friendly and welcoming. That's always appreciated whenever I'm dining at a restaurant. I had the pecan French toast with a side of bacon. It was pretty good. I would definitely come here again and again.,5.0

"Didn't live up to the hype for me.  I ordered the chicken and waffles and I was underwhelmed, seeing as how that was their specialty.  I think it was a little pricey.  One thing I did like was the selection of cocktails and drinks.  Not sure I would go back but happy to have tried it.",3.0
"We had a lovely dinner here with out-of-town visitors. Yummy food, nice atmosphere, and good service. We asked about a drink on the menu and were promptly all brought samples.

"Lovvvvvve! This place was awesome! The ambiance, the staff, and the food was amazing. One of the best brunch spots I've been to in NY. The only issue I really had was the wait. The wait time here if you have a party of 4 or less is roughly an hour plus. The area is beautiful although there is a lot of construction around and a bit difficult for me to get to. I had the signature buttermilk pancakes ($8), smoked bacon ($6) about 4 long strips, a mimosa and Bellini for $8 each. The bellini was better btw. My friends respectively got the burger, waffles and the popular eggs Benedict entrees. Each raved about their meals. We waited outside for an hour in the rain and it was well worth the wait. The staff was friendly and didn't rush us out at all. I can't wait to come back here in the summer with the outdoor seating.",4.0
"Okay! This was one of my number one pancake places to go. Now it's like you never know what you can get. I had the scramble that was delicious and the buttermilk pancakes.

"Been here multiple times, it's ridiculously reliably excellent. Only downside is we've never run into to Jay & Bey, although we just missed them once. Buttermilk Channel sets the standard in the zip code and further. Great food deftly prepared, excellent service, and an overall elevated and comfortable experience. It's our go-to in the price range in the borough. Our most recent meal is a fitting example of what ""the Channel"" has to offer.

"Like most brunch spots that are successful, be prepared for the wait time on a Sunday. After an hour and a half we were seated at a central table.

The side of house made breakfast sausage was salty and flavorful. May have been a little undercooked, but I didn't have an upset stomach, so I was happy with it. Not dying to go back, but had an overall positive experience. I hear the main thing to go there for is the turkey meatloaf, so I'll try dinner in the future.",4.0

"Came here on a Saturday for a nice brunch with a friend visiting BK. We got there right at 10 AM (because I don't play around with line waiting if I can avoid it).

"We were excited to try the brunch menu after reading many good reviews. When we got there the place was packed which we thought was a great sign. There was a 40 minute wait. They took our name and number and we were told that they would text us when a table was available. We loved that idea since we were able to walk around the neighborhood while we waited. We started off with the coffee which we were looking forward to based on the reviews we have read. Honestly, it was comparable to average diner coffee, which is to say - unremarkable. I ordered the Rancho Gordo Heirloom Bean Stew and my girlfriend ordered the A-B-C Grilled Cheese. The Bean Stew came with one fried egg and about 6 tortilla chips (see pic). I thought it was ordinary as if it was canned beans with some spices added to it, and the portion was rather small. The Grilled Cheese was tasty ( I had a few bites of hers) but the side of salad it came with was small and the dressing was very salty. Service was good from both the hostess and waitress, however, if you are claustrophobic, I would rethink coming here as you will be sitting very close to strangers.May go there for Brunch again in the future since the food that we glanced at on the other tables such as the pancakes and french toast did look rather good.",2.0
"Best Brunch in Brooklyn!! Amazeballs! The line is no problem. Put your name on the list and then take a walk around the neighborhood. They will call you when your table is ready and all is good. Let me just say that the entire staff of Buttermilk Channel is a shining example of what excellent and caring customer service should look and feel like! While having brunch on a very busy Sunday, we brought an 11 month old child who was the center of attention. She was treated with the most amazing love and affection by so many of the servers and management.

No joke, the reason the line and wait are long is because the food rocks. We had a brunch feast and each item was perfectly seasoned. Portions were large, and so yummmmm. First off we were given a plate of sweet baked treats that satisfied every flavor sense. The scrambles were so tasty and fresh!! Every item we ordered was hot out of the kitchen and made to perfection. Even the prices are really fair for how high quality everything menu item is. Try a spicy Bloody Mary and you'll be having seconds for sure. Even the hash browns are crispy perfection. This place is fun, the vibe is pure and so incredibly inviting.

"After trying their chicken and waffles at a street fair, Gibson H. and I finally made a reservation online for a Wednesday night for 2. From their excellent cocktails to their food, everything was wonderful. Staff was friendly and attentive.Ordered the ribs and mussels as our appetizers, the chicken&waffles and the duck meatloaf as entrees, corn bread and fries as sides, and a dessert. Buttermilk Channel did not go light on the portions--the appetizers were huge, in my opinion, entree sized. Fresh waffles paired well with cripsy fried chicken...the substantial duck in the meatloaf, which sat nicely over some mash potatoes...mMmmm.Buttermilk Channel is a wonderful, causal spot with above average food at great prices, highly recommend. Comfort food, done right.",4.0
"This has become one of my favorite spots for both brunch and dinner. Everything from the chicken and waffle to the warm lamb romaine salad to the biscuits and cocktails is absolutely delicious. The food is consistently good and the service is great, fast and courteous. Option for a side of waffle is a great idea, they should do the same with pancakes! Expect long wait times on the weekends (hour or more) - imo worth the wait! Will be coming back again and again.",4.0
"The food here is very good but I can't help but feel that they took advantage of Valentine's Day with their prixfixe menu. For three courses, it was $85/pp before drinks and the items that were offered normally don't add up to that much. That being said, everything was cooked to perfection and I did not leave hungry at all (actually left with a sizeable takeout portion). Their pecan pie sundae is out of this world and the fried chicken comes paired nicely with savoy cabbage and cheddar waffles. The crab cake appetizer had a really tangy sauce to accompany it, and the lettuce was nicely grilled. Overall, it is definitely worth checking out on a regular night.

When I came for lunch, I ordered several sides as they don't have many options for vegetarians. They were all very delicious but I wish they had something substantial and affordable for those who don't eat meat. When I came for brunch, I ordered nearly one of everything on the menu. The cheddar waffle sounded like such a good idea but didn't taste much like anything. I was expecting a better tasting hash brown, which sadly fell short. The buttermilk pancakes really are decadent, super fluffy and flavorful although I would have liked some choice of topping (perhaps blueberries or chocolate chips?) It's generally just three very dense and fluffy pancakes with nothing on the side. We also got the biscuits (how can a southern girl not?) and despite the awesome jams and butters that came with it, I was left unimpressed. The biscuits were dry, flaky...dare I say, basic. I think we also ordered the hash browns but I honestly can't remember because they were that unremarkable.

Have only been for dinner. Food was delicious. We split the burger and friend chicken on waffles. The burger was perfectly cooked and the chicken lived up to its legacy (although the waffles were a little dry and bland). Waiter was great. Atmosphere was OK.

"A friend and I went to Buttermilk Channel for dinner.  The restaurant was dimly lit and the decorations were pretty simple but it had a nice cozy feel to it with the exposed brick wall.  We went around 7:30 PM and were seated right away.I ordered the honey suckle rose cocktail, which was a mix of gin, sparkling rosé, lemon & honey.  I don't think my drink was mixed too well because I mostly just tasted gin.For the main course, I ordered the duck meatloaf which was SO DELICIOUS!!!  Everything about it was cooked to perfection, which is pretty hard with duck so I was surprised how well it turned out.  It was flavorful and juicy in all the right amounts.  My friend ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, which was served with cheddar waffles and a side of cabbage slaw.  The plate had 3 pretty big pieces of chicken but the maple syrup that came with it kind of tasted weird.  It had almost an Asian soy sauce taste to it so that was hard to get used to.  According to my friend, she preferred pop-eyes chicken to the chicken they served hahaFor dessert, we ordered the Doug's Pecan Pie Sundae and the Butterscotch Custard.  The sundae comes in two sizes, a small and a large (which is two small sundaes).  I had a bite and it was pretty good but I'm not personally a fan of ground up pecan but my friend liked it a lot. The custard was topped with light whip cream and came with two chocolate-dipped hazelnut shortbread pieces.  The texture of the custard reminded me of butterscotch pudding but a lighter version of it.Would like to come back to this place for brunch!",4.0
"What a lovely spot!I went here for dinner last night with the bff, it is definitely worth trekking from Queens. We were seated timely for our 7:30 reservation, and the dimly lit setting with candlelight at each table definitely made for a cozy atmosphere. We started with the mussels, definitely delicious! So delicious, I forgot to take a picture -_-I ordered the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, while the bff ordered the lamb shank over grits with a side of fries. I loved the chicken and waffles! The waffle tasted as if it had a bite to it..possibly like cornmeal? Not sure. Definitely worth a try! The lamb shank was great, falling off the bone, and the grits made for a perfect combination. The fries were delicious, a tad bit salty for my taste though. We finished off with the pecan pie sundae, super sweet for one person, I'd recommend splitting it!Lastly, the service was wonderful. I love the laid back, yet attentive type of service, so this was spot on. Go here please :)",4.0
"I don't think there's much I can add. I've been coming here since opening week. I've tried most dishes on the menu. The brunch is (as acclaimed by everyone) fabulous. The dinner scene is chill, kid friendly in the early hours. The staff is welcoming and friendly. Highly recommended.",4.0
"First off, I love the setting; cozyThe setting already had my stomach in a friendly mood,  I started with the winter salad--it was errr--I'm not a huge fan of kale  For my main course I had the chicken & waffles--definitely not enough waffles for the half of chicken they serve you!

"I came here with my cousin, grandmother and three year old for Sunday brunch. My grandmother and cousin got the Burger with fries.

I especially enjoyed the flaky biscuit underneath my poached eggs. My biggest complaint with this place was the service received by our waitress, ""Erin"". She was inattentive throughout our entire meal, she did not check on us to make sure we were ok. My cousin asked her for a recommendation between the Pecan Pie French Toast and the Burger and she looked too bothered by the question. She collected our plates with out asking if we were finished- my grandmother still had fries on hers. We basically had to flag her down when we needed something.

Have only been for dinner. Food was delicious. We split the burger and friend chicken on waffles. The burger was perfectly cooked and the chicken lived up to its legacy (although the waffles were a little dry and bland). Waiter was great. Atmosphere was OK. Make sure that it is not kids hour before you go if you don't want to be surrounded by tons of children for a nice meal.,4.0
"Went for brunch after seeing many ballyhooed reviews...Poached eggs were severely overdone. Iced coffee was garbage. Salad was salty.Overall everything we ended up eating was boring and just not good -- oh except for the hash browns. They managed to not mess those up. Our server was nice, however.It wasn't even just us. A diner at the table next to us even said she gives the place ""one star"" after eating the pancakes.I was excited to later check our their dinner menu and try more things, but I won't be going back anymore.",1.0

"I have been wanting to try this place since I moved to New York, but somehow never got around to it until last weekend. It was good and I enjoyed my experience, but it wasn't all I thought it would be. Perhaps that's because I had built it up too much in my mind.I had the spicy sausage scramble. It was a cute little dish that came with hash brown and toast. The hash brown was fast food style- a small round circle of fried potato. Not at all what I expected. The toast was a tiny brown crouton soaked in butter. I could only have a bite of each half. The rest was too hard to bite into.  My sister had the pancakes, and they were pretty good. They syrup was especially good.It's worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. The French toast looked amazing, the service is great, and the prices are reasonable.",3.0

Never heard of here until my bf brought me this past Saturday. Upon arrival I was greeted by a pretty professional host. You immediately realize the ambiance is a low lit dinner vibes (we went at 8pm).We had no wait time which was surprising but we went 2 hrs before closing so maybe that's why.  The crowd..immediately it was an obvious hippie crowd.Wasn't diversed at all. But we weren't discriminated or treated differently. It was wholesome and friendly. Food...their wasn't much options on the menu for my liking. It was very few. I went with the course 1(ribs and potatoes) it was REALLY good. I wish they had it as a regular sized meal. But this was more so a starter.  My bf had the buttermilk chicken and waffles(regular entree) which I dived into as well  and that had a different taste(unusual to me in a good way)but it was good as well. my overall view of this place was great I gave it 4 instead of 5 only because of the lack of diversity. But besides that it was a really good time. I would definitely go back.,4.0
"Maybe it's because the boyfriend and I didn't order the fried chicken and waffles, but we didn't find this place particularly AMAZING, but it wasn't bad either.

The two of us arrived on a Saturday morning for brunch right as it opened, and there were around 7-8 people already waiting for the place to open! First off: the atmosphere is really nice--laid back, and has a pristine, Southern farmhouse feel to it, and the staff is also very friendly. Now what you're all really here for is to get the scoop about the food...so I'll get to it!WHAT WE GOT:1. Side of Cheddar Waffles:Mmmm the cheddar is subtle but definitely there--perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. 2. Eggs Huntington:I thought it was good, but not great. Boyfriend wasn't a fan, as he thought it was barely warm.3. Heirloom Grains (I'm not sure if this is still on the menu anymore):This was soooo good. I loved this--perfectly soft boiled egg with the grains seasoned perfectly, wonderful taste of the mushrooms (not overcooked/mushy), with the asparagus, pea shoots, and green chickpeas--everything went well together. I dream about this dish.4. Side of hashbrowns:Yum! Crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked potato on the inside.Overall, we enjoyed eating here for a very laid back morning, but nothing really wow'd us (except for the heirloom grains on my end..but seeing as it's not on the online menu anymore...who knows.. :( ) I think if I were to go back here, I'd try the chicken and waffles, but now I don't really have a reason to go back.",3.0
"Oh dear Lord, the maple and bacon roasted almonds...I've died and gone to heaven.

I had a great experience here this afternoon! I came in with my boyfriend for brunch and we were immediately sat outside at a sunny table.

"We've been coming here since we moved to the neighborhood 8 years ago but don't go that often since it's still often too impossible to get into!  We are of the mindset that if we can get in with no wait, great!  If not, we go for plan B since we hate waiting and there are so many great restaurants in the 'hood.  However, I'm impressed that it still has all the hype after all these years.  The reason is because it's such a great experience--from the comfortable atmosphere, perfect servers and hosts--attentive and friendly without being intrusive, and the consistently excellent food.  I only docked a star because I sometimes wish the menu would vary a little more and sometimes the overall menu is a bit heavy for my taste...and a rare once in a while I think a specific dish is just ""good"" but not mind-blowing.  That being said, when I am in the mood, Buttermilk rarely disappoints and is more often than not, perfectly executed!   Last night we went for dinner and I had the burger for the first time in many years.  It was possibly the best burger I've had in the city.  It's definitely the best burger I've had in a long time.  Heirloom tomato, cheese, PERFECTLY cooked medium rare, juicy, flavorful...everything I want in a burger!  We also had the heirloom tomato salad with grilled peaches....wow, so good, my fiancé used his spoon to drain all the delicious tomato/peach juice from the bowl.  They had a special app, squid and cucumber, which were very subtle flavors so were overshadowed by the heirloom tomato salad.  In the past, we've had the chicken liver mousse with pickled grapes to start...omg...just so decadent, creamy, rich, delicious and the pickled grapes are a perfect complement.  Sometimes we'll get a couple raw oysters with the yummy grapefruit mignonette. My fiancé always (Always!! how boring!) gets the duck meatloaf.  Clearly he really loves it since he refuses to order anything else.  I haven't been for brunch in a long time but the few times I've been, I always get the Eggs Huntington, similar to an eggs benedict.  I LOVE a poached egg and these are always perfectly executed.

It only took a month to make reservations for brunch here! It was well worth it.  I had my mind set to try the pork chops and waffles. It was great however there needs to be a delicate hand in seasoning.  Between the breading on the pork chops and the cheddar cheese waffles it was a bit salty for me. I'm sure that's a case by case scenario.  The biscuit was also dry and dusted with flour (may be a preference). Overall the food was good and the service was nice.  The front desk lady went out of her walk to say goodbye and that really made us feel welcomed!,4.0

It only took a month to make reservations for brunch here! It was well worth it.  I had my mind set to try the pork chops and waffles. It was great however there needs to be a delicate hand in seasoning.  Between the breading on the pork chops and the cheddar cheese waffles it was a bit salty for me. I'm sure that's a case by case scenario.  The biscuit was also dry and dusted with flour (may be a preference). Overall the food was good and the service was nice.  The front desk lady went out of her walk to say goodbye and that really made us feel welcomed!,4.0
The food here is great it's unique. You can sit inside or outside be sure to make reservations. I came here with a group of four for brunch on my birthday and everything we ordered was great. I would definitely recommend and if you love pork the pork chops was great. It came with French toast I wanted instead pancakes but they both them out together. Still good food and good for indoor outdoor. The only downside is one bathroom unisex for both.,5.0
Great neighborhood restaurant. You can go with the kids or for a date night. Delicious food and friendly service.,4.0
"Hard to get a table. Out of the several times that I've been there, always ate at the bar. Bar is really wide and comfortable, so not a problem at all. Really love their brunch scramble bowls. Pork chop is ok. Fried chicken is good. Burger is great. Want to go back and try dinner.",4.0

"Easily a 4.0 and lived up to its name, Buttermilk! Their buttermilk biscuits and buttermilk pancakes are probably the best I have ever had. I had ordered the Eggs Huntington (aka Egg Benedict on a biscuit), and my boyfriend had ordered the Buttermilk Pancakes (comes with 3), with a side of two eggs and bacon. I too also bought a Pecan Sticky Bun to go.The food is of EXCELLENT VALUE and tastes great too.  The MUSIC is lively and soulful, just like I like it. My deductions to this place would be the following:1. They had skimped on salad greens in my Eggs Huntington. Who skimps on greens?2. A lot of their dishes I felt were missing the ""Trio"" that I normally look for when I eat brunch: Carbs, Protein, Greens. 3. I'm sorry ""Porkchop & Waffles"" sound more like a dinner item than ""Chicken & Waffles"". Chicken and Waffles should definitely be on your brunch menu, not dinner. 4.

We were told we would wait about 45 minutes which we did (we really did need to sit outside we had our pup with us). I ordered eggs huntington and my husband ordered the fried porkchop.

Wow!  This place was great!  The wait was a little long at around 1 hour.  They change their menu often so the pictures on YELP were not very relevant.  We ordered Bloody Marys for drinks.  They were fair but I would recommend the one from the one at Prime Meats(Bartender sucks there).  For food the selection was unique. I ordered the pork hash.  It was good but not amazing.  The best thing we had was the biscuit appetizer.  Perfect texture and taste.,4.0

"Have had the same dish, chicken and waffles, twice now. Both times were terrible. This was actually the worst fried chciken I have ever had.Chicken had a gross overly floury consistency. Skin was chewy, not crispy. Really disgusting texture and taste. Chicken pieces were small and did not justify the price. There were large pieces of pepper that seemed to be used to give the chicken some flavor, but resulted in a floury and peppery mess.

"If your in the neighborhood definitely a must try. Great menu, and you definitely will find your comfort food fix here. I loved the vibe of the staff they were great.

One draw back, be careful how late you sit outside - we saw a few furry creatures make an appearance. Otherwise 5 stars.",4.0
So average it's disappointing... No justification for long waits. Fried chicken lacked flavor.  Mashed potatoes were salty.,3.0
"The best thing about this place are the free samples they provide every morning vis-à-vis the sidewalk in front. Get there early enough (before 9AM) to enjoy leftovers of the food that was served at tables not 5 feet away the night before! On a warm summer morning you can smell the rotting juices of festering salmon or a creamy cheese sauce left out over night from a block away. Just the other day, I spotted at least a half dozen mussels, some of which hadn't even been stepped on yet. With a little effort you can probably put together the entire menu, albeit a more smoothie-like presentation, sans flavor...but it all ends up in the same place, right? My dog loves it too! bon appetit!",4.0
Wow!  This place was great!  The wait was a little long at around 1 hour.  They change their menu often so the pictures on YELP were not very relevant.  We ordered Bloody Marys for drinks.  They were fair but I would recommend the one from the one at Prime Meats(Bartender sucks there).  For food the selection was unique. I ordered the pork hash.  It was good but not amazing.  The best thing we had was the biscuit appetizer.  Perfect texture and taste.,4.0
"One of my favorite places to eat in Brooklyn, Farm to table. Fried Chicken and waffles are the best.  Comfortable ambience, Typical Brooklyn place you can either get dressed up or dressed down, that's how great Brooklyn restaurants do it.",5.0
"Have had the same dish, chicken and waffles, twice now. Both times were terrible. This was actually the worst fried chciken I have ever had.Chicken had a gross overly floury consistency. Skin was chewy, not crispy. Really disgusting texture and taste. Chicken pieces were small and did not justify the price. There were large pieces of pepper that seemed to be used to give the chicken some flavor, but resulted in a floury and peppery mess.

"Sure the wait is long, but so worth it for an amazing brunch. Put your name in and wait for the call at one of the nearby bars. The tables outside are also worth the wait for excellent people watching and are even dog friendly. The bloody Mary list here is great and each one is bloody awesome. The beer list is decent and has a few good craft brews but doesn't compare to some of the local bars. The food is delightful. The signature pork chop and cheddar waffle is a huge amount of food but so good. The sweet and savory flavors go so well together and everything is cooked just perfectly from the crispy crust on the chop to the chewy interior of the waffle. The grilled cheese was also great with tangy cheddar, savory salty bacon, and sweet apple sauce. And not even that pricey for a trendy brunch where you may see Jay Z and Beyonce.

"Dinner Review (5/5)Brooklyn is the way to go for food! I came to Buttermilk Channel to celebrate my 26th Birthday and they especially made it extra special for me. I hope you get Polly as your server as she was very delightful!Decor:I adore the brick wall as it brings so much class to the restaurant. The bar to the side had gorgeous drop down lights, which are very elegant. Polly sat us to the corner of the restaurant next to a window lighted with tea-light candles. This gave a very romantic feel for the place as well as giving us our privacy. As I walked through the doors, the staff greeted us as if we were on their VIP list. Food:1) They started us with fresh baked fluffy bread with a glaze of honey dressing which was fantastic!2) Next we had their chilled zucchini and basil soup with pumpernickel bread and their flat bread appetizer. The chilled soup was very refreshing as it was a hot summer day and the flat bread was full of flavor. 3) Moving on to the main entrees: We had an order of the Parley Hake and their Duck Meatloaf. Normally, I don't order duck because it's very fatty, but Buttermilk Channel knew exactly what they were doing. It had the right blend of flavor and the meat was very tender and juicy. Originally, my Hake (which is a fish) was undercooked. Without question, Polly sent it back to the kitchen and asked the chef to make me a new plate. Second time around, the dish came out perfect!4) Last but not least, the desserts were the highlight of my night. We originally ordered  just one pecan pie sundae that came with our pre-fix meal, but Polly was extremely nice and threw in another dessert on the house. We ordered the chocolate lava cake and it was very rich in flavor. I believe it was the store manager or owner that walked by our table and asked how was our night going. We chit-chated a little and I told her that I came out here from Queens to celebrate my Quarter Century +1 Birthday. She immediately asked Polly to send out another scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with a waffle and a small birthday candle on top.  I was extremely impressed with the service I received from Buttermilk Channel. This isn't your average All American Restaurant. If you want to enjoy a very romantic evening with a special someone for a reasonable price, definitely come by here. Also, stop by on Mondays as they have a 3 course meal for only $28. Please remember to tip your waitress generously and let them know their service was appreciated. Would love to come back for future cravings!Brunch Review (3/5)I'm still leaving a 5 star review because I think their dinner menu is AWESOME! However, I wasn't a huge fan of their brunch menu. They now sell pork chop with cheddar waffle instead of the typical chicken and waffles. The pork chop was somewhat bland and dry while the waffle wasn't as fluffy as I wanted it to be. Their Lox Platter was good though but nothing to write home about.",5.0
"This should really be a 4-4.5 stars for food. I've been here a few times for dinner, and the food is consistently really good; the oysters are fresh, and the fried chicken stands on its own. The service is also generally good. The reason for the downgrade on stars is the unprofessionalism of one of the bartenders. She was working behind the counter when I first got there, and her shift ended halfway through my meal. (I was seated at the bar.) Once she got all her stuff, she plopped down two seats next to me, got a glass of wine, and proceeded to talk negatively about other customers in the restaurant (who were still dining) with the blonde bartender behind the counter. To be fair, the blonde bartender didn't engage her or add on to the conversation.

Even though I knew I was about to eat a large pizza once my name was called for dinner #2 at Lucali, I couldn't help but order a lot of food here since everything was so good.It seems to be tough to get a table here unless you get here pretty early, but we were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar, where you can still order off the full menu.They brought us some hot, fresh, complimentary Popovers right when we sat down, so we were off to a very good start. I haven't seen a popover I haven't liked, and these were definitely up there with some of the best.For the entrees, given the name of the place and just about every reviewer mentioning it, we had to get the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($22). It's worth the hype here - the fried chicken is amazing, and the waffles and slaw they come with are perfect complements. We also got the Duck Meatloaf ($24), which was incredible as well. It was so soft and tender and also pretty buttery.And yes, don't judge me, but we got a huge dessert too before dinner #2 - we saw several people ordering Doug's Pecan Pie Sundae ($8), so I just couldn't pass up on it. This was an amazing dessert - you get some huge chunks of pie combined with some really good ice cream for a perfect end to a great meal.The atmosphere in here is really nice too. It's got a hip crowd at times, but then also when we went it seemed to be a lot of families with little kids. And I guess as a mix of both of those crowds, I heard Beyonce brought Blue Ivy here recently for brunch.I'll definitely be back here, possibly for brunch next time, and not before another meal, so I can really order a lot of food.",5.0
"Loved Buttermilk Channel. Food was amazing, drinks were even better (bloody mary + oyster!) I would definitely make the trek out here more, but the lines are usually crazy, which is really the only downside. Usually I'll go in here and it's like a 2 hour wait at peak, 1/2 hour at the least.",4.0

"I always have a great time at Buttermilk Channel.  I've been here for brunch several times and I'm never disappointed.  The menu is not super extensive but has a few sweet options and a few savory options- just enough to choose from that it's not overwhelming but you'll definitely find something that appeals to you.  I've had the grilled cheese, the salmon platter, and some of the scrambles.  All very good.  I'm usually not in the mood for something too sweet at brunch, but if that's your thing, the pecan pie French toast or the pancakes always look and smell like heaven.  I always question my meal choice when I see those entrees come out of the kitchen.  There are also jelly doughnuts on the menu, which I am looking forward to trying next time.  I was standing by the kitchen when an order of them came out & it smelt divine!  What's brunch without a Bloody Mary?   There is a Bloody Mary menu and they are all very tasty.  My favorite is the star if the sea, which comes with an oyster on top.  Yum.  There is outdoor seating available in the warmer weather.  There is typically a wait for a table during brunch, but the hostess will take your phone number and call you when you're table is ready so you're not stuck standing around.  My only complaint is it can get loud enough inside that it is difficult to carry on a conversation.  So if you're planning on doing some catching up with your dining companions maybe make a plan to hang somewhere quieter either before or after eating.",4.0
Well to make a long review short- My wife and I both had the Fried Chicken dinners; she had hers with mashed potatoes and I had mine with the waffle.  We shared a side of brussel sprouts.Brussels and potatoes both had way too much salt.  Not to the I cant eat it point but noticeably too salty--And I like salty dishes! The chicken on the other hand was not seasoned very well at all.  Portions were large but taste was bland and lacked any character-just a mouth full of crunch!I have had better fried chicken from supermarket hot tables..sorry Buttermilk get somebody to put some heart and soul into the chicken.Oh yeah it seems like everyone in the place had children and babies dining which caused a din of chatter and crying.,2.0
4 stars for the wait but 5 stars for everything else. My boyfriend & I came here on a Saturday afternoon. We were quickly greeted and told how long we would be waiting.

I even used the mussel shells to scoop up the sauce. The bread that was on top however, is every dentists' nightmare. Super hard. Watch out esp if you have anterior crowns. The chicken waffle is not worth the hype at all. I like the batter used but I was really expecting something... Unique. We actually wanted to grab Popeyes later if anything. Both chicken are good but for the price I can get a family meal ( complete different experience, I understand)The hubs got the duck meat loaf. He enjoyed it and it's true..

We came here on Sunday with a group of 8. We waited for 2 hours before getting  a table.  Luckily there was a coffee shop down the block.  The staff was friendly.  We order the fried  porkchop with waffles  it was really good.  We also orders a side of hash brown which was really fresh.  But the buttermilk  biscuit  was a little dry and hard to chew. The banana bread was really good. Fresh and warm.  The roasted almonds with bacon was good too.  Their bloody  mary  has a lot of seeds and horse radish.  We  didn't really like it because there was a lot seeds.  Price was fair.

"Great brunch spot. I've been for both brunch and dinner but the Brunch menu definitely stands apart from other places I've been. My husband always gets the Short Rib Hash, which is eggs with perfectly crisp short rib on top, and I get the Buttermilk pancakes, which are the perfect amount of fluffy every single time. The wait time is roughly 45-50 minutes each time I go on a Saturday or Sunday. Go in, put your name down, and stroll down court street until they're ready for you.

"Total let down. Here's why ... the service was awful. I walked in and it was a good ten minutes before anyone came to greet. A few waiters and the bartenders saw us standing there, but did nothing.

So I sat down with my girlfriend; We were given water and menus right away. But then it was a ridiculous amount of time before a waitress came to take our order. Can't complain about the service anymore. The food is delicious, really good in fact and it's a shame the service failed horribly on that night.",2.0

"Great service and very attentive. A relaxed but romantic atmosphere.BYOB w/ corkage fee ($25- No Corkage Fee Tuesdays!, Good to know for next time)Started with the Squash Tart which was on point. A very flaky tart/tartine with ricotta cheese, squash and topped with a brown butter vinaigrette salad. Followed by the beer-steamed mussels;  a great dish to share. Not salty at all, but very garlic-y, which makes the flavor.My gf had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (of course). Hands down one of the best fried chickens I've had. A not too thick-not too thin, just right fried coating with a juicy-meaty center. Its a large portion, enough to share. It's half a chicken!I had the Duck Meatloaf. I was skeptical from the photos I had seen, but it's a decent portion with bursts of flavor with every bite. If you're not a fan of duck pâté, then this may not be the dish for you.We ended the night with the Pecan Pie Sundae and my oh my was it worth it. It's a very heavy dessert, especially after the heavy meal it followed, but if you have some company to split it among, then it's a must-try.",4.0
"Having been to Buttermilk Channel for both brunch and dinner now over the course of two years, I have come to the concrete conclusion that it is a safe 5 star rating, worth checking out and worth revisiting. It's a dimly-lit, rustic, new American joint that has a very palpable soul of it's own. What I Love :- The food is genuinely, outrageously delicious. While the menu does change, time to time, it has it's staples.  For brunch, the Eggs Benedict are some of my favorite in town. The fried chicken and cheddar waffle (also available for dinner) up there on the list of my favorite fried chicken in Brooklyn. Their pancakes are also flawless. Regarding dinner:  Squash Tart was delicious (and is appropriately named Delicious Squash Tart on the menu, matter of fact) with the right texture of cheesiness, Slow Roasted St. Louis Ribs were 10/10 for texture and right amount of glaze to compliment the already soft falling off-the-bone-meat and no meal here is complete without some of their fantastic cornbread. Raspberry tart with whipped cream for dessert was fantastic. - The interior has a life of it's own. White brick with a few trinkets here and there.- Service has been friendly and knowledgeable, even when it gets busy and it gets BUSY. - Decent wine and draft beer options. Right up my alley, at least. If you're not drinking alcohol, which we did not last time we were here, the iced teas and non-alcoholic options are respectable and tasty as well. - In between appetizers and entrée, the food-runner came out with some light on-the-house pastry puffs which were absolutely delicious and always welcome! What a professional touch. What I Don't Love (But Will Not Remove A Star For Because It Doesn't Matter In The Grand Scheme of Things)- The only complaint is the often ludicrous wait that you have to endure here, as there are no reservations; not that I don't dislike the no reservations policy generally.  For brunch, it could be WELL over an hour (my limit is waiting an hour which we did and it was worth it). And for Friday or Saturday night, you're seriously gambling unless you have a legitimate back-up not too far away or you have a buttload of trailmix in your pocket. Once, after hearing that theres a two hour wait upon arriving, we had went over to try Old School Brooklyn down the street which was mediocre to just-OK with terribly unprofessional hosting that dampened the experience a bit. So after that, no more Buttermilk Channel during their peak hours. This place is worth your attention but just avoid weekends if you can help it to truly have a seamless, potentially wait-free experience.",5.0

I recommend doing the Monday special if it's your first time to kind of get an idea about the food.",4.0
"Great service and very attentive. A relaxed but romantic atmosphere.BYOB w/ corkage fee ($25- No Corkage Fee Tuesdays!, Good to know for next time)Started with the Squash Tart which was on point. A very flaky tart/tartine with ricotta cheese, squash and topped with a brown butter vinaigrette salad. Followed by the beer-steamed mussels;  a great dish to share. Not salty at all, but very garlic-y, which makes the flavor.My gf had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (of course). Hands down one of the best fried chickens I've had. A not too thick-not too thin, just right fried coating with a juicy-meaty center. Its a large portion, enough to share. It's half a chicken!I had the Duck Meatloaf. I was skeptical from the photos I had seen, but it's a decent portion with bursts of flavor with every bite. If you're not a fan of duck pâté, then this may not be the dish for you.We ended the night with the Pecan Pie Sundae and my oh my was it worth it. It's a very heavy dessert, especially after the heavy meal it followed, but if you have some company to split it among, then it's a must-try.",4.0
"Having been to Buttermilk Channel for both brunch and dinner now over the course of two years, I have come to the concrete conclusion that it is a safe 5 star rating, worth checking out and worth revisiting. It's a dimly-lit, rustic, new American joint that has a very palpable soul of it's own. What I Love :- The food is genuinely, outrageously delicious. While the menu does change, time to time, it has it's staples.  For brunch, the Eggs Benedict are some of my favorite in town. The fried chicken and cheddar waffle (also available for dinner) up there on the list of my favorite fried chicken in Brooklyn. Their pancakes are also flawless. Regarding dinner:  Squash Tart was delicious (and is appropriately named Delicious Squash Tart on the menu, matter of fact) with the right texture of cheesiness, Slow Roasted St. Louis Ribs were 10/10 for texture and right amount of glaze to compliment the already soft falling off-the-bone-meat and no meal here is complete without some of their fantastic cornbread. Raspberry tart with whipped cream for dessert was fantastic. - The interior has a life of it's own. White brick with a few trinkets here and there.- Service has been friendly and knowledgeable, even when it gets busy and it gets BUSY. - Decent wine and draft beer options. Right up my alley, at least. If you're not drinking alcohol, which we did not last time we were here, the iced teas and non-alcoholic options are respectable and tasty as well. - In between appetizers and entrée, the food-runner came out with some light on-the-house pastry puffs which were absolutely delicious and always welcome! What a professional touch. What I Don't Love (But Will Not Remove A Star For Because It Doesn't Matter In The Grand Scheme of Things)- The only complaint is the often ludicrous wait that you have to endure here, as there are no reservations; not that I don't dislike the no reservations policy generally.  For brunch, it could be WELL over an hour (my limit is waiting an hour which we did and it was worth it). And for Friday or Saturday night, you're seriously gambling unless you have a legitimate back-up not too far away or you have a buttload of trailmix in your pocket. Once, after hearing that theres a two hour wait upon arriving, we had went over to try Old School Brooklyn down the street which was mediocre to just-OK with terribly unprofessional hosting that dampened the experience a bit. So after that, no more Buttermilk Channel during their peak hours. This place is worth your attention but just avoid weekends if you can help it to truly have a seamless, potentially wait-free experience.",5.0

"I love the atmosphere of this place!  The menu is slightly limited but everything we had was delicious.  Our waitress was very honest about the menu and I loved that!  She told us the chicken and waffles was big enough for two and offered which appetizer was better than the other when we asked about two.  It's no use when waitresses claim EVERYTHING is amazing.  We tried a salad and soup from the seasonal menu.  The salad was pretty average but the soup was great!  (And I'm not a soup person...)  It was butternut squash and corn or something, so tasty!  We also had the mussels which were very good, but not the best I've ever had.  And with high expectations from the name of the restaurant, the chicken and waffles did not disappoint!  One small annoyance with this place came with making a reservation.  I used Open Table as I don't like calling places.  The place called me back and left a voicemail requesting me to confirm my reservation.  I had to call back four times over a few hours before someone answered, a voicemail / message system wasn't set up.  Making a res on Open Table was totally pointless.  The sole purpose of Open Table is make the reservation online rather than via phone.",4.0
"The fried chicken was delish! However I didn't care for the sauce which was maple syrup and what tasted like soy sauce....the waffles were amazing but I was a little disappointed that it was only 1/2 of a waffle.

Best fried chicken in Brooklyn.  The place is small and the waits can get long but it's really worth it.  If you get there closer to when they open you shouldn't have an issue but the waits for brunch can be insane!  Delish chicken and waffles and DOUGHnuts!,5.0

You have got to be kidding me!!!  Second, that SHORT RIB HASH! I can't even.  What was that!  Seriously, you have achieved perfection, Congratulations. Now if only you were open for dinner and served that short rib with some potatoes and veggies. holy cow.  My husband got the Benedict and also said that was the best he had ever had.  We are in withdrawal.  Please never close.

We were scarfing down our pancakes when she called my cell (this was a good 20 minutes into being seated) letting me know our table was ready. I gave her a friendly wave mid bite. Back to the pancakes.... They were the most perfect pancakes I have ever had. They were so perfect they will now ruin every other pancake I eat from this day forward that is not theirs. And the syrup..... it's by PoorFarm Farm and it is the best maple syrup around. Go Vermont!The rest of the food was also delish (pumpkin and sweet potato soup, apple+baco+NY Cheddar grilled cheese) but it was really all about the pancakes. And for those history buffs.

"MONDAY MONDAY MONDAY!youtube.com/watch?v=bxS9…You have a reason to be excited for Monday! Buttermilk Channel has a fantastic $28 dollar prix fixe menu on Mondays! It shouldn't be a long wait and if you are waiting, find a seat by the bar and order up some drinks! Great beer selection and they have some top notch cocktails. Once you sit down, you're in for a treat! Started off with a warm popover! Nice touch and great way to start our meal. Next I had the salad. Drizzled in walnuts and turnips, it was delicious. Another time I got a soup which hit the spot perfectly. Now here's where I am going to shock some people and it won't be very popular. When I come here now, I order the fish when I get the prix fixe. Yes, you read that right. No need to read it over like a Cormac McCarthy novel.I don't really care for their chicken and waffles. Sorry, I'm not sorry. I just don't. I do however find their fish to be phenomenal and if you ever see the flounder on the prix fixe menu, jump on that bad boy! Though I am dying to try some duck meatloaf! For desert, you got to go with the pecan pie sundae. Even if you don't care for pecans, it's worth it. Very rich and flavorful. Loved it all.So now you have something to look towards on Monday!",4.0

"I don't have one complaint about this place. I went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. We waited about 30 minutes for a table which was fine, ended up next door at the mexican restaurant and had a glass of sangria. For a busy Saturday afternoon, the staff was extremely pleasant, and professional. The restaurant was spic and span, including the one stall unisex bathroom! The hostess called me on my cell once our table was available, and sat my group of 4 in the front nook of the restaurant. We had the cutest sever (but you know me, I forgot his name)  brown hair, glasses, super sweet, super cute (yikes, that's my second time calling him cute :) . He gave us great recommendations... probably the reason we ordered 6 different brunch items from the menu. He said the best thing on the menu was the fried pork chop and waffle... and it was. I don't eat pork, but that chop was so crispy on the outside, and warm and juicy on the inside. I may have to permanently join the SWINE team. Oh, and it was huge!I ordered the burger, medium rare. There was a little confusion, so when the burger came out medium well, I was a little upset but it really wasn't a big deal, especially since we had so much food. But a guy standing by the door, who looked as if he was just waiting for someone, came over to our table, apologized for the well done burger and took it away. Another burger was brought out promptly, cooked medium rare to perfection. Thanks secret shopper guy. That was amazing, and great customer service! (They even comp'd the burger, which was a total surprise) I swear I love this place... it may be my next obsession! One last thing... they make great St. Germain margaritas... MY FAVORITE!

The best part of the meal was several hours later when my body finished digesting my dinner, and sent it packing down the Brooklyn-toilet-expressway  I was glad to be done with Buttermilk Channel, and hopefully though the wonderful world of sewers, maybe my poop will find it's way into the actual 'Buttermilk Channel'.* I, along with two other friends had the 'Buttermilk fried chicken w/ cheddar waffles'.  All three of our plates were overcooked, with dry chicken, and soggy waffles.  Rather than two large pieces of fried chicken, I received an assortment of miscellaneous pieces of fried chicken, and some fried buffalo wings (looking back, I wish I took a picture of this mess).   The ""chicken & waffles"" doesn't come close to Pies 'n' Thighs, or Amy Ruth's; and for $25, you'd think they'd at least know how to cook chicken and not serve soggy waffles.  Seriously?  WHO LIKES SOGGY WAFFLES?",1.0
"Delicious food.  Super trendy and glitterati packed.  The location is densely packed and because the food is amazing there's always quite a wait (and there's really no where to wait - hence the minus star... cause that's a little annoying, especially in the cold).  But once you're in and seated, the service is courteous and prompt; the food is magnificent and the atmosphere is pure New York - chatty and festive and alive.    I have to try this place on off peak hours one day when I have off :)",4.0

But I love pickles, coleslaw,  and salads w my meals. I didnt like their cornbread, a little too dry. Not bad if you live around here, but do make reservations.",3.0
"Very good. Went with the family for brunch, had the pork chop and waffle, awesome. Food took some time so they brought us complimentary muffins. We ordered like 4 more because they were incredible. Definitely recommended.",4.0
"I've come here for brunch many times. The food is always amazing the times I've been here.  In the winter, I love how they have warm cocktails for the season. The staff is awesome.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the wait can been wayyyyyyyyyy too long for seating(definitely good for business). Overall,  I would Definitely recommend.",4.0
Fried chicken was very good - hanger steak not so much. Service was excellent and the steak is the only reason I did not give five stars!,4.0
OMG! Oh my god! This place is delicious and fresh. This is definitely one of my favorite brunch places.,5.0
"One star simply because our waitress was nice... and negative four stars for the food.1. The food was awful.  Out of the SIX people at our table, only ONE enjoyed the meal, and only two people finished their meals.  2. Well, that's it.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was nice, but I can't eat the restaurant or the staff... so all I'm left with was terrible, overpriced food.3. The best part of the meal was several hours later when my body finished digesting my dinner, and sent it packing down the Brooklyn-toilet-expressway  I was glad to be done with Buttermilk Channel, and hopefully though the wonderful world of sewers, maybe my poop will find it's way into the actual 'Buttermilk Channel'.* I, along with two other friends had the 'Buttermilk fried chicken w/ cheddar waffles'.  All three of our plates were overcooked, with dry chicken, and soggy waffles.  Rather than two large pieces of fried chicken, I received an assortment of miscellaneous pieces of fried chicken, and some fried buffalo wings (looking back, I wish I took a picture of this mess).   The ""chicken & waffles"" doesn't come close to Pies 'n' Thighs, or Amy Ruth's; and for $25, you'd think they'd at least know how to cook chicken and not serve soggy waffles.  Seriously?  WHO LIKES SOGGY WAFFLES?",1.0
"Delicious food.  Super trendy and glitterati packed.  The location is densely packed and because the food is amazing there's always quite a wait (and there's really no where to wait - hence the minus star... cause that's a little annoying, especially in the cold).  But once you're in and seated, the service is courteous and prompt; the food is magnificent and the atmosphere is pure New York - chatty and festive and alive.    I have to try this place on off peak hours one day when I have off :)",4.0

"Hip atmosphere but under seasoned fare, especially their signature, Chicken & Waffles & Whipped Mashed Potatoes. The cheese-course is a good starter & thankfully, the Cornbread was moist & had the flavored Chipotle butter. For us, the saving grace is the knowledgeable & gracious bartender. Plenty of other places to lay down my money for less, that burst with top notch flavor! *A Lil salt goes a LONG way!",3.0
"I have been frequenting Buttermilk for a number years and never had a bad meal. However, this evening was the exception. The meal somehow got lost in the kitchen or there must be a new chef. As always, I began with the St Louis smoked ribs, which are generally delicious topped with a mustard sauce that is exceptional. This time around someone decided to experiment with a soupy concoction that was more like ribs in a soup. It was disgusting. In my attempt to right what was soon to become an awful meal, I ordered the baked sea bass. It was as bad as the St Louis Smoked Rib Soup. The fish was delivered in a plate of what looked like yellow sludge delivered from the Colorado River's toxic experience. It was horrible. Unless they change the chef, what was once a terrific restaurant will soon become known for that god times that were.It gets the BENT FORK AWARD",1.0

I love banana so it was an easy decision for me. it was worth the extra calories.I had the eggs huntington with a side of hash browns.

Went here for dinner this week for the first time.  It was delicious.  I cannot think of one bad thing about the place.  Excellent service...everyone was really friendly and inviting.  There were three in our party and we all enjoyed our meals.  It was a great time.  I got the kale salad to start and buttermilk fried chicken for my entree.  Normally I stay away from chicken because I think it is an easy meat to be cooked horribly and get dried out.  Of course this was the opposite (otherwise I would not be leaving this review).  The chicken was juicy and the waffles were excellent.  I love having breakfast for dinner so I was excited they were paired together.  I forgot to take pictures :-(  I am usually one of those annoying people who takes pictures of everything they eat.  FOR DESSERT YOU HAVE TO ORDER THE PECAN PIE SUNDAE.  I took the advice from other Yelpers and it was delicious.  I have probably only had one pecan pie in my life so I would have never ordered this on my own but I am glad I did.  It was out of this world.  Even if you are full from the dinner you need to order it.  Just have 1-2 bites and share the rest with the table.  Although you will find room to finish it.I saw on their website they have a special on Monday 3 courses for $30 which includes the pecan pie sundae...totally coming back next week!  Also on the website they have a whole menu with vegetarian options.  I want to bring my sister next time who is a vegetarian.  Most of the items are from the main menu but it is nice they have it separate.,5.0
"I had learned about this place from a friend that is familiar with this restaurant and it's neighborhood.  I went for Brunch and had ordered the fried pork chop with cheddar biscuits.    The pork chop was unbearably salty.   I'm the kind of person that loves well seasoned food and i can normally withstand salty foods probably more than the average American.  However, that pork chop was the saltiest pork chop i ever had in my life.  The one good thing about it was juicy and well fried but the overwelming amount of salt had killed the entire dish.  I had also ordered the Pecans french toast to-go and i also found it dry and lack of flavor.   This was my first time at this restaurant and perhaps this was an off day for them.  Since there are other competing restaurants in the area, i don't see myself returning to this one.",2.0

"Went to Buttermilk Channel for brunch yesterday and don't think I'll be making a return visit. While I can't say that Buttermilk Channel served me the worst breakfast I have ever eaten, I can say that it was damn close. It all started with the biscuits---they were a hard, doughy undercooked mess. I also ordered the short rib hash. The hash itself was good but the sunny-side up eggs were overcooked. The yolk didn't move and the whites were rubbery. It's not often that I have a sunny-side up egg but I'm fairly certain that they aren't supposed to resemble what I was served. Isn't the yolk supposed to be runny and not just sit there in a state of congealment? The tiny, dry toast corners didn't help matters either.

"First, they have a different menu for brunch. My husband and I went around three and were given the brunch menu. So we didn't get to try the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. So, instead my husband ended up ordering some fried pork dish with waffles. i don't know if it was the time and day, but they were lacking a lot of the items from the menu. We were told about the shortage as my husband's food came out. We were told they ran out of their waffle batter, so we got some pancakes instead. Again, this was told as they brought out our food. In addition, the substitution was made without our consent. I was surprised due to the fact they are known for their chicken and WAFFLES. How can they run out of the batter for what they are known? The pork dish was also lightly pink which isn't good when it comes to pork. We hoped for the best and still consumed it due to the long wait we had to endure to get our food in the first place. It was ironic how the table next to us, who had more people and ordered after we did, got their food first. We also tried ordering one of the doughnuts as dessert, but we were also told they only had one, exactly one, doughnut left. So, I got to have that one last doughnut.The service was mediocre. Our waitress seemed very miserable to be working there. She wasn't thrilled when we asked about some items on the menu nor when we tried to order dessert. Once we ordered our food our waitress was nonexistent. Also, we were told about the changes by someone else who brought our food out. The quickest service we got from her was when we asked her for the check.I really wanted to enjoy my meal at Buttermilk Channel, but it just wasn't meant to be I guess...",2.0

"My favorite brunch spot.  I usually order the pork chop and cheddar waffles and the pecan french toast. I travel all the way from Queens just for this.  Everything is actually really good on their brunch menu. To make a reservation, they said you need a minimum of five people and you usually have to book way ahead of time.  To walk in, I wait for about an hour which could be expected since this place is so popular.",4.0

Great food. Great service. Had about 30 minute wait but so worth it. The french toast was amazingggg,4.0
"First, they have a different menu for brunch. My husband and I went around three and were given the brunch menu. So we didn't get to try the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. So, instead my husband ended up ordering some fried pork dish with waffles. i don't know if it was the time and day, but they were lacking a lot of the items from the menu. We were told about the shortage as my husband's food came out. We were told they ran out of their waffle batter, so we got some pancakes instead. Again, this was told as they brought out our food. In addition, the substitution was made without our consent. I was surprised due to the fact they are known for their chicken and WAFFLES. How can they run out of the batter for what they are known? The pork dish was also lightly pink which isn't good when it comes to pork. We hoped for the best and still consumed it due to the long wait we had to endure to get our food in the first place. It was ironic how the table next to us, who had more people and ordered after we did, got their food first. We also tried ordering one of the doughnuts as dessert, but we were also told they only had one, exactly one, doughnut left. So, I got to have that one last doughnut.The service was mediocre. Our waitress seemed very miserable to be working there. She wasn't thrilled when we asked about some items on the menu nor when we tried to order dessert. Once we ordered our food our waitress was nonexistent. Also, we were told about the changes by someone else who brought our food out. The quickest service we got from her was when we asked her for the check.I really wanted to enjoy my meal at Buttermilk Channel, but it just wasn't meant to be I guess...",2.0
The food was AMAZING!!!! The service was great too. There was a long wait on a Sunday for brunch but well worth it. Try the fried pork chops!!! Yum,5.0
"Came here Saturday for brunch with the lady.Getting in:- Walked in and spotted 2 seats at the bar, sat down and avoided the very long waits.  Bar is first come first serveAtmosphere:- Nice place with outdoor and indoor seating- Nice bar seating area as well- Bright and fresh feeling- Only one bathroom, and a line does stack upService:- Very good - we were at the barFood:- Food was great- Side of buscuits was good, but next time I want to try the cheddar waffle- Lady got the roasted mushrooms/spinach/goat cheese scramble which was great- I got the short rib hash which was fantastic. I still think about it.  Very very good.Drinks:- Bloody mary was good and spicy coming with an oysterOther:- Lives up to the hype- Will be back soon!- Great place to take friends and make them impressed with Brooklyn",5.0
"Lovely dinner with a friend! We ordered the bacon, three cheese platter, flat iron steak and the signature fried chicken.  All delicious!  The maple balsamic glaze for the chicken with waffles was delicious as was the steak preparation.  Wait staff was kind, attentive and available when needed.  Lovely, warm interior design. Will definitely return!",5.0
"I have been here twice.Food: The fried pork chop and cheddar waffles didn't blow mind. I know...I know W-T-F?! The pork chop was soooo deep fried that the meat was dry. It was also overly salty for my liking. The cheddar waffles weren't as cheesy as I hoped they would be and also dry...it seemed like the overall dish was stale or sat in the kitchen for too long before it reached my table. I also had the pecan French toast...now this was delicious, if you have a sweet tooth and I do! My husband didn't feel the same about this dish as I did. The French toast has the sweet sauce, some kind of caramel maple syrupy sauce and nice chunks of pecans all over them and my plate. They also have whipped cream on the side. The French toast is also large portioned, it really is a meal by itself. Service: The waitress never made eye contact with us, which really diminished the appeal of the atmosphere. She never asked us if we liked the food. Also, at the end of the meal they give you a postcard to fill out with comments. I wanted to fill it out but she never gave us a pen and when she finally did to sign our receipt, she took away the post card...was that on purpose? I don't know.Atmosphere: typical hipstery brunch spot, very minimalist. It's a ""eat up and go-get out of here because we are so busy and exhausted"" type of atmosphere. I love food but I love service even more and this place doesn't have amazing food that I would be willing to sacrifice service. I will most likely not be back here.",3.0
"Monday night $28 three course prix fixe is worth way more than that in taste and portion. Cauliflower and leek soup was creamy and warm with brioche croutons and grilled cauliflower. Honey crisp apple and chicory was well dressed but a little small portion wise. We also ordered the chicken liver mousse that was served with grilled toast and grilled grapes which perfectly complimented each other. Sprinkle some salt that comes with to add flavor to the mousse. Hake was wonderfully cooked with delicious sauce. Buttermilk fried chicken was well seasoned and battered, slaw dressed well and went all together with waffle. Coffee pot de creme was good, but could of used more coffee flavor. Pecan pie sundae was also good but a little too sweet. Would return for brunch and regular dinner.",5.0

"Some dishes are better than others. Here is what we had:1. The short rib hash had great flavor and was the best dish we got. Although it was not ""hash"" as much as it was shredded short rib...one recommendation would be to order a hashbrown on the side. 2. The ABC grilled cheese was horrible....the smoky bacon was overpowering and not well cooked; the green apple was soft and unpleasant to bite through. This dish could really be improved by using non-smoky bacon and creating an apple spread instead of pieces of soft hot apple. 3. The Huntington Eggs (i.e., Eggs Benedict) were good, but the ham is very thin and the dish lacks flavor. 4.

"Southern-style comfort food has certainly become a really trendy thing in NYC, with chicken and waffles appearing on so many brunch menus across the city that you'd think the novelty had worn off.

"I came here for brunch on a sunny Saturday afternoon. We luckily didn't have to wait, despite going at 12:30 when everyone suddenly gets stricken by hunger. I ordered their eggs huntington which is a classic Benedict with a thinly sliced, cured ham instead of Canadian bacon and a biscuit instead of an English muffin. This was absolutely delicious. The hollandaise sauce was great and the eggs were poached to perfection where it's nice and gooey in the middle. Though the biscuit does a nice job of soaking up all the egg yolky goodness, I thought it was just a tad too heavy for me. I could have used a little more ham too- it left me wanting more. I tried some of the pancakes too and they were simple and fluffy. They didn't seem to offer any toppings, which I generally enjoy, but these were top notch simple pancakes. I ordered the banana walnut sticky bun and thought it was mediocre. It looks better than it tastes. A bit anticlimactic for me. We got a side of biscuits with jam and they finish the biscuits on a grill which left them slightly burnt on the outside. Our neighbors at the restaurant had the same problem too. However, the strawberry jam was quite good and I even put a little on the pancakes. This place is worth checking out and I'll be back to try their dinner menu too.",4.0

You honestly could do no wrong with any selection you made. My guest and I had the chicken and waffles and the sausage pasta. Both were excellent choices. Desert had that pecan pie sundae.

The biscuit is dense but flaky and perfectly mops up the sauce. The greens are dressed just right. The bacon is delicious. The French fries are addictive. The short rib hash is melt in your mouth with layers of yummy flavor. I love this place and clearly many others do as well. If you don't get here early enough for brunch you are in for up to an hour or more waits. We had no issue any time we've been here because we get in early before the rush.

I ordered the short rib hash which was average, my companions ordered the pork chop and waffles which they raved about. Coffee was good and they offer free refills. The service was where this place fell off, with a 90 minute wait for a table would have expected more attentiveness. Took awhile to place our order and waitress seemed apathetic to refills on drinks/coffee and clearing our plates. Worth one visit, wouldn't return as there are plenty of other good brunch places in the city.",3.0

"I came here on 7/22 for a special someone's 26th birthday. I'm glad I picked this place and I'm glad the restaurant made it extra special for her. This place has a very cute and very romantic feel to it. We sat in the corner of the restaurant. No one sat near us the entire time. It was nice they gave us privacy. Service was EXCELLENT!!! TOP NOTCH!!! Very friendly and great people to chat with. The food. Too much food you can say, but it was all good. FYI if you come on Mondays, they have 3 course meal for $28To start we had some baked bread with glazed honey. It was delicious. Next, we had chilled zucchini and basil soup. Very refreshing and plus I like soups. We also had flat bread, that was tasty. For our main courses, we had a duck meatloaf and hake. The duck meatloaf was delicious. It was very flavorful and tasty. The hake was undercooked at first, but it was sent back immediately and second hake came out perfectly and yummy. For dessert, too much dessert, but it was all so YUMMY!!!!! We had the pecan pie sundae...amazing. We also had the chocolate lava cake which was given to us on house. Wow, delicious!!!! Another dessert that was given on the house was a vanilla bean ice cream with a candle on top. Birthday girl said it was her birthday and the restaurant gave her the surprise. What an amazing romantic restaurant. Food was 5 stars!!! Service was 5 stars!!! Highly recommend this place. I'm glad the restaurant made it extra special for the birthday girl. Definitely bought a smile on her face and mine. Thank You, Buttermilk Channel!!!",5.0
"Decor: 4/5-very southern feel with the white walls, large windows and dim lighting-only one washroom so there might be a wait-there are tables that can accomodate 4 and one large table that appeared to accomodate a dozenService: 4/5-Fairly good overall, didn't have to request for water once and the dishes came out in timely intervalsFood: 3/5-Complimentary Honey Popovers were super fluffy and to my surprise tasted better than they looked. They were cooked to a golden brown then drizzled with honey. Eat bite I couldn't help but think that I'm eating an Eggo waffle-The cornbread ($4) by itself was decent but add the chile-lime butter and wow, I could eat only cornbread the whole dinner. Yummy!-The flatbread ($12) tasted just like its ingredients: buttermilk ricotta, flowery with a hint of lemon. I wish the bread was a bit more crispy though.-Buttermilk fried chicken ($22) had a peppered seasoned skin that was thick and crispy. The white meat was surprisingly not dry but not as juicy and tender as Bobwhite. Three pieces with waffles and coleslaw for $22 is a bit fancy. I suggest spending that much at Bobwhite instead. -Duck Meatloaf ($24) was my favorite of the night. Distinct duck taste with a perfect meatloaf consistency though I couldn't help but think that when divided into four quarters, each bite was $6.",3.0

"Buttermilk channel is definition of the perfect utopia.  I assumed that I would have felt uncomfortable there but this place is where you can go to disregard race for the time you are there. I walked in on a day during the heat wave and whilst I was settling down the bartender had placed a glass of water for me on the table, at this point I knew had fallen in love because I was hot as sweaty balls on a dog!What did I order:So since it was Monday, a 28 buck the course prix fixe menu was the special of the day. You honestly could do no wrong with any selection you made. My guest and I had the chicken and waffles and the sausage pasta. Both were excellent choices. Desert had that pecan pie sundae. OMG melts in your damn mouth. First bite had me hooked it's like I wasn't expecting it!Customer Service:Everyone who works here is very sweeet. I beleive this added even more to the decadence of the food. I would highly recommend this place to anyone! If you enjoy good food, comfort and a very hospitable environment!",5.0
"Delicious, reliable, old faithful. Can't go wrong with the Eggs Huntington, the poached eggs are perfectly runny, the hollandaise is thick, creamy and doesn't break. The biscuit is dense but flaky and perfectly mops up the sauce. The greens are dressed just right. The bacon is delicious. The French fries are addictive. The short rib hash is melt in your mouth with layers of yummy flavor. I love this place and clearly many others do as well. If you don't get here early enough for brunch you are in for up to an hour or more waits. We had no issue any time we've been here because we get in early before the rush. Best part- they give little ones crayons to draw on the table with & the coffee is nice and strong.",5.0

"Food is wow-delicious (try fried pork chop!!!) and the staff impeccable, but what impressed me most is the sense of ""customer service""...I mean, they know what they are doing.

"When I crave chicken.. There are 3 go-to places in NYC and Buttermilk Channel makes the best fried chicken outside Manhattan. It's the crispy crunch on the outside complimenting the soft, succulent meat once you bite into each piece. It is slightly under seasoned but nothing a dash of salt can't fix!

"First time doing brunch at buttermilk channel and i am so glad we did it! Mom, sis and myself arrived at buttermilk channel for brunch and were told that it would be an hour to an hour and 15 minute wait for a table. You give them your name and number and they text you to head back because your table is being set. That is an awesome set up! So we went a few doors down to mezcal's restaurant for a drink to kill time. Received the text and wad seated. Started with the banana walnut sticky bun which was delicious and a great way to start. Next came the pan fried pork chop with cheddar waffles and pecan pie french toast with a side of soft butter. The french toast was delicious but the pork chop and waffles were on another planet! So damn amazing. The buttermilk pancakes came out with a side housemade breakfast sausage that i ordered and both were awesome.

"Arrived at 950am on a Saturday morning and there was a good line started.  Metered street parking around were a plenty at this time.  Upon entering the establishment, it was a nice size with a plenty of tables, leaving scarce space to maneuver around.  There's only one bathroom and is very dim inside.  The menu was great as there were great choices for brunch.  We selected the jelly donut, homemade pickles, French toast dish, and the pork chop n waffles dish.  Everything was excellent as they were really big portions.  The pork chop was breaded and fried to perfection.  Moistness of the pork and the tastiness of the seasonings make it a great choice!  The French toast was amazing!  Soft on the inside.. Light crisp on the outside.. And sweet overall.  The pecans were a good addition for a nuttyness.  Overall, it was a great experience and would definitely return.  The food was great!  The atmosphere was inviting!  For those who enjoy eating brunch on the weekends, this is a great spot!",4.0
"Delicious!  Get the pecan French toast!  It was delicious!  Loved the texture and flavor!  I also had the short rib/hash dish.  It was good, but the meat was too oily for my taste - tasted almost fried.  I also didn't love the texture of the biscuit, though the flavor was good.  It was very crowded here - I came on a snowy Saturday, and there was an hour wait, though no wait for me because I sat at the bar.  I'd definitely come back.",4.0

"I had excitedly anticipated eating at Buttermilk Channel, but I was disappointed. The fried pork chops lacked flavor (how does that happen??) and the buttermilk biscuits were dry. I expected the buttermilk biscuits to be at least comparable to the biscuits offered at Two Little Red Hens, but they didn't even come close. The sausages weren't remarkable, and tasted like pre-made breakfast sausages from a bodega. I won't ever go back. Don't get me wrong, the food was edible, but I wouldn't recommend Buttermilk Channel as a destination. They need to work on producing food that's better than mediocre.",1.0

"I have been her plenty a times and always have great waiter service. Today for brunch, we sat at the bar because when we arrived around 2 we were told no more seating.

Otherwise, no complaints.",4.0
"Tried their fried chicken and waffles at Smorgasburg, and have to give them kudos for fantastically juicy chicken and soft, toothsome waffles.The skin of the fried chicken (usually the best part), however, was oddly ""crunchy"" and dry, rather than ""crispy"", lacking that usual ethereal texture that I have come to love and adore with fried chicken.  There also seemed to be a lack of seasoning in the particular batch I had, which made it the entire experience a bit difficult to redeem, regardless of how wonderfully juicy and tender the meat happened to be.Maybe that's just their style and I just happen to dance to a different drummer, or something about cooking their fried chicken outdoors under a tent.  But the end result is still the same, next time I'm at Smorgasburg, I'll be setting my sights elsewhere for my fix.",3.0

And 1 slice of toast-  could you spare another slice- cheap people. Wow. Never going back. Ever.",1.0
chicken and waffles every time I go there. The vibe is calm relaxed servers are patient and courteous. Two thumbs up lovely place.,4.0
"I had excitedly anticipated eating at Buttermilk Channel, but I was disappointed. The fried pork chops lacked flavor (how does that happen??) and the buttermilk biscuits were dry. I expected the buttermilk biscuits to be at least comparable to the biscuits offered at Two Little Red Hens, but they didn't even come close. The sausages weren't remarkable, and tasted like pre-made breakfast sausages from a bodega. I won't ever go back. Don't get me wrong, the food was edible, but I wouldn't recommend Buttermilk Channel as a destination. They need to work on producing food that's better than mediocre.",1.0
Totally enjoyed the burger.  Can't wait to go back for some of the other selections.,4.0
"I thought our meal was about perfect. When you consider its a Friday night 8:30 reservation for seven grown men out to celebrate.They sat us exactly on time!We were not cramped at all!The restaurant was cool and comfortable!The service was PERFECT! (& we are pretty non stop ordering drinks)The food was all very delicious!They were pretty much still pouring water in our glasses as we left!We were not rushed at all!Some food standouts were the Duck meatloaf, fried chicken, and ribs app.Keep in mind the entire time and even when we left it was packed. There was no drop off in service. We were all very impressed with everything and i cant wait to go back. Great job!",5.0
"I have been her plenty a times and always have great waiter service. Today for brunch, we sat at the bar because when we arrived around 2 we were told no more seating. The servers at the bar were truly delightful. They were in matching sweaters, not sure what their names were but they made the experience very pleasant and I forgot I was even sitting at a bar. Just wanted to note the kind experience by the bar! Food is always great! I gave 4 stars because if you say brunch is until 3 I feel people should still have a chance to sit down at 2pm. Otherwise, no complaints.",4.0
"Tried their fried chicken and waffles at Smorgasburg, and have to give them kudos for fantastically juicy chicken and soft, toothsome waffles.The skin of the fried chicken (usually the best part), however, was oddly ""crunchy"" and dry, rather than ""crispy"", lacking that usual ethereal texture that I have come to love and adore with fried chicken.  There also seemed to be a lack of seasoning in the particular batch I had, which made it the entire experience a bit difficult to redeem, regardless of how wonderfully juicy and tender the meat happened to be.Maybe that's just their style and I just happen to dance to a different drummer, or something about cooking their fried chicken outdoors under a tent.  But the end result is still the same, next time I'm at Smorgasburg, I'll be setting my sights elsewhere for my fix.",3.0
"This is possibly my shortest review ever. But, not much else needs to be said.  Delicious food.Refreshing drinks. Fantastic service.Awesome ambiance. Great for dates or family brunch. Worth the trip to Carroll Gardens. The pork chop & cheddar waffle was heavenly.",4.0
This is one of the best brunches I have ever had.  We had a few different things on the menu including the french toast which was very rich but out of this world.  Even the fresh squeezed orange juice was pretty amazing.  Great service also.  I would recommend going here to anyone.,5.0
"When I think of Buttermilk, I imagine a cute country cottage, which is exactly how it feels like when you walk in.  My friends had warned me that there's always a bit of a wait for brunch here, so we decided to get here by 10am.  We thought we'd be the only ones there thinking ahead by getting there right when it opens, because seriously, who really eats brunch at 10am when alcohol isn't served until noon?!  To our surprise, there were already a couple of groups of people outside waiting.  Luckily, they promptly opened the door at 10am, and seated everyone accordingly.  We opted for an outdoor seat since it wasn't too hot out.  Unfortunately for one of the tables, since their table was against the wall of the restaurant, they were directly below the windows of the apartments upstairs.  I think someone might've poured water or something outside their window, which landed all over the table's food!  The people who were sitting there explained the situation to their server and he kindly moved their table, and I assume they also got new plates of food.I ordered the Eggs Huntington and although it looked tiny, it surprisingly filled me up.  This might also have to do with the fact that my friends and I ordered ANOTHER entree, in addition to our individual ones, to share.  This, might I add, was the best decision ever that day! We ordered the Pecan Pie French Toast.  Now I don't usually like sweets for breakfast, but this french toast was unlike any french toast I've ever had.  The inside did not taste like bread at all, but it had more of a creamy custardy cake consistency.  That consistency mixed with the bourbon molasses was the perfect mix.  I wish all french toast tasted like this!! Although I've only been here once, if there was one thing I could get again, it'd definitely be this!",5.0
"Been here a couple of times for brunch so I feel comfortable writing a review. The food is amazing. Everything from the coffee to the service is dope. There are some drawbacks, however don't bother trying to get a table after 2, they won't even take your name. They also are one of the only restaurants in NYC that observe the no liquor before noon law on Sundays so that nixes that mimosas and Bloody Mary you were craving.

I'm Jamaican, so I'm not afraid of getting down to the bones, but my boyfriend typically doesn't. The chicken here, though, was so flavorful and so juicy that he was like a lion on a gazelle.I don't remember what we had for our first course and I THINK the second entree was the steak.

"Biked all the way here for a cute date Saturday brunch. Let me be frank here: food is okay (minus the fact that they don't know how to cook pork), but service ruined it for us. 1. Everyone here just gives zero fucks. It's not like they're trying to insult us. It's just that they're apathetic. Asked for hot sauce from 3 different people; one got back to us in 20 minutes. Waitress doesn't even say hi. 2. Slow service. we did sit outside but it took us about 10-15 mins to get any service,  including water. Damn, it's hot outside, it's summer, I'd like a glass of water please. 3. My boyfriend ordered pork chop and waffles. Half way through, I notice that his pork looks pink, looking like flesh. I call it out to a worker, which took a good 2-3 mins because they don't come outside to check on anyone. He got us a more manager looking guy, who doesn't even apologize and says ""sometimes a fatty part may look pink"". I grew up eating meat all my life. Are you trying to telling me that I can't tell the difference between raw meat and a pink fatty part? He takes the plate away to the kitchen and comes back 5 mins later. Again, no apologies, but just says ""yeah it's just a fatty part. Do you want another one?"" As if he expects us to say no. NO APOLOGIES. how the hell are you even a manager? As I am already done with the meal at this point, my boyfriend says ""no, I was almost done with it anyway."" Manager: ""ok cool."" Walking back in briskly. Excuse me? No sorry? No ""let me make that on the house""? Also, his plate never came back. There was clearly half of the plate already on there. Maybe they were afraid that we will take a picture of it and call them out? Check comes, fully charged for food that we didn't even eat half of, because they fucked it up. Way to ruin my only in-town Saturday brunch date. I couldn't give less fucks about this place. Sorry dudes, you picked the wrong people, too. My bf has a shit ton of journalist friends (think NYT and Buzzfeed and everything in between).",1.0
"Well, came here to sample the infamous fried chicken with cheddar waffles.  Unfortunately the food looks better than it tastes.The place is nice and cozy, clean and cute, not spectacular, but just a nice atmosphere. As for the food I was a bit disappointed. I just don't see what the big deal is. The fried chicken is OK at best and the cheddar waffles (which you only get two by the way), was again, OK. The chicken portion was considerable however there should be four waffles instead of the two served. Food was not spectacular as everyone hypes it up to be. Coleslaw was good (although I'm not a coleslaw fan) I could eat the coleslaw that's how I know its  good. I have definitely had better fried chicken and waffles. Anyone looking for a better chicken and waffles spot can try milk River in Brooklyn and Soco in Brooklyn as well. Maybe this place is the best chicken and waffle spot in Gowanus/Park slope but definitely not all of Brooklyn.  Not comparable at all.",2.0

The Bellini and mimosas were good. My birthday boo had the Eggs Huntington. Very very good. Our first time having eggs in that manner.  Coffee was good.

"Beyonce and Jay-Z frequent this restaurant.  Given my obsession with Beyonce and my ex-boyfriend's similar obsession with Jay-Z (we once called ourselves the ""Law School Bey and Jay""), I've been to Buttermilk Channel a few times to ensure that my impression and review aren't tainted by my fandom.Well... it delivers.  I've been to Buttermilk Channel a few times for Sunday brunch.  There is ALWAYS a wait and the restaurant is ALWAYS packed.  Even still, each time the hostess has been very courteous -- not at all the type to make you feel insignificant and desparate because you're one of fifty names on a list.  Luckily, I've never had to wait longer than 25 minutes, but believe me, I'd wait whatever time is needed.For brunch, I've had the Pancakes, Short Ribs Hash, and Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon, and the Turkey Sausage.  The Pancakes are simply amazing -- moist, buttery and fluffy-- and the accompanying syrup is a nicely balanced sweet, not too overwhelming.  The Short Ribs Hash is the best thing ever.  Like seriously, whose idea was this?!  BRILLIANT.  Yea, so, well seasoned, nicely cooked, tiny chunks of beef, mixed with tiny home fries.  I order my eggs scrambled rather than sunnyside up and it's just perfection.  I highly recommend this entree.  My least favorite part of the brunch is the Eggs Benedict.  It's a traditional eggs benedit, with smoked salmon and the distinguishing characteristic is that its served atop a biscuit.  Eh, it doesn't add much for me.  It's solid, but definitely not a showstopper.  I definitely have to go to Buttermilk Channel for dinner.",4.0
"Retroactive reviewI came here last spring after reading all the rave reviews about this place so I HAD TO TRY IT! The brunch wait was pretty typical for a popular restaurant, about 40 minutes. Since it's located in Carroll Gardens, you can put your name down and then walk around for awhile. It's a nice neighborhood to just browse around until your name is called (just make sure you get back in time!)During the spring, summer and nice fall days they offer outdoor seating which is where I sat. The inside was crowded with people. We ordered the Fried Pork Chop and Cheddar Waffles and Eggs Huntington. The pork chop was AMAZZZING! It was soft, easily chewable and juuu--ooo--cy! The maple syrup on the waffles mixed with the pork chop too so the sweetness combined with the tender meat was oh so GOOOOOOD. As for the Eggs Huntington, they looked very similar to an eggs benedict. I didn't get much of a taste of it, but from the bite I had, it was pretty much your typical eggs benedict. It was a poached egg that sat on 2 biscuits and when the egg is poached all of the yolk dribbles onto the biscuits which makes the biscuits that much better! I really liked the atmosphere as everyone was very chatty there and there was constantly a wait so YOU KNOW THIS PLACE IS DAMN GOOD!",4.0

"Went this morning with my husband, my 19 months old baby and the 2 months old newest addition to the family, we were there for opening and even though there was already a small line waiting, we managed to be sitted very comfortably, it's not cramped up at all unlike lots of brunch spots in Brooklyn.. The place is nice, the service very friendly and welcoming but I have to say that the food didn't blow my mind.. I had short rib hash and it was way too salted,  my husband had the pancakes and thought they were good, average good, but he also had the pecan pie french toast and said it was amaaazing.. Not sure we would go back, definitely not if we had to wait in line or if the place and staff weren't that nice",3.0
"We made reservations for this place because it was a pretty small to moderate sized restaurant. Staff was very friendly. It wasn't too loud at all in the resturant. The lighting and atmosphere was super chill.I started off with the Maple and Bacon Roasted Almonds which were super delicious. For Dinner I had the Duck Meatloaf, which was hella good and I would highly recommend it. For dessert i ha the pecan pie sundae. That was the bomb.com. I reached over and tried my gfs chicken and waffle plate, that was super awesome as well. I would most definately come back to this place. I want to try their brunch menu =)",5.0
"Biked all the way here for a cute date Saturday brunch. Let me be frank here: food is okay (minus the fact that they don't know how to cook pork), but service ruined it for us. 1. Everyone here just gives zero fucks. It's not like they're trying to insult us. It's just that they're apathetic. Asked for hot sauce from 3 different people; one got back to us in 20 minutes. Waitress doesn't even say hi. 2. Slow service. we did sit outside but it took us about 10-15 mins to get any service,  including water. Damn, it's hot outside, it's summer, I'd like a glass of water please. 3. My boyfriend ordered pork chop and waffles. Half way through, I notice that his pork looks pink, looking like flesh. I call it out to a worker, which took a good 2-3 mins because they don't come outside to check on anyone. He got us a more manager looking guy, who doesn't even apologize and says ""sometimes a fatty part may look pink"". I grew up eating meat all my life. Are you trying to telling me that I can't tell the difference between raw meat and a pink fatty part? He takes the plate away to the kitchen and comes back 5 mins later. Again, no apologies, but just says ""yeah it's just a fatty part. Do you want another one?"" As if he expects us to say no. NO APOLOGIES. how the hell are you even a manager? As I am already done with the meal at this point, my boyfriend says ""no, I was almost done with it anyway."" Manager: ""ok cool."" Walking back in briskly. Excuse me? No sorry? No ""let me make that on the house""? Also, his plate never came back. There was clearly half of the plate already on there. Maybe they were afraid that we will take a picture of it and call them out? Check comes, fully charged for food that we didn't even eat half of, because they fucked it up. Way to ruin my only in-town Saturday brunch date. I couldn't give less fucks about this place. Sorry dudes, you picked the wrong people, too. My bf has a shit ton of journalist friends (think NYT and Buzzfeed and everything in between).",1.0
"Well, came here to sample the infamous fried chicken with cheddar waffles.  Unfortunately the food looks better than it tastes.The place is nice and cozy, clean and cute, not spectacular, but just a nice atmosphere. As for the food I was a bit disappointed. I just don't see what the big deal is. The fried chicken is OK at best and the cheddar waffles (which you only get two by the way), was again, OK. The chicken portion was considerable however there should be four waffles instead of the two served. Food was not spectacular as everyone hypes it up to be. Coleslaw was good (although I'm not a coleslaw fan) I could eat the coleslaw that's how I know its  good. I have definitely had better fried chicken and waffles. Anyone looking for a better chicken and waffles spot can try milk River in Brooklyn and Soco in Brooklyn as well. Maybe this place is the best chicken and waffle spot in Gowanus/Park slope but definitely not all of Brooklyn.  Not comparable at all.",2.0
Buttermilk Channel is excellent.. in a quiet part of town... The chicken and waffles are to die for and so is the pecan pie Sundae.. nice place to go relax!!!!,5.0
"I came back to this place after missing brunch one week.  The customer device is good. But the wait on a Sat afternoon is kinda long. So get here early. But our waitress, Jillian, was excellent!  She was attentive and available to answer questions.I had the pecan pie French toast. OMG! So good! Sweet greatness! It was like cake for breakfast. The Bellini and mimosas were good. My birthday boo had the Eggs Huntington. Very very good. Our first time having eggs in that manner.  Coffee was good. And we even got a free jelly donut cuz the kitchen was backed up! Overall, the customer service was good and food was good. Only downside is wait time. But it is worth it.",4.0
"I've been here several times for brunch on the weekends and usually order the pecan pie french toast. So good! My boyfriend likes the pork chop and cheddar waffles, but I think it's a little dry/tough (disappointing given that this is one of the restaurant's most popular dishes). Tends to be super crowded, so be prepared to wait.",4.0
"Beyonce and Jay-Z frequent this restaurant.  Given my obsession with Beyonce and my ex-boyfriend's similar obsession with Jay-Z (we once called ourselves the ""Law School Bey and Jay""), I've been to Buttermilk Channel a few times to ensure that my impression and review aren't tainted by my fandom.Well... it delivers.  I've been to Buttermilk Channel a few times for Sunday brunch.  There is ALWAYS a wait and the restaurant is ALWAYS packed.  Even still, each time the hostess has been very courteous -- not at all the type to make you feel insignificant and desparate because you're one of fifty names on a list.  Luckily, I've never had to wait longer than 25 minutes, but believe me, I'd wait whatever time is needed.For brunch, I've had the Pancakes, Short Ribs Hash, and Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon, and the Turkey Sausage.  The Pancakes are simply amazing -- moist, buttery and fluffy-- and the accompanying syrup is a nicely balanced sweet, not too overwhelming.  The Short Ribs Hash is the best thing ever.  Like seriously, whose idea was this?!  BRILLIANT.  Yea, so, well seasoned, nicely cooked, tiny chunks of beef, mixed with tiny home fries.  I order my eggs scrambled rather than sunnyside up and it's just perfection.  I highly recommend this entree.  My least favorite part of the brunch is the Eggs Benedict.  It's a traditional eggs benedit, with smoked salmon and the distinguishing characteristic is that its served atop a biscuit.  Eh, it doesn't add much for me.  It's solid, but definitely not a showstopper.  I definitely have to go to Buttermilk Channel for dinner.",4.0
"Retroactive reviewI came here last spring after reading all the rave reviews about this place so I HAD TO TRY IT! The brunch wait was pretty typical for a popular restaurant, about 40 minutes. Since it's located in Carroll Gardens, you can put your name down and then walk around for awhile. It's a nice neighborhood to just browse around until your name is called (just make sure you get back in time!)During the spring, summer and nice fall days they offer outdoor seating which is where I sat. The inside was crowded with people. We ordered the Fried Pork Chop and Cheddar Waffles and Eggs Huntington. The pork chop was AMAZZZING! It was soft, easily chewable and juuu--ooo--cy! The maple syrup on the waffles mixed with the pork chop too so the sweetness combined with the tender meat was oh so GOOOOOOD.

"Went here for brunch with a couple of friends. Wait was about 30 minutes and we were seated by 2pm, so not bad.We tried the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles, the buttermilk pancakes and the buttermilk biscuits. Fried pork chops were meh. I much prefer fried chicken with my waffles as that pork chop was a little tough and lacking some flavor. Buttermilk pancakes were delicious and nice and thin. My friend said it was the best pancakes he ever had. The biscuits (it comes as 2) were also good; however, I am a sucker for buttermilk biscuits so I may be biased. All in all, a good brunch option in a nice neighborhood.",4.0

"I've always wanted to try this...This little intimate restaurant is warm and inviting but the music is terrible. Perhaps because I wasn't here with a boo on V-Day. Still please play something a little less cheesy! Those feelings aside the dim lighting can cause waitresses to almost spill the water (close!) but can put you at ease. The bartender makes a good drink. I loved my Il Diavolo with tequila (yeaaa) bitters, cherry, and it was garnished with a pine leaf.They first served a toasted airy bread that was almost like a croissant but shaped like brioche. I wasn't sure but it was slighty crispy and filled with air in the middle. The appetizers offered included roasted chestnut soup which was creamy and excellent. The foie gras is actually not the best I've had but they intermix it with ham and I just don't like ham that much. The buttermilk fried chicken is key. That is what you come here for. Its extra crispy, juicy, not greasy like the chains and comes with syrup and a waffle (prix fixe on V-Day). The Duck meatloaf which is topped with foie gras and served on a bed of brussel sprout leaves is awesome. The risotto and chestnut ravioli with black truffle wasn't as flavorful as I expected (where was the truffle flavor that I love so much??) but it was good and I ate it all up anyway.Their pecan pie sundae is awesome. Just simply delicious. The coffee creme sucks though. Its really just a whipped coffee flavored thing that is airy but bland in my sweet tooth's opinion.Overall a place to return for fried chicken. I'm coming on a Monday night for their $25 prix fixe.",4.0

They were like muffin shaped puff pastry glazed in a sweet sauce baked so that it was crispy yet chewy. I'm now in love with it. Cornbread, however, was not impressive and a bit dry. I just prefer mine moist with more flavor. The acorn tart was surprisingly good - flaky crust topped with cheese and greens.

Then this place is for you. We showed up at 11, meal was finished at 3. Just not cool.Negativity aside... the food is great. Pancakes are amazing, it's really hard to compare them to other buttermilk pancakes... anywhere. The hamburger was also really good. Appetizers, which you'll want to order after waiting for so damn long, are delicious.In the end, it's very hard to weigh the waiting and salivating in anger with the great food.

"For a Brooklyn restaurant to have over 600 mostly stellar reviews is some impressive feat, no doubt.  Buttermilk Channel is one of those few Brooklyn reaturants that has achived this.  And with that said, I now say the following five words: I just don't get it.I won't be as pretentions as to say ""this place is"", but rather ""I found this place to be"".  I found this place to be so overrated.  My disappoinment raneth over after eating here.  Everything was just so, well, meh.I'll give the place 4 stars for ambiance and service.  That I cannot take away from this place.  It's beautful inside, boasts a nice crowd, and the staff are extremely attentive.  But the food just disappointed, big time.First off, if you're going to do Chicken and Waffles, you've got to do it right.  I know my Chicken and Waffles.  I live in Harlem and eat it all the time, plus I've spent lots of time in the South eating the real deal, as well. Buttermilk Channel's Chicken and Waffels tasted more like something they just shouldn't have tried to make.  I also had the steak.  Cooked medium.  It was like rubber, and not any flavor to at least make up for the rubber feel.  Just so disappointing.  The bone marrow sauce seemed rather gimmicky too.  It did not have the best flavor, and it was a pain to get to.  I had to dig into the bone to get it.  Another thing that bothered me was the Sangiovese wine.  It was as cold as ice.  When I asked the waiter why, he responded because it's wine on tap.  Wine on tap?  Dear Lord, I'm not even going to start on that one.  Just all wrong.  Red wine should not be served cold, and not from a tap (lest samples be served like in some wine stores).I've been waiting years to go to this reaturant, and once I finally did, I was really so sad that it disappointment me this way.  I think it's fair to say I won't be back.  I would say, to be fair to the restaurant, that my review goes well against the grain of so many other great reviews.  But frankly, again, I just don't get it.  I have the feeling this place's ambiance may trick people in believeing the food is better than it really is.",2.0

My dinner partner and I both ordered the lobster special of the evening (Maine lobster via red hook lobster pound) I got mine served over squid ink linguine while my gluten free dinner date got the grapefruit sauce that came with and some sauteed mushrooms on the side.  The dish was delicious, the grapefruit sauce was spot on with the squid ink linguine.Finished our night with their pecan pie sundae.  Fantabulous.Very memorable meal, will defintely be back.",4.0
"We went on a Sunday, waited for an hour and twenty minutes and sat down to another amazing brunch. This time around - my mom ordered the French toast.

"Brunch at Buttermilk Channel was as good as I was expecting.  We were quoted a forty minute wait but probably only waited about twenty minutes. I had heard that Buttermilk Channel made the best bloody marys in the borough, and I was very pleased with the classic, which was spicy and strong as promised (I've found that other places get away with skimping on the vodka, but that was definitely not the case here).I ordered the scramble with Esposito's Hot Sausage, peppers, and onions, which was fluffy and tasty and served with two slices of fresh toast, a golden brown, super tasty deep fried hash brown, and heaps of a lightly dressed mixed greens salad. We also split a side order of the cheddar waffle for the table, and it was truly an epiphanic culinary experience--perfectly browned, rich, with a good balance of savory and sweet.Minus one star because service was very slow, and it was quite difficult to get water refills.  There were also some pesky flies buzzing about the dining room, which interfered with my enjoyment of the meal and caused me to wonder if there were also some in the kitchen.

"I was so excited to try this place out. I went originally a few weeks ago around 11:30, I believe, and was told the wait was about 45 minutes to an hour for 2 people. Both I and my friend were starving so that was not an option. A few weeks later I was determined to be there early, because I was sure the wait was due to the unseasonably warm day during the winter.  Boy was I wrong.  The place opens at 10 and and I arrived at 10:30 to a 30 to 45 minute wait, and yes it was the tail end of that window that I received a call saying a table was now available. I was really looking forward to trying the cheddar waffles and was in the mood for scrambled eggs and hash browns. I ordered the scrambled eggs and asked for a substitution of the waffle for the toast. My food came out pretty quickly but to my dismay it was not all I had hoped. The potions were tiny. Thank God I went to a cafe down the block before hand and had hot chocolate and a muffin during my 45 minute wait otherwise I would have been starving. Now let's talk about that food. So my waffle substitution was a quarter of a waffle.  I repeat a QUARTER of the waffle instead of toast, which was a dry as the Sahara. The fact that the syrup never made it to the table didn't help. The hash browns were actually a hash brown (singular) that was guaranteed to raise your blood pressure because it was so salty. I also ordered an apple juice which was 3 bucks but practically came in a shot glass. This meal was SO not worth the wait or anticipation. Our server was not memorable at all. I think due to all the hype about this place everyone just focuses on getting people in and out as soon as possible. They weren't rude but the atmosphere was not welcoming in this place. I can't envision having one of 3 hour brunch dates in this place.Will certainly not go back again.",2.0

I liked the breading, but there was something off about the chicken that I could not put my finger on... the cheese waffle was okay, tasting the cheddar more from the smell than the amount of cheese in it.For dessert the bread pudding was very good, a nice spongy almost Belgian gauffre-y texture to the cake and smothered in a creamy caramel with a spoonful of whipped cream.The dark and stormy had no lime juice in it and the ratio of rum:ginger beer was a little off, but once the ice melted a bit it took the edge off and was pretty good.

"Great value for brunch. We came Saturday afternoon around 1, waited 30 minutes before we were seated at the bar (we were quoted 45 for a table).

We were hoping ordering three entrees would get us an extra drink, as it did for the people next to us, but the butternut squash soup definitely was a dainty appetizer size.French toast was the highlight of our brunch. I loved that the molasses sauce was on the side: the toast itself is quite sweet and decadent, so it was nice to pair the two at your own discretion.

"The brunch food at Buttermilk Channel is quite possibly the best in the area, but you may find the wait slightly off-putting.The first part of Buttermilk Channel you'll likely sample is the wait.

In fact, if you're not from New York, it serves as quite an eye-opener as to how long locals are prepared to wait for their favourite tucker: up to an hour in Buttermilk Channel's case. In my case, only a bout of power-walking from my friend and I to get there for 10:30 kept the wait down to a mere 30 minutes.Once finally inside, you'll be greeted by the sight of well-groomed and rather contented locals from Cobble Hill. I can well believe that celebrities have been spotted here.The food goes some way towards meeting the hype, if not in my opinion all the way there. The stack of pancakes I helped myself to was probably the largest artfully arranged such stack I laid my eyes on, with delicate dustings of icing sugar and of pleasingly rough, hand-made shape. Very tasty they were too. I also had the much recommended fried pork chop, which was okay, if not really much more than its description: rather like a pork schnitzel but with the added inconvenience of bone and gristle to deal with. Still, it pleased me, as did the orange juice. The biscuits, however, were better at Prime Meats though.The service is okay: Quick, polite, but they made a slight (quickly rectified) error with one of our orders.Overall, a pleasant experience.

I shared the fried bone-in pork chop - a generous size, breaded, and perfectly cooked, atop a crispy cheddar cormeal waffle and a pecan crusted french toast with a nice caramel syrup with a hint of bourbon (?).  It was the perfect meal for a blustery wintery day.   I also got the bloody mary topped with a freshly-shucked oyster. It was a bit too overpowering on the spices, but so very good.Service was a bit sluggish - but the waiter came around with a freshly-made gratis strawberry jelly doughnut, so that more than made up for it.If i didn't need to lose my last 5 pounds, I'd be here every week.",5.0
"Went here for brunch on a Saturday, it was veryyy busy and I know why! Their brunch is delish! Waited only about 10-15 minutes to be seated which was great because the place was very packed. For my early morning alcoholic beverage, I ordered ""The Classic"" Bloody Mary which was very spicy, the way I like pretty much everything! For my meal I had the Eggs Huntington, which I assume is Eggs Benedict's cousin from the south; poached eggs, with sliced thin country ham on a buttermilk biscuit, drizzled on hollandaise sauce with a side of smoked bacon... oh heavens! It was sooo good! Especially the bacon, because its bacon. Needless to say, just go and eat here because everything sounds good and tastes good and the prices are decent and you won't be sorry!",4.0

One of my first dining experiences in Brooklyn and I loved it. It was a Wednesday night and the restaurant was very busy so make sure you have a reservation. The fried chicken was a great entree with a sizeable portion that is perfect to share. The house made pickles were excellent as well. A great spot for a date or meeting a good friend.,4.0

I've been meaning to write this review for a while.My partner and I came here for our anniversary in January of 2013.  We had excellent wonderful food.  Truly a pleasure.Probably around 9 months later we were in the neighborhood and decided to treat ourselves to an early dinner.  We were seated promptly in what seemed to be an empty dining room.  Ten minutes late three adults came in with about EIGHT children under the age of seven.  Our lovely table was  right next to all of these screaming kids.  It caused us to rush out without really even finishing our meal because the noise was so obnoxious.  In hindsight we wished the hostess would have given us options (we could have sat at he bar and been totally happy) rather than next to loud and over-entitled children.  We weren't even warned that a large party was coming in.We'll probably not be back.  Bummer. Even the delicious fried chicken can't make up for the potential of a Chuck E. Buttermilk Channel experience.,2.0
"The best time to get into this place is after 9pm the beginning of the week. We went on a Monday night at about 8:30pm as I stood waiting for the hostess to get her butt to the front, several people walked in after me. As the hostess emerged she proceeded to cater to the folks that walked in after. I guess she thought I was just standing there for the goodness of my damn health. So I got a little snarky and ask her if she is going to continue to ignore me, she apologized quickly and said she could seat me immediately. I asked to be seated at the bar. I was still a little miffed about that situation.  So, as I am positioning myself on the bar stool I overheard this transplant chick saying to the 50's throwback bartender, ""she had such attitude about not being seated first, only to sit at the bar"".  That left a bad taste in my mouth and I needed to calm myself because the good lord only knows that I would have gone very BROOKLYN on that transplant a$$.Anyway, and I digress. After I calmed down a bit.  We ordered the mussels, fried chicken and waffles, both were pretty amazing. I really enjoyed the popovers, they are a bit funny looking, however, very tasty. I am  excited to back for brunch. Hopefully, my experience the second time around will be awesome as I do not wish to go Brooklyn on anyone. :-)Go and have a good ole time a the spot that Jay-Z and Ms. Beyonce made famous.",4.0

"For her birthday, my girlfriend was weighing here options, and ultimately settled on here.  Why may you ask?  A location (relatively) near Prospect Park, it being in Carroll Gardens, and having some of the best fried chicken in the city.  I'd heard of Buttermilk Channel before, and after placing that I'd read about it on Chowhound and elsewhere, I quickly seconded this.  We came at 6pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately.  The place had 6-8 other tables, but wasn't even half full.  This didn't last for long, as it was absolutely packed by the time I left with people from all walks of life: families, older people, young couples, etc.  The service was spotty at times but our actual waitress was very good.  The beer list is decent as is the cocktail list.  I paired a Brooklyn Sorachi Ace with my steak, and I got a funny-named cocktail (something about an older woman) that had scotch, rye, an orange liquer, and a herbal liquer in it.  It was really good, but a bit pricey at $12 for a tiny glass.  That is to be expected, at this ""quality"" of restaurant.  It is also expected that the food must be great in a New American restaurant at this price point with this critical acclaim.  Luckily, Buttermilk Channel did not disappoint.We got popovers to start, which was a pleasant surprise.  I haven't had popovers for probably over 5 years now (fuck I'm old).  I ordered the steamed mussels (green chili, aioli, grilled country bread, $12) to start, and my girlfriend ordered the mustard-glazed grilled bacon ($7).  The mussels were excellent; they were huge, plentiful, and packed with flavor.  The green chili they were cooked in resembled a variant of salsa verde with green tomatillos and onions, which I absolutely love.  The aioli wasn't entirely necessary bit didn't hurt either.  The grilled country bread was good stuff, but they probably could've done without the grilling in order to better act as a sponge for the sauce.  My girlfriend complained about her bacon, saying it was way too fatty.  Cut thick enough to make Peter Luger's bacon look thin, she was right about it being too fatty.  Too addictively, deliciously fatty.  Seriously, the bacon was mostly fat, but once you get past that it has to be some of the most tender, succulent pork fat I've tasted.  I could eat this stuff all day.  It even came with a small salad just so that you can feel slightly better about yourself.  My girlfriend had a waiter take this dish away, otherwise I would've cleaned the plate.  I got the special Delmonico steak for my main (~$36), while my girlfriend played it safe with the buttermilk fried chicken (cheddar waffles and savoy cabbage slaw, $23).  I'd never had a ribeye or a Delmonico steak before, but my steak tastes have gradually been growing towards fattier steaks in search of more flavor.  Given this--and my philosophy that the best restaurants are those that you can try something out-of-the-box that you wouldn't normally order and end up loving it--I went for it medium rare.  Great choice!  The steak was fatty, tender, and packed with flavor.  There was a bit too much grizzle on it for my tastes, but I'm unsure of whether this is just typical for this cut.  I wish I had asked more about how it was prepared though, as it came dressed in balsamic vinegar and oils.  This complemented the steak well, mind you; I just didn't expect it as there was no description on the menu.  These liquids mingled nicely on the bottom of the plate, making a tasty meat juice soup.  There were also several peppers around the dish.  Most peppers were sweet, juices and tasty, having sucked up the steak's flavors--except the one lone, random  extra-hot pepper.  I was not expecting that one at all, and while I have no problem with spicy food, it only served to curb my enjoyment of the dish.  My girlfriend had the much bally-hoed fried chicken.  I was only allowed one bite, but it was crisp, moist and flavorful.For dessert, I got the vanilla ice cream float with Manhattan Special ($7), and my girlfriend got the chocolate tart ($8).  I am a huge fan of Manhattan special and the ice cream they used was great, so there was no way for this to be anything but great.  Very refreshing to see a basic item like this on a fancy restaurant's menu: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  My girlfriend's chocolate tart was chocked full of deep, dark chocolate flavor, albeit being a little small; she didn't seem to love it, though.Slight imperfections aside, Buttermilk Channel lived up to the hype for me.  This place is a great restaurant because it has all the characteristics of one--not just because someone wrote an article in the Times oron Chowhound.  It proves it is a great restaurant in how it executes its dishes first and foremost, how serves its customers, and how it makes itself more than just another restaurant in a trendy area.  There is a buzz here that is palatable beyond pure hype.  I would definitely love to come back again.",5.0

"Attraction: Monday price-fix menu! 3 course meals for $25.  This place is not in the most accessible part of town, but worth the travel. At 6pm, the place was pretty  had the whole place to practically to ourselves. Sat in a cute spot in the back near the French window. Small touches I really liked: my seat was a long church bench which they have near the walls, great light fixtures, big candles near the window. Our server was a swell guy, quick and attentive.Though we came for the Monday special, I decided to venture off and get items from the regular menu. Ordered the hush puppies for apps and the duck meatloaf as an entree. Loved the meatloaf (juicy, tender),  though not a fan of the fruity sauce.  SO went with the favorite fried chicken and waffles. Excellent dish! I wish the half side of waffles matched the 3 big pieces of chicken on the meal. Sill not a fan of the syrup (again a dark fruity mix). Pecan pie was an amazing dessert. Best of all, we never felt rushed, even as the place started filling out. Would love to return for brunch, though I fear the long lines.",4.0

"Gets two stars because of the server. He was knowledgeable and very helpful, tentative and provided great customer service. Apart from that I didn't really enjoy the food. I been craving chicken and waffles and been wanting to try this place for a while. After spend hours at the doctors office I decided to come here for dinner. The atmosphere is nice and that is a plus. My first course I had the mussles and they were the best I've ever eaten. They weren't rubbery. They were nice and tender literally melting in my mouth. The broth was good. Wasn't salty and I can appreciate that. The bread however  was grilled and had too much of a charcoal grill taste to it. Main course I had the chicken and cheddar waffles. Wasn't nothing to rave about. It really wasn't that great. The chicken  was crispy and nicely seasoned but they put a bit to much salt after taking it out tge fryer. That clashed with the cheddar waffle, which was meh. The cole slaw was bland, couldn't eat it and the syrup wasn't great either. It tasted like a balsamic syrup reduced with maple flavor. My drinks were great. Maybe I need to try something else but for 60 bucks this meal wasn't worth it.",2.0
"The fried pork chop with waffles alone is worth the one hour-wait you'll have ahead of you once you put your name down! (Too bad they don't take reservations). Add to that the almonds with bacon and that's one of the best meals in Brooklyn. Great service too! For such crowded place though, having only one bathroom was a pain and there was a long line the whole time we were there. We were 4 people and paid around $30/person (tax/tip included).

So, when a friend of mine wanted to go to a brunch place, this place automatically popped into my head.

The breading seemed a touch underseasoned (nothing some pepper couldn't rectify - I tend to like things with a little kick), but the cheddar waffle was fabulous.

"I don't get the hype. My food was good, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't blown away either. I came for dinner, so I can't speak on brunch, but nothing about this place was amazing, not the food or the atmosphere - they have an older crowd kind of vibe so maybe I'm not being fair in that regard, but I can honestly recommend some other spots in that area that I think would exceed your expectations for around the same prices they charge.",3.0
"Really good food and great wine. The complimentary biscuits (biscuits? Popovers? AWESOME CARB THING THAT IS COMPLIMENTARY) were amazing. I'm still thinking about them. I had the hake, but the waiter apologized saying how they were out of something, but then they weren't, but they were, and -- it ended up being available, but yeah.I was told that the fried chicken was ""okay"" by my fellow co-diner who hails from the south, which apparently is supposed to be their signature dish. I don't eat chicken, so I can't say much, ya know?I'd come back if I lived in Carroll Gardens, but alas, I have no babies or dogs.",4.0
"Attraction: Monday price-fix menu! 3 course meals for $25.  This place is not in the most accessible part of town, but worth the travel. At 6pm, the place was pretty  had the whole place to practically to ourselves. Sat in a cute spot in the back near the French window. Small touches I really liked: my seat was a long church bench which they have near the walls, great light fixtures, big candles near the window. Our server was a swell guy, quick and attentive.Though we came for the Monday special, I decided to venture off and get items from the regular menu. Ordered the hush puppies for apps and the duck meatloaf as an entree. Loved the meatloaf (juicy, tender),  though not a fan of the fruity sauce.  SO went with the favorite fried chicken and waffles. Excellent dish! I wish the half side of waffles matched the 3 big pieces of chicken on the meal. Sill not a fan of the syrup (again a dark fruity mix). Pecan pie was an amazing dessert. Best of all, we never felt rushed, even as the place started filling out. Would love to return for brunch, though I fear the long lines.",4.0
"I had heard a lot about this place, and the food was good, but I don't think that it was worth the really long wait time and the less-than-stellar service. Plus, don't even think about going to the bathroom.  There's only one, so there was a huge line for it when I tried to go.  Then three different members of the waitstaff hollered at me to get out of the way when I was waiting on line for it.  I would have liked to stay and try the dessert but I had to leave so I could go elsewhere to use the restroom.",3.0

"Gets two stars because of the server. He was knowledgeable and very helpful, tentative and provided great customer service. Apart from that I didn't really enjoy the food. I been craving chicken and waffles and been wanting to try this place for a while. After spend hours at the doctors office I decided to come here for dinner. The atmosphere is nice and that is a plus. My first course I had the mussles and they were the best I've ever eaten. They weren't rubbery. They were nice and tender literally melting in my mouth.

We had the east oysters iced & barbecued. Really small oysters. The barbecued one was of interest to me because it was unique. Never had that flavor anywhere.As for entree, I had the famous buttermilk fried chicken . I was expecting awesomeness, but truthfully it was just OK. Kind of disappointed. Skin was burnt and too hard. Chicken wasn't that juicy. I enjoy Popeyes more. Especially since this dish was $23. The cheddar waffles were OK. Syrup was a little tangy.

The manager, genuinely stressed out, calmed our frustrations with a delicious apple doughnut ball, compliments of the kitchen.We tried and LOVED the pork chops/waffles and eggs huntington. The eggs huntington is basically their signature eggs benedict -- the biscuits are light and fluffy and obviously homemade. The hollandaise tastes buttery with subtle notes of lemon. A poached egg and ham harmoniously complete each bite. The pork chop is HUGE and breaded to perfection; maple syrup and a cheese waffle accompany it. The portions are mammoth but finger licking good and can thus be tackled, irregardless of hangovers.Though Manhattanites like myself come to Buttermilk Channel, its crowd and space emanate ""classic"" Brookyln.",4.0
"After living in NYC for 9 months we finally were able to get to Buttermilk Channel on a Sunday. The place was jam packed and our wait time for a table for 2 was 1 hour. A lot of the people got discouraged with the wait time and left. We hung around and were luckily seating in less than 30 minutes. The hostess was nice enough to accommodate us quickly. Everything on the menu looked delicious. We ordered:Pecan Pie French Toast - This is the BEST french toast i have ever ever ever eaten. It's topped with bourbon, molasses and toasted pecans. A super delicious dish. The french toast just melts in your mouth and I loved every bite of it. It is overwhelmingly sweet so i recommend sharing this with someone. I ordered it as my main dish and was not able to finish it. The Roasted Mushroom, spinach and goat cheese scrambled is served with toast, hash brown and a small salad. The deep fried little hash brown was amazing. Small perfectly fried and full of flavors. The scramble was absolutely scrumptious. You can't go wrong with a combination of mushroom, spinach and goat cheese. Excellent dish!!Buttermilk Biscuits -  Side of buttermilk biscuits was just OK. They taste good if you eat it hot, but if you leave them for a few minutes, they are average. Not the best biscuits i have had!I will definitely come back here for more. The only downside to this place is, they don't take reservations. So be prepared for some long wait time.",5.0

The short rib hash was not short on the short rib as some places are and the short rib is nice, tender, and juicy.  Buttermilk also has a pretty tasty bloody mary selection and my favorite was the court street bloody mary.

We had an hour wait and got crammed into two tables outside in the sun, (each table sits two patrons).

It took us that long,if not longer to get a menu and if this was the case out of curtesy, we should have been advised of this but this choice was not even given to us in the first place.

"My fiance has been craving chicken and waffles for months, and Buttermilk Channel did not disappoint.

"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner - don't understand what the hype is all about. Perhaps it's a better choice for brunch. It took over 30 min to get seated, even with a reservation. The place is really crammed, so I got elbowed or hit with plates at least ten times. Food was generally good - oysters mussels and fried chicken were really great. I made the mistake of ordering the cod special, which was served as a whole fish. It was so fishy, I got nauseous after one bite and asked the waitress to take it away. The cheesecake was the most bitter thing I ever tried - barely was able to swallow it down. Carrot cake was good. Would've left 4 stars but the hospitality was lacking a bit. The bartender with the weird pointy glasses had an attitude. Waitress was good though. Hostess was super nice, except she forgot to communicate to the waitress that it was my friend's birthday and didn't bring a candle out with the dessert until I walked over and something. Overall - not worth the trip to Brooklyn for me.",3.0

So, i decided i was not going to stuff waffles and chicken in my face in such a tight space. I asked for the sunday pecan.

"I have been here five times and it is absolutely a top 10 NYC brunch destination.  There is usually a long wait, so be prepared or hover near the bar where you can score a seat and order from the full menu.  A few of my favorite items include the classic bloody mary, the candied almonds with bacon, house-made pickles, the goat cheese scramble, the pancakes and the house-made sausage patties.  The pork chop is probably the most filling item on the menu and the french toast is decadent...also making a good dessert.  Service is always friendly and prompt.  The only thing I'd call your attention to is the fact that on Sundays, they don't serve alcohol until 12 PM, so don't get seated any earlier than that...booze should always precede food during brunch.",5.0
"Came here for Sunday Brunch and quoted 1.5 hour wait, thankfully shortened because we opted for the first come first serve bar option. Classic Spicy Bloody Mary = excellent. I got the spinach scrambles and my friend got the Eggs Huntington with spinach instead of ham. Scrambles were ok but I would definitely would opt for her meal the next time I come, with the same veggie option vs. ham. Ambiance was fantastic. Its no wonder this place is a Brooklyn gem!",4.0

"I was really looking forward to going to Buttermilk Channel. We already arrived 40 minutes past their opening time, 10:00 AM, and there was already a line of people waiting. Luckily, we were only a party of 2, so we wound up waiting no more than 10 minutes before being seated.Sadly, it was before noon, so we weren't able to order any alcoholic drinks. Some may want to plan on going after 12 PM, especially if you like Bloody Mary's which Buttermilk specializes in several different concoctions.Coffee will run you $3.00, with free refills, which is sourced locally from The Brooklyn Roasting Company. Their coffee is quite good and worth trying, with a medium body and not too much acidity. It's a cup of joe that I can enjoy having a couple cups of.For my entree, I ordered the Short Rib Hash ($12.00), which consisted of 2 sunnyside eggs, 2 half slices of whole wheat toast, and organic greens. I was rooting for this dish, especially after becoming a huge fan of the Duck Hash from LIC Market in Long Island City. The short rib hash was shredded up and abundant complimented with cubes of potatoes. Tasty, but slightly dried out and definitely no where as good as the formerly mentioned. My 2 sunny side eggs were overcooked past the point of perfection, both yolks were for the most part 75% solidified with only a small trace amount of runny yellow yolk. The edges of the egg white were over-fried to crispiness, something which I normally wouldn't mind, but everything seemed to just go wrong. The toast wasn't bad, lightly buttered and lightly toasted just enough so that I could hold it without the bread flopping over. However, the highlight of the meal seemed to be the side of organic greens which at first sight appeared to be deceptively undressed and boring. But instead, there was a light dressing and very subtle note of saltiness that made for a very enjoyable salad. I did have a chance to try the Buttermilk Pancakes ($7.00) which was a big hit. Airy with a hint of sweetness, making for one of the best pancakes that I've had in a while. I usually don't like pancakes, but these were so darn good and definitely worth trying.Our waitress was very nice. Not once did I have to get her attention as she always seemed to come at the right time, refiling our cups of coffee and water. Despite the crowds waiting outside, she never rushed us to leave.Maybe my dish was a freak accident as the general opinion of Buttermilk Channel seems to be positive. But such minor details, such as an overcooked fried egg should never go unnoticed. Perhaps I should have told my waitress, but I'm not one to complain to the staff about my food unless there is some sort of bug in it or the food is just unbearably bad. With the pancakes being a huge hit, I'll wager a return visit, hopeful that they get my eggs right the next time around.",3.0

"Enough with the sprinkling of sea salt on top of everything. When I bit into the fried chicken all I tasted was the salt.

"A Superb Dining Experience! From the Maple Bacon Roasted Almonds through the Pecan Pie Sundae, everything was perfect! It was father's day and I went with my wife and Kids. ""Thing One"" smartly observed that since the last time she ate at Chez Panisse she had not enjoyed a complex meal where the original and unique flavors all worked as an ensemble, but stayed totally distinct. She had the mussels in green chili sauce and a salad. (I am so proud of her ability to articulate what makes a good meal special: a great Father's Day gift!) The warm lamb salad with soft boiled eggs, roasted cauliflower and olive-bread croutons was, simply sublime(See picture). The Eggs were so rich and fresh it makes me lament how base supermarket eggs are, even when cage free and all of the other marketing pablum I pay extra for is figured in. The fried chicken and cheddar waffles my partner and son enjoyed were sparkling: the sweet-savory syrup served with it brought everything to life. I was most impressed by the subtlety sweet-savory cheddar waffles, which were light, crispy and not overpowering: slightly sweet and mildly cheddary. We all loved everything (even Thing Three's kiddy meal of pasta with red-sauce was perfect). The deserts were amazing: strawberry icecream that tasted like farmer's market strawberries was amazing. Thing Three's cone clown sundae was good, as was the chocolate chip bread pudding. But special notice for the pecan pie sundae is demanded. It made my very good father's day perfect.",5.0

After I trade it with my Boyfriend, i could eat better.The service is good, but rushed, but thats just because the place was packed!",3.0

The overall meal was meh.  Meh, I tell you.  No other words. Just three letters that reflect a sound to summarize our lame disappointment. The long, belabored critique of our visit on what we ate:- House-made pickles served as round slices and thick spears.  Fine.- Fresh mozzarella balls skewered with crusty, oiled bread, laced with tiny anchovies and broiled until golden. Alright. (Good, not great.)- Pureed cauliflower soup was promising, smooth and creamy with crushed pistachioed crunch.  Good.- Green apple and arugula salad, with all two thin slivers of green apples and seemingly novel but absolutely ordinary blue cheese sandwich accompaniment.  Average.- Popovers. Fine.  Would have been better if they served it to us early in our meal instead of wedged awkwardly after our first course because they forgot to bring them earlier.- Ham wrapped trout, served on a thick bed of grits and roasted radishes.  Decent. While the gf loved the flavor of the grits, I couldn't get over its unbecoming, thick and chunky texture. The trout was definitely fishy - the good fishy that true fish lovers enjoy but on-the-fence-loving-fish-people would not particularly appreciate, and we enjoyed the salty balance added by the ham because lord knows how the chicken needed some of that balance...- Fried chicken and cheddar waffles.  Ridiculously disappointing.  I mean, if you want your chicken to be coated in thick cardboard-textured batter, the decently moist flesh bland beyond belief, then you will not be disappointed.  For others who enjoy actual flavor, you are best to skip this one, unless you have a habit of carrying an emergency package of soy sauce or salt in your pocket.  Seriously.  Don't do it.  The waffles absolutely stink too.  They were served as hard as hockey pucks and tasted like Cheez Nips (I mean, I like Cheez Nips, but I like bouncy, light waffles too).- Chocolate chip bread pudding with salted chocolate butterscotch.  Skip. Move on. Dense. Overly salty (smother it on the fried chicken?).  Sad.  Yuck.  Go on already.- Mini-pecan pie sundae.  Awesome.  Spectacular.  Layers of huge, softly-caramelized pecans, velvety vanilla ice cream and lovely whipped cream in a cup.  Simple. Savory. Sweet.

That was a bad way to set the tone for dinner.The chicken was ok, but would not even make the top ten in my mind. The thigh was juicy, but the breast was dry and bland. Also shared a rib-eye, and it was a decent piece of meat, but no real char from the grill or any flavor.

"This place hooked me with their presence at Smorgusburg where they serve the best chicken and waffle combination I have ever had  in my 30 years of living.The food:  The Friend Chicken and Waffles is must try!  Lets start with the chicken.  It is breaded a bit heavier than I usually like it with spices that are just perfect for friend chicken.  It's so crispy, the initial crunch can be audible throughout Brooklyn!  Take a big bite to enjoy the delicate chicken contrasted with the extra crispy skin.  Somehow they managed to make it not greasy at all.  Enter the Waffles.  It's texture mirrors the chicken: crunchy exterior with soft tender interior.  The best part about this duo is that once you eat up all the skin on the outside, just fork the chicken and crisp edeges of the wafflles and dip it in the balsamic maple sauce....can't be beat!  Back in the day at Smorgusburg they also served a watermelon gazpacho type condiment with it but not anymore :(   Be warned they don't have chicken and waffles for the brunch menu.  But what they do have is pork chop and waffles.  Excellent pork chop with a nice crispy exterior on great waffles.  Not as good as the chicken but a close second.They have great oysters as well!The setting: nice date place!  For brunch its nice and airy with a clean fresh feel to it, probably due to its bright blue, white and pale colors.  Overall: best friend chicken and waffles I have ever had, and I have had alot",5.0
"I must concur with most reviews of this establishment.  The food was simply delicious and the service was great.  We sat at the bar in order to avoid the wait.  My friend had the bourbon pecan French toast while I had the grilled cheese and pickles.  The homemade pickles were awesome.  Despite it being so busy, the bartender fella worked with speed and precision.  It was pretty amazing to watch him in action.  Kudos to him!",4.0
"My boyfriend and I have wanted to try Buttermilk Channel since moving to Brooklyn in August. The only question I have, after our dinner this week, is: WHY DID WE WAIT SO LONG TO GO TO BUTTERMILK CHANNEL?Seriously, top five meals I've had in the NYC area. We went on a Tuesday - free corkage night! - and as soon as we walked in, the waitress brought us wine glasses. The place was pretty empty at 6:30 but when we left at 8:30, it was jammed. It's a small restaurant, but very charming, with soft lighting and an attractive wooden bench lining one wall. The food. We started with the House-made Pickles: both spears and rounds, which were delicious. I think they used a special kind of vinegar, because I'd never had anything like it. If you like pickles even a little, you must try these. As were enjoying the pickles, our waitress brought out a plate with two complimentary popovers (still hot from the oven!) drizzled with honey and sprinkled with flaky sea salt. It melted in my mouth.For entrees, we shared the oft-mentioned Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cheddar Waffle, and the salad with olive-croutons, fried capers, fresh mozzarella, and soft egg. The chicken was amazing - a little hard to eat, but so tender and flavorful, my mouth is watering just remembering it. The salad was unbelievable - the croutons were little pieces of bread studded with pieces of kalamata olives, and the fried capers crunched between my teeth. So satisfying.When the waitress took away our entree plates, my boyfriend said, ""I think we should get dessert, because I think dessert here is going to be REALLY good."" Normally I don't order dessert out, because it tends to be overpriced, and I'm more of a savory person, but I had a feeling he was right. The dessert was amazing! I had a coconut pot de creme, which managed to be sweet without being cloying or overpowering, maybe because it was cut with light whipped cream and crunchy flakes of roasted coconut. My boyfriend had the chocolate chunk bread pudding, which, for all of you chocolate lovers, was fantastic.The best part? The bill for all of that food came to $60, or $35/person with tip. Not something I can afford to do every week, but I feel like I got MORE than my money's worth.Go! Buttermilk Channel is calling.",5.0

Fluffy, slightly sweet, perfect density, the perfect pancake. The side of bacon and bloody mary which accompanied were spot on as well. Why had I ignored the obvious for so long. I will be making up for it, I'm sure...except the fried pork chop and waffle I eyed on the way out looked really good...",4.0

"This place hooked me with their presence at Smorgusburg where they serve the best chicken and waffle combination I have ever had  in my 30 years of living.The food:  The Friend Chicken and Waffles is must try!  Lets start with the chicken.  It is breaded a bit heavier than I usually like it with spices that are just perfect for friend chicken.  It's so crispy, the initial crunch can be audible throughout Brooklyn!  Take a big bite to enjoy the delicate chicken contrasted with the extra crispy skin.  Somehow they managed to make it not greasy at all.  Enter the Waffles.  It's texture mirrors the chicken: crunchy exterior with soft tender interior.  The best part about this duo is that once you eat up all the skin on the outside, just fork the chicken and crisp edeges of the wafflles and dip it in the balsamic maple sauce....can't be beat!  Back in the day at Smorgusburg they also served a watermelon gazpacho type condiment with it but not anymore :(   Be warned they don't have chicken and waffles for the brunch menu.  But what they do have is pork chop and waffles.  Excellent pork chop with a nice crispy exterior on great waffles.  Not as good as the chicken but a close second.They have great oysters as well!The setting: nice date place!  For brunch its nice and airy with a clean fresh feel to it, probably due to its bright blue, white and pale colors.  Overall: best friend chicken and waffles I have ever had, and I have had alot",5.0
"I must concur with most reviews of this establishment.  The food was simply delicious and the service was great.  We sat at the bar in order to avoid the wait.  My friend had the bourbon pecan French toast while I had the grilled cheese and pickles.  The homemade pickles were awesome.  Despite it being so busy, the bartender fella worked with speed and precision.  It was pretty amazing to watch him in action.  Kudos to him!",4.0
"My boyfriend and I have wanted to try Buttermilk Channel since moving to Brooklyn in August. The only question I have, after our dinner this week, is: WHY DID WE WAIT SO LONG TO GO TO BUTTERMILK CHANNEL?Seriously, top five meals I've had in the NYC area. We went on a Tuesday - free corkage night! - and as soon as we walked in, the waitress brought us wine glasses. The place was pretty empty at 6:30 but when we left at 8:30, it was jammed. It's a small restaurant, but very charming, with soft lighting and an attractive wooden bench lining one wall. The food. We started with the House-made Pickles: both spears and rounds, which were delicious. I think they used a special kind of vinegar, because I'd never had anything like it. If you like pickles even a little, you must try these. As were enjoying the pickles, our waitress brought out a plate with two complimentary popovers (still hot from the oven!) drizzled with honey and sprinkled with flaky sea salt. It melted in my mouth.For entrees, we shared the oft-mentioned Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cheddar Waffle, and the salad with olive-croutons, fried capers, fresh mozzarella, and soft egg. The chicken was amazing - a little hard to eat, but so tender and flavorful, my mouth is watering just remembering it. The salad was unbelievable - the croutons were little pieces of bread studded with pieces of kalamata olives, and the fried capers crunched between my teeth. So satisfying.When the waitress took away our entree plates, my boyfriend said, ""I think we should get dessert, because I think dessert here is going to be REALLY good."" Normally I don't order dessert out, because it tends to be overpriced, and I'm more of a savory person, but I had a feeling he was right. The dessert was amazing! I had a coconut pot de creme, which managed to be sweet without being cloying or overpowering, maybe because it was cut with light whipped cream and crunchy flakes of roasted coconut. My boyfriend had the chocolate chunk bread pudding, which, for all of you chocolate lovers, was fantastic.The best part? The bill for all of that food came to $60, or $35/person with tip. Not something I can afford to do every week, but I feel like I got MORE than my money's worth.Go! Buttermilk Channel is calling.",5.0
"OMG, their Chicken and Waffles is ridiculously delicious.  Likely the best fried chicken I've ever tasted.",5.0
"After having several brunches here, I failed to have tried the famous buttermilk pancakes. Well, today I've corrected my actions. Ordered up a tall stack (5 fluffy pancakes piled high)  and devoured the whole thing sans syrup and butter - doesn't need it. They were all that I was led to believe. Fluffy, slightly sweet, perfect density, the perfect pancake. The side of bacon and bloody mary which accompanied were spot on as well. Why had I ignored the obvious for so long. I will be making up for it, I'm sure...except the fried pork chop and waffle I eyed on the way out looked really good...",4.0
"I love this place but not for dinner. I love the brunch offered here. It has become apart of our family events and for good reason. Each brunch item is made to perfection. The goat cheese omelet is delicious. I gave Buttermilk four stars instead of five because their drink menu is non-existent. They offer this Bloody-Mary thing with an oyster on top WHAT!? YUCK!

"This is my review for their Sunday brunch..Pros: Wide variety! When I was looking over their menu, there were a number of things that popped out to me and looked delicious. The waffles, the scrambles, the salmon platter! I had a really tough time choosing.Cute and charming. The decor inside Buttermilk is adorable. Exposed brick walls, trey ceilings... It definitely had a very country, quaint feel to it.Great Sunday brunch music. They played The Beatles for our entire meal!With every entree you purchase, you get your choice of drink.. (Bellini, mimosa, OJ, apple juice, tea..)My group and I ordered a plate of pancakes for our table. They were sprinkled with powered sugar on top and stacked five high. They were delicious and fluffy..!Friendly staff and super nice hostess. She kept my Cons: Longest wait in the history of mankind. It is crowded here! And popular! And we waited 50 minutes to be seated.I ended up ordering the scramble with salmon and cream cheese. I should've stuck with my gut and gotten the sausage and pepper one but I wanted to be fancy and ended up with weird watery / creamy eggs. My dish came with toast, a side salad and one hash brown. I was really disappointed with my scramble! It just wasn't good. My sister ordered the salmon platter which was your run of the mill lox and cream cheese.For my drink, I ordered an apple juice. They gave me a glass about 3 inches tall - it took me all of 3 sips to finish it. I guess only children usually order the apple juice but really?

The mains were also really good - the fired chicken was GREAT!! the lobster was also really impressive - the pan seared fish was also really good. The atmosphere  was great - very Brooklyn.",4.0
"In the mood for Pancakes?  Don't even think about IHOP as this place absolutely makes the best pancakes I've ever tasted and confirmed on multiple occasions so it's not a fluke!I had the Eggs Benedict here and it's pretty amazing.  Did I mention to also get a side order of pancakes as well?  If you come here without getting that, you're doing yourself a disservice.  Very attentive waitress who kept refilling our drinks and made our overall experience pretty good.  Their other brunch food was also a hit as nothing we've tasted seemed to be off point.   This is one of the better brunch places I've been to and no need to travel to Manhattan either.The wait time can be pretty hectic depending on when you come but the few times I've arrived it was always on a Sunday afternoon and took about 30 mins at the very least so plan to wait.",5.0
"In my quest to devour and compare the best chicken and waffles plates NYC has to offer, my journey took me to the trendy (yet highly recommended) Buttermilk Channel.  In summary, if you're going to indulge in some caloric binging, this plate is totally worth it.  As a whole, the chicken and waffles were amazing.  The chicken was deftly fried (not too greasy, but with a really great texture and crunch to it).  I found myself guiltily peeling off pieces of fried skin (after the meat had been decimated), and dipping it into the amazing maple balsamic syrup (which is amazing).  The syrup's balsamic tones give the syrup an interesting dimension, and I definitely re-applied the syrup multiple times.  The cole slaw was the perfect addition to the meal.  However, I do feel that the waffles were a bit soft (or undercooked).  A good waffle to acccompany fried chicken should be firm and with a crispy outer layer, to be enjoyed together with the chicken.  The waffle here was definitely an afterthought.  The venue is very pretty inside, low lighting and a hip crowd.  Be prepared to wait though.  I arrived early to put our name down, and it took a good 1.5 hours to get a table.  Any NYer is used to such a wait at a popular restaurant, but after a 50 minute train ride (as a ""tourist"" not from Brooklyn - as the hipster girl waiting in line to the WC lovingly referred to us) that's quite a wait.  Be prepared to wait, and I definitely suggest sending someone to put your name down early so that you can explore the neighborhood a bit.  The service was adequate.  No complaints, but no kudos either.  I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the wait and the price.  I'm willing to wait for good food, but it was (with drinks) quite a bit of money for comfort food.  Those two factors combined knocks it down a bit.  With all that said, I will return and shove fried chicken into my face again.  Highly recommended.",3.0
"First off, I went here on a Friday night around 7:30 and I had called ahead to see if they take reservations. Unfortunately, they do not, only for parties for 5 or more. I was placed on the waiting list for both the table and bar, so whichever was quicker, I was sure to get my grub on. I took my boyfriend here to celebrate his belated birthday. We waited around 45 minutes to sit at the bar. I ordered red wine while my boyfriend ordered the Kelso beer (which has a great crisp taste, as recommended by the bartender). We then ordered the raw oysters and the barbequed oysters with smoked bacon as the appetizers. We love raw oysters, so this was definitely a plus for us. The barbequed oysters were great as well. Both of these appetizers were presented beautifully. For the main entree, we ordered the Maine lobster (which was the special on Fridays) as well as the trout. One of the lobster sides, which was hard to see because of the lighting, was raw. And so, I told the manager in which he insisted we stay for dessert. I wasn't being a pest, but just to let him know that the lobster was raw. The Maine lobster was overall delicious and full of flavor and it came with some kind of pasta noodles as well. The trout was delicious as well, sauteed to perfection. We then ordered dessert--the Pecan Pie sundae, which was real great. As we got the bill, the Sundae and a cup of beer was waived due to the raw Maine lobster. This place is great if you want to take your significant other, or a friend. But the wait is long and it is far from the train station (especially if it is cold out). The food here is unique and delicious. Highly recommend this!",4.0

"This has been on my yelp ""to try"" list forever and I'm glad it's worth the hype! I came here around noon on Saturday and the wait was not too deadly (around 20 mins). I was sad that they didn't have the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, only the fried pork chop and waffles. But thankfully I am wise (modesty is not my middle name) and used my waiting time to look at the menu and correspond the dishes to yelp photos :) Well, yelpers have amazing photography skills because I was sold on the fried pork chops at first view! And I'm so happy to have ordered it because it was AMAZING! Perfect breading, meat was moist and juicy and the sweet and savory combo was so satisfying. Of course the cheddar waffles were delicious but I was blown away by the perfection of the pork chops. We also ordered the rib hash, the ABC sandwich (apple, bacon, cheddar) and the pumpkin and butternut squash soup. I have no complaints about any of these dishes. The ABC sandwich was my friend's favorite - the ingredients were balanced so you could taste each ingredient distinctly; again, the perfect blend of sweet and savory. Another surprising dish that I highly recommend. The rib hash and soup were great as well. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the brunch menu. Good brunch makes my weekend day!",5.0

"Definitely suggest either coming with only 2 people or making reservations for brunch.

All of the meals came with a refreshing side salad.The bacon side is definitely enough for at least 2 people and they were hearty meaty slices. The fries side is small but very tasty (crunchy and soft and yum). The grapefruit snack was nothing spectacular but refreshing; The sticky bun snack was totally not worth it in my opinion...a bit on the dry side of how i like my cinnabons.Overall a cute little place with that hippie / carroll gardens brunch feel.A must try on the brooklyn brunch list.",4.0
"My brunch cherry has been popped and my companions were gentle with me and coddled me afterwards...I finally lost it!

I think we waited over 40 minutes, but it was worth the wait. A truly diverse crowd. A lot of people with tattoos and a lot of different races. I love Brooklyn, but you knew that already. I felt at home. Diversity breeds good genes. Apparently, this place is known for their Bloody Marys, so I tried the oyster Bloody Mary. Pretty damn good. Spiced right, and you could barely taste the alcohol. That is a plus for me. And I felt the effects later. I tried the Egg Huntington platter. Poached eggs, Canadian ham, biscuits, a bed of greens with Hollandaise on the side. Great dish. I like runny eggs and this dish fulfilled my desire for runny eggs. I now know that I don't like Hollandaise. In life, it is important to know what you don't like...A great brunch experience. Where are we going next for brunch?",4.0
"I struggle with giving this place 2 stars because the atmosphere was nice, the waiters were helpful, and we were seated rather quickly for a Saturday brunch (especially since we showed up at 2:45pm and brunch is over at 3).  With such a good start, how is it possible that I could give this place two stars? Simply, it was the food :-/. I had the fried pork chop with cheese waffles, my friend had pancakes with a side of sausage and eggs, and a 2nd friend had ribs hash with sunny side eggs. To start off, one friend found a hair in his food (NOT good, he simply took the hair out and starting eating, but had it been me, I would've FLIPPED my wig). He said his ribs and hash were ""ok, nothing to write home about"" nor was it anything to come back for. For a drink he had a drink that started with ""hunting"", which he liked but it came in the tiniest glass! Here's this 6'2 guy drinking out of a glass that looked like a child's tea set in his hand, and it cost $12! Ridiculous! My cheese waffles were actually pretty good, but the fried pork chop had no flavor. No seasoning, or anything. I ended up covering the pork chop in syrup to give it some taste.  I'd also had a side of their buttermilk biscuit and that also had no taste. I covered that in the jelly in order to eat it (and even then, I only ate one of the biscuits). My mimosa was pretty good (and believe me, I've been to restaurants where a mimosa isn't made correctly). My other friend said her pancakes were ""DELICIOUS!"" but she hated her sausage, and that too she didn't finish. Her side of eggs were ""ok"".

"Had a pretty damn delicious brunch here a couple of weeks back.Started with some well made coffee & juice and then had to get a bit of jelly donut, which was the best I've had in decades.My boy got the fried pork chop & cheddar waffle, and I must echo everyone else's sentiments regarding said dish - brilliant.  A really nice twist on the now popular chicken and waffles...the breading was tasty, and the waffle was even better.I got the Esposito's scramble, which is made with hot sausage, peppers and onions and *contrary* to some other reviews I've read on here, it was fabulous.  Eggs were perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the peppers & sausage left me wanting more and more with each bite, almost the to the point of inhaling it all.  Sides of applewood smoked bacon, hash browns and biscuits.  The bacon was standard and proper, as were the hash browns, but the biscuits were a bit dense and heavy.All in all, this place really has the whole brunch thing down solid...lived up to the hype. Very comfortable space and a pretty good people watching vibe.  Definitely want to go back on my next trip to BK.",4.0
"The good: delicious house-made sausage patties & nice ambianceThe bad: 1 hour wait for brunch  AND paying $5 for a 1/4 of a cheddar waffle. The waffle itself was OK, nothing spectacular, but $5 for a 3 bite waffle? That's ridiculous even for a Yuppie!",2.0
"Worth the wait for the food. Pretty packed for the weekend which was expected. Hard to even get a drink from the bar, I would say, awkwardly packed trying to hang inside. That says something about their breakfast though.I couldn't pass up the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles. The best of both worlds, sweet and savory. Hit the spot. Couldn't have asked for more on this breakfast occasion. I also guzzled down a Star of the Sea Bloody Mary. Celery and peppercorn infused vodka garnished with a fresh shucked oyster. I wasn't super impressed for $10 but it got the job done. Maybe I'm just cheap or its Brooklyn? Probably both.Service was legit but not getting the overall 5 stars from me. Not sure but I wasn't exactly stunned by the food. Good experience but they place seemed a little cramped. Although, my celebrity sighting of Tiffani Amber Thiessen was cool and glad I got the check that off the list. If you do the whole shabang of drinks, sweets and a main course you are about to spend around $40 a person.",4.0
"Nice staff. Soft decor. Over rated food by far!  I wish I could recommend anything other than the fried chicken, but mostly everything I have had on the entree menu has been extremely disappointing.  Like ""sending back to the kitchen"" disappointing. There are a few good salads and starters that I liked, but not enough to make up for gamey lamb salad or soggy fish.  I guess when you have people lining out the door to see Beyonce eat there, you don't have to have good food anymore.  I wont be going back here if I can help it.  Sorry.",2.0

"This place is so OVERRATED. I tried this place after seeing the blogs say that this was Beyonce's favorite Brooklyn restaurant. I really cannot imagine how considering how tasteless the food is. Firstly,  I ordered their version of eggs Benedict (eggs Huntington i believe it was called) and it was TERRIBLE. The egg was undercooked and just GROSS. Secondly, the orange juice is served in a shot glass. I asked my waiter if i could have a LARGE orange juice (because i couldn't believe that this was the usual size) and he looked at me like I had 10 heads. oh, and my waiter sucked! he was so inattentive and uninterested.I will never come back to this place.",1.0
"Came on a Tuesday Night, and did not have to wait. Sat outdoors and enjoyed the nice breeze. It was such a relaxing serene feeling. Buttermilk Channel definitely has a great atmosphere. And, the foods were very delicious! Service was good too.We ordered: 1) BBQ Oysters with Smoked Bacon & Green Onions, 2) Caputo Handmade Mozarella w/ Basil & Warm Anchovy Sauce, 3) Hanger Steak, 4) Buttermilk Fried Chicken, 5) Pecan Pie Sundae, and 6) Coconut Pot de Creme w/ Pistachio Shortbread.The BBQ Oysters with smoked bacon and green onions was alright. I am not a big fan of oysters so I didn't really enjoy them as much as I should. The oysters are fresh, and seasoned with bbq, bacon and green onions. The oysters were quite small, and is a bit pricey as each oyster cost $3 each. We ordered 6 pieces of oysters, and that was already $18.The Caputo handmade mozarella w/ basil and warm anchovy sauce (which comes with 2 small pieces of bread) was truly delicious! It was very fresh, and savory. The anchovy sauce complemented the mozarella and bread well.The Hanger Steak was another delicious item. It was very tender, and tasty. This dish also came with a bone marrow, which was an interesting culinary experience. The salad that came with this side was very fresh and crisp.The Buttermilk Fried Chicken dish was my most favorite.The fried chicken was so crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. Definitely one of the best fried chickens (that comes with the waffle combos) I have eaten. I was a bit disapointed with the cheddar waffles. I prefer the waffles from Clinton St. Baking more. The cabbage slaw was good - not too much mayo on it.The Pecan Pie Sundae was good, but it was not that astounding. The pecan pie pieces were a bit too sweet for me. However, I was very fond of the vanilla ice cream. The Coconut Pot de Creme w/ Pistachio Shortbread (Dessert) was truly amazing! I wish we ordered 2 of these (instead of the Pecan Pie Sundae). The coconut creme was out of this world, and the pistachio shortbread was so tasty. I did not see this dessert on their menu online, so I am assuming that they change their dessert options often. But, I hope they will have this next time that I visit Buttermilk Channel.Had a wonderful time at Buttermilk Channel. Great food, atmosphere, and service. Highly Recommended!",5.0
"Came here for a birthday dinner back in August. The popovers they give you to start with are amazing. Had the fried chicken and cheddar waffle which was really tasty. The chicken was a bit peppery but tolerable.The only thing that turned me off about this place was the hostess. We got there a bit early and asked if they had happy hour specials. She looked at us like we asked the dumbest question and just told us that they NEVER do happy hour. Also when we left and came back for or reservation time, it took another 25 minutes top be seated.

"Had a great brunch with friends here.  We got there early so didn't have to wait for a table which was good because there was a line when we left.  Waiter was very nice and attentive.   Food was excellent.  Three of us had the pecan pie french toast which was amazing. Great flavor, bread just the right texture and just enough syrup.   Another had the poached eggs which were very good.   Also sampled the cheese waffles, which were good.  If you crossed Eggos with Cheez-Its, that is the flavor, although obviously the quality was much higher than Eggos!Great service, delicious food that wasn't too complex and at a reasonable price.  It's a great place for brunch.  I've also been for dinner and had the fried chicken which was very good.   Also saw Tyra Banks when I was there for dinner.   Definitely recommend this place.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I went in March.  We waited two hours for a table, which was neither fun nor worth it. The food was lackluster.  I had a pasta dish and the cauliflower soup.  My boyfriend had the bacon and maple almonds and the hake (fish).  I'm pretty easy to please, but not a single dish here hit the spot. Normally, when informed of a long wait, I would just move on to the next place, but there was such a huge crowd outside that I thought this spot must be some kind of hidden neighborhood gem with amazing food. Decided to be patient and give it a shot.  It was also out of the way for us geographically, so I knew that if we didn't try it that night, we weren't likely to come back.  The hostess didn't help the experience; she had a weird attitude and kept extending our wait time.  By the time we sat down I was quite ""hangry."" Unfortunately, the food turned out to be neither worth the wait nor the distance traveled.",2.0
We got here about 12:30 and waited about 35 mins to be seated. I must say that it was worth the wait. The food was delicious---Especially the buttermilk pancakes & the walnut french toast. My friend had the pork chops & that was awesome as well. I will definitely be going back.,4.0
Wao! This restaurant deserves all the great reviews it has. My husband and I went for brunch and i have to say it's one of the best brunches we've ever had. From the quality of ingredients to the level of execution it is an A plus restaurant. The service was very good. The pecan french toasts have elevated my expectations of french toasts in the future. Well done! Definitely will be going back and inviting friends from the city.,4.0

"This place is kind of overrated. I'm not saying it's not good, but what I am saying is that it's not worth waiting an hour for. If you walk in and can get a table, then by all means, sit down and enjoy some hearty food. If you walk in and are surrounded by a million people trying to look in-the-know waiting for a table, then walk south and have a burger at Dubuque.Strolled in for brunch one day and was happy to sit right away. I ordered scrambled eggs and my bf had pancakes and sausage. His pancakes were fluffy and delish. My eggs were ordinary and I ended up not finishing it (unheard of for me!). The food was heavy and sat in my gut for a long while after.Ambiance is nice albeit slightly noisy. Service was good. Everyone seemed to be munching on the giant porkchop and waffle. I guess I must have missed that memo.",3.0

"Only my second foray into the Brooklyn brunch scene, my experience at Buttermilk Channel left me wanting to cross the bridge more often. Buttermilk Channel attracts an eclectic mix of clientele. Everyone from 20-something hipsters to 40-somethings with strollers flock to this casual yet trendy neighborhood gem. At 10:15am on a Sunday morning, it was decidedly packed. The wait for a table for two was 35 minutes -- just at the high end of my acceptable wait time for Sunday brunch. Luckily we snagged two seats at the bar instead. Take that, families of five! We ordered prompty. Then we waited... and waited... The bar tender / server was very apologetic and even brought out complimentary jelly doughnuts to lift our spirits. And lift our spirits they did. The doughnuts were soft yet chewey and the strawberry jelly filling was divine! After one bite of the buttermilk pancakes, I could no longer fault them for the 25+ minute wait for our food. These were some of the best pancakes I had ever had. Perfectly simple and dusted with a snowy coat of powdered sugar. Yum. Would have given five stars save the slightly elevated prices.

The place was packed in less than an hour, and after that, there was a line out the door. On our way out, my fiance saw a friend who told him they had a 2+ hour wait ahead of them.So yeah, this place is poppin'.We sat down and got cocktails. I don't remember what I got, but it was delicious and had rum in it.We placed our orders and got our delicious popovers ( my fiance asked for seconds). We ordered three of each kind of oyster on the menu. Unfortunately, our server thught we meant three of each kind IN HOUSE. Once we explained the confusion, he was kind enough to comp us the oysters and bring us the BBQ oysters we originally ordered. They were out of this world!I genuinely don't remember what else I ordered that night, because all that sticks in my mind is the plate of chicken and waffles we ordered to splitf. The chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffles were nice and fluffy. But I had ordered so much already (apps, cocktails, main course, etc.) that I could only eat a few bites!There was a family with kids sitting next to us ( which made me feel guilty about leaving the little one at home, but Mommy and Daddy need to get out of the house sometimes!), and from what I saw, they were very accomodating to them. I think they might even have a kids menu.Great customer service and AMAZING food (with healthy portions).I'll update more when I go back. I'll try to leave some room this time!",5.0

My sole mission is to try everything on the menu and then start over again.I'm going to start off talking about the music.  Especially the brunch music.  90's R&B and hip hop? Yeah, I'm alllllllll the way in on that one.  The brunch menu is good, but the dinner has been my favorite by far.  I love how the menu sublty changes with the seasons.  So far, I've had chicken and waffles, duck meatloaf, hake, grilled flatbread (OMG to die for), warm lamb and romaine salad, barbecued oyster (so spoiled off of this), caputo's linguini, the bramble (with and without alcohol).  Next stop: charcuterie.The service is great.  Everybody is chill and laid back, no uniform required here.  Polly is an absolute angel, serving celebrity treatment at all times.   I've even sat outside, brought my dog here and they gave her water!!  Not much people watching this side of town but who wants to watch people when you can watch all this good food!!Buttermilk Channel, I really and truly love you.",5.0

I figured you can't mess up the menu item that is the speciality, and i was right... it was DELICIOUS! I had the pecan pie sundae for dessert, that too was delicious, the portion size was enough to share between 3 people. NOTE: You must reserve a table if you plan on doing dinner, if not, you will be waiting hours to be seated or end up eating at the bar.",5.0
"It's been a few weeks,  but I'll do my best with this review.We got here for the first reservation (5pm?) on a Saturday night. This was a great idea, as we were seated immediately. The place was packed in less than an hour, and after that, there was a line out the door. On our way out, my fiance saw a friend who told him they had a 2+ hour wait ahead of them.So yeah, this place is poppin'.We sat down and got cocktails. I don't remember what I got, but it was delicious and had rum in it.We placed our orders and got our delicious popovers ( my fiance asked for seconds). We ordered three of each kind of oyster on the menu. Unfortunately, our server thught we meant three of each kind IN HOUSE. Once we explained the confusion, he was kind enough to comp us the oysters and bring us the BBQ oysters we originally ordered. They were out of this world!I genuinely don't remember what else I ordered that night, because all that sticks in my mind is the plate of chicken and waffles we ordered to splitf. The chicken was perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffles were nice and fluffy. But I had ordered so much already (apps, cocktails, main course, etc.) that I could only eat a few bites!There was a family with kids sitting next to us ( which made me feel guilty about leaving the little one at home, but Mommy and Daddy need to get out of the house sometimes!), and from what I saw, they were very accomodating to them. I think they might even have a kids menu.Great customer service and AMAZING food (with healthy portions).I'll update more when I go back. I'll try to leave some room this time!",5.0
"Best pickles ever!We waited about two hours for dinner on a Friday night. The hostess was very nice - sat us at the bar and came around with free appetizers and these amazing pickles. I ordered the steak with bone marrow. The steak was perfect, but I'm not quite a fan of bone marrow because of its fatty texture. The friend I fed it to told me it was delicious, though. All the brunch reviews sound great - can't wait to try it!",4.0
"Things you wish you could un-see (but can't):1.  'The Ring'2.  Walking in on a familial unit engaging in coitus3.  Observing the kitchen staff of Buttermilk Channel par-frying their chicken and storing the fowl uncovered in a dingy bus tub on the kitchen counter - in plain sight of the restrooms.The chicken and waffles were a pedestrian preparation - a bit too heavy handed with the breading, and a bit burnt from using fryer oil well past its prime.  But after visiting the loo and observing that blatant DOH violation, my mind only registered flavor notes redolent of dirty dishes, air born microorganisms, and cut-corners in the kitchen.",2.0

"For the life of me, I can't understand why in the hell it took me this long to write about my beloved Buttermilk Channel.  You know a spot is the bomb when you go three times in a 2 week span, the servers know your name and you get a complimentary snack plate!! My sole mission is to try everything on the menu and then start over again.I'm going to start off talking about the music.  Especially the brunch music.  90's R&B and hip hop? Yeah, I'm alllllllll the way in on that one.  The brunch menu is good, but the dinner has been my favorite by far.  I love how the menu sublty changes with the seasons.  So far, I've had chicken and waffles, duck meatloaf, hake, grilled flatbread (OMG to die for), warm lamb and romaine salad, barbecued oyster (so spoiled off of this), caputo's linguini, the bramble (with and without alcohol).  Next stop: charcuterie.The service is great.  Everybody is chill and laid back, no uniform required here.  Polly is an absolute angel, serving celebrity treatment at all times.   I've even sat outside, brought my dog here and they gave her water!!  Not much people watching this side of town but who wants to watch people when you can watch all this good food!!Buttermilk Channel, I really and truly love you.",5.0
"We have eaten here twice while visiting New York. The first time, we enjoyed the evening atmosphere and had the fried chicken and waffles. The maple syrup served along with it is white good, and the fried chicken is remarkable. This is coming from a Georgia girl. On our second visit, we had the mac & cheese waffles with fried pork chops. Not as exciting as the fried chicken and waffles from our first visit, but good nonetheless. We will be back soon.",5.0
"I had Friday night dinner here with my mom when she was in town. Very popular and crowded place and the website said they didn't take reservations so we ended up waiting around for about an hour for a table. The food was OK. Mom got the fried chicken and I got the duck meatloaf, but will have to say that both were a bit salty. The cider was good,but dessert was the best thing about this place. Overall, solid meal, but not as great as I expected considering all the RAVE reviews.Oh yea. Service sucked.",3.0
"Just encountered the most dismissive and cantankerous hostess. Observed numerous open tables for two at brunch and was told it would be forty five minute wait, and abruptly walks away having never looked at us. My wife and I decided not wait and upon leaving, without solicitation, the nasty hostess comments ""Sorry we couldn't accommodate you right now.""  Speaking to us like spoiled children. Food might be good, don't know. Refuse to do business with a place that can't even be gracious on hello. Cross the street to Prime Meats.",1.0
"Fantastic place to eat.  It can be really crowded and you sometimes have to wait.  I have had dinner here 3 times.  Always love it.  I can't tell you much about the menu because I have only ordered the duck meatloaf.  Incredible!  I also had a few bites of the chicken and waffles.  It was great, but not like the meatloaf.",5.0
"I'd been dying to come here for the longest time, except I never found the time, since it seemed so out of the way. Who knew it was so close to the BQE?! I came here with two people at 6:30 on a Friday, and it wasn't packed yet, so luckily for us, we were seated right away.  Given the fact that past reviews have mentioned exceptionally long waits, I was really happy that we didn't have to wait!This was my first time trying hush puppies, and prior to this experience I had no idea what they were. Regardless, they were a good snack as I starved myself for this dinner.The butter lettuce salad was really good; I mean, it's really just a bed of lettuce - you can't go wrong, but duck cracklings are DELICIOUS. I guess you can tell by now that I have a guiltless soft spot for fried foods.I didn't order the fried chicken if you predicted I would. I ordered the steak because we all wanted to order different things. The daily special was the lobstah from RHLP, and it was delicious from the bit that I tried. The steak was a little tough at medium, and a little bland - nothing spectacular. LUCKILY FOR ME, my friend who ordered the chicken wasn't too hungry and found it impossible too finish her dish - SCORE. The chicken was good. It was juicy, and the batter was very crispy but not the type that would leave your palette feeling raw. And cheddar waffles? Great. I didn't get to try the cole slaw, as my friend finished it, but given the fact that she's not a big fan of cole slaw and finished it anyway, I would have to say that it must have been good.",4.0

"Buttermilk Channel is a small, neighborhood gem of a place.  Classy yet homey, serving up comfort foods that are straightforward but well-prepared and beautifully presented.  Located on a quiet corner in south Carroll Gardens.  The small bar sits to the right of the entrance.  Decor is something like modern country: brick lined and off-white walls, pale wood tables, chairs, and flooring, colonial window panes, and a simple, elegant chandelier.  Service was competent and efficient.Mondays feature a prix fix 3-course menu, a very good deal at $25.  Their regular dinner menu is not extensive but has a little for everyone, and appealing selections.  Big, airy popovers instead of bread for the table; sadly I didn't get to try them (too busy eating everything else).  The maple and bacon roasted almonds were crunchy and flavorful, addictive and terrible, in that so-good-but-so-bad-for-you kind of way.  The very generously portioned chicken liver mousse came in a bowl, with crispy bread slices and sea salt; deliciously creamy.  The roasted pumpkin and sweet potato soup was lovely, sweet and savory.  Their well-known buttermilk fried chicken was a big portion for one person at half a chicken.  Arrived sitting on top of waffles with a side of slaw.  The skin was excellent, light, very crispy, nice flavor.  The chicken meat, both white and dark parts, was very tender and juicy.  I felt the meat lacked flavor, which was the only thing keeping me from raving about this fried chicken.  A fantastic balsamic maple syrup accompanied the dish and helped with the flavor but shouldn't have been necessary; it did go nicely with the light waffles.  Roasted mustardy brussel sprouts on the side were excellent.  For dessert, their pecan pie sundae was the highlight, with ice cream sandwiched between rich, pecan goodness, topped with fluffy whipped cream.  I am addicted to the pecan pie at Peter Luger's and this was just as good, only deconstructed.  The chocolate and caramel tart was also good, but honestly overshadowed by the pecan pie sundae, but my personal bias is probably playing in.Overall, I liked Buttermilk Channel a lot.  Solid, comfort food and just a nice place to dine in.  I probably won't have the fried chicken again but would love to try other items on their menu.",4.0
"Another great Brooklyn restaurant, all the quality and atmosphere without the steep prices and cutthroat competition to get a table. The lamb salad was great (could have had a little more lamb however) but the friend chicken is really their star. Will be back for that.",4.0
"This place is perfect, great food, excellent service, and a simple and inviting ambiance.   We are visiting for work from CA and was recommended this place from a local, and what a treat. Started off with the complimentary popovers which are like a sweet and salty muffin soufflé. Also has the corn bread and chicken liver pate which were both excellent, especially the pate on the crunchy grilled bread, just perfect. Had the duck meatloaf for the entree which was also very good but surprisingly light, I was expecting it to be very rich. Tried a piece of my friends fried chicken, also perfectly flavored, crunchy and juicy. Can't wait to go back and try other options on the menu.",5.0
"TWO WORDS: BRUSSELS SPROUTS. the roasted brussels sprouts with mustard were easily the best brussels sprouts I've ever eaten, let alone ordered in a restaurant. the prune jam that comes aside benton's ham wrapped brook trout complimented the grits perfectly and the warm lamb and romaine salad was really dope, too. the cauliflower in the salad was perfectly seasoned. lots of other ""big time foodie spots"" really lack in the vegetable/side-order department but, buttermilk do vegetables justice! (lookin' out for all my vegetarian homies)I had the chicken and waffles, too. I have to be honest and say I wasn't completely blown away by them however, I had been on a three-day fried food binge so I'm probably biased. also, what's up with ""hipster"" being an option for ambience? seriously, yelp?",4.0

"Buttermilk Channel is one of those restaurants with a split personality.

"I wanted very badly to give this a five-star review. The food and drink at Buttermilk Channel are everything they're billed to be; we absolutely loved it. We went in a small group and sampled around the menu, getting a few seafood and a few meat dishes. My duck meatloaf with whipped parsnips was an absolute treat, the hake was perfectly moist, and the famed fried chicken was as good as advertised. The one drawback to the food was dessert, which was decidedly less inspired than the main courses; we'll be skipping it in the future.So why four stars? The restaurant itself is beautifully appointed, light, and open. The service is friendly and prompt. And they have a list of wines and draft beers (not to mention the full bar and cocktail list) to complement their superb food offerings. Unfortunately, we went to dinner on the early side of dinner (thank you, visiting parents), and in Carroll Gardens that means children are afoot. There is some inevitability to that - people do have kids, after all - but it is all but impossible to savor a glass of wine or enjoy a plate of steamed mussels when someone's child is running between the tables and neither the restaurant nor the parents seem inclined to do anything about it. My advice (which I will be heeding): go later, wait in line, and enjoy your meal without any children around.",4.0
"OMG!!! This is a FANTASTIC brunch spot, and while I want to save it for myself, it happens to be too good not to share. The food is delicious, especially the Pecan Pie French Toast! I only gave them a 4/5 because of the decor and the noise level. The place is VERY plain, and looks unfinished, and not in a very posh way. As for the noise I understand and even enjoy a lively establishment, however hearing the music blaring over brunch is a bit much, especially when it's ""get down on it"", which I find oddly inappropriate for an 11am brunch on Sunday.Overall, give this place a try and see what you think...",4.0

"Buttermilk please! Everything about this brunch spot was the perfect touch to my morning. The locale, the atmosphere, the people, and the food all made for deliciousness. I loved that every brunch entree came with your choice of mimosa, bellini, or sparkling wine. How did they know? My fried pork chop and cheddar waffles could not have been more tasty! The pork chop was surprisingly juicy and the waffles tasted freshly made. I  YUM! I couldn't help but share an order of buttermilk pancakes with my husband. They were perfectly soft melt in your mouth goodness in every bite. I haven't had better. WANT SOME NOW!My husband ordered their in-house smoked salmon that tasted super yummy too! I loved how the eggs were still a little runny and not overcooked - just how they should be. Buttermilk Channel was possibly one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to. Being from Chicago where Brunch is a MUST, this spot tops it all. I just wish I could travel to Brooklyn every week for my buttermilk pancake fix. My stomach is smiling at me right now... :)",5.0

We went in a small group and sampled around the menu, getting a few seafood and a few meat dishes. My duck meatloaf with whipped parsnips was an absolute treat, the hake was perfectly moist, and the famed fried chicken was as good as advertised. The one drawback to the food was dessert, which was decidedly less inspired than the main courses; we'll be skipping it in the future.So why four stars? The restaurant itself is beautifully appointed, light, and open. The service is friendly and prompt. And they have a list of wines and draft beers (not to mention the full bar and cocktail list) to complement their superb food offerings. Unfortunately, we went to dinner on the early side of dinner (thank you, visiting parents), and in Carroll Gardens that means children are afoot. There is some inevitability to that - people do have kids, after all - but it is all but impossible to savor a glass of wine or enjoy a plate of steamed mussels when someone's child is running between the tables and neither the restaurant nor the parents seem inclined to do anything about it. My advice (which I will be heeding): go later, wait in line, and enjoy your meal without any children around.",4.0
"OMG!!! This is a FANTASTIC brunch spot, and while I want to save it for myself, it happens to be too good not to share. The food is delicious, especially the Pecan Pie French Toast! I only gave them a 4/5 because of the decor and the noise level. The place is VERY plain, and looks unfinished, and not in a very posh way. As for the noise I understand and even enjoy a lively establishment, however hearing the music blaring over brunch is a bit much, especially when it's ""get down on it"", which I find oddly inappropriate for an 11am brunch on Sunday.Overall, give this place a try and see what you think...",4.0
Loved brunch here. I recommend the eggs florentine!  Not sure that it is always worth the crazy wait time though... We waited 45 minutes for 2 people on a Saturday aroun 11:45. Come just when they open or during off hours.,4.0
"Buttermilk please! Everything about this brunch spot was the perfect touch to my morning. The locale, the atmosphere, the people, and the food all made for deliciousness. I loved that every brunch entree came with your choice of mimosa, bellini, or sparkling wine. How did they know? My fried pork chop and cheddar waffles could not have been more tasty! The pork chop was surprisingly juicy and the waffles tasted freshly made. I  YUM! I couldn't help but share an order of buttermilk pancakes with my husband. They were perfectly soft melt in your mouth goodness in every bite. I haven't had better. WANT SOME NOW!My husband ordered their in-house smoked salmon that tasted super yummy too! I loved how the eggs were still a little runny and not overcooked - just how they should be. Buttermilk Channel was possibly one of the best brunch spots I've ever been to. Being from Chicago where Brunch is a MUST, this spot tops it all. I just wish I could travel to Brooklyn every week for my buttermilk pancake fix. My stomach is smiling at me right now... :)",5.0
"This review is for brunch on Saturday.I was a bit worried about the wait after reading the reviews, but it turned out this place is nowhere near Clinton St Bakery's wait, where you have to get there before opening or else wait forever. There was a sale I wanted to check out at noon, so I didn't want a huge wait. I got there at 10:15. I would say that there was no wait (for small parties) until 11am. The restaurant is extremely well lit and decorated conservatively. We sat at the bar. I started with coffee and OJ. The OJ looked freshly squeezed, but it actually isn't. Sad face. The bloody marys looked popular and I would've gotten one, if I were in a diff state of mind. Service was attentive, but not obtrusive. I think our dishes came out fairly quick. There was no 'omg, I'm starving, where is our food' moments. On to the food:- Fried pork chop and cheddar waffles with maple syrup. This is the perfect dish for those who love sweet and savory. The pork chop was pretty lean and perfectly fried/seasoned. The cheddar waffles (two pieces) reminded me of cheez its, in a good way. The perfect bite consists of a piece of each, dunked in maple syrup. Portion size was large. - Short rib hash with over easy eggs and toast. Also, well executed. Not fatty at all. - Short stack of buttermilk pancakes. I guess it is difficult to go to a place with buttermilk in the name and not try their pancakes. The pancakes are served with butter and more maple syrup. It is on the richer side. Each bite reminds me of a nice shortbread cookie. This is a solid brunch place. Unless you have a particular hankering for one of their offerings (their menu is extensive, unique) or live close by, I would save it for special occasions.",4.0

That's my drink review.We split the Chicken Liver Mousse and the Rabbit Rillettes. Both excellent.I had the Duck Meatloaf, which was outstanding. It tasted like unicorn meat (magical and soft). It came with one onion ring, but the ring was so big it was like maybe five onion rings combined into one. The best part about the onion ring was that it was crispy and didn't slug on your face (you know how sometimes you bite into an onion ring and the whole sloppy soggy onion comes out and burns your chin with all its grease? Yeah, it didn't do that). Lastly, on the bottom, was the ginger puree. Lighter than mashes potatoes and sweeter in taste, it went perfectly with my loaf of dead duck and fried onion circlet (which was so big I could have worn it as a small crown). As we ate, McChubbin  began arguing with his girlfriend. ""I have allergies to cats and to dogs,"" he complained, ""and I want you to take that more seriously. It's like every time I tell you, you just shrug me off. I want to be comfortable! Breathing is something I actually enjoy!"" I could see her body heaving with her deep sighs. I wondered what she was doing with such a Khaki pants monster. He went on to complain about her ""saying what he wanted to hear but not being genuine enough about it"" and later exclaimed ""I MADE A MISTAKE I DONT KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU!"" when she quietly countered his attacks with a comment of her own. My friend got the burger, which was forgettable. I forgot that he had it until I asked him. He liked it. He described it as ""whatever.""Watching McChubbin  made me think of a great idea for a sitcom: The Most Annoying Man in the World. It would be about a guy who everyone hates, even the audience. No redeeming qualities. Nothing remotely likable about that person. Just an annoying, pretentious, anal, condescending-yet-unintelligent dude who walks around being The Most Annoying Man in the World. We also had the house pickles, which were good but ""just pickles."" They could have come from a jar.

"Today was the first time I went to Buttermilk Channel.Yes, I'm aware that everybody on Yelp  loves this place and yes, we all know that Beyoncé loves it too but my experience was not as positive.My friend and I arrived around 12:30 and surprisingly, were promptly seated.The problem was that our food arrived about 45 minutes or slightly more later! I would have rather waited for a table than be seated and wait for the food endlessly.Whenever we asked the hostess or waiter about our food, we were promised it would be out ""any minute"" which of course, was not the case.Service (meaning water refills) were a bit sloppy too as I had an empty glass for quite sometime.A few minutes before our food arrived, the waiter served us 2 donuts on the house (which was a nice gesture but would have been appreciated 15 minutes before that as we were really hungry).We shared the buttermilk pancakes which was just about the best pancakes I have ever tried (not heavy and dense but fluffy with a batter like taste) and the omelet with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms which was served with a side salad and one hash brown. This was equally good.I don't doubt other items on the menu are also good or dinner for that matter, but to wait so long for our food (when it seemed other people were being served) was pretty annoying mostly b/c we each had an appointment and I felt that I had to eat quickly.Service wasn't good but the food was and although I wouldn't go as far to say it was worth the wait---b/c I don't appreciate waiting so long for anything, I would give it another try.My score would have been higher if it wasn't for the ridiculous wait.",3.0

"I shlepped all the way to Carroll Gardens knowing I'd have to go even further home but it was well worth the trip.I appreciated the restaurant's atmosphere and home-like feel.  The menu was pretentious but the ambiance was not.  A little discouraged by the unique choices, I came for one and only thing:  fried chicken.Monday nights they have a $25 menu special, which consists of 3 courses, an appetizer, entree and dessert.  One is left with two choices in each course.When you first sit down, they bring you honey glazed popovers with a dash of sea salt.  Absolutely delicious, but I warn you that you should eat these with a fork and knife and not your hands.  If you use your hands, be prepared to get up and go wash your hands in the bathroom because you will get the honey all over them.Next course, sweet potato soup with crostini with pumpkin butter spread.  I think the soup also may have had butternut squash in it.  It was delicious, natural, and something I think I could make at home.  I would have liked to see a dollop of creme fraiche on top.  (FYI the crostini can be sticky too so be careful when handling).Entree, fried chicken.  It's pretty much half of an entire chicken, so go hungry.  The chicken has a perfect layer of fried goodness on top that was so good I could have eaten it by itself.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Underneath you find two large waffels which honestly I lost my interest in them because I was so into the chicken.  There was a side of syrup which I think had a cherry flavor but I'm not certain, and the cole slaw that didn't have any mayo was a great side.  Our waiter was really nice and served us a side of mashed potatoes on the house.  I get there was tons of food, but if you go you should order the mashed potatoes, they were fluffy and I could have had the entire container if I wasn't sharing it with other people.Dessert - Coffee pot de creme.  So creamy and delightful.  The coffee beans on top cracked as I bit down and got stuck in my teeth so I could have gone without that, and I wasn't really interested in the cookies that came along with it.To sum it up, the service was great, the Monday night special was a bargain, and the restaurant itself was inviting. I would recommend this place and it was worth the trip.",5.0
"Drool....  I've been here for all manner of dining - dinner, brunch, the Monday special, the liquid kind.  Each time makes me love it more and more.First, great cocktails and beers by the bottle or draft.  Start off with a libation, move on to the menu, which is divided into the snacks, shellfish, cheese/ charcuterie, first and main courses.  Highlights include the spice-rubbed ribs, duck meatloaf, berkshire chop, fired chicken, uhm, wait they are all highlights.  Brunch offerings include some modified versions of their dinner menu, with eggs.  Yes, please! Remember, Monday night 3 course special is a deal for $25.  Also, random celebrity sighting here, from the whataretheydoinginbrooklyn variety (Tyra Banks) to the more expected (Josh Hartnett).",5.0
"I'm sorry to give it such a low rate, but the food was just... bad...I don't understand what people like that much about their dishes.We had the MAPLE & BACON ROASTED ALMONDS and the GRILLED FLATBREAD as appetizers. The almonds and bacon were just a bad combination, as for the flat bread, the cheese had no taste and all I could feel was a lot of lemon juice.As an entree we had CAPUTO'S FRESH LINGUINI and the DUCK MEATLOAF.The pastas were very plain and the aspargus were not cooked. I remember thinking ""how on earth could they mess up pastas?"". The duck was a small dish soaking in its sauce on a very thin layer of puree, the jam was nowhere to be found.We then had a crumble and a chocolate cake. Both very plain and not really tasty too... I always finish my dessert, I didn't this time.Overall we thought they just tried to be originals but it didn't work out and they kept the recipes anyway. It's not cheap and I actually liked none of my dish, it's the first time it happens to me! Waiters were very nice though.I will go back to try their vg monday menu and maybe brunch, but only because of all the amazing reviews I think we might have come at a bad time and it's worth trying another menu.

That's my drink review.We split the Chicken Liver Mousse and the Rabbit Rillettes. Both excellent.I had the Duck Meatloaf, which was outstanding. It tasted like unicorn meat (magical and soft). It came with one onion ring, but the ring was so big it was like maybe five onion rings combined into one. The best part about the onion ring was that it was crispy and didn't slug on your face (you know how sometimes you bite into an onion ring and the whole sloppy soggy onion comes out and burns your chin with all its grease? Yeah, it didn't do that). Lastly, on the bottom, was the ginger puree. Lighter than mashes potatoes and sweeter in taste, it went perfectly with my loaf of dead duck and fried onion circlet (which was so big I could have worn it as a small crown). As we ate, McChubbin  began arguing with his girlfriend. ""I have allergies to cats and to dogs,"" he complained, ""and I want you to take that more seriously. It's like every time I tell you, you just shrug me off. I want to be comfortable! Breathing is something I actually enjoy!"" I could see her body heaving with her deep sighs. I wondered what she was doing with such a Khaki pants monster. He went on to complain about her ""saying what he wanted to hear but not being genuine enough about it"" and later exclaimed ""I MADE A MISTAKE I DONT KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU!"" when she quietly countered his attacks with a comment of her own. My friend got the burger, which was forgettable. I forgot that he had it until I asked him. He liked it. He described it as ""whatever.""Watching McChubbin  made me think of a great idea for a sitcom: The Most Annoying Man in the World. It would be about a guy who everyone hates, even the audience. No redeeming qualities. Nothing remotely likable about that person. Just an annoying, pretentious, anal, condescending-yet-unintelligent dude who walks around being The Most Annoying Man in the World. We also had the house pickles, which were good but ""just pickles."" They could have come from a jar. Buttermilk Channel's outdoor seating area is dog-friendly as long as your dog sits outside the little barrier-thing, which allows him to stay super close to you while staying out of the server's way.

"Today was the first time I went to Buttermilk Channel.Yes, I'm aware that everybody on Yelp  loves this place and yes, we all know that Beyoncé loves it too but my experience was not as positive.My friend and I arrived around 12:30 and surprisingly, were promptly seated.The problem was that our food arrived about 45 minutes or slightly more later! I would have rather waited for a table than be seated and wait for the food endlessly.Whenever we asked the hostess or waiter about our food, we were promised it would be out ""any minute"" which of course, was not the case.Service (meaning water refills) were a bit sloppy too as I had an empty glass for quite sometime.A few minutes before our food arrived, the waiter served us 2 donuts on the house (which was a nice gesture but would have been appreciated 15 minutes before that as we were really hungry).We shared the buttermilk pancakes which was just about the best pancakes I have ever tried (not heavy and dense but fluffy with a batter like taste) and the omelet with goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms which was served with a side salad and one hash brown. This was equally good.I don't doubt other items on the menu are also good or dinner for that matter, but to wait so long for our food (when it seemed other people were being served) was pretty annoying mostly b/c we each had an appointment and I felt that I had to eat quickly.Service wasn't good but the food was and although I wouldn't go as far to say it was worth the wait---b/c I don't appreciate waiting so long for anything, I would give it another try.My score would have been higher if it wasn't for the ridiculous wait.",3.0
The service was excellent.  The atmosphere as well. I had the Duck Meatloaf and it was great.  No one in my party had a complaint about the food.  I will definitely be back when I am in the neighborhood.,5.0
Nice spot in the hood  with nice ambiance and food.  I had the chicken and waffles which I can't say was the beat I've had but definitely still enjoyable.  I'm sure everything else is good as well based on the fact that everyone I'm came with enjoyed there meal.,4.0
"I shlepped all the way to Carroll Gardens knowing I'd have to go even further home but it was well worth the trip.I appreciated the restaurant's atmosphere and home-like feel.  The menu was pretentious but the ambiance was not.  A little discouraged by the unique choices, I came for one and only thing:  fried chicken.Monday nights they have a $25 menu special, which consists of 3 courses, an appetizer, entree and dessert.  One is left with two choices in each course.When you first sit down, they bring you honey glazed popovers with a dash of sea salt.  Absolutely delicious, but I warn you that you should eat these with a fork and knife and not your hands.  If you use your hands, be prepared to get up and go wash your hands in the bathroom because you will get the honey all over them.Next course, sweet potato soup with crostini with pumpkin butter spread.  I think the soup also may have had butternut squash in it.  It was delicious, natural, and something I think I could make at home.  I would have liked to see a dollop of creme fraiche on top.  (FYI the crostini can be sticky too so be careful when handling).Entree, fried chicken.  It's pretty much half of an entire chicken, so go hungry.  The chicken has a perfect layer of fried goodness on top that was so good I could have eaten it by itself.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Underneath you find two large waffels which honestly I lost my interest in them because I was so into the chicken.  There was a side of syrup which I think had a cherry flavor but I'm not certain, and the cole slaw that didn't have any mayo was a great side.  Our waiter was really nice and served us a side of mashed potatoes on the house.  I get there was tons of food, but if you go you should order the mashed potatoes, they were fluffy and I could have had the entire container if I wasn't sharing it with other people.Dessert - Coffee pot de creme.  So creamy and delightful.  The coffee beans on top cracked as I bit down and got stuck in my teeth so I could have gone without that, and I wasn't really interested in the cookies that came along with it.To sum it up, the service was great, the Monday night special was a bargain, and the restaurant itself was inviting. I would recommend this place and it was worth the trip.",5.0
"Drool....  I've been here for all manner of dining - dinner, brunch, the Monday special, the liquid kind.  Each time makes me love it more and more.First, great cocktails and beers by the bottle or draft.  Start off with a libation, move on to the menu, which is divided into the snacks, shellfish, cheese/ charcuterie, first and main courses.  Highlights include the spice-rubbed ribs, duck meatloaf, berkshire chop, fired chicken, uhm, wait they are all highlights.  Brunch offerings include some modified versions of their dinner menu, with eggs.  Yes, please! Remember, Monday night 3 course special is a deal for $25.  Also, random celebrity sighting here, from the whataretheydoinginbrooklyn variety (Tyra Banks) to the more expected (Josh Hartnett).",5.0
"I'm sorry to give it such a low rate, but the food was just... bad...I don't understand what people like that much about their dishes.We had the MAPLE & BACON ROASTED ALMONDS and the GRILLED FLATBREAD as appetizers. The almonds and bacon were just a bad combination, as for the flat bread, the cheese had no taste and all I could feel was a lot of lemon juice.As an entree we had CAPUTO'S FRESH LINGUINI and the DUCK MEATLOAF.The pastas were very plain and the aspargus were not cooked. I remember thinking ""how on earth could they mess up pastas?"". The duck was a small dish soaking in its sauce on a very thin layer of puree, the jam was nowhere to be found.We then had a crumble and a chocolate cake. Both very plain and not really tasty too... I always finish my dessert, I didn't this time.Overall we thought they just tried to be originals but it didn't work out and they kept the recipes anyway. It's not cheap and I actually liked none of my dish, it's the first time it happens to me! Waiters were very nice though.I will go back to try their vg monday menu and maybe brunch, but only because of all the amazing reviews I think we might have come at a bad time and it's worth trying another menu. Maybe diner is just not their strong suit.",2.0
"I have been to Buttermilk 3 times....only once have I managed to actually eat here as there is generally at least an hour to a 2 hour wait on a table.  The place is extremely busy and anyone who has had the pleasure of having one of their pancake stacks and expertly made late's would know.  The service is fantastic, last time I ate here we were given a free glass of prosecco by the bartender and he shared a few laughs with us.I decided I was going to be a fatty and order a scramble for myself and a stack to share with my girlfriend.  The stack was awesome, 6 pancakes covered in butter and maple syrup, the pancakes were as light and fluffy as a cumulous cloud and I was a happy man.  Then my scramble came, I have to admit I was less than enthused with it.  I ordered the saussage and pepper scramble, it was dry, flavourless and to be honest not worth the $12 clams.So, if you're going to Buttermilk Channel, I strongly urge you to stick to its name and order the pancakes, the eggs are, on a level of 10 to balls....well...balls.  However, the pancakes were and service were top notch.",3.0

"I really want to love Buttermilk Channel. I really, really, really do. The food is definitely five stars but the service is bordering on three. I'm torn on giving it four stars, but here you go. Four shiny stars.Weekday evenings are probably less crowded than the weekends, especially for brunch! And they don't take reservations, so you'll have to take your chances then.The fried chicken with the cheddar waffles are a must! The skin of the chicken bursts with flavor and is crispy, an essential for fried chicken. The seasoning and flavors are perfection.Service is a bit strange and awkward. We had two different people waiting on us, asking us the same questions, even after we explained that the other person was helping us. We were waiting for our food when we saw our plates delivered to the table next to us. They had ordered the same thing. And they had ordered after us. It was difficult to flag down someone to get my water refilled. The delivery of the check was very strange as well. After we received the bill, they only charged the card for a portion of the meal.  Nice, discount, right? But being a woman of the utmost integrity, I pointed that out to them so they could fix it. Charge me more, darn it! That was a strange incident.Even with these strange mishaps, Buttermilk Channel still manages to be a 4 star establishment, as fried chicken speaks the language of my heart. I guess that's cholesterol.",4.0

"I went here with a big group on Saturday night and we had a great time. The restaurant is very small but with a reservation you have no problem getting seated. The food is excellent. Everything we had from the duck meatloaf to the BBQ oysters, to the steak was really tasty and delicious. The drink selection was good as well, though I do think they could use a few more wines on their list. My only negative was that it is quite pricey at nearly $200 a couple for an app, dinner, and then 2-3 drinks. It's definitely worth trying though.",5.0

"Short rib hash and Cheddar waffle.  Too bad they don't have their fried chicken for brunch.Saw this place on the cooking channel and knew I had to try the chicken and waffles here.

That is exactly what you have to do with short ribs in order to melt all the fat and end up with meltingly tender beef. This is what hash should be. I'm use to hash being mostly potatoes and a little main event. This hash was definitely mostly main event with the potatoes going along for the ride. The short rib meat was so tender and it looked like that some of the vegetables that were cooked with it were included in the hash. I have to admit that I'm not much of a fan of waffles However, I think I may have found the waffle that has changed my mind. The combination of the sweet maple syrup with the salty tang of the cheddar was a party in my mouth. I love it when sweet and salty come together in perfect marriage.

"One of my favorite meals in Brooklyn,by far.  I have been meaning to make it out to this destination for some time.  My deep love of southern food and fried chicken made this place seem perfect, and in many ways it was.We opted out of the prefix special on Mondays, just so we can try more stuff on the menu.  We started out with the bbq'd oysters which were fantastic.  Considering, I shuck about 100 a day, it was nice to have them prepared in a completely different way.  After that, we had the flat bread.  The ricotta was delicious, but it seemed very thin and soggy by the time we were halfway done eating it.  It was nice to see the squash blossom/ricotta combination done differently, rather than stuffing and deep frying it.Then for our main courses we had the fried chicken and waffle, and the duck meatloaf.  I thought the fried chicken was fantastic.  The crispiest I've had.  I wish I knew how they do it.  It is seasoned perfectly.  The coleslaw was terrible and disappointing at most.  It tasted bland as could be.  I am not sure, but maybe they just cut some up some cabbage and put it on the plate.  The waffle was pretty good.  I only got an aftertaste of cheddar, wish it was more flavorful.  The duck meatloaf was delicious.  The onion rings on top were great, I am pretty sure it's the same batter as the fried chicken because both were equally crunchy.  The corn pudding was weird, seemed just like shucked corn on the plate with some seasonings.  I usually want corn pudding to be baked goodness.  We finished with the pecan pie sundae which was pretty good.  I was surprised.  I thought it would be a real pecan pie with vanilla ice cream, rather than a deconstructed version, but still very tasty.  The drinks were okay.  I had two beers which were alright.  I thought the service was good, but way too overwhelming.  I thought after the 4th person asked us if we needed anything it was time to chill out.  I like good service, but sometimes I am just trying to unwind and do not need someone interrupting every sentence I try to have.  The server was knowledgeable about the menu, but honestly, I don't feel I need to know what ricotta is.  Overall, great experience, I would love to try brunch, but the massive wait leaves me astray.",4.0

BONUS!We ordered scrambles which were delicious.  But the thing to die for is the buttermilk pancakes.. I am pretty sure they are made with crack.. so fluffy and tasty.  Then they add this amazing maple syrup.. yum.   SERIOUS YUM-TASTIC.  Next time I need to try the biscuits :)",4.0

"One of my favorite meals in Brooklyn,by far.  I have been meaning to make it out to this destination for some time.  My deep love of southern food and fried chicken made this place seem perfect, and in many ways it was.We opted out of the prefix special on Mondays, just so we can try more stuff on the menu.  We started out with the bbq'd oysters which were fantastic.  Considering, I shuck about 100 a day, it was nice to have them prepared in a completely different way.  After that, we had the flat bread.  The ricotta was delicious, but it seemed very thin and soggy by the time we were halfway done eating it.  It was nice to see the squash blossom/ricotta combination done differently, rather than stuffing and deep frying it.Then for our main courses we had the fried chicken and waffle, and the duck meatloaf.  I thought the fried chicken was fantastic.  The crispiest I've had.  I wish I knew how they do it.  It is seasoned perfectly.  The coleslaw was terrible and disappointing at most.  It tasted bland as could be.  I am not sure, but maybe they just cut some up some cabbage and put it on the plate.  The waffle was pretty good.  I only got an aftertaste of cheddar, wish it was more flavorful.  The duck meatloaf was delicious.  The onion rings on top were great, I am pretty sure it's the same batter as the fried chicken because both were equally crunchy.  The corn pudding was weird, seemed just like shucked corn on the plate with some seasonings.  I usually want corn pudding to be baked goodness.  We finished with the pecan pie sundae which was pretty good.  I was surprised.  I thought it would be a real pecan pie with vanilla ice cream, rather than a deconstructed version, but still very tasty.  The drinks were okay.  I had two beers which were alright.  I thought the service was good, but way too overwhelming.  I thought after the 4th person asked us if we needed anything it was time to chill out.  I like good service, but sometimes I am just trying to unwind and do not need someone interrupting every sentence I try to have.  The server was knowledgeable about the menu, but honestly, I don't feel I need to know what ricotta is.  Overall, great experience, I would love to try brunch, but the massive wait leaves me astray.",4.0
"Though I do not venture into Brooklyn often.. this place was definitely worth it.  My friend who lives in Brooklyn talked me to go to Buttermilk Channel.  What a treat!  We put our names on the list.  But luckily a few seats opened up at the bar, so we snagged those.  I love sitting at the bar anyway - great people watching, you usually get your food pretty quickly and bartenders usually have great recommendations.  Oh yeah and Solange Knowles sat at the bar next to me.. BONUS!We ordered scrambles which were delicious.  But the thing to die for is the buttermilk pancakes.. I am pretty sure they are made with crack.. so fluffy and tasty.  Then they add this amazing maple syrup.. yum.   SERIOUS YUM-TASTIC.  Next time I need to try the biscuits :)",4.0
"Up a star.  I had the fried chicken again.  It's a little ""bready"" in spots, but it's super juicy and delish.  And the mashed potatos are buttery melty goodness.  Maybe eating at 12:30 am is the secret.",4.0
The food here was EXCELLENT. It is unfortunate that my niece and I sat at the bar because the barmaid was very unfriendly and seemed disgusted the whole time. We tipped her only 15% because she gave us such poor service and had almost a hostile-like attitude. I will go back to buttermilk but will wait for a table rather than sit at the bar.,4.0
"Nestled cozily in the middle of nowhere, Brooklyn (I live in Bushwick and it took me 25 mins, driving time, to get here) sits Buttermilk Channel. I came with my friend/co-worker for some  monday-funday eats and was beyond impressed with the staff, service, drink, food, and most importantly, DESSERT!!I hadn't planned on eating much since we were initially there on a dessert crawl. My friend and I both ordered from the appetizer section although my falling off the bone Spare Ribs, paired with a side order of fries was the perfect amount of food! My friend got the flatbread (she was on her vegetarian kick). I didn't try any because I was face deep in my ribs! Mmm! For dessert we had ... EVERYTHING! Well, not exactly. But we had the Coconut Pot de Creme, Chocolate chunk bread pudding, and the black cherry Bourbon tart. The Pot de Creme and bread pudding were some of the best desserts I've had, anywhere! The black cherry tart didn't tickle my fancy as much as the others but it wasn't bad and I definitely had a star-crossed love affair with the crust. All in all I will definitely be making the trek back to Buttermilk Channel for some amazing food, mind blowing desserts, and the most comforting bathroom ever.",5.0
"I dined one wintry Tuesday night with two Southern guys who fiercely believe they ""know fried chicken."" Each guy told a tale of his mamma's great recipe. We'd arrived a bit early and there were few occupied tables so I was a nervous that the guys would be disappointed. They were happy to see the bar had a very special bourbon. They ordered it and began to feel that indeed coming to Carroll Gardens was a good idea. I was surprised when they then ordered the fried chicken (after their trash talk). I guess they wanted to put us Northerners to shame. They had to eat their words as they ate with real gusto the fabulous signature chicken of Buttermilk Channel. They loved it! And the restaurant filled up completely while we were there, showing how very popular it is.  Plus we had a  great waitress. She had the kind of ""attitude"" that makes for an entertaining evening - the guys loved her too.  All around the service was just right.  And I was thrilled when my colleagues from the deep South treated me to dinner.  Very sweet like the tasty desserts we enjoyed.  Can't wait to take my husband to BC.",5.0

"Rolled up at 11 am on a Saturday, hungover from my birthday festivities and looking to come in out of the sunshine on Court St so I could stop sweating beer.  Sat right down at a table for two and ordered the classic bloody mary, complete with homemade pickle, it was spicy and delicious and helped bring me back to life.  I ordered the eggs and short rib hash--delicious but a bit fatty and gamey.  Then I tried my dining companion's deep fried pork chop and cheddar waffles...why is there anything else on the menu??  It is so crispy and juicy and unbelievably flavorful, every bite left me incredulous as to how something could taste so good.  If you do want to go healthy, they had a really good looking oatmeal and fruit salad too but when I go back I know what I'm getting!",5.0

"Buttermilk Channel.I didn't realize that it was named after an actual body of water. I thought it was named after the buttermilk fried chicken.Which wouldn't be that bad. I heard about the restaurant in my search for chicken and waffles. The waffles didn't disappoint. The chicken...surprisingly did. Which is why the restaurant gets 4 stars.While the buttermilk crust has a delicious crunch and the chicken was juicy (borderline undercooked but just right), I guess I was expecting a little more flavor in the actual chicken itself.It is a wonderful restaurant. It seats about 50 I would say, so it's not the largest space, but the environment and ambiance is cozy and comfortable - AKA - perfect date spot. They don't do reservations for less than 6 so watch your timing - this place fills up quickly and the wait can be kind of long (mines was about 30-45 minutes).The service was great and for you beer and wine connoisseurs, there's a great selection (not fond of it myself).The cheddar waffles are delicious. Not too cheesy, but a good hint of cheddar and sweetness in the dough. The syrup was a nice flavor with a fruity reduction taste.The 'bread service' honey with salt popovers would be so much better if they weren't as brown and crispy as they were.Also, the dessert? Marvelous. I had the chocolate bread pudding with salted butterscotch and side of their ice cream - yummo.The prices are a bit high ($15-20+ for an entree), but the environment, ambiance, and service are worth it.

"Came here for dinner on a Monday night.  No reservation and no wait.  The neighborhood is gorgeous and the ambiance is very low-key romantic.  Our waitress was a witty fun gal.  On Mondays they do a pre-fixe 3 course menu (in addition to the regular menu) for only $28.  I highly recommend it.  We tried the Hack and fried chicken.  The fish was good, but you can't compete with fried chicken.  We ordered a few apps, all good portions.  The mussels are a must and the bread they give you beforehand was probably the best part of the meal.  Don't pass up the pecan pie sundae; I don't like pecans but loved this!  Overall excellent dinner.",4.0
"I visit my family in NYC quite a bit and stay at their home. This time, my wife and I decided to try out staying in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, not only for a change in pace but to see how the area has transformed from the time I used to attend Polytech.My nephews, who live in the area, said we had to try out Buttermilk Channel. The menu looked great so we headed over to meet them (plus one of my nephew's girlfriend) there on a Tuesday night. It's a smallish size place but the atmosphere was pretty cool and we were set up with a table right by the window. The wait staff was very attentive and service was overall pretty good. Another thing we all liked was the nice draft beer menu as well as the good wine list (not too expensive).We each started out with an appetizer. I had the butternut squash and pumpkin soup. That was made with coconut milk not cream which was not only great for the flavors, it was perfect for those who are lactose intolerant! Super tasty without the heavy cream overtones. My wfe had the kale salad to start and loved it. For the main course, all the guys picked one of their Tuesday dinner specials, the lamb shank. I've got to say that it was one of the better lamb meals I've had in a while (big thumbs up). It was both a decent size portion plus the meat was tender and nicely cooked. In was served over spinach and mashed patatoes. My wife had the squash tart for dinner and enjoyed it as well.Definitely a place I'd return to.",4.0

"This is my neighborhood spot, and one of my favorite restaurants ever. First, the people. Jennifer at the door is wonderful--she has an incredible memory for faces and names and she is just such a lovely, warm person. I never asked the cute bartender's name (the one who often wears a newsboy cap), but when I eat dinner alone at the bar from time to time, he's efficient and noninvasive (he can also be charming and dryly amusing when I'm feeling chatty). The owner is there a lot, and quite friendly. The waitstaff is competent and professional. Next, the food. Their menu is a locavore's delight, with a southern twist. Did you know they have a vegetarian menu if you ask? I really like the fact that they have small bites in case you want a little snack and not a big appetizer. From the snacks menu, the bacon almonds are a standout. If you're in the mood for something a bit more substantial in the way of appetizers, they usually have at least one excellent soup on the menu. I've also tried their ribs, which are delicious and as big as an entree at many places. Their sides are great too--in particular, the fries and seasonal side veggies are consistently great. You can't go wrong with any of their entrees, but my favorites are the lamb salad and the duck meatloaf. I also love their steak, and they always have one or two excellent fish dishes. I enjoy their fried chicken with waffles as well, but as far as southern-style restaurants go, this dish is a bit trite. Maybe go to a true soul food restaurant if you're craving chicken and waffles and don't bother with it here--they have so many other standouts.They always have a great selection of (local) beers and wines, and inventive, cheekily named cocktails (the Carlos Danger, anyone?) As far as desserts are concerned, the real standout is the pecan pie sundae. To die for. Truly. I always order a half portion because it is so rich! When I don't want something sweet, I go for the cheese plate. The sourness of the pickled grapes, crunchiness of the toasted french bred, and sweetness of the honey counterbalance nicely with the creamy/saltiness of the cheese. I'm starting to get hungry just thinking about it.Their brunch is great too. I usually order one of the scrambles and a side of fries. Delicious!The unfortunate thing about this restaurant is that it is almost ALWAYS crowded, and doesn't take reservations for small parties (I think you need like 6 or 8 people to make a reservation). Expect to wait at least 45 minutes, sometimes more than three hours. I think one of the reasons for this is the food is great and isn't that expensive. You could try on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, and you may get lucky. Another trick is find a friend who lives nearby and put your names in in advance (you have to do it in person), and then hang out at your friend's place until they call you. Or you could swig by the Mexican restaurant next door (they have decent margaritas), grab some chips and a beer, and hang out there until they call you.If you can handle waiting a little bit for something good, by all means you must go there.",5.0
"As vegetarians, Bf and I don't usually go to these types of new-American/comfort/southern restaurants because we find them to be expensive, over-hyped, and not very vegetarian-friendly anyway since there's been such a huge resurgence of bacon and duck in the past few years.But, we were invited to a birthday dinner here, and I was so excited upon reading that they offer a separate vegetarian menu.I know this place is way popular, so I was surprised that my friend was able to get a reservation for a large party of 8. So of course I was not surprised that we ended up having to wait for over 45 minutes to be seated. They were very apologetic about it though, and offered us some dishes of their maple and bacon almonds and hush puppies during our wait, and I did appreciate that.Here's my review on the (vegetarian) items we had throughout the night:Hush puppies: Ok, came with this spicy/creamy dipping sauce that was nice.House-made pickles: Ok I guess? I didn't love them but I'm generally not a big fan of pickles anyway.Popovers: Dry, burnt, underwhelming.Fries: Good, crispy. It's pretty bad if you mess up fries.Cauliflower/apple soup: Delicious. Thick, warm, a little sweet. A little cup of comfort with some crispy croutons on top.Fresh-pulled mozzarella appetizer: Cheese tasted very fresh but kind of bland. Nothing else memorable on the plate: couple pieces of bread, balsamic vinegar.Linguini: Vegetarians beware: we suspected that it might have been cooked with chicken stock. It tasted like chicken, and it there was a telling film of animal-like oil in the dish. Pretty mediocre overall, and I just picked at all the mushrooms in the dish since I just like mushrooms.Cheddar waffles: Ugh, nothing good on this plate. Waffles were dry and burnt. Brussels sprouts were overwhelmingly salty. Coleslaw was just coleslaw. I again picked at all the mushrooms from the plate because I like mushrooms, even if overcooked.Pecan pie sundae: It was just sweet stuff piled into a milkshake glass, had no depth. Unmemorable.We surely won't be back again, but clearly, they will be fine without us.",2.0
"Brooklyn is becoming the new place to go to for great food.  Restaurants are too expensive to open in Manhattan so all the chefs are coming to Brooklyn.  A short subway ride is definitely worth it to try all the great restaurants.  I read a review about Buttermilk Channel being the best new restaurant, but I read the New York Times review, and it only got 1.5 or 2 stars.  Apparently when this place first opened it was hard to get a table for supper, we went at 6:00 PM for supper and we were the first for their dinner rush.  So many places you go to, they serve you a lack luster bread basket, but at BC they serve you a popover, which was a tasty change.  For our mains i chose the ever popular duck meatloaf.  In the description i saw my favourite words:meatloaf, and onion ring.  For 20 dollars the portion size was generous.  The meatloaf was good, moist but not amazing.  My fav part of the dish was the creamed corn.  It was creamy and sweet from the fresh corn.  If it were just these 2 items i would have given it 4 stars, but the onion ring killed it.  It was about 2 inches thick and the breading on it was not crisp, it was so thick and tough to cut through.  My sis had the scallops with fennel and rhubarb.  My dish was comfort food and hers was a light Californian dish.  The flavours were bright and light.  Her only complaint was that the pieces of rhubarb were far too large.  Overall the dishes sound great on the menu, but there are too many technical errors, they really need to test run more of their recipes.",2.0

"Did you know that Buttermilk Channel was the name of the (walkable) channel that used to exist between Brooklyn and Governor's Island?

We arrived here for the Monday night prix-fixe, and everything was divine. The salad, fried chicken and cheddar waffles (or the bacon wrapped trout - we did exchange a few pieces), and the pecan ice cream sundae were all delicious. At $25 a set, it was practically a steal. The greatest find of the night was probably the Torrentes wine. Recommended by both the bartender and our waiter, the wine is more ""orange"" (fermented with the grape skin) rather than white and it was a wonderfully complex and full wine.

"Genius...one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. ~ Thomas EdisonIt is quite apparent that a lot of perspiration, serious thought and hard work have been invested into Buttermilk Channel.  As a tribute to the area's history, the  restaurant  is named for the tidal strait between Brooklyn and Governor's Island in New York harbor (not their well known buttermilk fried chicken).  The deceptively simple decor creates an incredibly warm and cozy atmosphere through the use of strategic lighting.  Everyone on the staff appears to be warm, friendly and extremely efficient.All the menus (brunch, kids, vegetarian, dinner and dessert) are all very well thought out, with careful attention to quality food sources and artisanal preparations.  Items, such as the house-made pickles, ham and foie gras terrine, buttermilk whipped potatos, buttermilk fried chicken and pecan pie sundae, can make you mouth water just by reading the menu.  The dishes delivered to each table are creatively plated edible art work.  The complementary popovers are a lovely way to start a meal which by every indication would be perfect.Unfortunately, my meal was a bit of a let down.  I started with house made pickles which were OK.  An order of duck meatloaf followed.  Although it was well cooked and moist, the meatloaf was  bland. I yearned for my spice rack.  My companion's warm lamb salad was also bland.  The ham and foie gras terrine was enjoyable. (I have a weakness for foie gras and almost any cured pork product.)  I also enjoyed the pecan pie sundae despite (or maybe because of) the sugar coma which resulted.  Frankly, the only item which lived up to my expectations was one which we did not even order, the grilled pole beans with lemon and sea salt.  They were simple and absolutely divine!  A lovely couple seated at a neighboring table took pity on me after seeing our disappointment with the meal, and allowed me to sample their order.I cannot fault the efforts of Buttermilk Channel.  It is a good restaurant which excels in many ways; however, I do hope  the team finds the 1% inspiration needed to bring the food up to the level of the rest of its efforts.  For now, it is only practically perfect.",4.0

(I have a weakness for foie gras and almost any cured pork product.)  I also enjoyed the pecan pie sundae despite (or maybe because of) the sugar coma which resulted.  Frankly, the only item which lived up to my expectations was one which we did not even order, the grilled pole beans with lemon and sea salt.  They were simple and absolutely divine!  A lovely couple seated at a neighboring table took pity on me after seeing our disappointment with the meal, and allowed me to sample their order.I cannot fault the efforts of Buttermilk Channel.  It is a good restaurant which excels in many ways; however, I do hope  the team finds the 1% inspiration needed to bring the food up to the level of the rest of its efforts.  For now, it is only practically perfect.",4.0
"Just came for dessert, and the bread pudding was great. The service was I attentive, slow, and overall lacking. The place was also really loud, and a hard place in which to have a conversation. There's plenty of street parking, which is convenient.",3.0
"Took family members here who were visiting from out of town. Wanted badly for the food to be great, that's why i chose it. I had heard good things.The chicken and waffles, the waffles were burnt black. The burger's bun was so stale that we hit it with a fork and it was hard as a rock. This would be no big deal if it was a diner, but the burger is 16 bucks.On  the plus side, the wine was good. But I wouldn't recommend this place. Prime Meats is up the street and very good. And there are tons of other great places to eat within blocks. Dissapointment.",1.0
"Maybe I am in the smaller percentage, but I am not a huge fan of this place.  I found that the service was just ok, and the seating process around the bar was frustrating and disorganized.  Since when do bars start reserving seats for other parties?  When asked if possible to substitue something (there on a Monday night for the fried chicken special) because my friend doesn't eat cheese, they said no.  It's understandable since it was a prix fixe, but they easily could have accomodated it with something cheaper or equivalent like most places do.  The Bibb lettuce salad was lovely, and dressing was good.  The friend chicken was sort of bland, though the crust was a good texture.  Still can't beat the Commodore.  I had the fish which needed salt, and the grits were disgusting - it looked like it was made from a box, hardened and too thick.  Not too impressed.The 3 stars is for the dessert, the pecan pie sundae in a glass - it was really good.  Heart attack city but really good.  The pecan clusters were a tad bit sweet for me but with the ice cream, it was good.  Service from the staff wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly friendly and warm.  Just not my cup of tea I guess.",3.0
"I didn't realize in I was in the company of a local celebrity until walking through the door of Buttermilk Channel. The host fawned over us with grace and attention once she realized who my companions were. So, although my perception of the staff may have been slightly skewed, each element of the evening worked like a well oiled machine with unlabored friendliness, impeccable timing, and with nay a hint of pandering.After ordering from the generously sized Vegetarian menu, the first dish (actually more of a cup) to appear was the dill-icious House-made Pickles ($3) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… a lovely crunchy cousin from the Claussen's clan. The spears and chips offer slight different flavors, but I devoured them much too eagerly to remember their distinctions.Caputo's Handmade Mozzarella with basil and black olives ($5) begged for salt. You'd think the olives would have sufficed, but, um... they didn't. The Sweet Potato and Goat Cheese Croquettes ($5) were unexpectedly uber goat cheesy and only mildly sweet potatoy, but as a girl who doesn't believe in ""too much cheese"" these were a-ok with me.Next came out the Delicata Squash Tart ($10) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… a flaky buttery pastry layered under house-made buttermilk ricotta and savory squash medallions delicately held together beneath a lacy doily of cheese. It is a robustly soft dish that crumbled into a beautiful disaster as we stabbed it greedily with our forks.My BF ordered the Caputo's Fresh Linguini ($16) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… miles of noodles fill the wide bowl along with brussels sprouts, roasted mushrooms and a confetti of pecorino and toasted breadcrumbs. After stealing bites of this dish, I still do not understand how someone would consider putting bread on pasta a good idea... that is unless you also feel that crab saturation is scandalously decadent... but this concept has been unfortunately driven out of our society by all the diet fear mongers out there. With the frequent mentions of the Cheddar Waffles ($14) yelp.com/biz_photos/rU9c… raining in from all culinary fronts, I felt I had not choice but to order them despite the fact that vegetarian accompaniments sounding less then savory. The vulgar mound of assorted roasted mushrooms were uniformly bland, the brussels sprouts were tender under the outer charred leaves but the dijon mustard vinaigrette smothered the nuance right out of them, and the cabbage slaw was a complete nonevent.Despite the entree letdown, a fateful truth of most vegetarian food, the small dishes that preceded them won me over. Overall Buttermilk Channel is a lovely experiences with the refine rustic wooden tables collected under iron chandeliers and flowering branches pairing perfectly with the staunchly professional wait staff and crushed pine needle scent wafting through the bathroom hall.",4.0
"Wow- was looking forward to living the hype- but sadly Buttermilk Channel is more hype than reality in my book. Dragged my friend from Manhattan because of all these great reviews, we got there and the hostess was nice enough (the place trues to be pretentious and that alone is annoying but whatever- their trying to be all exclusive and high end so i allowed them).The tables are kinda small, place is packed the place does look very pretty and tables are dressed nicely.  that's kinda sorta where it ends.  We both ordered two different things for brunch and we were both grossly disappointed. My eggs smelled funny and were served in such an uncomfortable dish they were overflowing it (get larger serving dishes for your omelette's dudes) and my friends egg white omelet was gross! It looked like it was swimming in water- yuk!  Coffee was OK and we both got sides they were not good also and the bread was just OK.  We were also disappointed by the desserts so we left kinda complaining that we would never come here again. Too many good places in Brooklyn to pay top dollar for pretend upscale food.",3.0
"Service: This, again, knocked a star off my review. Our waiter was slow (perhaps because we did the Mondy $25 special?) and rude. When we asked about turning the air down a bit, he made a face and a snarky comment. Several times another server would end up helping us and making sure we were doing ok. Food: The fried chicken was DELICIOUS. As was the pecan pie sundae. That was so decadent yet totally mmm-worthy.",4.0
"It's like most people think the hour+ wait for brunch is a necessary part of the brunch experience but on a Sat or Sun morning/afternoon when I'm STARVING, long waits are not an option. Luckily, I came here close to opening time with my bf in the spring and we only waited about 20 minutes.I listened to fellow Yelpers and got the hash browns and doughnuts to start. The jelly doughnut was good although a bit small - I much rather prefer to get one double in size for the same price from Dough. The hash browns were a HUGE disappointment because they taste the same as McDonald hashbrowns.I ordered the eggs huntington and subbed the canadian bacon for lox for a small fee. The lox was such a small portion of thinly cut smoked salmon that it was barely visible underneath my egg. Other than that, it was just a standard poached egg with hollaindaise sauce. My boyfriend's fried porkchop and cheddar waffles were much more enjoyable and interesting than my dish, although I wonder why they don't serve the more traditional fried chicken with this dish...Service was whatevs, nothing special but I wasn't expecting amazing service during the super busy brunch time. The waitress didn't inform us that brunch came with a free drink but I stopped her before she ran off and gave her my drink order.Glad I finally got to try Buttermilk Channel but the food just isn't not that mindblowing to justify the hype and long wait.",3.0
"I have heard a lot of great things about this place.  After many rave reviews from friends, I decided to come here for brunch on Sunday.  I expected a wait and was fine with waiting.  UNTIL......We walked in and asked to be put on the waiting list.  The hostess put us on the list and I casually told her that if there is seating at the bar, we don't mind sitting there as opposed to a table.  Her response?? (with the snottiest attitude ever and rolling her eyes) ""Well, do you see one, because I dont.""  I was appalled and livid at how she can treat a customer.  I understand if we were rude and obnoxious to her because I know how stressful the job can be.  But I was perfectly happy and pleasant in speaking with her.  No matter how good the food can be, I will definitely never come near here again just to be treated like a second class citizen.",1.0
"BEST FRENCH TOAST. Ever.The pancakes are yummy too. Service is pretty friendly, nothing above and beyond extraordinary, but I've never had a bad experience there, even when there is a crazy line the hostess is always quick to acknowledge our existence, even in a big group or just 2 people. Food is always relatively quick given how packed it is and the servers are always sure to check everything is ok in a timely manner.

"I've been wanting to try Buttermilk Channel's Monday pre-fixe dinner for ages. Last night I finally made it there. I was meeting some friends at 7 and I arrived a little early, the F train was a convenient 2 blocks away. The place is adorable as so many others in BK are. They have seating outside which I would have preferred but one in the crowd is not a fan of eating on the sidewalk. I put my name in and sat at the bar. The bartender was great and she made me a Paper Moon: Rye, aperol, amaro, lemon and a spray of absinthe that definitely hit the spot. When I arrived around 6:30 the place was pretty empty but by 7 when the rest of my party arrived the place was packed and we had to wait about 20 minutes for our seats at a communal table. My friend ordered the Carlos Danger, she couldn't resist with the whole wiener scandal. It was made with mezcal, grapefruit, honey & campari rimmed with some sort of smoked sugar. It was bitter, but I liked that. We all decided to order the pre-fixe. I started with the watermelon and radish salad with black olives, arugula and lime vinaigrette. This was a perfect, refreshing summer salad. Both of my friends went with the chilled zucchini and basil soup with pumpernickel croutons and goat feta. I personally don't like chilled soups, had this been warm I would have ordered it as well but when tasting it, meh. For entrees I ordered the parsley crusted hake with summer beans, basil, hot pepper and green olive. I'll have to say that I thought this was just OK. I guess I'm not a fan of the consistency of hake and it did have a bit more of a fish smell than I usually like. My friends each tried the other two entrees that were offered, the chicken and waffles and the linguine with broccoli rabe, pecorino, spicy sausage and chile oil. I tasted the fried chicken and waffles and thought it was very good. I never did get to taste the linguine as my friend had the protective arm around the bowl which leads me to assume that it was quite good. We ordered a bottle of the Bonny Doon Carignane, us being Cali girls and all we needed to represent. It was serviceable and exactly what you would expect from the eccentric Randall Grahm. The dessert is where we were completely sold. All three of us opted for the mini pecan pie sundae with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. I barely got down to the pecan pie part as I was loving the ice cream and whipped cream. The ""filling"" was uber sweet but the whole thing was delicious! Our service was fine, we did have to flag our waitress down a few times but she was slammed. I would definitely recommend the place, not entirely for the food but the whole experience was pretty great.",4.0
"Wow I think I have found one of my favorite brunch places in BK. Everything was delicious. A bit on the pricier side but frickin' amazing.

Wait a minute, take a deep breath, then sink your teeth into it.The Huntington: AKA Eggs Benedict. I had them replace the ham with lox since I'm off the meat but it was still yummy. Nicely poached eggs with a good homemade Hollandaise.Cheddar waffles: Just cuz I couldn't get the porkchops, doesn't mean I couldn't get cheddar waffles. Order these as a side if no one at your table gets the full order. They are nice and crunchy and you can really taste the sharp cheddar.Drinks:The classic bloody Mary: Whoa, but 9 bucks whoa? TBD. It was immensely  spiced and seasoned. Capers really added to the full, complex flavor of this tasty bloody.Come here early! We got here around 11:30 and there was a 10 minute wait.

"I cheered inwardly when an unrelated activity brought me by serendipity to delicious Carroll Gardens - which, to my Manhattan-centric existence, might as well be Delaware. I cursed myself inwardly when I departed, for forgetting to Check-In Here, because if I *ever* return to this nabe, Buttermilk would need to queue up behind Prime Meats and Frankie's, even though everything from the house-brined pickle platter to the huckleberry duck meatloaf was tantalizing enough to warrant a second and third date. Hey Williamsburg - as you begin to sculpt a high-end middle-brow restaurant scene, take a hint from Carroll Gardens' Buttermilk Channel. Keep the menu short and sweet; keep the food fresh and well-made. Make sure your servers are affable. You can pick out vintage furnishings and expensive lighting schemes once the basics are laid right.",4.0
"Fantastic restaurant all round- 5 star service- Jennifer, Doug and Deb took such incredible care of us. It was my husband's 30th birthday and they planned meticulously in advance, kindly arranged for a table even though they were basically full for 8 of us, arranged a special birthday cake and took care of every whim! We were thoroughly impressed and will absolutely be back. They were so accommodating they even allowed my husband's birthday present bottle of Hirsch whiskey from some friends to be used to make Manhattans. We even stayed well into the wee hours of the morning and we felt nothing but still warmly welcomed, even at that hour!It was our first time and in addition to fantastic service, the food was delicious and very much enjoyed. The complimentary popovers were a nice touch, maple almonds are a must, but the fried chicken is not to be missed!  So food wise, the fried chicken was a huge hit- people especially were surprised how great  the coleslaw and waffles were also. A couple of us girls had the porgy, which was delicious, and the brussel sprouts were great also. The special cake was a huge hit- vanilla cake with salted caramel filling and chocolate butter cream. Definitely keen to come back for brunch also plus the ambience was so warm and cosy, and price wise it was extremely reasonable!! Absolutely a stellar local restaurant hitting the ball out of the park in every category AND to boot-,affordable enough to come regularly. What a great discovery!",5.0
"Met Jess S. here with every intention to devour cheddar waffles and buttermilk fried chicken. Boy, was that mission ever accomplished. I know they don't give out medals for this sort of thing, but I was kinda stellar in my devouring of food, with the exception of my work on the drumstick, which Jess scolded me over.Buttermilk Channel is a busy locale, so you probably won't want to go to get any privacy or have any deep conversations...although, if you did, no one would hear you over the cacophony of other potentially deep conversations, so go ahead, let those skeletons out of the closet!Since there was a wait, we perched at the bar and had some peppermint tea. Good tea. It helped the time fly by until our table was ready. She had the kale salad, which was really delicious and all but...This refined version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is delicious. Three large pieces sitting atop two incredibly savory waffles. They give you syrup to go along with it, and it complements the flavors of the meal well.  The cabbage slaw that comes with it was also tasty; it was light and not laden with mayo or anything like that.For dessert, there was chocolate bread pudding for me, and a pecan pie sundae for her. The bread pudding wasn't what I expected, a little bit on the dry side. The pecan pie sundae? Never have I been so happy to hear ""you're gonna have to help me finish this."" Delicious.Look, I've already told you what you want to know. Log off and get to Buttermilk Channel.",4.0
"Amazing brunch. The place was packed, but we got right in. The food was delish...service was great. I am definitely a fan. Oh and get the Pecan Cinnamon bun for brunch desert. Yes I said brunch desert...oh my....SO GOOD. I think I may be on to something here!",4.0
"If the prize at the top of shoots and ladders was a plate of Buttermilk Channels chicken and a bowl of their pickles and I happened to roll the dice on that last motherfucking shoot at the top you know the one that's like one square away from winning and shoots your ass to the beginning? Well if I so happened to land on said chute I would without second thought or hesitation shimmy my way up it, straight up Outdoor Games style and rape the hell out of some chicken and pickles. Do you understand the complex seriousness associated with the fact that strictly play by the Hasbro rules me is willing to fuck over years of childhood training for some chicken? O baby its that serious.So be prepared for quite a wait. There are plenty of bars in the area where one can get good and pre diner tipsy. They'll call you when a tables ready. Simple easy done.Pickles. Pear, walnut, and arugula salad. Hanger steak. Chicken and waffles. This would be your selection into heaven. Let's break it down shall we:Pickles - homemade. That should say enough. On the sweeter side for those of you dill/uber garlicy fans. Survey says delicious. I wanted to take some home, to go after my first bite. But by the end of the meal I was so full that I couldn't contemplate bringing food anywhere. Really if you're any form of pickle fan you need these in your mouth now. God I never thought I'd rave about pickles but than again I am a Jew.Salad - Yo. This is crazy good. That's pretty much what I said anyway after biting in. And than a funny thing happened. I found a piece of hidden bread under my greens. What's this I said? Oh. Oh my. Oh my heaven. Could this be a grilled cheese snippet? In ma salad? Is that blue cheese? #dead. Orgasms at dinner tables are really rude you guys. Fair warning should be given.Hanger Steak - So sharing steak with someone is always tough. Because well we all like our steaks different don't we? I was raised by a man who likes his steaks rubber tough. Brutally charred. My dad likes to eat steak tires. Now as I've grown up I've realized the era in his ways. But I still can not do bloody. Medium well please. My date on the other hand is all on the medium rare band wagon. (likeenothankyouimayvomit) but I sucked it up because she is a culinary wiz kid.

My only one tiny really insignificant thought is that there should be some hot sauce...its not crazy necessary or anything...but I'd like it...don't be mad at me kitchen gurus. The waffles. Yes. Ah.

"I very recently decided to try the Buttermilk Channel for dinner, based on the recommendation of the people who work at a very good local restaurant.  I was disappointed to say the least.  The service was terrible, and the food was mediocre, with a 'flare' that was absolutely disgusting - coming from a person who has no problem doing their own hunting and dressing of animals.When I arrived, I stood in the doorway and had to wait about 5 minutes before I could get a very gruff waitress to answer that I did have to wait for the hostess to give me a seat, which took another few minutes.  Then the same waitress dropped off my menu and didn't even say welcome.  After a bit longer than was necessary a drink steward finally took my drink order, followed by the original waitress who wasn't at all pleased that I had some questions about their appetizer portions.  I ordered their Muscles appetizer and their Steak dinner, and patiently waited.The complimentary bread course was promptly delivered, and started the meal out in a pleasing fashion, but after a pause, the Muscles began the disappointing spiral downward.  The Muscles weren't very well cooked, some were rubbery, while some were cool.  The tastes had promise, if the dish were better executed.  I had to use my bread plate for the muscle shells until with about 5 muscles left the waitress FINALLY brought me a larger plate for the shells, the bread plate overflowing with the other half dozen muscle shells.I was still willing to give it a better rating, until the dinner came - and had a big foul-smelling bone on it.  I was upset that the waitress hadn't asked about sides and since she didn't come back until half way through the Appetizer I couldn't order the Brussels sprout side.  So instead of just giving me a plate with the meat and garnish (which would have been good) they also included a big hunk of bone that just stunk up the whole meal.  Smell is a very integral part of any meal, and for the chef to include the bone, stinky as it was, shows that they either don't care or only value looks.I won't be going back even to try the cheddar waffles, and I hope your experience is better than mine was.",2.0
"Despite getting lost twice en route, I'm glad we stuck with our original plan to visit Buttermilk Channel.   Everything I could ask for in a restaurant:  delicious food; fantastic and charismatic service; great décor and ambience.  Finding it was like a Godsend. Our waitstaff was kind and very helpful.  He brought us nuts and bacon when they found out about our plight to find the restaurant, and he helped us find our way back to the subway to get home. Talk about service!You must have the buttermilk fried chicken with cheddar waffles.  It may go against everything I believe in terms of healthy eating, but it was so worth it.  The chicken feels more like it is baked; it does not have the same greasy and heavy feeling that fried chicken usually has. And while some of you are thinking ""cheddar waffles?"", let me assure you the cheddar gives the waffle a nice, sharp bite.Benton's Ham Wrapped Trout was almost as good.   I don't think I've ever had grits before; they were a nice touch to the meaty, flavourful fish. Dessert was my favorite part of the meal.  While my wife won the main course pickin', my dessert choice buried her's.  I don't care how stuffed you are, order Doug's Pecan Pie Sundae.  It is exactly as it sounds: pecan pie and ice cream served in a parfait glass like a real sundae.  The pecan pie is nice and sweet, and when mixed with the ice cream, it is such a nice finish to the meal.   The chocolate chunk bread pudding was a very nice dessert, just no pecan pie sundae.  Salted chocolate butterscotch is a nice contrast to the sweet chocolate.The decor is quite nice and the atmosphere has a class vibe to it.  There's just something about it that makes you feel very cool.   If you're looking for a nice place to take a date, take that person here.",4.0
"The first time I've ever experienced Buttermilk Channel was at Smorgasburg. It was the first tent I went to and I couldn't help but say to the person serving me..""your tent smells the best."" I indulged myself with their famous Fried Chicken and Cheddar Waffles with a balsamic maple syrup. It was a magical, juicy, sweet, and salty combination. Their fried chicken and waffles are only available on their dinner menu so plan accordingly if you ever want to try. During brunch on the weekends at the actual restaurant, you can get their Fried Pork Chop and Cheddar Waffles. I personally like the fried chicken better, but can you really go wrong with anything that's fried and covered in syrup? It was really good but the health nut in me felt pretty guilty afterwards. After I was defeated by the fried pork chops, I knew I was going to get the Eggs Huntington for my next experience. I mean, if you're going to a place that's called Buttermilk Chanel, you have to try the buttermilk biscuits, am I right? The eggs benedict filled me up, the biscuits were rich and flaky. I did think they were a little salty for my taste, that and the side salad but overall, a good meal most definitely. My friends and I decided to splurge and share the Pecan Pie French Toast with a bourbon molasses glaze over the top. The french toast was crunchy and toasted on the outside while the inside was soft, creamy, and custardy. The freshly whipped cream next to it was light and heavenly with the perfect amount of sweetness. I would only recommend getting it if you had a really strong sweet tooth that morning. Our server was very kind as well, telling us to relax and take our time with the check. If you're looking for a place for brunch, try Buttermilk Channel in Brooklyn.",4.0
"This place is great. Consistently terrific food, and relatively reasonably priced; I feel like they could probably get away with charging two or three bucks more per entree than they do. (But don't do that.) As I'm sure all the other reviews have said, they don't take reservations and there's usually a huge line, so the deal with here is that sometimes it's Tuesday, or it's like 5;00 but you're so starving that you don't even care if you're eating with old people, and at those times you go ""Oh hey, I bet there's no line at Buttermilk Channel.""",5.0
"We came here on a friday for dinner and it was a really cute spot. The watermelon salad was very refeshing. I had the chicken and waffles, and though there was nothing wrong with it, it just was not how I usually like them. I'd like to come here again, as everything else was very good, but I wouldn't really get that again.",3.0
"I cheered inwardly when an unrelated activity brought me by serendipity to delicious Carroll Gardens - which, to my Manhattan-centric existence, might as well be Delaware. I cursed myself inwardly when I departed, for forgetting to Check-In Here, because if I *ever* return to this nabe, Buttermilk would need to queue up behind Prime Meats and Frankie's, even though everything from the house-brined pickle platter to the huckleberry duck meatloaf was tantalizing enough to warrant a second and third date. Hey Williamsburg - as you begin to sculpt a high-end middle-brow restaurant scene, take a hint from Carroll Gardens' Buttermilk Channel. Keep the menu short and sweet; keep the food fresh and well-made. Make sure your servers are affable. You can pick out vintage furnishings and expensive lighting schemes once the basics are laid right.",4.0
"Fantastic restaurant all round- 5 star service- Jennifer, Doug and Deb took such incredible care of us. It was my husband's 30th birthday and they planned meticulously in advance, kindly arranged for a table even though they were basically full for 8 of us, arranged a special birthday cake and took care of every whim! We were thoroughly impressed and will absolutely be back. They were so accommodating they even allowed my husband's birthday present bottle of Hirsch whiskey from some friends to be used to make Manhattans. We even stayed well into the wee hours of the morning and we felt nothing but still warmly welcomed, even at that hour!It was our first time and in addition to fantastic service, the food was delicious and very much enjoyed. The complimentary popovers were a nice touch, maple almonds are a must, but the fried chicken is not to be missed!  So food wise, the fried chicken was a huge hit- people especially were surprised how great  the coleslaw and waffles were also. A couple of us girls had the porgy, which was delicious, and the brussel sprouts were great also. The special cake was a huge hit- vanilla cake with salted caramel filling and chocolate butter cream. Definitely keen to come back for brunch also plus the ambience was so warm and cosy, and price wise it was extremely reasonable!! Absolutely a stellar local restaurant hitting the ball out of the park in every category AND to boot-,affordable enough to come regularly. What a great discovery!",5.0
"Met Jess S. here with every intention to devour cheddar waffles and buttermilk fried chicken. Boy, was that mission ever accomplished. I know they don't give out medals for this sort of thing, but I was kinda stellar in my devouring of food, with the exception of my work on the drumstick, which Jess scolded me over.Buttermilk Channel is a busy locale, so you probably won't want to go to get any privacy or have any deep conversations...although, if you did, no one would hear you over the cacophony of other potentially deep conversations, so go ahead, let those skeletons out of the closet!Since there was a wait, we perched at the bar and had some peppermint tea. Good tea. It helped the time fly by until our table was ready. She had the kale salad, which was really delicious and all but...This refined version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is delicious. Three large pieces sitting atop two incredibly savory waffles. They give you syrup to go along with it, and it complements the flavors of the meal well.  The cabbage slaw that comes with it was also tasty; it was light and not laden with mayo or anything like that.For dessert, there was chocolate bread pudding for me, and a pecan pie sundae for her. The bread pudding wasn't what I expected, a little bit on the dry side. The pecan pie sundae? Never have I been so happy to hear ""you're gonna have to help me finish this."" Delicious.Look, I've already told you what you want to know. Log off and get to Buttermilk Channel.",4.0
"Amazing brunch. The place was packed, but we got right in. The food was delish...service was great. I am definitely a fan. Oh and get the Pecan Cinnamon bun for brunch desert. Yes I said brunch desert...oh my....SO GOOD. I think I may be on to something here!",4.0
"If the prize at the top of shoots and ladders was a plate of Buttermilk Channels chicken and a bowl of their pickles and I happened to roll the dice on that last motherfucking shoot at the top you know the one that's like one square away from winning and shoots your ass to the beginning? Well if I so happened to land on said chute I would without second thought or hesitation shimmy my way up it, straight up Outdoor Games style and rape the hell out of some chicken and pickles. Do you understand the complex seriousness associated with the fact that strictly play by the Hasbro rules me is willing to fuck over years of childhood training for some chicken? O baby its that serious.So be prepared for quite a wait. There are plenty of bars in the area where one can get good and pre diner tipsy. They'll call you when a tables ready. Simple easy done.Pickles. Pear, walnut, and arugula salad. Hanger steak. Chicken and waffles. This would be your selection into heaven. Let's break it down shall we:Pickles - homemade. That should say enough. On the sweeter side for those of you dill/uber garlicy fans. Survey says delicious. I wanted to take some home, to go after my first bite. But by the end of the meal I was so full that I couldn't contemplate bringing food anywhere. Really if you're any form of pickle fan you need these in your mouth now. God I never thought I'd rave about pickles but than again I am a Jew.Salad - Yo. This is crazy good. That's pretty much what I said anyway after biting in. And than a funny thing happened. I found a piece of hidden bread under my greens. What's this I said? Oh. Oh my. Oh my heaven. Could this be a grilled cheese snippet? In ma salad? Is that blue cheese? #dead.

"Buttermilk Channel, for me, was like the girl on Yelp that you really want to meet in person, but you are scared she won't be as witty in person.  I pined for Buttermilk Channel before ever going there and last night was our first date.  I met up with one of my oldest friends so that BC, as I call it now, would not feel uncomfortable knowing how much I wanted to meet her.I arrived first and was immediately impressed with the look of BC.  This cozy restaurant looked just as good as expected (big exhale) and the hostess was extremely friendly.  There is a nice bar right in front and probably around 20 tables in the restaurant.  I tried not to know what I was getting before I got there, but I have to admit I did look over BC's profile (menu) a number of times before.  I wanted BC to know that I had done my research, but not that I was cyber-stalking before our first meeting.The menu is fantastic, tons of options, but not overwhelming.  We got the maple & bacon roasted almonds and the sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes to start.  The almonds are flavorful and soft and they are the type of starter that you let sit there through the meal and you keep having a few more, then a couple more, then they are gone.  Thinking of the croquettes now, I am daydreaming about how good they were.  The texture was perfect, the flavor was really outstanding, one of the best appetizers I have had in a long time.  The amount of sweet potato vs. goat cheese was completely on point.I had a tough time settling on an entree, but in the meantime, being able to have imperial pints of Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold was necessary.  Just drinking something called Liquid Gold made me feel bold (and very rich) and this is a very good beer.  Not sure how many ""helped"" wash the meal down, but it was more than a couple.I settled on the Creekstone Farms Flap Steak (grilled bread salad, roasted marrow bone and parsley pistou for $21).  The suggested serving was medium rare which is rarer than I would usually order, but I wanted to trust the chef.  I cleaned the plate and while I am still obsessing over those croquettes, this entree was a nice size and had very interesting and tasty complements to the steak.Our server was very friendly, never rushed us and seemed completely genuine.  As my first date with Buttermilk Channel came to a close, I felt like I should make a move.  I want to go back to BC (I can't say I am in love I mean it was just a date (with a restaurant I pined for)) right now and hopefully Buttermilk Channel will look at me the same way I look at her when I return.",5.0
"Short Rib hash -$122 out of 5Overall it was a quite dissapointing dish.Unless one likes chewing on fat, this dish doesn't offer any merit or uniqueness. The cubed and refried short rib was simply too much of fat, even for a bacon lover, it just was not an optimum breakfast choice.The toasted & prebuttered wholeweat bread was quite unpleasant surprise. The bread was very plain supermaket bread and buttered bread was simply overkill when combined with the greasy shortrib hash.I expected they would serve a buiscuit for a dish like this. There is nothing redeeming quality about this dish.Breakfast sausage -$44 out of 5Mixed with sweet potato and lots of spice, it was quite tasty. Since the short rib hash was not substantial, I needed to order more meat to fill me up.Capuccino - 3.50 and Cafe Americano $2.502.5 out of 5very very plain coffee, rather, it was dissapointing considering how popular this resturant is.Sour cream donut - $23 out of 5nothing earth shattering, it is served when it is warm so that might be the only thing I liked.(When you go to 'Egg' in Williamsburg, they give you this fresh made donuts while waiting for your meals, it is absorutely one of the best.Did I say it is free?

"I saw all the reviews and thought this place must be great for brunch so me and my husband decided to go. We showed up with a wall of people waiting for seats and our own waiting time was an hour. We didn't mind the wait and thought this food must be the best brunch or else it wouldn't be so packed! After waiting an hour, I have the say the food was ok to good but not the best I've had. I ordered the pork chop with cheddar waffle and my husband ordered the ABC grilled cheese and a side of sticky bun. I couldn't taste the cheddar in my waffle but my pork chop was good. It was a bit fatty, but I think the fat helps flavor it. The grill cheese was good but the sticky bun tasted a little stale. Both our dish came with a side of salad which was way too sour. It wasn't drowned in dressing so I'm just going to assume the dressing itself was very sour to begin with.The reason why I didn't rate this higher was because of the long wait time and the food really wasn't worth that wait. Still, I'm glad I tried it so I can cross this place off my list of places to eat around the area.",3.0
"First of all - the food was delicious.  Everything I ordered was wonderful.  I am vegetarian and there was an entire separate menu available.  But be sure to ask for it - it was not presented with the cocktail and regular dinner menu.  Second of all - the service was excellent as well.  Friendly, not snobby.  They did not rush us nor were they overly present.  Yet our water glasses were always full.  Nice ambiance too.  We went on a Monday night at 7:30 and didn't have to wait for a table.",5.0

Even though, like I mentioned, the place was packed we didn't have to wait an absurd amount of time for our food. It all came out hot and and timely.

"Take your boyfriend to Buttermilk Channel for his birthday and he will begin ring shopping immediately.  Well almost immediately, first I have to write this review, watch highlights from the Giants win over the Packers, and eat my leftovers.  Leftovers.  You want them from here, not because the portions are out of control; they're not. Because you want this meal to last as long as possible and who doesn't want fried chicken for breakfast?Maple & bacon roasted almonds, house-made pickles, maple-glazed grilled bacon, cheese plates with pickled grapes(I have no idea what that tastes like)... Those are only a few options to get amped up for before the main course.The Buttermilk fried chicken and cheddar waffles live up the hype.  I just get nervous eating it in a fancy place if the tables are close.  I become a savage when I eat fried chicken.  Anyone who got hit with chicken, I apologize (You don't want me here on lobster night).  The chicken melts in your mouth and two glasses of Ommegang Three Philosophers are the perfect compliment.  Allagash Curieux, is one of my favorite beers and a rarity around these parts.  I'll be saving that for next time.Buttermilk is far enough out of reach where tourists won't steal precious spots.  Depending on the night, the wait isn't horrific.  Two of us were seated in twenty minutes on a Sunday night at 8:30.  It's classy - they have a coat check and a hostess with a clip board.  I'll be back, especially if there is a possibility to spot my two dream ladies:  Beyonce and Kelly Kapowski.",5.0
"This place is great. The room feels warm and cozy and the staff are all super friendly, positively unpretentious, and very knowledgeable. For starters I love the house made pickles, the Caputo's Mozzerella, and the Oysters.The Delicata squash tart is mind blowing. The Fried Chicken and Waffles is awesome. The fry is perfect. The chicken remains tender and very juicy. The Duck Meatloaf shouldn't be missed either.If you happen to be there on a Friday, the kitchen absolutely nails the art of cooking a lobster. It doesn't hurt that the lobster comes from the Red Hook Lobster pound (who buy lobsters straight from Maine on a weekly basis, ie as fresh as they come) For dessert the Doug's Pecan Sundae is so awesome. It comes with Van Leeuwen vanilla ice cream and served in a classic sundae glass. It is the perfect ending to an always great meal over there. Now I'm hungry!",4.0
"Buttermilk Channel, for me, was like the girl on Yelp that you really want to meet in person, but you are scared she won't be as witty in person.  I pined for Buttermilk Channel before ever going there and last night was our first date.  I met up with one of my oldest friends so that BC, as I call it now, would not feel uncomfortable knowing how much I wanted to meet her.I arrived first and was immediately impressed with the look of BC.  This cozy restaurant looked just as good as expected (big exhale) and the hostess was extremely friendly.  There is a nice bar right in front and probably around 20 tables in the restaurant.  I tried not to know what I was getting before I got there, but I have to admit I did look over BC's profile (menu) a number of times before.  I wanted BC to know that I had done my research, but not that I was cyber-stalking before our first meeting.The menu is fantastic, tons of options, but not overwhelming.  We got the maple & bacon roasted almonds and the sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes to start.  The almonds are flavorful and soft and they are the type of starter that you let sit there through the meal and you keep having a few more, then a couple more, then they are gone.  Thinking of the croquettes now, I am daydreaming about how good they were.  The texture was perfect, the flavor was really outstanding, one of the best appetizers I have had in a long time.  The amount of sweet potato vs. goat cheese was completely on point.I had a tough time settling on an entree, but in the meantime, being able to have imperial pints of Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold was necessary.  Just drinking something called Liquid Gold made me feel bold (and very rich) and this is a very good beer.  Not sure how many ""helped"" wash the meal down, but it was more than a couple.I settled on the Creekstone Farms Flap Steak (grilled bread salad, roasted marrow bone and parsley pistou for $21).  The suggested serving was medium rare which is rarer than I would usually order, but I wanted to trust the chef.  I cleaned the plate and while I am still obsessing over those croquettes, this entree was a nice size and had very interesting and tasty complements to the steak.Our server was very friendly, never rushed us and seemed completely genuine.  As my first date with Buttermilk Channel came to a close, I felt like I should make a move.  I want to go back to BC (I can't say I am in love I mean it was just a date (with a restaurant I pined for)) right now and hopefully Buttermilk Channel will look at me the same way I look at her when I return.",5.0
"Short Rib hash -$122 out of 5Overall it was a quite dissapointing dish.Unless one likes chewing on fat, this dish doesn't offer any merit or uniqueness. The cubed and refried short rib was simply too much of fat, even for a bacon lover, it just was not an optimum breakfast choice.The toasted & prebuttered wholeweat bread was quite unpleasant surprise. The bread was very plain supermaket bread and buttered bread was simply overkill when combined with the greasy shortrib hash.I expected they would serve a buiscuit for a dish like this. There is nothing redeeming quality about this dish.Breakfast sausage -$44 out of 5Mixed with sweet potato and lots of spice, it was quite tasty. Since the short rib hash was not substantial, I needed to order more meat to fill me up.Capuccino - 3.50 and Cafe Americano $2.502.5 out of 5very very plain coffee, rather, it was dissapointing considering how popular this resturant is.Sour cream donut - $23 out of 5nothing earth shattering, it is served when it is warm so that might be the only thing I liked.(When you go to 'Egg' in Williamsburg, they give you this fresh made donuts while waiting for your meals, it is absorutely one of the best.Did I say it is free? I still can't forget how good that donuts was. and the coffee at Egg is amazing too!! )",3.0
"I saw all the reviews and thought this place must be great for brunch so me and my husband decided to go. We showed up with a wall of people waiting for seats and our own waiting time was an hour. We didn't mind the wait and thought this food must be the best brunch or else it wouldn't be so packed! After waiting an hour, I have the say the food was ok to good but not the best I've had. I ordered the pork chop with cheddar waffle and my husband ordered the ABC grilled cheese and a side of sticky bun. I couldn't taste the cheddar in my waffle but my pork chop was good. It was a bit fatty, but I think the fat helps flavor it. The grill cheese was good but the sticky bun tasted a little stale. Both our dish came with a side of salad which was way too sour. It wasn't drowned in dressing so I'm just going to assume the dressing itself was very sour to begin with.The reason why I didn't rate this higher was because of the long wait time and the food really wasn't worth that wait. Still, I'm glad I tried it so I can cross this place off my list of places to eat around the area.",3.0
"First of all - the food was delicious.  Everything I ordered was wonderful.  I am vegetarian and there was an entire separate menu available.  But be sure to ask for it - it was not presented with the cocktail and regular dinner menu.  Second of all - the service was excellent as well.  Friendly, not snobby.  They did not rush us nor were they overly present.  Yet our water glasses were always full.  Nice ambiance too.  We went on a Monday night at 7:30 and didn't have to wait for a table.",5.0
"Lovely restaurant.  House made pickles are scrumptious.  Grilled flatbread is a sweet and savory blend of flavors.  Great friend chicken.  Exciting and inventive cocktails. Do not leave without sampling ""Doug's Pecan Pie Sundae.""  (Doug is the owner who is a super friendly and warm man who came over to us at the bar and introduced himself.) Always a fun mix of clientele. Service could be a bit friendlier.  Don't always get a ""I'm excited to be working here"" vibe.",4.0
"Came here for brunch on a Sunday and the place was packed. We arrived at around 11 and had to wait an hour, no big deal, took a leisurely stroll around the area and by the time we got back, our table was ready. The two of us shared the house cured salmon platter, eggs huntington and a cheddar waffle on the side. Even though, like I mentioned, the place was packed we didn't have to wait an absurd amount of time for our food. It all came out hot and and timely. Buttermilk Channel was just on point with every aspect of our meal, it was absolutely mouth-wateringly delicious goodness. And the service was very friendly as well. I will definitely be back for more!",5.0
"If you are planning to go there on the weekend, you def. need to go there early. Got there at 10 mins before it opened and there was a line forming already. I got the short rib hash...delicious! It was a good consistency of meat and potatoes. It comes with a side salad. Also tried the pecan pie french toast there. Good, but not the best I ever had. A little bit too sweet in my opinion, but the fresh whipped cream made it very very good. The waiters were nice and friendly. I def. would come back here for brunch any day!",4.0
"I've eaten here half a dozen times and just always love the food and overall atmosphere. Their popovers they give at the beginning of the meal are delicious.

Good cocktails, good waitstaff and on 2 occasions with a party of 4 or more got a table just by walking in.",4.0
"Take your boyfriend to Buttermilk Channel for his birthday and he will begin ring shopping immediately.  Well almost immediately, first I have to write this review, watch highlights from the Giants win over the Packers, and eat my leftovers.  Leftovers.  You want them from here, not because the portions are out of control; they're not. Because you want this meal to last as long as possible and who doesn't want fried chicken for breakfast?Maple & bacon roasted almonds, house-made pickles, maple-glazed grilled bacon, cheese plates with pickled grapes(I have no idea what that tastes like)... Those are only a few options to get amped up for before the main course.The Buttermilk fried chicken and cheddar waffles live up the hype.  I just get nervous eating it in a fancy place if the tables are close.  I become a savage when I eat fried chicken.  Anyone who got hit with chicken, I apologize (You don't want me here on lobster night).  The chicken melts in your mouth and two glasses of Ommegang Three Philosophers are the perfect compliment.  Allagash Curieux, is one of my favorite beers and a rarity around these parts.  I'll be saving that for next time.Buttermilk is far enough out of reach where tourists won't steal precious spots.  Depending on the night, the wait isn't horrific.  Two of us were seated in twenty minutes on a Sunday night at 8:30.  It's classy - they have a coat check and a hostess with a clip board.  I'll be back, especially if there is a possibility to spot my two dream ladies:  Beyonce and Kelly Kapowski.",5.0

"i was craving fried chicken & waffles. the plan was to make them for brunch, then i imagined the mountain of dishes and grease in my kitchen and decided to let someone else make them for me. we made a mad dash to get to buttermilk by 3pm and after every minor misadventure imaginable, we walked into buttermilk at 2:58pm. we were seated(!), albeit somewhat grudgingly.it turned out that buttermilk does not have c&w on their menu. a certain brother transposed the dish from the dinner menu to brunch, but they did have a fried pork chop & waffles! close enough... that is until we were informed that they are out of pork chops.we had bloody marys, the house-cured salmon platter, house pickles, a cheddar waffle, huntington eggs, side of bacon, and the burger.i loved my dish. what's not to love about pumpernickel bread smeared with green onion cream cheese, covered in thin slices of silky house cured salmon, and sprinkled with fried capers. that said, it's not a filling enough dish if your first meal is at 3:15pm. next time i'd only get this dish to split among a couple people as an appetizer.house pickles -- the dill spears were unimpressive and reminded of my failed batch of homemade pickles. the bread & butter chips were good.cheddar waffle -- incredible!!!huntington eggs -- perfectly poached, sitting on a delicious biscuit and smothered in creamy hollandaise. i did think the hollandaise could have used a touch more lemon juice and cayenne but nitpicking blah blah.burger -- didn't try it. my friend likes her burgers medium-well and that killed all my curiosity. she said it was at a midway point between good and excellent.bacon -- yes, please.bloody mary -- perfection. spice, body, punch.the space is bright and open. they play an upbeat pandora music mix. the best brunch experience in a loooooooooong time.",4.0
"The brunch is unbelievably amazing.  I don't know why it took me so long to have it but like the dinner here, you want to do things right.  This isn't your basic brunch.  This is another level so I strongly recommend at least 2 courses.  Start with a warm beverage and a cocktail because you are at brunch.  Enjoy yourself.  Then order a nice savory meal but don't forget that you could start that meal with a sticky bun or you could end it with Pecan Pie French Toast.  I chose the later and I am so happy that I did.  This is like no other french toast in the world.  It is so custardy and yummy then you get to the end an you are just trying to scrape up every last bite of that mapley-pecan goodness with the flaky croissant-crust.  You will love every last bite.",5.0

The place didn't start filling up until around 7;30 and by 8pm it was crowded. The real benefit of a group of 5 was being able to sample just about every snack and dessert and enough of the apps & entrees to get a real feel for the kitchen's talents. Everyone unanimously loved the Bacon almonds, pickles, flat bread, and the pecan pie and peach cobbler sundays. I disagreed with the group on the bread pudding. I found it a bit dry and as a consequence the burnt edges didn't add a yummy burnt sugar taste but just a burnt taste. Everyone individually loved their entrees. I had the scallops & mussels with soba in basil broth. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Nicely seared on the outside and plump and juicy inside.  The broth was delicious.  The only negative was the lack of bread to sop it up afterward.The wine list had a good range of prices and varietals, mostly domestic, with a couple of NYS's better offerings.

"i was craving fried chicken & waffles. the plan was to make them for brunch, then i imagined the mountain of dishes and grease in my kitchen and decided to let someone else make them for me. we made a mad dash to get to buttermilk by 3pm and after every minor misadventure imaginable, we walked into buttermilk at 2:58pm. we were seated(!), albeit somewhat grudgingly.it turned out that buttermilk does not have c&w on their menu. a certain brother transposed the dish from the dinner menu to brunch, but they did have a fried pork chop & waffles! close enough... that is until we were informed that they are out of pork chops.we had bloody marys, the house-cured salmon platter, house pickles, a cheddar waffle, huntington eggs, side of bacon, and the burger.i loved my dish. what's not to love about pumpernickel bread smeared with green onion cream cheese, covered in thin slices of silky house cured salmon, and sprinkled with fried capers. that said, it's not a filling enough dish if your first meal is at 3:15pm. next time i'd only get this dish to split among a couple people as an appetizer.house pickles -- the dill spears were unimpressive and reminded of my failed batch of homemade pickles. the bread & butter chips were good.cheddar waffle -- incredible!!!huntington eggs -- perfectly poached, sitting on a delicious biscuit and smothered in creamy hollandaise. i did think the hollandaise could have used a touch more lemon juice and cayenne but nitpicking blah blah.burger -- didn't try it. my friend likes her burgers medium-well and that killed all my curiosity. she said it was at a midway point between good and excellent.bacon -- yes, please.bloody mary -- perfection. spice, body, punch.the space is bright and open. they play an upbeat pandora music mix. the best brunch experience in a loooooooooong time.",4.0
"The brunch is unbelievably amazing.  I don't know why it took me so long to have it but like the dinner here, you want to do things right.  This isn't your basic brunch.  This is another level so I strongly recommend at least 2 courses.  Start with a warm beverage and a cocktail because you are at brunch.  Enjoy yourself.  Then order a nice savory meal but don't forget that you could start that meal with a sticky bun or you could end it with Pecan Pie French Toast.  I chose the later and I am so happy that I did.  This is like no other french toast in the world.  It is so custardy and yummy then you get to the end an you are just trying to scrape up every last bite of that mapley-pecan goodness with the flaky croissant-crust.  You will love every last bite.",5.0
"Pleasant atmosphere and service.  Wine by the glasses were excellent quality at reasonable price.  Homemade pickles were tasty.  Food was visually attractive.  Green apple and radish salad was delicious, though the comically large hunks of radish went untouched.We waited over an hour for our food.  When we finally inquired we were told ""we make everything fresh"" as if the problem were ours for expecting food any faster.  Then moments later we were offered another story, that our food was waiting on a burger ordered well-done.  As if it takes an hour to cook a burger well-done.2 out of 3 main dishes were bad  The Caputo's Fresh Linguini was undercooked, and ironically it tasted as if dried ingredients were used.  The Berkshire Pork special featured flavorless pork swimming in a bowl of sauce of soy, sugar, and pickles.  It tasted as disgusting as it sounds.  The burger at least was passable.No plans to return.",2.0
"Finally made my way to Buttermilk Channel after hearing so much about it and I was not disappointed.The Grilled Flatbread ($11) is a must have!We also got hush puppies and an amazing kale and endive salad, but the flatbread was the standout.As for entrees my guy had the Chicken & Waffles ($20) and I got the linguini with brussel spouts and mushrooms ($18).I was worried about the portions but they were more than enough and absolutely delicious.Even non-vegetarians would enjoy that linguini, because the flavors were so strong.The chocolate bread pudding was the perfect end to an amazing meal.The prices are a bit on the higher side but the it's worth it. The $25 Prix-Fixe is a great option (only on Monday though)Attentive, polite servers and great atmosphere.Give it a try!",4.0
"Came here for dinner a week ago.   Initially it feels like a great ambiance since it's pretty lively with a lot of hip patrons.  Unfortunately it is extremely dark, so dark in fact that neither my girlfriend nor myself could actually read the menu without holding the table candle up to it.   I thought it was just us but I noticed later people seated next to us had to do the same thing as well.I got the three course menu.  The soup wasn't very interesting or tasty.  I got the buttermilk fried chicken for the entree.  Normally I love fried chicken but in this case it wasn't delicious.  It wasn't bad just not really good either (most of the food was like that).  My girlfriend got a pasta special and was equally not excited.  The pecan dessert WAS delicious which bumps the rating up a bit.  Drinks are on the pricey side for the most part.Service was good but probably won't come back unless they change up the menu a lot.",2.0

"After all the rave reviews and reading the awesome menu I figured I'd better manage my expectations or risk a let down... Well it didn't disappoint. Everything about the place was spot on. Decore, servers, menu, food, drinks, everything great! We had 5 of us so we were able to get a reservation but since we went early we wouldn't have needed it. The place didn't start filling up until around 7;30 and by 8pm it was crowded. The real benefit of a group of 5 was being able to sample just about every snack and dessert and enough of the apps & entrees to get a real feel for the kitchen's talents. Everyone unanimously loved the Bacon almonds, pickles, flat bread, and the pecan pie and peach cobbler sundays. I disagreed with the group on the bread pudding. I found it a bit dry and as a consequence the burnt edges didn't add a yummy burnt sugar taste but just a burnt taste. Everyone individually loved their entrees. I had the scallops & mussels with soba in basil broth. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Nicely seared on the outside and plump and juicy inside.  The broth was delicious.  The only negative was the lack of bread to sop it up afterward.The wine list had a good range of prices and varietals, mostly domestic, with a couple of NYS's better offerings. The beer list was great for a small place and the specialty cocktails all looked yummy and not overpriced.",5.0
"Came here with a group of 5.  We were seated next the window at the front quickly.  The service was outstanding, the portions were just right, and the food was delicious.  I had the chicken and waffles dish.  Only the chicken and waffles at the Wynn in Vegas has been better.  I would definitely return.",4.0

The eggs were so small that they must have come from pigeons. Portions were tiny and plates filled out with greens. The hash looked good but when I took a bite of what I assumed was potato, it was a huge hunk of fat. I couldn't believe they would serve such a mess. I complained to the waitress and she also was in disbelief, but hers because she couldn't believe I didn't like it. After consulting the manger, she offered to bring me something else.

"BRUNCH.After one visit, Buttermilk Channel has elevated itself into what will be a go-to brunch spot. Holy cow! I'm not your usual buttermilk biscuit type, but I date a boy who was raised on a diet of white gravy slop plus unrecognizable meat by-product over a dense slab of biscuit. (Affectionately known as ""SOS."" Look it up.) Here we are for brunch. The place is packed so we've scouted out stools at the bar. Sipping some delicious Bellinis --that are included in the brunch menu, of course-- and out come 1) a giant fried porkchop on a waffle for Boy, 2) my Eggs Benedict, hollandaise and poached egg over country ham, the fluffiest biscuit ,and the most delicious and lightly dressed salad on the side.  BEST FORTY MINUTES OF MY LIFE. I tried my first bite of fried-meat-over-waffle and the pork chop was juiiiiicy and the waffle was so flavorful. Even though it's busy, and it's loud, and the decor is kind of watery and boring, and even though the servers are overworked and distracted, this place is where they hide the good stuff.",5.0
The wait sucks but the food was great.I had the eggs which were good but not amazing. But my brother had the fried pork chops which were. Basically anything fried was AMAZING.Yum.

Enjoyed but not sure I'll go back anytime soon - mostly cuz it's a bit of a hike for me and I hate waiting for any meal. :),4.0
"We agree with Ava's review. This place is the bomb and i'm conviced it sits in some mystical vortex that sets your chi straight. We have been here dozens of times and have never had a negative experience or a bad meal. The quality of every dish is outstanding, the music is awesome, the service is amazing, and when you leave here you are always in a good mood. The owners always come by to get your feedback on the meal, talk to you, and make you feel like you are the #1 customer which makes this place 5 stars. You can't go wrong with the brunch or dinner. Everything on the menu is good. Some of our favorites include the BBQ oysters, the duck meatloaf, and the fish dishes. Occasionally i crave the fried chicken.

"The vibe of Buttermilk Channel is quintessential ""New-Age Brooklyn"" - and that's not a bad thing!!!Sadly these days in both Manhattan and Brooklyn a lot of places try to manufacture that hip vibe and its usually quite apparent, and a turnoff in my opinion. At Buttermilk the buzz in the restaurant is completely inline with the stellar food on the menu. We went as a party of 4 and got to the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night and were fully prepared for an hour to hour and a half wait, they quoted us an hour and 45 minutes so we ended up going a few doors down to Palo Cortado for Sangria (which was good) while we waited. We got the call about an hour and 15 minutes later and were seated right near the front door. My fiancé and I sat against the window on a seat built into the wall which could have been more comfortable but not too bad. As for the food, we were brought out popovers for the table which were incredibly tasty and then ordered the little neck clams and the slow roasted pork spare ribs to start, both of which we enjoyed. The 4 main courses we ordered were 2 chicken and waffles, 1 burger and 1 flap steak. Everything was great, everyone seemed to enjoy what was ordered but nothing had that ""wow"" factor with the exception of the mashed potatoes (a must order) side which is the only reason I held off on the 5th star. After reading the other reviews we ordered 2 of the Pecan sundaes to share and that was a great decision - the sundae was without question the star of the show! I would definitely recommend BMC to friends and would like to go back for brunch one day even if I have to wait another hour and a half!!!",4.0
"I came here with a group of 6 and I was really looking forward to this place after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. The decor is simple yet elegant. We ordered oysters for the table - they were good. For entrees we ordered Hake, Fried Chicken and Duck Meatloaf. Chicken and meatloaf were both flavorful, hake was quite tasteless.Not sure if I plan to return for dinner, but I'll try out their brunch.",3.0
"Love it! Love it! Fried chicken and waffle dish - holy mother of god that is amazing!  Do yourself and friends a favor - bring them here!  Place is clean, has a great bar you can site at, or by the window, decor is fantastic, not too loud, a bit of elegance - just perfect for a special occasion, or just want a great place to eat regularly.  Don't miss out if your on the south end of Court St - be sure to stop by!",5.0
Yo! You can come here for breakfast and get a short stack of DELICIOUS pancakes with a free alcoholic breakfast drink of your choice for $6! That right there is the best deal in the the neighborhood. I didn't have the pancakes but my friend did and they were good. I got the french toast and it was equally as amazing. To wash it all down we got bellinis and mimosas. Definitely one of the most satisfying breakfasts in a while!,4.0

Disappointing. I had looked forward to eating here for a long time. Took me a long time to get there because there is always a wait....so I thought it had to be good.  I enjoyed the bbq oysters.  The pork spare ribs tasted like old meet.  I couldn't even eat them.  We sat at the bar and I must say that the bartender was very full of himself.  Took him a while to acknowledge us and when he did it was very robotic and he never smiled.  Maybe we should have tried their fried chicken?????,2.0
"BRUNCH.After one visit, Buttermilk Channel has elevated itself into what will be a go-to brunch spot. Holy cow! I'm not your usual buttermilk biscuit type, but I date a boy who was raised on a diet of white gravy slop plus unrecognizable meat by-product over a dense slab of biscuit. (Affectionately known as ""SOS."" Look it up.) Here we are for brunch. The place is packed so we've scouted out stools at the bar. Sipping some delicious Bellinis --that are included in the brunch menu, of course-- and out come 1) a giant fried porkchop on a waffle for Boy, 2) my Eggs Benedict, hollandaise and poached egg over country ham, the fluffiest biscuit ,and the most delicious and lightly dressed salad on the side.  BEST FORTY MINUTES OF MY LIFE. I tried my first bite of fried-meat-over-waffle and the pork chop was juiiiiicy and the waffle was so flavorful. Even though it's busy, and it's loud, and the decor is kind of watery and boring, and even though the servers are overworked and distracted, this place is where they hide the good stuff.",5.0
The wait sucks but the food was great.I had the eggs which were good but not amazing. But my brother had the fried pork chops which were. Basically anything fried was AMAZING.Yum. The service was also really excellent. They kept checking in on us and our drinks were always refilled quickly. Enjoyed but not sure I'll go back anytime soon - mostly cuz it's a bit of a hike for me and I hate waiting for any meal. :),4.0
"We agree with Ava's review. This place is the bomb and i'm conviced it sits in some mystical vortex that sets your chi straight. We have been here dozens of times and have never had a negative experience or a bad meal. The quality of every dish is outstanding, the music is awesome, the service is amazing, and when you leave here you are always in a good mood. The owners always come by to get your feedback on the meal, talk to you, and make you feel like you are the #1 customer which makes this place 5 stars. You can't go wrong with the brunch or dinner. Everything on the menu is good. Some of our favorites include the BBQ oysters, the duck meatloaf, and the fish dishes. Occasionally i crave the fried chicken. I'm looking forward to eating here for many years to come.",5.0
"The vibe of Buttermilk Channel is quintessential ""New-Age Brooklyn"" - and that's not a bad thing!!!Sadly these days in both Manhattan and Brooklyn a lot of places try to manufacture that hip vibe and its usually quite apparent, and a turnoff in my opinion. At Buttermilk the buzz in the restaurant is completely inline with the stellar food on the menu. We went as a party of 4 and got to the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night and were fully prepared for an hour to hour and a half wait, they quoted us an hour and 45 minutes so we ended up going a few doors down to Palo Cortado for Sangria (which was good) while we waited. We got the call about an hour and 15 minutes later and were seated right near the front door. My fiancé and I sat against the window on a seat built into the wall which could have been more comfortable but not too bad. As for the food, we were brought out popovers for the table which were incredibly tasty and then ordered the little neck clams and the slow roasted pork spare ribs to start, both of which we enjoyed.

"Most of my beef with Buttermilk Channel has to do with the hype. There were a lot of promises going into it that my life was going to change (via chicken and waffles, in this case), but ultimately I just ended up being really, really bored. This place is so overwhelmingly UNDERwhelming. I really feel like I must be missing something because of all these glittering Yelp reviews, but I've been twice now and see nothing special about this place.On my first visit, we ordered both the pickles and an option the from the selection of daily cheeses- which turned out to be the best part of the meal (probably because it didn't require any real cooking on the part of the Buttermilk Channel staff). The entrees were the true disappointment, unfortunately. My consort had the burger- which he found to be a total snoozefest. Supermarket-y bun, dry meat, no toppings of interest; BORING. I had the storied chicken and waffles, which was a total letdown. It wasn't BAD, but it certainly wasn't good. The most off-putting part was the maple-balsamic glaze, which sounds amazing- and SHOULD be amazing- but was really a huge sugary, weird-tasting mess. The pecan pie sundae is definitely a ""Teen Mom"" or Lifetime Movie type of dessert; you know it's bad for you, but dammit, you watch/eat it anyway. But after a while, it starts to give you a stomachache.I swore off Buttermilk Channel after that, but a girlfriend cajoled me into going last night. I had the fresh linguine- which on paper, has everything going for it. Fresh peas, onions, garlic, pecorino, chile oil, and breadcrumbs. It sounded to me like Carbonara's skinny cousin. WRONG!

"After trying this place multiple times now, I am so glad this place is not too close, because I would go there everyday.  I don't know why, I just like this place that much.  I just do.  I have had brunch and dinner a like.  If you ever go for brunch, go early.  Sunday before noon they don't serve booze, so if you curing a hangover on Sunday, wait till after noon before showing up, then expect a wait.  Expect a wait every night or try to grab a seat at the bar.The fried chicken is some of the best in the 5 boroughs.  The cheddar waffle that accompanies the tender and crispy chicken is pretty awesome too.  The $25 Monday night 3 course dinner is a steal!  I had the trout off the menu the Monday I went and it was superb.  My wife had the duck meatloaf that was excellent as well.  The pecan pie sundae was pretty awesome way to finish up.  The brunch has a great French Toast...pecan pie FT to be exact.  Thick sliced brioche with caramel pecan sauce and whipped cream.  It's like a dessert and breakfast all rolled into one.  The coffee was pretty good as well.  I think it's Gimme! coffee.  All in all, I expect many returns to try many items here at Buttermilk Channel.",4.0

I think we've worked our way through all the snacks - the hush puppies are really good as are the housemade pickles. You should probably NOT get the fried chicken. It's just OK. The cheddar waffles they are served with are pretty awesome, though. You should get the duck meatloaf instead - really rich and delicious. Everything is good at brunchtime, too.

I have no idea why I have never ordered the pecan pie french toast, but I imagine it's as wonderful as it sounds.",4.0
"After hearing the hype about this place for over a year and finally trying it tonight, my husband and I were totally disappointed. He ordered the fried chicken, he said they got the crispy right, but need to season it, it was very plain. I had the hangar steak and it was served with a dog bone with marrow in it. The bread salad that came with it was way too drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.The side of mashed potatoes was fine. The hush puppies at Van Horn Sandwich st on Court are way better then Buttermilks. And as for the service, the hostesses do not smile and are not friendly and the waitress was neglectful.",2.0
"5 stars for brunch. Haven't been for any other meal, but I find myself trekking out from Astoria time and again for brunch here.I always order the same thing: Short stack of pancakes, side of hash browns, side of bacon. And I always leave here smiling. In fact, I can't stop beaming from the first moist, delicious bite of pancake that I take. I have no idea what they put in it (crack, maybe?), but DAMN are those pancakes good! And I'm not even a pancake person. The butter that comes on the side of the pancakes is also pretty life-altering. If it were socially acceptable, I would eat multiple ramekins of that butter. I would bathe in it if I could. It's got some vanilla twinge to it, oh man just thinking about it makes me want some right now! Anyway, the short stack is an excellent deal at only $6. The maple syrup is also super high quality tasting, but the pancakes are so good, you really don't even need it.The hash browns are a perfect counterbalance to the sweetness of the pancakes. You get two smallish discs of crispy salty goodness, which, while a small portion, is the perfect amount. The ketchup they provide is Heinz, which makes me happy. I think the hash browns are $5.The bacon...mmmm, bacon....it's thick, it's crispy, it's salty, it's chewy, it has an excellent taste. It's a pretty sizable portion (around 3 or 4 large slices), so I usually split it with a friend. I think the bacon is around $4 or $5 an order.When you order something from the brunch menu, you get a free alcoholic beverage. I ordered a bellini the first time I was here, and it tasted a bit off, so the waitress was nice and brought me the peach juice in a separate glass from the sparkling wine. The peach juice is SO good-I now order it like that every time I come just to savor the juice and wine separately. Speaking of service, all of the servers I've had here are nice and pretty laid-back. The hostess is very helpful, and wants everyone to enjoy their experience. We got here towards the tail end of brunch one day and she warned us they may not have a table by the time they stopped serving, but she ended up being able to seat us just as they were about to stop serving.Just as an aside, I've noticed that in order to finish my whole meal here, I need to have a snack beforehand, otherwise my stomach just can't handle all of that food that early in the day! So if you're stuck waiting for a table (don't worry, it usually goes quickly), have a small snack to warm up your tummy!",5.0
"Deliciousness. My friends and I had to wait about an hour for a table, but the food was worth the wait. I ordered the roasted mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese scramble; homemade sausage; and the cheddar waffle. One of my friends ordered the warm coffee cake afterwards for dessert. Personally I feel that the sides and the baked goods were far superior to my main brunch dish. The homemade sausage was terrific -- sweet, a touch of cayenne, and the crispy sage leaves were a wonderful accompaniment to the sausage. The cheddar waffles were perfect. Usually waffles are too soft and soggy, but these were perfectly crisp AND soft. The savoriness of the cheddar (and I think the waffles had some cornmeal as well) and the sweetness of the maple were a great flavor combination. The coffee cake was so good. The scramble was good, but not as good as the sides. The salad wasn't anything more than the usual baby lettuce and spinach leaves and a touch of vinaigrette. The hash brown was very crispy, crunchy, and tasty. Loved it. Will definitely come back here for more.",4.0
"I am finally writing a review for the Buttermilk Channel after being there for 4 times. The first time, I went, it was just after my yoga class. We were seated promptly.

"We arrived towards the end of brunch period so some items we were looking forward to try were already gone.  It was a tease to see the next table enjoy a thick cut of porkchop. Had a piece fall off the table, I would for sure snatch it mid-air. Now let me focus on what we ordered...We started off with 3 different kinds of bloody mary - otis, star of the sea and court street. They were all seasoned well with enough kick.  We all shared the house made sausage, cheddar waffle, mozzarella and for entree i ordered the lamb salad.  It was delicious. Everything was delicious! This is definitely one of the best brunch I've had. I'll come back for the porkchop and maple and bacon roasted almonds. See you again soon!",4.0
"This restaurant is worth the wait and money. Cheddar waffles are mouth watering! Add the bacon trout and spicy ribs will make you come back for more. The staff is accommodating. Pros: Awesome food and atmosphere.Cons: Could get pretty crowded, just half hour wait for me. (but i guess this tells you about the place)",4.0
"After trying this place multiple times now, I am so glad this place is not too close, because I would go there everyday.  I don't know why, I just like this place that much.  I just do.  I have had brunch and dinner a like.  If you ever go for brunch, go early.  Sunday before noon they don't serve booze, so if you curing a hangover on Sunday, wait till after noon before showing up, then expect a wait.  Expect a wait every night or try to grab a seat at the bar.The fried chicken is some of the best in the 5 boroughs.  The cheddar waffle that accompanies the tender and crispy chicken is pretty awesome too.  The $25 Monday night 3 course dinner is a steal!  I had the trout off the menu the Monday I went and it was superb.  My wife had the duck meatloaf that was excellent as well.  The pecan pie sundae was pretty awesome way to finish up.  The brunch has a great French Toast...pecan pie FT to be exact.  Thick sliced brioche with caramel pecan sauce and whipped cream.  It's like a dessert and breakfast all rolled into one.  The coffee was pretty good as well.  I think it's Gimme! coffee.  All in all, I expect many returns to try many items here at Buttermilk Channel.",4.0
"If you can get me out here just for dinner it must be good. Went here with a group of friends and they all loved it. They're famous for their fried. Chicken with waffles which is definitely great but I particularly love their duck meat loaf. Juicy and amazing, great with the corn.All in all a delicious place, everything we had including drinks was well worth a return visit.",4.0
"Came here with my husband for brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon. Our wait was about half an hour.I liked the feel and atmosphere of the place and the menu looked easy and rustic. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese scramble...which was just typical...but the bloody mary was phenomenal! Tasted fresh, shreds of horseradish, and a pickle! It was the best bloody mary I'd ever had.",3.0
"Nice service - very accommodating waiters and hosts. I've only been for brunch/ very late lunch (which is early dinner, I guess) a few times, and it's good stuff. I think we've worked our way through all the snacks - the hush puppies are really good as are the housemade pickles. You should probably NOT get the fried chicken. It's just OK. The cheddar waffles they are served with are pretty awesome, though. You should get the duck meatloaf instead - really rich and delicious. Everything is good at brunchtime, too. I particularly enjoyed the grilled cheese, the Eggs Huntington and the banana walnut bun. I have no idea why I have never ordered the pecan pie french toast, but I imagine it's as wonderful as it sounds.",4.0
"After hearing the hype about this place for over a year and finally trying it tonight, my husband and I were totally disappointed. He ordered the fried chicken, he said they got the crispy right, but need to season it, it was very plain. I had the hangar steak and it was served with a dog bone with marrow in it. The bread salad that came with it was way too drenched in olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.The side of mashed potatoes was fine. The hush puppies at Van Horn Sandwich st on Court are way better then Buttermilks. And as for the service, the hostesses do not smile and are not friendly and the waitress was neglectful.",2.0
"5 stars for brunch. Haven't been for any other meal, but I find myself trekking out from Astoria time and again for brunch here.I always order the same thing: Short stack of pancakes, side of hash browns, side of bacon. And I always leave here smiling. In fact, I can't stop beaming from the first moist, delicious bite of pancake that I take. I have no idea what they put in it (crack, maybe?), but DAMN are those pancakes good! And I'm not even a pancake person. The butter that comes on the side of the pancakes is also pretty life-altering. If it were socially acceptable, I would eat multiple ramekins of that butter. I would bathe in it if I could. It's got some vanilla twinge to it, oh man just thinking about it makes me want some right now! Anyway, the short stack is an excellent deal at only $6. The maple syrup is also super high quality tasting, but the pancakes are so good, you really don't even need it.The hash browns are a perfect counterbalance to the sweetness of the pancakes. You get two smallish discs of crispy salty goodness, which, while a small portion, is the perfect amount. The ketchup they provide is Heinz, which makes me happy. I think the hash browns are $5.The bacon...mmmm, bacon....it's thick, it's crispy, it's salty, it's chewy, it has an excellent taste. It's a pretty sizable portion (around 3 or 4 large slices), so I usually split it with a friend. I think the bacon is around $4 or $5 an order.When you order something from the brunch menu, you get a free alcoholic beverage. I ordered a bellini the first time I was here, and it tasted a bit off, so the waitress was nice and brought me the peach juice in a separate glass from the sparkling wine. The peach juice is SO good-I now order it like that every time I come just to savor the juice and wine separately. Speaking of service, all of the servers I've had here are nice and pretty laid-back. The hostess is very helpful, and wants everyone to enjoy their experience. We got here towards the tail end of brunch one day and she warned us they may not have a table by the time they stopped serving, but she ended up being able to seat us just as they were about to stop serving.Just as an aside, I've noticed that in order to finish my whole meal here, I need to have a snack beforehand, otherwise my stomach just can't handle all of that food that early in the day! So if you're stuck waiting for a table (don't worry, it usually goes quickly), have a small snack to warm up your tummy!",5.0
"Deliciousness. My friends and I had to wait about an hour for a table, but the food was worth the wait. I ordered the roasted mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese scramble; homemade sausage; and the cheddar waffle. One of my friends ordered the warm coffee cake afterwards for dessert. Personally I feel that the sides and the baked goods were far superior to my main brunch dish. The homemade sausage was terrific -- sweet, a touch of cayenne, and the crispy sage leaves were a wonderful accompaniment to the sausage. The cheddar waffles were perfect. Usually waffles are too soft and soggy, but these were perfectly crisp AND soft. The savoriness of the cheddar (and I think the waffles had some cornmeal as well) and the sweetness of the maple were a great flavor combination. The coffee cake was so good. The scramble was good, but not as good as the sides. The salad wasn't anything more than the usual baby lettuce and spinach leaves and a touch of vinaigrette. The hash brown was very crispy, crunchy, and tasty. Loved it. Will definitely come back here for more.",4.0

"I went here for dinner on St. Patricks Day with a vegetarian friend. They have a special menu for vegetarians! Very thoughtful. And even though I wanted to devour some delicious beast I decided to be a good friend and go veggie for the evening. The cheddar waffle with shaved brussel sprouts and delicious roasted mushrooms was divine! The waitstaff was super kind, and at the end of the night when we requested a bizarre dessert that wasn't on the menu (Guiness float with pistachio ice cream, in honor of the day), they were really nice and made us a float with a porter they had on draught. I really like the space. It feels like you're eating in someone's lovely living room with tall ceilings, big windows and large farmhouse-y tables. It's a very comforting place to be.I've tried to come for brunch a few times, but all the good reviews have made it next to impossible to get a table.

"I went to Buttermilk Channel for brunch on Sunday.  You can't reserve a table, which is a bit annoying because it is really popular!  We turned up at 1pm and it was an hour wait - but they take your number so we went for a coffee and wandered round Court St.It was worth the wait as the atmosphere was really nice in there, it was buzzing with happy people enjoying brunch. I had the eggs benedict and it was amazing!  So tasty.  It all sounded really good.  My husband had the pecan pie french toast, which was as incredible as it sounds!  It is sweet though!It is definitely worth going for brunch, but go early or be prepared to wait.",4.0
"If for no other reason, you should dine here just to have a bloody mary. My personal favorite is the Star of the Sea which comes topped with a fresh oyster.

It can get nosy in the dining room, so if you are looking for a place to hold an intimate conversation, look elsewhere. The french toast and any of the egg scrambles are great as are the homemade pickles (I am a sucker for pickles). Bottoms up!",4.0
"For my first trip out to Brooklyn, I decided to go to Buttermilk Channel after hearing some good things about it.  The wait was about an hour long, so I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.The place was loud- very loud.  I found it a little difficult to hold a conversation over the noise.  Atmosphere-wise, it wasn't anything spectacular, the usual dim lighting, some exposed brick but this part seemed a little out of place with the rest of the minimally decorated white walls.Service was...interesting.  First of all, when I asked for a wine recommendation and told the waitress what kind of wine I liked, she said ""I know exactly what wine to get you"", and left the table without telling me what it was or anything about it.  The wine itself was ok, not really what I was looking for.  When I asked what her favorite things on the menu were, all she said was ""Everything is good.  But a lot of people order the chicken and waffles"".  She didn't really offer any helpful information or details.  Later in the meal, when she handed us the dessert menu and I asked her what she recommended, she said she had never tried any of the desserts on the menu so she didn't know.  Isn't it part of the waitstaff's job to be knowledgabel about the food the restaurant serves?On to the food:- Sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes:  completely boring an unforgettable.  Basically it was a fried ball of mashed sweet potato, without even a hint of goat cheese, or any other flavor.- Cheese plate:  the cheese itself was pretty good, although we didn't really get an explanation of what they were, but the biggest issue was the bread that was served with it.  It was completely charred!  What kind of restaurant serves its customers burnt bread?- Fried chicken with cheddar waffles:  The chicken itself was pretty good; moist, crispy skin, the way fried chicken should be, although I wouldn't say it was particularly memorable.  The cheddar waffles it was served with was actually kind of cold.- Duck meatloaf:  more of a duck patty than meatloaf, this was an amazing dish that I absolutely loved.  Served on a bed of creamed spinach and topped with a large crispy onion ring, the flavor was incredible.  I almost licked my plate clean.- Chocolate chip bread pudding:  I was told it was served warm, but it actually arrived room temperature, with the top of it slightly warm.  It was extremely dense and aside fromnt he bits of chocolate, it was kind of bland.Although I'm glad I went for the duck meatloaf, I definitely won't be back for another visit.",2.0

"I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. At around 7:40 the wait was forty five minutes. Determined to try it, we decided to wait it out and walk around the area. We wound up being seated after a little over an hour wait. The atmosphere of the place was very relaxed and had a great vibe. We had a corner table seated next to a candle and it made it feel romantic. The space is definitely tight, but we didn't mind it. Our waiter was exceptional and the wine delicious. We were brought a couple of popovers for the table which were a great combination of sweet and salty. We ordered mussels to start which were in an amazing broth that my boyfriend couldn't get enough of. I had to try the chicken and waffles which were the best chicken and waffles I've had and my boyfriend had the special of the night which was a huge piece of steak that he enjoyed. Buttermilk Channel is definitely worth the wait and I can't wait to go back for dinner again and to try their brunch as well.",5.0
"Usually people go to Palo Cortado because the wait's too painful at Buttermilk Channel, but it was actually the opposite for me. Palo Cortado was closed for a private party so we went down the street to Buttermilk Channel where it was a surprisingly quick 10-minute wait. My friends and I all got the $25 3-course special and since there were 3 of us we got to try one of everything on the menu. I had the apple and turnip salad which I loved even though I hate turnips. I tried a little of everyone's entrees and my favorite was definitely the bluefish; I just wish there was more of it especially when you compared it to my fried chicken entree. I loved the crispy crust, but most importantly how they didn't overcook the chicken breast. Dry fried chicken is the worst. (I even microwaved a piece the next day and it was still super moist!) But it wasn't anything super special. The pecan pie sundae was as tasty as everyone said it'd be. But overall, I don't think I'd come back here...unless it was a Monday of course. I think the fact that everything was just $25 made it taste better, but it's not something I'd go out of my way to have again.",3.0

"Please, please, please- do not attempt to eat here. Save yourself.  Do not read on unless you want to hear an extremely jaded account of a poor dinning experience.  Recap of my experience- Fried chicken was dry, flavorless, tough and cold.Cole slaw salad tastes like it was flavored with canned olive juice- euwww!!!Even the burger... the poor burger... I love burgers... all burgers... I don't discriminate... and this burger was as bland as plain oatmeal. The Soup was ok, but still not good. I'm not going to crave it- ever. Even the white dipping sauce for the fries was gross. And the fries were too crunchy and dry. Honestly... it's like they let all their food sit on a Ronco food dehydrator before they served it. I thought maybe they would redeem themselves with the pecan pie sundae... why did they have to go and put it in a glass jar? I mean it looks cool I guess. But you know what would be cooler? Actual warm pecan pie with the ice cream and whipped cream on top. It was ok, I mean it's hard to mess this up- but it wasn't good. It just wasn't :(*mind you - despite being really hungry- this was still how I felt. Buttermilk Channel is a perfect example of really good food completely ruined and poorly imitated in an attempt to make it cool and trendy. There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Brooklyn. Just not this one. I'm still so disappointed.  :(The waitress and the service was great. So that's good, right?",1.0
"We were starving but still waited (as patiently as we could) for a table for brunch.  We were rewarded with a cute table for 2 by a window.  The free mimosas/bellinis with the meals were a nice touch.  I actually don't really drink, but it still adds an extra nice feeling, and these were pretty tasty and fun!  We felt like the wait for the food was a bit long, but that might just have been our empty bellies.  I got the Esposito's scramble and it was the perfect amount of food that filled me even in my hungry state.  We shared a short stack of pancakes, and they were good but we still prefer homemade.  The Eggs Huntington was the other dish at our table which was good, but not as well-received as the scramble.  Oh, and it is not on the menu, but the huntington dish also included the same salad that the scramble had.Service was decent.  Not as warm or friendly as you might want for a brunch place, but I guess they were going for that hipster vibe?  Good food could make you go again, but with so many other places to try, we might just go elsewhere to get a different ambiance.  Food isn't as nice when you don't feel cool enough to eat somewhere.",3.0
"Went to brunch around 1130 am encountered a 45 min wait time on Sunday. The food was definitely worth the wait time. I tried the pancakes, the sticky bun, the french toast and the eggs huntington. The pancakes are the fluffiest I have ever had. The sticky bun was okay, but still good. The pecan french toast was amazing. It was hard on the outside like toast but in the middle, it was soft and almost pudding like. The eggs huntington was cooked perfectly too, with the yolk gushing out when you cut it open. I will definately go back.",5.0

"I'd like to think I just built this up too much. I want this to be my fault. I really do. I saw this place first on The Food Network, and like any good Yelper, I logged on and attempted to verify the claims. 390+ reviews and 4 stars...I'm in. This was the first stop in the ""NYC"" segment of our summer vacation. Previously we were in Atlanta, and we ate well. So, this being New York, and considering all of the research I've done, my expectations are rather high. Not to mention, my @$$ is on the line here. I'm the guy booking our reservations. In essence, I'm 'recommending' these restaurants. So if something turns out bad, or even mediocre, that's a reflection on my decision-making ability.So, first night out the gates in New York, and I come up short. Not cool. But let me clarify -- not everything here was mediocre. In fact, everything started off well. From the day I made the reservation, and when I called back last-minute to add a guest, and even the our initial greeting -- everyone was quite friendly. So, rather than craft a long-winded play-by-play, let me give a few bullet points of the things I liked and disliked.Pros:- Friendly host staff- Very kid friendly - even to the point that they served my 4-year old son his meal well ahead of ours without us having to request it.- The bread they served us initially: Amazing!- The flatbread and the bacon that started us off: Delish!(at this point in the meal ALL of our high expectations had been met)Cons:- The baked oysters: Ehhh. This was the first disappointment. I wanted to love them, but they were just okay.- The fried chicken and cheddar waffles: I mean seriously...THIS is why I came here. When someone reputable says that this is (one of) the BEST things they ever ate, I'm getting it. And I did. I took that first bite with great anticipation. The experience: underwhelming. Let me take another bite, I thought, to see if the flavors start to pop. Nope. Okay, another...nope. And then something completely unexpected happened -- the more I ate, the worse the dish got. I found the breading quite soaked in oil. The chicken was almost flavorless apart from the taste of the oil. The waffle: it was decent. Better than the chicken, but not nearly enough to elevate the overall quality of the dish. The coleslaw: a slightly better version of your grandma's coleslaw. The problem is, I hate your grandma's coleslaw. I won't eat it. This, on the other hand, was just good enough to eat.- The server: She wasn't overtly rude. In fact, at first, before my food experience began to sour, I completely ignored the little signs that told me she had a holier-than-thou attitude. Whatever it was I thought I had noticed, I was there to have a great experience, and I was going to ignore it. But as the meal went on, I couldn't ignore it. Frankly, she just wasn't very friendly toward us. Uggghhhh...I'm disappointed that I'm disappointed. I REALLY wanted to love this place. But I didn't. Hopefully tomorrow night will be better.",3.0
"Buttermilk Channel is a romantic, (although seriously noisy), warmly lit, small space that has excellent food and refinement. My friend and I shared a number of items in order to test out the menu. When we ordered half a dozen fresh oysters, we were served a chef's selection of tree very varied (savory to sweet) that were detailed by our waitress at the table. The ricotta based flatbread was more of a crisp and not anything to reorder unless you are looking for a salty drink pairing. The highlight of the meal was an exquisitely creamy and balanced chicken liver mousse with charred fresh bread. And a simple asparagus based Spring pasta dish finished off out meal. All in all an excellent meal although a bit loud.",4.0
"Basically, I can't wait to come back for more at Buttermilk Channel.  We arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and had to wait for a good 30-45 minutes, but SO WORTH IT!  Besides having the cutest website ever, the brunch proved to be pretty top-notch as well.  The snacks, mostly around $2-4 are small-ish and range from grapefruit slices to maple bacon almonds to a warm sour cream donut or coffee cake.  The bloody mary selection also rules, with varities of your simple classic bloody mary to one made with whiskey.   My cousin and I split the burger, which was the best burger I've had thus far in NYC.  The beef was house ground mixed with grilled onions and came with a fat slice of cheddar cheese on top alongside a plate of skinny, cripsy french fries. My other cousin thoroughly enjoyed her vegetarian scramble mixed with goat cheese, roasted mushrooms, and spinach.  The presentation was adorable as well.  Next up will be Sunday night dinner so I can try their supposedly delicious fried chicken with the grilled bread stuffing.   I'm already drooling just thinking about it.",5.0
Great for a Brunch date. I love the pork chop with cheddar waffles (yum). Get there early cause it gets packed quick.,4.0
"Please, please, please- do not attempt to eat here. Save yourself.  Do not read on unless you want to hear an extremely jaded account of a poor dinning experience.  Recap of my experience- Fried chicken was dry, flavorless, tough and cold.Cole slaw salad tastes like it was flavored with canned olive juice- euwww!!!Even the burger... the poor burger... I love burgers... all burgers... I don't discriminate... and this burger was as bland as plain oatmeal. The Soup was ok, but still not good. I'm not going to crave it- ever. Even the white dipping sauce for the fries was gross. And the fries were too crunchy and dry. Honestly... it's like they let all their food sit on a Ronco food dehydrator before they served it. I thought maybe they would redeem themselves with the pecan pie sundae... why did they have to go and put it in a glass jar? I mean it looks cool I guess. But you know what would be cooler? Actual warm pecan pie with the ice cream and whipped cream on top. It was ok, I mean it's hard to mess this up- but it wasn't good. It just wasn't :(*mind you - despite being really hungry- this was still how I felt. Buttermilk Channel is a perfect example of really good food completely ruined and poorly imitated in an attempt to make it cool and trendy. There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Brooklyn. Just not this one. I'm still so disappointed.  :(The waitress and the service was great. So that's good, right?",1.0
"We were starving but still waited (as patiently as we could) for a table for brunch.  We were rewarded with a cute table for 2 by a window.  The free mimosas/bellinis with the meals were a nice touch.  I actually don't really drink, but it still adds an extra nice feeling, and these were pretty tasty and fun!  We felt like the wait for the food was a bit long, but that might just have been our empty bellies.  I got the Esposito's scramble and it was the perfect amount of food that filled me even in my hungry state.  We shared a short stack of pancakes, and they were good but we still prefer homemade.  The Eggs Huntington was the other dish at our table which was good, but not as well-received as the scramble.  Oh, and it is not on the menu, but the huntington dish also included the same salad that the scramble had.Service was decent.  Not as warm or friendly as you might want for a brunch place, but I guess they were going for that hipster vibe?  Good food could make you go again, but with so many other places to try, we might just go elsewhere to get a different ambiance.  Food isn't as nice when you don't feel cool enough to eat somewhere.",3.0
"Went to brunch around 1130 am encountered a 45 min wait time on Sunday. The food was definitely worth the wait time. I tried the pancakes, the sticky bun, the french toast and the eggs huntington. The pancakes are the fluffiest I have ever had. The sticky bun was okay, but still good. The pecan french toast was amazing. It was hard on the outside like toast but in the middle, it was soft and almost pudding like. The eggs huntington was cooked perfectly too, with the yolk gushing out when you cut it open. I will definately go back.",5.0
"Take 2!  After not being able to suffer the 1 hour wait last weekend, we decided to try again this weekend, this time calling ahead to get our name on the list.The food:Watermelon and radish salad - fresh and interesting combination of flavors.Fried chicken and cheddar waffles - HUGE portion.  This definitely seemed to be the most popular dish on the menu.  Definitely lived up to the hype but...Burger - sooo good.  One of the best burgers I've ever tasted.  I think it outshone the chicken.Pecan Pie Sundae - definitely was too full to eat this but glad we ordered it because it was delicious and the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had.",4.0
"I love this place.  I had the Monday night $28 deal with the fried chicken and the pecan pie dessert.  I accidentally got the salad rather than the appetizer I ordered and they let me keep both.  The food was awesome, but the staff particularly impressed me with how attentive and understanding they were with my badly behaved toddler.  Despite the fact that it got quite crowded after 7pm, they were quick to change the paper table cover after his spill, and were cool when he made a couple of mad dashes across the dining room.  The fried chicken plate was enough to share for the kiddo, and the popovers were simply orgasmic.",4.0
"Just average place in my opinion. I went there for dinner and had the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, it wasn't amazing.  I was disappointed because so many ppl rave abt this place.

"I'd like to think I just built this up too much. I want this to be my fault. I really do. I saw this place first on The Food Network, and like any good Yelper, I logged on and attempted to verify the claims. 390+ reviews and 4 stars...I'm in. This was the first stop in the ""NYC"" segment of our summer vacation. Previously we were in Atlanta, and we ate well. So, this being New York, and considering all of the research I've done, my expectations are rather high. Not to mention, my @$$ is on the line here. I'm the guy booking our reservations. In essence, I'm 'recommending' these restaurants. So if something turns out bad, or even mediocre, that's a reflection on my decision-making ability.So, first night out the gates in New York, and I come up short. Not cool. But let me clarify -- not everything here was mediocre. In fact, everything started off well. From the day I made the reservation, and when I called back last-minute to add a guest, and even the our initial greeting -- everyone was quite friendly. So, rather than craft a long-winded play-by-play, let me give a few bullet points of the things I liked and disliked.Pros:- Friendly host staff- Very kid friendly - even to the point that they served my 4-year old son his meal well ahead of ours without us having to request it.- The bread they served us initially: Amazing!- The flatbread and the bacon that started us off: Delish!(at this point in the meal ALL of our high expectations had been met)Cons:- The baked oysters: Ehhh. This was the first disappointment. I wanted to love them, but they were just okay.- The fried chicken and cheddar waffles: I mean seriously...THIS is why I came here. When someone reputable says that this is (one of) the BEST things they ever ate, I'm getting it. And I did. I took that first bite with great anticipation. The experience: underwhelming. Let me take another bite, I thought, to see if the flavors start to pop. Nope. Okay, another...nope. And then something completely unexpected happened -- the more I ate, the worse the dish got. I found the breading quite soaked in oil. The chicken was almost flavorless apart from the taste of the oil. The waffle: it was decent. Better than the chicken, but not nearly enough to elevate the overall quality of the dish. The coleslaw: a slightly better version of your grandma's coleslaw. The problem is, I hate your grandma's coleslaw. I won't eat it. This, on the other hand, was just good enough to eat.- The server: She wasn't overtly rude. In fact, at first, before my food experience began to sour, I completely ignored the little signs that told me she had a holier-than-thou attitude. Whatever it was I thought I had noticed, I was there to have a great experience, and I was going to ignore it. But as the meal went on, I couldn't ignore it. Frankly, she just wasn't very friendly toward us. Uggghhhh...I'm disappointed that I'm disappointed. I REALLY wanted to love this place. But I didn't. Hopefully tomorrow night will be better.",3.0

"Buttermilk Channel you have more class than you know.

"We had been told about Buttermilk Channel by many of our foodie friends, so maybe our expectations were too high?  I thought the location, decor and service were spectacular, but while the food isn't BAD, per se, it's incredibly overpriced for what it is.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying for a great experience, but I just felt a little cheated here.The things we loved were the BBQ oysters with bacon and the grilled pole beans with lemon.  Other than that, I had the watermelon/radish salad which was just okay - and the linguini with mushrooms and corn which was good, but overall VERY salty and heavy (I asked for it without the cheese too, but I think the sauce might have been cream based) - like after two bites, I felt like I couldn't eat anymore.  My fiance had the gazpacho which was okay, but missing salt (weird), and then he went with the fried chicken which was the same - extremely heavy and salty batter (but the actual chicken was really moist which was nice).  They deep fry it, by the way, not pan fry it... I think this is why the chicken is moist but the flavor is overpowering.  The cheddar waffle was awesome though.  And I loved our bread pudding desserts but he thought they were also too salty.... they're big fans of salt there!Honestly, the food wasn't BAD - I would have been ecstatic if it had been half the price, but we walked out of there feeling raped which is never a good thing.  I'm glad we tried it, but we won't be going back. $18 for a few pieces of mediocre fried chicken is what they're known for?  no thanks.",3.0

"Buttermilk Channel was featured in the ""Best Restaurants"" issue of Bon Apetit for their weekly Monday three course pre fixe dinners for $25. Since I was trying to make my trip to New York as cheap as possible I figured this was my best bet. A somewhat upscale place with cheap dinner? I'm so there!Buttermilk Channel is a restaurant you go to with a small group of friends to laugh, dine, and drink for hours. It has a homey comforting feel as if this was a dining room in a modern home. The decorations are sparse and the lighting is low. I was attracted to the space but it was a nice summer night that I opted to sit outside.I was given the menu for the three course dinner. The main courses were the most varied consisting of three choices. You could choose from chicken and cheddar waffles, a pasta dish, or a fish fillet wrapped in bacon and mashed potatoes. I had seen every dish on another table with the exception of the pasta dish. The chicken and waffles looked delectable and the bacon wrapped fillet with potatoes made my mouth water. I choose the pasta dish. The first item set in front of me was a sweet biscuit covered in honey. A departure from the rest of the menu I thought. It was tasty but I found it unusual for a sweet item to be first. Next came a corn chowder which would have been fabulous if it wasn't lukewarm in temperature. Next came my pasta which was missing a key ingredient: flavor. The pasta was mixed with greens, mushrooms, and corn kennels but it the flavors didn't mend together so it felt was if I was consuming a bowl of plain pasta. I doused the dish with Tabasco sauce and pepper and with that it started to taste a bit better. A bit deflated that my previous entrees weren't as I had expected, I was nervous about dessert. To my delight dessert was exquisite! I choose the pecan pie sundae and it was layers of pecans, ice cream, and whipped cream.

The city the bathroom was nice also.... But the food was horrible. The lemonade was more like water with lemons squeezed I. Very quickly. The food itself was crap too I got the chicken and waffles which did not go well together the syrup was like an apricot which really made it crappy.

It's a cozy place w/ dim lighting and feels intimate. I went with their fried chicken and waffles (very indulgent), playing on the sweet and salty. Am I looking back at my meal and wanting more? Probably not. Would I go back again? Yes, to try something else.",3.0
"Waited an hour and 15 minutes for a table. I love to brunch so I wasn't really complaining about the wait. But since the wait was so long, I already knew what I wanted once we were seated.I had the Huntington Eggs. The biscuit was open faced with ham/proscuitto and a poached egg on top of it. There was also a side of mixed greens on the plate (like!). My dish was good but I felt for the thickness and density of the biscuit, there should have been a bit more meat or thicker slices of it. Aside from the complimentary orange juice, I also had the coffee. Me likey because it's nice and strong! He had the mushroom, spinach and goat cheese scramble. Just the right amount of goat cheese without making you say 'ewww'. The eggs were served in a small, deep bowl. There was also a side of mixed greens and toast. Ordered the cheddar waffles and this, I thought was very interesting. I loved how they incorporated the cheddar cheese into the batter without comprimising the fluffiness of the waffle. The sweet and salty combo is definitely a 'hit' in my book.Definitely enjoyed brunch here and found that the pricing is reasonable considering that a choice of mimosa, bellini or champagne is included. Coffee is separate. Service was okay but understandable since it was so busy.",4.0
"One of the more underwhelming restaurant experiences I've had in a while. The boyfriend made plans to go to the restaurant after a visit to the Brooklyn Botannical gardens to see the cherry blossoms. Because our visit to the gardens ended earlier than we anticipated, we decided to walk to the restaurant. Since he usually has excellent choice in restaurant, I assumed that it would be awesome, as usual. First impressions were promising-it's pretty much what you would expect a place with the word ""buttermilk"" to look like...very country-esque. Hungry from a half day of walking, we decided upon the Caputo's Handmade Mozzarella with Basil and Warm Anchovy Sauce, Slow-Roasted Pork Spare Ribs, Warm Lamb and Romaine Salad, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (a choice that was heavily influenced by all the raving reviews).The meal also started out with a bang-the mozzarella was delicious (and I don't think it was due to our hunger!), with just enough flavors to make it interesting, but not too much as to be overwhelming. The pork was excellent as well, and perfectly roasted with a sauce that had an unexpected (but well-received) kick at the end. The second course. Sorely disappointing:The lamb salad had its moments (e.g. the cauliflower), but the lamb was not extraordinary, and the boiled egg was way too salty (so much for Bloomberg's war on salt!). Halfway through the meal, I realized that I was continuing to eat merely because I felt like it'd be a waste of $16.  We ordered the chicken despite our initial concerns that it was too ordinary. And it was little more than ordinary. According to the boyfriend, the highlight of his meal was the cole slaw (eek). The fried chicken was good, but it was just fried chicken, and the waffle was good, but it was just a waffle (with syrup that was very fluid and ""pure""). His last piece of chicken was also a bit bloody. Worth $18? Probably not. Take home point: the food is fine, but probably not worth the $$$. I'm sorry to say that I would probably not go here again.",2.0
"I came here for brunch with some friends last weekend and got the Eggs Huntington and a banana walnut bun which were both excellent. The wait staff was also great. My only complaint is the water being served was not clean; everyone's water glasses at my table had stuff floating in it (possibly from a filter, but nevertheless unacceptable).

Soooooo dissapointed. My boyfriend And i pass this place everyday On our way home I finally decided we had to go... And what crap the environment is cute I felt like I was in a barn I. The city the bathroom was nice also.... But the food was horrible. The lemonade was more like water with lemons squeezed I. Very quickly. The food itself was crap too I got the chicken and waffles which did not go well together the syrup was like an apricot which really made it crappy. I was soo surlrised that this place had bad food I spoke to many people in Manhattan who traveled here all the time just to eat here. Capitol  ewe...I'll pass.,1.0
"The fried pork chops here are amazing.I came for brunch with a new friend and her mother, since I am without a reason to celebrate mother's day in NY...mine is on the west coast.I have walked past several times, but it seems like the type of place you don't go to alone.  Now that I am meeting more people in the area, I will have more people to come back to this yummy spot again.And now that I have been inside, I see that I can eat alone at the bar, which isn't so daunting.",4.0
"Was here last week for brunch - my friend and I waited for just over an hour to be seated (I know - INSANE and unnecessary, but we really wanted to try this place).  The hostess handled the massive influx of people very well.  I ordered the lox scramble, which was very nice alongside its salad and delicious little hash brown.  The buttermilk biscuits were flaky and salty in the right ways.  My friend's pancake stack was cake-sweet and very good and his side of cheese waffles were delicious.  We definitely want to go back and sample more of the menu, which was able to balance New York's local food with classy Americana and down-home tastes.  I'd go back but I don't know that i'd wait another hour...",4.0
"Comforting and sinfully delicious. A chill environment with traces of trendiness to boot!Went for birthday brunch and tried to behave myself with the roasted cauliflower and apple soup, with a side of the cheddar waffle.

"I thought dinner in Carrol Gardens on a Sat. would be a 45 min. wait, an hour max. forget that try two hours! They don't take reservations so you either have to have a friend who lives in the hood to cue or a large group to make a res. Anyways, I came back on a Tuesday and was seated right away. It's a cozy place w/ dim lighting and feels intimate. I went with their fried chicken and waffles (very indulgent), playing on the sweet and salty. Am I looking back at my meal and wanting more? Probably not. Would I go back again? Yes, to try something else.",3.0
"Waited an hour and 15 minutes for a table. I love to brunch so I wasn't really complaining about the wait. But since the wait was so long, I already knew what I wanted once we were seated.I had the Huntington Eggs. The biscuit was open faced with ham/proscuitto and a poached egg on top of it. There was also a side of mixed greens on the plate (like!). My dish was good but I felt for the thickness and density of the biscuit, there should have been a bit more meat or thicker slices of it. Aside from the complimentary orange juice, I also had the coffee. Me likey because it's nice and strong! He had the mushroom, spinach and goat cheese scramble. Just the right amount of goat cheese without making you say 'ewww'. The eggs were served in a small, deep bowl. There was also a side of mixed greens and toast. Ordered the cheddar waffles and this, I thought was very interesting. I loved how they incorporated the cheddar cheese into the batter without comprimising the fluffiness of the waffle. The sweet and salty combo is definitely a 'hit' in my book.Definitely enjoyed brunch here and found that the pricing is reasonable considering that a choice of mimosa, bellini or champagne is included. Coffee is separate. Service was okay but understandable since it was so busy.",4.0
"One of the more underwhelming restaurant experiences I've had in a while. The boyfriend made plans to go to the restaurant after a visit to the Brooklyn Botannical gardens to see the cherry blossoms. Because our visit to the gardens ended earlier than we anticipated, we decided to walk to the restaurant. Since he usually has excellent choice in restaurant, I assumed that it would be awesome, as usual. First impressions were promising-it's pretty much what you would expect a place with the word ""buttermilk"" to look like...very country-esque. Hungry from a half day of walking, we decided upon the Caputo's Handmade Mozzarella with Basil and Warm Anchovy Sauce, Slow-Roasted Pork Spare Ribs, Warm Lamb and Romaine Salad, and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (a choice that was heavily influenced by all the raving reviews).The meal also started out with a bang-the mozzarella was delicious (and I don't think it was due to our hunger!), with just enough flavors to make it interesting, but not too much as to be overwhelming. The pork was excellent as well, and perfectly roasted with a sauce that had an unexpected (but well-received) kick at the end. The second course. Sorely disappointing:The lamb salad had its moments (e.g. the cauliflower), but the lamb was not extraordinary, and the boiled egg was way too salty (so much for Bloomberg's war on salt!). Halfway through the meal, I realized that I was continuing to eat merely because I felt like it'd be a waste of $16.  We ordered the chicken despite our initial concerns that it was too ordinary. And it was little more than ordinary. According to the boyfriend, the highlight of his meal was the cole slaw (eek). The fried chicken was good, but it was just fried chicken, and the waffle was good, but it was just a waffle (with syrup that was very fluid and ""pure""). His last piece of chicken was also a bit bloody. Worth $18? Probably not. Take home point: the food is fine, but probably not worth the $$$. I'm sorry to say that I would probably not go here again.",2.0
"I came here for brunch with some friends last weekend and got the Eggs Huntington and a banana walnut bun which were both excellent. The wait staff was also great. My only complaint is the water being served was not clean; everyone's water glasses at my table had stuff floating in it (possibly from a filter, but nevertheless unacceptable). Even after that, I would still come back for the food.",4.0
A madhouse at brunch with a deafening din though lives up to the hype.  Solid food with a twist.  Ordered the fried pork chop over waffles a take off on the famous chicken and waffles.

"I went to Buttermilk Channel for a Christmas date dinner with my boyfriend. After a brief discussion on whether or not the bartender was more ""lumberjack"" or ""seaman,"" we sat down at a cute two seater near the entrance. The menu was very much ""home cookin'"" and reminded me of the dishes you see at The General Greene. Lots of fried chicken and roasted, oily vegetables. One of the main reasons we chose Buttermilk, besides their reputation, is because they have a vegetarian menu with about 5 or 6 main veggie dishes. The waiter brought us two delightful and fluffy popovers as our bread. We ordered the hush puppies as a ""snack"" and the butternut squash tart as a first course to share."" The hush puppies were crispy and delicious. The tart had interesting flavors. It was sweeter than we expected but still great. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles and I ordered the cheddar waffles with roast brussel sprouts and mushrooms as our entrees. My veggies were very roasted (meaning there is no doubt they were swimming in oil) and my waffles were fair. Considering everything else was so hot and crispy, I found them to be cold and limp. Great beer and wine list as well.  Our bill totaled around $100. Overall, this is not a health food place! Come hungry and be prepared to see lots of fried buttery dishes. Like other Yelpers, I think it may be overrated considering that my dining partner and I felt like the menu was very familiar. For me, the snacks and veggie first courses seemed to be more interested than the entrees. I would go back.",4.0

I went here because everyone seems to be talking about it. Dont get me wrong its a great brunch restaurant but I was let down by the pecan pie french toast. Everyone says its great and I coundnt wait to try it but it was cold and totally not what I expected. The rest of the food was really nice though. Make sure to try to buttermilk biscuits. Good service but nothing out of this world in my opinion. The wait for sunday brunch was 2 hours which wasnt really cool either.,3.0
"""Oh. My. Gawwwwwd"" as Joey Styles, the wrestling announcer legend would say.By far the best restaurant I have been to in Brooklyn is now Buttermilk Channel. The reviews do not lie and even Sam Sifton of the New York Times notes that Buttermilk Channel is a destination point for those venturing from Manhattan.Literally, as other reviewers noted, everything on the menu is good. Breaded oysters were prepared perfectly and had the right amount of flavor and that natural, oyster taste that can be killed sometimes when restaurants overbread them.I went with the chicken liver, an acquired taste but served on toast and with grapes, it was a filling portion that you have to try. The liver was smooth and spread easily so it was almost more of a butter. I recommend washing it down with a Captain Lawrence draft beer. The wheat like taste worked well with the southern comfort food and filling portions.My family ordered duck meatloaf and the bay scallops which they destroyed. Do not hold back on this food as it will be gone before you know it and if you're not careful your plate will be missing items too.I chose the steak prepared medium rare, which I am finding out to be much better than medium. Again, a great steak and the accompanying sides and sauces are a carnivore's delight. I event ordered a course of hush puppies for the table served with a very fatty but tasty dipping sauce just because when I see hush puppies and I'm eating in a southern restaurant, I order them. It's a party foul not too.Saving room for desert, I went with the apple crumb with cream cheese. I don't know why the south is so good at sweets but this was the perfect way to finish a great meal.Overall the service was very quick although the typical busboy bringing out food and putting the wrong plate in front of everyone happened.The menu pretty much leads you to order and so we didn't really ask for any opinion, although the desert special was a recommendation we went with and enjoyed.As we arrived and began eating at 6:30 pm, the place was filled up with couples and families by 7/7:15 and got considerably louder. I recommend arriving early for a big meal and then going elsewhere as there doesn't appear to be much around the area except Prime Meats down the block for a cocktail.Overall, there is no better restaurant in Brooklyn in my opinion and all other restaurants will now be judged by this experience.",5.0
"In light of my roommate's birthday today, we took a lil trip over to buttermilk channel.  We thought we were in for a delicious, cheer-filled, joyous occasion, but instead left our meal feeling like we wanted toss our server, our busboy and the hostess into the buttermilk channel itself.Seriously.  THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  From the phone etiquette inquiring about reservations all the way up until our nonexistent farewell greeting from the server (don't even know her name because she NEVER introduced herself), my roommate's birthday brunch failed miserably.After waiting 35 minutes for our table, the hostess sat us with about as warm and fuzzy aura as your average MTA bus driver.  And then we meet our waitress, and she was just as cheery.  NO, ""Hi my name is blah blah, welcome to Buttermilk Channel, what can I get you today?""  I understand you're angry because your audition for the next Geico commercial didn't pan out like you wanted, but don't take out your failure as an actress on your customers at your ""day job.""  That is just not cool.  Save your aggression/lack of emotion for your pseudo-rock star boyfriend, your therapist or your pet puppy.  I'm not paying 12 bucks so you I can order your so-called AMAZING pecan pie french toast with a side of snoody attitude and asshole tendencies.Needless to say, our food was served at room temperature accompanied with necessary condiments ONLY AFTER i got up to inquire about them, ONE coffee refill after several reminders, NO water refills and I think we may have paid a lil extra for the fake smiles and rolling of the eyes.This delightful service ultimately ended in a wamping 5% tip and a darling love note on their nostalgic looking comment cards that went a lil something like this:  ""worst service ever.  food was cold. no water or coffee refills.  never coming back.  happy saturday:) ""Obviously I won't be returning.  And I don't think you should either.",1.0
"Recently stopped in for lunch after reading the yelp reviews.  The one thing that disappointed was that chicken/waffles is dinner only (for brunch they had pork and waffles which doesnt have the same appeal).  I had the buttermilk pancakes (figuring the name of the place was asking me to order them) and my wife had a scramble with goat cheese.  The pancakes had a nice middle ground in terms of heaviness and were quite tasty (not the best I have ever had---see nicks in providence, but very good).  The scramble was also quite tasty and had some nice sides, the only downside is that it came in small bowl/cup and was a bit too runny.We waited approx 45 min for our table and will definitely be back likely for dinner (chicken and waffles)",4.0
"Brunch review only...If I was basing my review solely on the food it would get a 4 or 5.  I mean, it's actually a pretty good deal that you get a free drink with good food for only $11 or $12.  However, the server woke up on the WRONG side of the bed.  I've been a server before, so I know you have your moods.  But there are some things you just don't say unless you're charming enough to get away with it...  My friend asked, ""Is your orange juice fresh squeezed?""  I knew the answer would be no and expected that simple response.  Instead she said, ""Do you think we'd give away free fresh-squeezed orange juice?""  Not even a chuckly to indicate she was joking.  It was almost as if I was stuck in an awkward sitcom diner scene with the stereotypical ""angry waitress."" Negatives:  I don't know if it was the day or what, but the pixie-haired hostess was equally as surly as our server.  Another negative: We were seated smack-dab in the middle of the extremely narrow restaurant so our elbows were constant targets.  Yet another negative: One bathroom. Positives:  The biscuits are pretty awesome.  Free drink with entree.  All of my positives basically reflect the kitchen.  I have no complaints in that respect.  In closing, I know serving can be a pain.  But I also had a lot of fun.  When a server assumes the worst from the get-go, it's a terrible sign.",3.0
"I really liked the bustling atmosphere of this place. My server was cool....but so was my food. I ordered the short-rib hash and it was luke warm. They also over cooked my poached eggs to the point where they were almost the consistency of a boiled egg. By the time my new eggs arrived, my breakfast was even colder than when I first got it. I had to flag my waitress down to beg her for jam for my toast almost towards the end of the meal. They shouldve asked or provided jam on the table. I was not pleased with my meal. The hash itself is quite tasty if you like cold beef.....My husband had the french toast. Its more like a dessert, but its really good if you like dessert for breakfast. The bacon has a great smoked taste to it. My experience wasnt horrible here, but it was too average for me to go back. I'll just stick to Tom's Diner for hot breakfast/brunch.",2.0
"Typically when I see reviews that seem to be strictly ""I want this restaurant to father my children"" or ""I will burn this shithole to the ground with my own hands, and laugh"" I fall in line with one of the camps and assume the other camp is full of bitter ex-employees/random psychopaths or delusional family members of the owner/people who think wet cardboard is ""pretty tasty :) :) :) luv it guyz lol!!!!""Not so with brunch at Buttermilk Channel.On one hand, I thought the food was pretty damn good. I got something that involved eggs in a cup, toast, and the cutest li'l hashbrown ever, and it was solid. I'm an asshole about eggs (I think I might actually hate eggs, something happens about 5 bites in where I get angry/grossed out/sad) and these eggs didn't upset me. They weren't too wet or too dry. Good job. We got side orders of the pickles  (that even my pickle-skeptical husband liked) and the cheese waffle, and I decided I'd probably punch someone for the cheese waffle. I wouldn't stab anyone for it, it's not THAT amazing, but it's easily good enough for a punch.

I'm not saying I could do it - in fact, my own lack of acting skills is why I worked IN the kitchen when I worked in food service.

"I went to Buttermilk Channel for a Christmas date dinner with my boyfriend. After a brief discussion on whether or not the bartender was more ""lumberjack"" or ""seaman,"" we sat down at a cute two seater near the entrance. The menu was very much ""home cookin'"" and reminded me of the dishes you see at The General Greene. Lots of fried chicken and roasted, oily vegetables. One of the main reasons we chose Buttermilk, besides their reputation, is because they have a vegetarian menu with about 5 or 6 main veggie dishes. The waiter brought us two delightful and fluffy popovers as our bread. We ordered the hush puppies as a ""snack"" and the butternut squash tart as a first course to share."" The hush puppies were crispy and delicious. The tart had interesting flavors. It was sweeter than we expected but still great. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles and I ordered the cheddar waffles with roast brussel sprouts and mushrooms as our entrees. My veggies were very roasted (meaning there is no doubt they were swimming in oil) and my waffles were fair. Considering everything else was so hot and crispy, I found them to be cold and limp. Great beer and wine list as well.  Our bill totaled around $100. Overall, this is not a health food place! Come hungry and be prepared to see lots of fried buttery dishes. Like other Yelpers, I think it may be overrated considering that my dining partner and I felt like the menu was very familiar. For me, the snacks and veggie first courses seemed to be more interested than the entrees. I would go back.",4.0
"Went there for a new year brunch, and it was super crowded.  We ended up taking seats at the bar.  My husband had pancake but I had lobster hash with eggs and toast.  Both of us were very happy with our mimosa and our food.  We will go back for sure!",4.0
"Good food, friendly waitstaff, fast service without you feeling rushed.  Tasted the beef hash.  Had the Eggs Benedict on a biscuit with Benton ham.  Very tasty and lite.  Whatever I tasted had flavor as it was clear that an effort was made to make the food taste good.  The pancakes were incredible!  Plan to try the pecan pie french toast next.  Will be going again.",4.0
I went here because everyone seems to be talking about it. Dont get me wrong its a great brunch restaurant but I was let down by the pecan pie french toast. Everyone says its great and I coundnt wait to try it but it was cold and totally not what I expected. The rest of the food was really nice though. Make sure to try to buttermilk biscuits. Good service but nothing out of this world in my opinion. The wait for sunday brunch was 2 hours which wasnt really cool either.,3.0
"""Oh. My. Gawwwwwd"" as Joey Styles, the wrestling announcer legend would say.By far the best restaurant I have been to in Brooklyn is now Buttermilk Channel. The reviews do not lie and even Sam Sifton of the New York Times notes that Buttermilk Channel is a destination point for those venturing from Manhattan.Literally, as other reviewers noted, everything on the menu is good. Breaded oysters were prepared perfectly and had the right amount of flavor and that natural, oyster taste that can be killed sometimes when restaurants overbread them.I went with the chicken liver, an acquired taste but served on toast and with grapes, it was a filling portion that you have to try. The liver was smooth and spread easily so it was almost more of a butter. I recommend washing it down with a Captain Lawrence draft beer. The wheat like taste worked well with the southern comfort food and filling portions.My family ordered duck meatloaf and the bay scallops which they destroyed. Do not hold back on this food as it will be gone before you know it and if you're not careful your plate will be missing items too.I chose the steak prepared medium rare, which I am finding out to be much better than medium. Again, a great steak and the accompanying sides and sauces are a carnivore's delight. I event ordered a course of hush puppies for the table served with a very fatty but tasty dipping sauce just because when I see hush puppies and I'm eating in a southern restaurant, I order them. It's a party foul not too.Saving room for desert, I went with the apple crumb with cream cheese. I don't know why the south is so good at sweets but this was the perfect way to finish a great meal.Overall the service was very quick although the typical busboy bringing out food and putting the wrong plate in front of everyone happened.The menu pretty much leads you to order and so we didn't really ask for any opinion, although the desert special was a recommendation we went with and enjoyed.As we arrived and began eating at 6:30 pm, the place was filled up with couples and families by 7/7:15 and got considerably louder. I recommend arriving early for a big meal and then going elsewhere as there doesn't appear to be much around the area except Prime Meats down the block for a cocktail.Overall, there is no better restaurant in Brooklyn in my opinion and all other restaurants will now be judged by this experience.",5.0
"In light of my roommate's birthday today, we took a lil trip over to buttermilk channel.  We thought we were in for a delicious, cheer-filled, joyous occasion, but instead left our meal feeling like we wanted toss our server, our busboy and the hostess into the buttermilk channel itself.Seriously.  THE WORST SERVICE EVER.  From the phone etiquette inquiring about reservations all the way up until our nonexistent farewell greeting from the server (don't even know her name because she NEVER introduced herself), my roommate's birthday brunch failed miserably.After waiting 35 minutes for our table, the hostess sat us with about as warm and fuzzy aura as your average MTA bus driver.  And then we meet our waitress, and she was just as cheery.  NO, ""Hi my name is blah blah, welcome to Buttermilk Channel, what can I get you today?""  I understand you're angry because your audition for the next Geico commercial didn't pan out like you wanted, but don't take out your failure as an actress on your customers at your ""day job.""  That is just not cool.  Save your aggression/lack of emotion for your pseudo-rock star boyfriend, your therapist or your pet puppy.  I'm not paying 12 bucks so you I can order your so-called AMAZING pecan pie french toast with a side of snoody attitude and asshole tendencies.Needless to say, our food was served at room temperature accompanied with necessary condiments ONLY AFTER i got up to inquire about them, ONE coffee refill after several reminders, NO water refills and I think we may have paid a lil extra for the fake smiles and rolling of the eyes.This delightful service ultimately ended in a wamping 5% tip and a darling love note on their nostalgic looking comment cards that went a lil something like this:  ""worst service ever.  food was cold. no water or coffee refills.  never coming back.  happy saturday:) ""Obviously I won't be returning.  And I don't think you should either.",1.0
"Recently stopped in for lunch after reading the yelp reviews.  The one thing that disappointed was that chicken/waffles is dinner only (for brunch they had pork and waffles which doesnt have the same appeal).  I had the buttermilk pancakes (figuring the name of the place was asking me to order them) and my wife had a scramble with goat cheese.  The pancakes had a nice middle ground in terms of heaviness and were quite tasty (not the best I have ever had---see nicks in providence, but very good).  The scramble was also quite tasty and had some nice sides, the only downside is that it came in small bowl/cup and was a bit too runny.We waited approx 45 min for our table and will definitely be back likely for dinner (chicken and waffles)",4.0
"Brunch review only...If I was basing my review solely on the food it would get a 4 or 5.  I mean, it's actually a pretty good deal that you get a free drink with good food for only $11 or $12.  However, the server woke up on the WRONG side of the bed.  I've been a server before, so I know you have your moods.  But there are some things you just don't say unless you're charming enough to get away with it...  My friend asked, ""Is your orange juice fresh squeezed?""  I knew the answer would be no and expected that simple response.  Instead she said, ""Do you think we'd give away free fresh-squeezed orange juice?""  Not even a chuckly to indicate she was joking.  It was almost as if I was stuck in an awkward sitcom diner scene with the stereotypical ""angry waitress."" Negatives:  I don't know if it was the day or what, but the pixie-haired hostess was equally as surly as our server.  Another negative: We were seated smack-dab in the middle of the extremely narrow restaurant so our elbows were constant targets.  Yet another negative: One bathroom. Positives:  The biscuits are pretty awesome.  Free drink with entree.  All of my positives basically reflect the kitchen.  I have no complaints in that respect.  In closing, I know serving can be a pain.  But I also had a lot of fun.  When a server assumes the worst from the get-go, it's a terrible sign.",3.0
"I really liked the bustling atmosphere of this place. My server was cool....but so was my food. I ordered the short-rib hash and it was luke warm. They also over cooked my poached eggs to the point where they were almost the consistency of a boiled egg. By the time my new eggs arrived, my breakfast was even colder than when I first got it. I had to flag my waitress down to beg her for jam for my toast almost towards the end of the meal. They shouldve asked or provided jam on the table. I was not pleased with my meal. The hash itself is quite tasty if you like cold beef.....My husband had the french toast. Its more like a dessert, but its really good if you like dessert for breakfast. The bacon has a great smoked taste to it. My experience wasnt horrible here, but it was too average for me to go back. I'll just stick to Tom's Diner for hot breakfast/brunch.",2.0
"Typically when I see reviews that seem to be strictly ""I want this restaurant to father my children"" or ""I will burn this shithole to the ground with my own hands, and laugh"" I fall in line with one of the camps and assume the other camp is full of bitter ex-employees/random psychopaths or delusional family members of the owner/people who think wet cardboard is ""pretty tasty :) :) :) luv it guyz lol!!!!""Not so with brunch at Buttermilk Channel.On one hand, I thought the food was pretty damn good.

Chicken & Waffles: he loved it and said it was worth the wait. Waffles w/ asparagus: these cheddar waffles are soooo good. Sooo worth the wait. The asparagus was grilled and had a nice smoke flavor, perfectly cooked so it was tender but not chewy. The mustard sauce was fresh but had a bit too much horseradish taste than I like. The cabbage slaw that came on the side was a perfect accompaniment. Normally coleslaw is drenched in mayo. This was light, though a bit too heavy with the red onions, and very fresh. For dessert he had the strawberry rhubarb tart and I had the chocolate caramel tart. My tart was delicious, salty and sweet. His hot fresh strawberry rhubarb tart was off the friggin hook.

"Oh, Buttermilk Channel. I had heard stories. Good ones! People say good things about you. Really. But I had no idea. They were being pretty modest, I think. You, my friend, are swell. Charming. Epic, even.***I arrived around 9:30 (after the bulk of the dinner rush, I imagine). Right off, the room is beautiful. They manage to get a fair number of tables in without it seeming uncomfortably packed, and have a number of seats at the bar, which still feels pretty roomy. The service: The very kind hostess offered me a table, but I opted for the bar. Good thing, too. Buttermilk Channel reaffirms every thing I love about Sitting at Bars in Great Places, and then some. The barstaff is welcoming, friendly, cool, and super-knowledgable. They made great menu and wine pairing suggestions. They were fun and funny and concerned about the experience of their clientele in a way I found really cool, and greatly appreciated. I love food, but I care about the quality of the restaurant experience itself at least as much. It was entirely great at Buttermilk Channel. The food: Soup was vegan squash amazingness w/olive oil and rosemary crostini in, pasta was made fresh in the nabe and full of Delicious Things (two kinds of mushrooms, fennel, and amazing pecorino), and dessert was a pecan pie sundae.

"Buttermilk Channel was a lovely, solid restaurant to take my boyfriend for his birthday dinner.Tuesday night is free corkage, so we brought a nice bottle of Grenache and they opened it and poured it immediately so it could breathe a bit. Service was friendly and appropriately timed. The only thing that was a little weird was a food-allergy issue. I told the waitress I'd heard great things about the popovers they bring instead of a bread basket, but that I had a dairy allergy so could she please check whether I could eat them? She did, and they did contain dairy. She then brought two popovers (one for each of us?) and put it in the middle of the table (for us to share?) although I'm allergic to them. It's not a big deal, but the small gestures sort of make a big difference- some dairy-free bread would have been nice!The menu isn't particularly friendly to someone with a dairy allergy, but we managed to eat really well.We started with some tasty snacks: Brooklyn Pickles, as well as MAPLE-BACON ROASTED ALMONDS. Get. These. They are SO GOOD. You get a LOT here, like probably enough for four people. We took half of them home. The almonds are sort of akin to the Nuts for Nuts guys on the street (those sugary delights that smell like Christmas) but with a salty-maple thing going on. And crusted right in there were very hefty chunks of thick-cut bacon (house cured, I believe). If you like salty-sweet-fatty (aka, if you're a person with taste buds and a conscience), you'll love these.I got the warm lamb and romaine salad. They were nice about substituting the dressing for one that did not contain dairy. Each component of this salad was delicious, but it wasn't the most cohesive dish I could imagine. That being said, the lamb was plentiful, succulent, and melted in my mouth. The kalamata olive bread croutons were nice, although seemed a little stale (I think they were just poorly toasted, or grilled, or whatever. I think they should have either left them fresh or really gone all out and pan-grilled them in olive oil!) The roasted cauliflower and fried capers were lovely, and the soft-boiled egg was a great finish. The romaine was fresh and crunchy, despite being among these warm components.  When I say the dish wasn't cohesive, it wasn't as though pairs of ingredients didn't seem to go together, it just wasn't executed quite as well as I would have hoped from Buttermilk Channel, given all the rave reviews. That being said, I did eat the salad with a different dressing than the chef normally uses, and this salad is by no means one of their famous dishes (compared to the fried chicken, the duck meatloaf, or the pecan pie sundae for example). I loved eating it, and I would even recommend that you order it if you like lamb! My boyfriend got the market salad (nectarines, radishes, mixed greens) to start, and then the duck meatloaf. His salad was particularly non-cohesive. The nectarines were completely unripe, and the lime dressing didn't do much for the salad. We both agreed that the mixed greens seemed busy, and that sticking to plain baby arugula or spinach might have made more sense. The duck meatloaf, however, was OUT OF THIS WORLD awesome. Please, please order this. It's succulent and rich, on a delicious fresh corn pudding (I didn't try the pudding but my boyfriend alleges it was wonderful). On top of the meatloaf (which incidentally looks rather small but ends up being an incredibly hearty portion) is a GIANT wonderful crispy onion ring. Each component of the dish stands on its own and melts into perfect harmony with the rest of it. I can't recommend it any more strongly!We lingered after the meal over our bottle of wine, and we were so pleased by the relatively small pricetag on the bill- definitely owing to the fact that it was free corkage night and we didn't have to pay for drinks$s$s. We were rather disappointed that Beyonce didn't make an appearance, since she and my boyfriend share a birthday we thought maybe Jay Z would take her there like he did for New Years Eve. Oh well, as my coworker put it: ""Beyonce never eats at the same place twice"".",4.0
"Nowadays you just can't get a discount for dining in Brooklyn anymore.  I mean it's not because the quality is any less but it's just that, I mean c'mon, it's a bit far from the mainland.  Throw me a friggin' bone here!  But despite the Manhattan-like prices, this place is a keeper fa'sho.Now the wait's gonna be a little lengthy, especially because this place is a hotspot, especially in the summer.  Freaking 100+ degrees!  For crying out loud.  I guess if you could bear the heat, you can be seated more quickly perspiring outside, but I ain't doin' that!  Honestly, the inside isn't much better but I sweat really easily so maybe this assessment is a bit physiologically biased.  Alas, the beers on tap ($7) is great and micro-brewed in NY and the food, wowie wowow, the food!The gF had the staple Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($18) and I had the Duck Meatloaf ($20) and yes, o yesh!, both were delightful.  The chicken came with waffles and cole slaw (light mayo, perfect!) which were awesome!  The meatloaf came with creamy parsnips, a huge onion ring, and a duck jus and you know how much I love my duck jus!  I don't recall the creamy parsnips.  What's a parsnip?  What's a parsnip you ask?  Rather I asked but what the hey.  parsnip |pärsnip|noun1 a long tapering cream-colored root with a sweet flavor.Yeah, I don't remember that at all.  But what I do remember is saying that I'd like to bring my friends here.  At least 5ive because that's the minimum to make a reservation.  Now, about that G line.",4.0

The chicken and waffles were lovely, the burger and fries fantastic but the brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes held their own too.

The romaine was fresh and crunchy, despite being among these warm components.  When I say the dish wasn't cohesive, it wasn't as though pairs of ingredients didn't seem to go together, it just wasn't executed quite as well as I would have hoped from Buttermilk Channel, given all the rave reviews. That being said, I did eat the salad with a different dressing than the chef normally uses, and this salad is by no means one of their famous dishes (compared to the fried chicken, the duck meatloaf, or the pecan pie sundae for example). I loved eating it, and I would even recommend that you order it if you like lamb! My boyfriend got the market salad (nectarines, radishes, mixed greens) to start, and then the duck meatloaf. His salad was particularly non-cohesive. The nectarines were completely unripe, and the lime dressing didn't do much for the salad. We both agreed that the mixed greens seemed busy, and that sticking to plain baby arugula or spinach might have made more sense. The duck meatloaf, however, was OUT OF THIS WORLD awesome. Please, please order this. It's succulent and rich, on a delicious fresh corn pudding (I didn't try the pudding but my boyfriend alleges it was wonderful). On top of the meatloaf (which incidentally looks rather small but ends up being an incredibly hearty portion) is a GIANT wonderful crispy onion ring. Each component of the dish stands on its own and melts into perfect harmony with the rest of it. I can't recommend it any more strongly!We lingered after the meal over our bottle of wine, and we were so pleased by the relatively small pricetag on the bill- definitely owing to the fact that it was free corkage night and we didn't have to pay for drinks$s$s. We were rather disappointed that Beyonce didn't make an appearance, since she and my boyfriend share a birthday we thought maybe Jay Z would take her there like he did for New Years Eve. Oh well, as my coworker put it: ""Beyonce never eats at the same place twice"".",4.0
"Nowadays you just can't get a discount for dining in Brooklyn anymore.  I mean it's not because the quality is any less but it's just that, I mean c'mon, it's a bit far from the mainland.  Throw me a friggin' bone here!  But despite the Manhattan-like prices, this place is a keeper fa'sho.Now the wait's gonna be a little lengthy, especially because this place is a hotspot, especially in the summer.  Freaking 100+ degrees!  For crying out loud.  I guess if you could bear the heat, you can be seated more quickly perspiring outside, but I ain't doin' that!  Honestly, the inside isn't much better but I sweat really easily so maybe this assessment is a bit physiologically biased.  Alas, the beers on tap ($7) is great and micro-brewed in NY and the food, wowie wowow, the food!The gF had the staple Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($18) and I had the Duck Meatloaf ($20) and yes, o yesh!, both were delightful.  The chicken came with waffles and cole slaw (light mayo, perfect!) which were awesome!  The meatloaf came with creamy parsnips, a huge onion ring, and a duck jus and you know how much I love my duck jus!  I don't recall the creamy parsnips.  What's a parsnip?  What's a parsnip you ask?  Rather I asked but what the hey.  parsnip |pärsnip|noun1 a long tapering cream-colored root with a sweet flavor.Yeah, I don't remember that at all.  But what I do remember is saying that I'd like to bring my friends here.  At least 5ive because that's the minimum to make a reservation.  Now, about that G line.",4.0

"LOVED this place. The ambiance, the staff, the location, the beers, the food- all amazing. Came with a group of three and we shared the fried chicken with cheddar waffles, the burger, fries, the brussel sprouts, the mashed potatoes and had the ribs to start. I cannot say enough good things about this food! Purely ridiculous. The ribs are as good as any I've eaten at the Intl. Sparks Rib Cook-off. They were meaty, tender and perfectly seasoned with no discernible fat- better even than the Smoke Joint and Smoke Joint is great. The chicken and waffles were lovely, the burger and fries fantastic but the brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes held their own too. Wow!We finished by sharing a slice of some chocolate, salted peanut, caramel torte which was pretty good too, but a bit dry. I would try it again though.We went at 6:30 on a Wednesday and didn't have to wait for a table but a good crowd came in shortly thereafter- interestingly there were a lot of families with children.The place has a classic farm house turned chic interior and reminded me a lot of places in SE Portland (Oregon). Very cosy. Can't wait to go back!",5.0
"""Oh God,"" said my fiancé as the sauvingnon blanc he had just knocked over spread across my lap in a chilly puddle of shame. ""What if this had been our first date?""But it wasn't our first date. It was our gazillionth date. He could have knocked over ten glasses of wine. He could have set his sleeve on fire. He could have friggin' climbed up on the table like King Kong and start swatting tiny airplanes out of the sky; it wasn't going to distract me from trying to remember whether or not I had unplugged my hair iron before we left home. That's monogamy, everybody. Of course, the amazing Buttermilk Channel staff does not share my general listlessness and they snapped into action the second that wine hit my lap. I looked up to ask someone for a towel, but towels were already there. That wine was mopped up, cleaned up, and replaced in five seconds flat. I felt like Cinderella in that scene where the birds help her get dressed, if Cinderella had been covered with wine and wearing a pink sports bra under her dress.Those little details matter, you know? When that wine spilled, the staff handled it. When I couldn't decide between two appetizers, our waitress gracefully pointed out which one would pair better with our entree. And although I didn't visit the kitchen, it was clear from the food they kept sending out that they had paid some damn good attention to the details back there too. It was a Sunday, so we decided to order the special of the night: roasted chicken with kale and bread stuffing, a poached egg, and sage jus. We also ordered a little cup of their homemade pickles (because I am currently going through a pickle phase), a Westlake Cocktail (because I'm also going through a bourbon phase), and a squash tart with ricotta cheese and brown butter (because brown butter isn't so much a ""phase"" as it is a ""lifestyle"").I started with my cocktail, which had bourbon, elderflower liqueur, orange bitters, and a gloriously fragrant little slice of orange zest. I loved it, although it made me feel old to realize that five years ago I would have preferred to drink whiskey and sprite with maraschino cherries from a sugar-rimmed plastic cup. Sigh. Anyway.All of the food was so consistently delicious that I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite. I would order everything again in a heartbeat. For dessert, we shared the much-lauded pecan pie sundae and the coconut pot de creme. I don't usually like pecan pie, but that sundae was amazing and easily outshone the more mild-flavored pot de creme. Our entire meal, including one cocktail, one beer, one ill-fated glass of wine (which was replaced for free), a cappuccino, and a much-deserved 20 percent tip for the waitress, totaled only at about $100, which struck me as exceptionally good value.  I'll sum it up like this. Among the things my fiancé doesn't really like are: 1. spending $100 on a meal, 2. going to Brooklyn (I know, he's a heathen), and 3. knocking over drinks in public places. And yet, as we left, he casually said, ""I'd come back here.""That's a huge endorsement, folks.",5.0
"I could probably eat an entire meal of their homemade pickles, but I'll never really know because I also can't resist their fried chicken and cheddar waffles.

They'll take your phone number and give you a call when your table is ready, so we always head down the street to Abilene for drinks while we wait. I kind of look forward to that part of going to Buttermilk as much as I do to eating there. Something about the no rush ritual.

"Just tried it last night, heard great things, completely underwhelmed. The food is a kind of Americana or 'down-home' style cooking; locally sourced, organic, farmers market, yada ya ya. The wine list is actually very interesting, all American wines, some interesting choices. Only two reds and two white under 40 dollars (and just barely), most ranging around 45+. Shame.I knew we were in trouble though when I ordered a 2005 Barbera, Uvaggio from Lodi, Ca and they brought out a 2008 Barbera from Santa Barbera and didn't mention anything about a substitution. I don't remember being presented the bottle before the taste (I am not saying it didn't happen), but after the waitress poured our first glass I noticed the mistake and sought to inquire. The waitress hadn't even noticed and she did not know what was going on, she swore up and down that it was the only Barbera they had. The manager came over and told us the list was out of date. 'Sorry', but he had 'just tasted it last night' and swore to us 'it was excellent'. Thanks for trying to convince me that the wine I did not order was up to par. The wine was fine, but come now, a big difference between 2005 and 2008 and two completely different vineyards.The menu was a standard new American bistro. Split into apps, first and mains; ie; Lamb with fried capers, buttermilk fried chicken, duck meatloaf (?), Roast chicken for two(yawn)... Nothing special, the main courses were so underwhelming that I ordered two first courses instead.When you sit down they give you a few pop-overs for a starter bread, drizzled with clover honey and chunky sea salt. The pop-overs were a tad dry and not quiet as richly-eggy as I've had, but it was a fun and tasty way to start.We ordered; Hush Puppies with green chili aioli, foie grois/pork head terrine, watermelon arugula salad, chili-rubbed ribs and scallops with rhubarb and fennel.Hush-puppies were good, cooked perfectly and well spiced. The sauce was not spicy at all, (if there is chili in here it must be the secret part of the sauce.) The presentation was a joke. Four (yes four) small hush puppies the size of large marbles stacked in a tiny glass cup with mayo (oops aioli) on the bottom. So to dip the hush-puppies in the sauce you had to remove the top ones and set them on your plate and then eat the bottom ones first and then dip the aforementioned top ones in the sauce. Ridiculous. Not to mention they cost $5 dollars per order. 1.25 per tiny (and I mean tiny) hush puppy? Please...Terrine next, which was also very tasty. Came with pickled onion and shredded cabbage and standard crunchy toasted bread, all drizzled with a little too much balsamic reduction. Again the portion for cost was ridiculous, this shouldn't be Jean Georges haute causine, not if your fronting down-home cooking, certainly not at these prices. Perhaps they were rationing for labor day?Arugula salad was mediocre, skimped on the water melon and way way too much lime (and I fucking love lime, really). Baby-back ribs were tough, seasoning was nice, but had no guts, no punch. The perfect dish for someone who doesn't like spice or is a giant pussy. Have had awesome versions of both dishes at Fatty Crab, run their and have both.Scallops were quite good, perfectly cooked. Fennel and Rhubarb salad was very very tasty.Decore was about the same as the food uninspired. Trying to be down-home and straight forward, but coming off as boring. If your gonna try for soul, have some. This place is perfect for Brooklyn yuppies. Actually reminds alot of something like Sarabeth's on the upper west side, which is not a complement.Bill came to 100+ dollars before tip.

The brunch is fairly priced, but dinner can quickly get expensive. The menu is pretty small, and has a gourmet, soul-food flare (they're known for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken).  All the entrees seem delicious, so I would recommend sharing if you can.

Great food and relaxing atmosphere. Went for brunch and had an amazing pork chop and cheese waffles. The bacon and almond appetizer excellent. I want to try the fried chicken which I hear is the best thing on the menu.,4.0
"Milkman, Milkman, where have you been? In Buttermilk Channel, up to my chin.I split my milk and I sploit my clothesAnd I got a long icicle hung from my nose.Came here with my parents the night of the BK Blizzard of '09 as I'll be calling it when I'm old - when we got there we were in snow up to our chins and just about had icicles hanging from our noses. Luckily, they had tasty cocktails and sweet potato croquettes to warm our little hands and hearts. Once we thawed, we had a great dinner at the bar, watching the snow fall through the steamed up windows. Fabulous.",5.0
"OMG.........  This is a place that you HAVE TO go to in Brooklyn.  I came here on a weeknight after work with a friend and immediately we fell in love with the place.  There was jazz music on, it was dimly lit, and it was warm and inviting (definitely a great place to bring a date).Now onto the food - For appetizers, we had the foie gras and country ham terrine which was simply delicious and such a wonderful way to start the meal.  You will NOT be disappointed with this appetizer.  My friend had the warm lamb and romaine salad - which is THE BEST SALAD I've ever had.  It was flavorful and the lamb was plentiful (making your $16 well worth it)!  I had the duck meatloaf which was simply heavenly.  The meat wasn't dry at all and with the combination of the huckleberry duck jus, it was just the right touch to make this dish so delightful.  My friend and I cannot wait to bring our significant others here!",4.0
"This place is great- cozy but unpretentious, and serves amazing comfort food. I rarely order vegetarian items when eating out, but decided to get the delicata squash tart, which turned out to be one of the most memorable appetizers I have had in a really long time. The hush puppies were also really good. We also ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and the duck meatloaf. The fried chicken was delicious, and the duck meatloaf was even better- super moist and flavorful. I didn't think it could get any better- then I tasted the pecan pie sundae, which I definitely recommend getting.The menu is seasonal, and I can't wait to go back again to try the summer menu.",5.0
"Holy mother of Jesus. I experienced the light without even needing a free stress test at the Union Square Subway Stop. Such a good f'ing meal, it's unbelievable. Get thee to Buttermilk Channel on a Friday night before 7 (that's when the lines get insane) and order the special--lobster. But this ain't no special lobster, no. This lobster is stuffed with Thanksgiving-like stuffing, complete with herbs, carrots, and celery. This may actually be my death row meal Servers here are very nice and the wine list is pretty exceptional. Get thee to Buttermilk Channel stat.",5.0
"I'm biased, because this is where my boyfriend surprised me for Valentine's Day, but Buttermilk Channel is definitely worth a trip.I've been here on three separate occasions (twice for dinner, once for brunch), and the food has never failed to disappoint. They manage to make the standard brunch combination of eggs, veggies, ham and cheese a unique experience -- and that deserves some praise. The brunch is fairly priced, but dinner can quickly get expensive. The menu is pretty small, and has a gourmet, soul-food flare (they're known for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken).  All the entrees seem delicious, so I would recommend sharing if you can. Despite how full you might be at the end, you must order their Pecan Pie Sundae....two classic desserts combined into one giant glass of heaven.Overall: delicious & pricey -- a great spot if you want to do something a little more upscale",4.0
"You can't judge a restaurant by its website - but in the case of Buttermilk Channel, you totally can!Incredibly well designed website with adorable illustrations translated into a delicious brunch.I ordered the pecan pie french toast soaked in burbon and molasses and topped with candied pecans. Best french toast I've ever had. (5)My friend had the ABC grilled cheese, apples, bacon and cheddar.  Delightful combination but the bread was a little bit too hard and the cheese not melted enough. The side salad that accompanied it was amazing though, a simple vinagrette done incredibly well. (3)Decor and ambience was on point.  A clean and modern appearance with cute vintage touches ala the collection of old soda spritzer bottles hanging out on the bar. (5)Great attention to detail from beginning to end. Even the comment card was well put together.Brunch also comes with a free drink, always a plus",4.0
"Agreed that this is a great place for brunch if you have a reservation. quick and dirty: pancakes, pork chop, otis bloody mary, cheese waffles - everything else you can skip, the hash overly salty, lox and eggs plates you can ge anywhere else. Service was spotty and food came slow - very slow.Pros: Pork Chop- getting out of the cityCons: Train service to brooklyn, slow service and the hype.",4.0
"Not understanding why there are so many good reviews.  Was excited to try this place since it is in the neighborhood but one word describes the whole experience: underwhelming. Our waitress had a cooler-than-thou demeanor and ignored us for the entire meal. One water refill and that was when we got the check (which we had to get from the busboy). Seriously, when you charge $18-25 per entree, you should have good service. The food was bland. I got the chicken/waffles, which was too overcooked. Husband got a Portuguese style stew that seriously had no complex flavor and was room temperature. Go to Pies and Thighs if you want good chicken. Try Prime Meats nearby and save yourself the money.",1.0

"One of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn, Buttermilk Channel has consistently good food and enough variety to keep coming back. One of the most amazing things about this restaurant is how perfectly they cook their meat; the fried chicken (a signature dish) is always perfectly cooked and juicy, unlike any other chicken I've had. The ribs were amazingly tender without being mushy, and the burger I had (medium rare) was expertly done. I don't usually rave about burgers, but I have to say the burger at Buttermilk Channel is really well balanced and lets the quality and taste of the beef really shine. The service is also very good at Buttermilk; the wait staff is both knowledgeable and friendly, and very accommodating. On a recent visit I had a bit of a problem with the way one of my dishes was done and the waiter, kitchen and manager (owner?) were apologetic and quick to remedy it. No matter how good the food is, bad service can kill a restaurant and the owners of Buttermilk seem to understand that.My only complaint with the restaurant is that they don't take reservations, which means it's pretty typical to wait for 45 mins to an hour and a half if you're dining during prime time. And prime time starts pretty early as families in the area (with kids in tow) fill the restaurant by 6:30 or 7:00pm. The bar at Buttermilk is usually overcrowded, so it's worth going elsewhere for a drink before dinner, and thankfully the hostess will call your cellphone to bring you back when a table opens.All in all, Buttermilk Channel is not just a great neighborhood restaurant but a Brooklyn-class restaurant worth a trip.",5.0
"It might be their special $25 three-course prix-fixe menu (which is a great deal) or it just might be that this place is part of the latest craze of Southern comfort food in a classy American bistro setting. Regardless, the restaurant was packed on a Monday night.  We were quoted a 30 minute wait but were sat much sooner.We were treated to complimentary popovers and enjoyed a snack of sweet potato croquettes.  It felt like we were at somebody's grandmother's house.  Maybe that's what they were going for, but who's grandmother?  Mine never cooked fried chicken and duck meatloaf.  But I sort of wished she had.The service was good and the atmosphere comfortable, but the food was slightly disappointing.  The buttermilk chicken and cheddar waffles were very heavy (they were so dredged in batter that I couldn't even tell it was chicken) and rather cold by the time I got it.  The best part to the dish was the light and sweet maple balsamic.  I wish this place was called Maple Balsamic Channel.  It doesn't have the same ring to it, though.The apple and turnip soup was rather bland.  And the kale salad had difficult textures and strange temperature contradictions.  Nothing here was bad, but it was all rather underwhelming.  It's a cute place and I'll probably give it another chance, but it's not worth crossing any channels to get to.-eatthisny",3.0
The food and service here is ok. Its has a great atmosphere for a nicer meal with friends or a more intimate dinner with a date but the food was somehow lacking.The hush puppies were bland and almost burnt and the buttermilk fried chicken and waffle wasn't seasoned well. The Waffle was supposed to be a cheddar waffle but it was covered in powder sugar and came out more sweet than savory. I would go back to give it a second chance but I wasn't too impressed.,2.0
We were trying to get in various spots last saturday night and managed to grab a table in Buttermilk channel. The food was full of flavor and the service was excellent. Very attentive and on point. I had the special which was ribeye. I'm usually not one for a steak if its not in a steakhouse but this was as good as any i've had. Full of flavor and cooked rare to perfection. Really enjoyed the place and would highly recommend.  Next time the fried chicken will be mine !,5.0

One of the dinners, one of a bittersweet reunion nature after moving away from so many of my lovelies, actually ranks as one of my top 5 dinner experiences EVER. And though the good company was certainly part of it, Buttermilk Channel really made the night so special.The smoked savory nuts, the local produce and meat, the pumpkin beer, the clear dedication to the community...The whole restaurant just reeks of a sweet thoughtfulness and respect for both their patrons and the food they serve them.

"So here I am at my desk in beautiful California on a Tuesday afternoon...when I catch myself in a Buttermilk Channel daydream. I feel compelled to write an update.I have eaten at Buttermilk Channel since my first birthday dinner there (when I wrote my review for it). And it just gets better and better, service and food wise. One of the dinners, one of a bittersweet reunion nature after moving away from so many of my lovelies, actually ranks as one of my top 5 dinner experiences EVER. And though the good company was certainly part of it, Buttermilk Channel really made the night so special.The smoked savory nuts, the local produce and meat, the pumpkin beer, the clear dedication to the community...The whole restaurant just reeks of a sweet thoughtfulness and respect for both their patrons and the food they serve them. Buttermilk Channel is deserving of so much praise. So much.",5.0

"There are very few places (less than I could count on one hand) that I would consider for my last meal on earth.  Buttermilk Channel easily makes that list and if I was a betting man (which I'm not - most of the time) I would put a good deal of my ante into BC as a win.  The menu is nothing short of brilliant and the preparation reflects an obsessive attention to detail in the most delicious way.  Cocktails and tap beer selections are always choice, local and pair perfectly with a range of delights on the mouth-watering menu.  If you like oysters, you must try whatever the chef chooses for the night you're there.  On our last go-round, the bluepoints were among the finest bi-valves I have ever had the pleasure of knowing on a deeply, deeply intimate level.  Thank you, BC.  Keep up the impeccable, mouth-watering work.",5.0
"Came here on two separate days; once for brunch and the other for dinner. I've give the brunch 4 stars and the dinner 3 stars.The fried chicken was ok. I mean, the skin was great; it was very crunchy and thick. But I'm someone who prefers Popeye's chicken, spicy and juicy!Menu options for brunch was appealing because they were unique. I recommend the short rib hash which comes with two eggs and 2 small, delicious, perhaps home made, hash browns containing scallions, I think. Brunch prices range about $12-15 and comes with a choice of sparkling wine, bellini, mimosa, and 1 other choice that I don't remember (probably bloody mary).If you are craving for something very sweet, get the Pecan Pie French Toast.

"My boyfriend and I ate here for lunch on a Sunday morning, and unfortunately, we left disappointed and bitter. It took the staff over an hour to bring us our food. Literally, we watched a table of six and two tables of two get seated, served, eat and pay before our food came out to us.It was obvious that they either forgot our order or served it to another table (there are only 10 things on the menu, so everyone is basically ordering the same thing), but even after inquiring where our meal was the waitress offered no explanation, apology or sympathy. Most venues have the decency to admit their mistake and/or compensate you for your inconvenience, but this restaurant offered neither.We ordered the pecan french toast, the mushroom and goat cheese scrambled eggs and the lamb romaine salad. The pecan french toast was tasty, but the amount they serve is two thin but tall pieces of texas toast that amount to the size of one slice of bread - definitely not even a breakfast for one. The eggs were okay, but underwhelming. The lamb ""salad"" is a few pieces of lamb and cauliflower laid on top of two pieces of romaine lettuce. Um, NOT A SALAD. It was very delicious, but again, not enough food.The flavorful food does not compensate for the tiny portions and the horrible service. I was so excited to try this restaurant :(",2.0

"I had attempted to have brunch here on my birthday, but it was a gorgeous day and we were told there was an hour and a half wait. As much as I love standing around doing nothing on my birthday, we decided to come back another time. (And went to Cafe Luluc, always good.)Sunday morning, while Brooklyn is digging itself out of a snowstorm (20 inches! 40 inches!! I think we got about 10?) around 10:30, we arrive to no wait. Because we're brilliant. Who wants to go out in a snowstorm, early in the morning? (Plenty of people, apparently - there was a wait by the time we left.) Anyway, we were seated immediately, at a cozy table in the back, and got to poring over the menu.  I ordered chamomile tea, as I was suffering from a wicked sore throat - I really enjoyed that it wasn't some tear out of a package bag of tea, but rather put together in house. It was a nice touch.On to the food!  It arrived quickly, and was most delicious. I had the short rib hash, but also tried the pancakes, and Eggs Huntington.  All were delicious. My hash was perfectly flavored, and the inclusion of carrots and potatoes made me wary when I saw it, but they fit perfectly with the texture of the hash - and the sunnyside up eggs and toast were the perfect additions to complete the meal. Shout outs must go to their biscuits, they were light and fluffy and went great with everything.  It was quite possibly, the best brunch I've had in the area.  I want to go back, again, and again.  And for dinner. And for brunch again. You get the picture.",5.0
"Yet another restaurant that is not only overly hyped, but is also offering terrible service. We've been here twice. The first time, we cam here for brunch, and we were seated immediately at the bar. The bartender served us, and he was very nice. The brunch, I admit was delicious, and exceeded my expectations. I had the eggs florentine sandwich. Normally, I'm weirded out by soggy spinach, but this was perfect. It was seasoned nicely and had delicious sauce, and fantastic flavor. We really wanted to come back and try dinner though. One night, my husband, daughter and I decided to see if we could get a table (there's always a 45 minute wait). We were able to score a small table outside within a few minutes. We were excited about this. Our server (the stereotypical hipster), started out nice. He seemed attentive for the first few minutes. He initially check to see if we were ready to order, and when we said we needed more time, he didn't come back for at least 10 minutes. I ordered what sounded like a decent pasta dish, my daughter got a kids dish, and my husband decided to try their famous fried chicken and cheddar waffle dish. I was really looking forward to this. Our food took almost 40 minutes to arrive, and in that time, our waiter decided not to show his face. He kept checking on the table next to us, but wouldn't check on us at all. We kept waiting for him to look our way, but he never did. When our food finally came, it was just not good at all. My pasta sucked. It wasn't flavorful at all. I was so disappointed. My husband asked if I wanted to taste the chicken, and it too was just not good. We both agreed that not only have we had better, but that this shouldn't even be in a restaurant. I've honestly made better fried chicken. When our waiter checked on the other table again, we had to call him to get his attention. I didn't want to have to do that.  After the long waits, my daughter just wanted to make sure she got her dessert that was included with her dinner. When the waiter came, he just started writing the check, even though we hadn't asked for it, and he was about to stiff my daughter out of her dessert. What did she do?? So I explained that her meal came with dessert. I know it had options but he insisted it only offered vanilla or chocolate ice cream. She ate her dessert, and we ran out of there so fast. We will likely never return.There's something wrong with these places that are getting cocky lately. Especially in this economy. This is not the first restaurant we've been to where our server has copped an attitude. We're always smiley, and friendly with our servers, and we're very good tippers so long as the service is good. I'm getting really tired of dealing with attitudes on servers.",2.0
"This is a great place for brunch, the wait can be a bit long, but they will take your phone number and call you when the table is ready and there are a few interesting boutiques nearby to distract you while you wait.I don't want to say that the food is typical Brooklyn Fare, but more restaurants seem to be trending towards new and upscale classic American. These guys just do it right, the quality exceed the price.I highly recommend the pork chops, and the sour cream doughnut which comes out warm and covered in powdered sugar (yeah!) and Brunch includes a alcoholic bev, I recommend the bloody mary, if your into them because they do it well.",4.0
"When a restaurant dares to use the word ""buttermilk"" in its name, I'm not going for wheatgrass shakes or sushi or Korean bbq.  The word ""buttermilk"" evokes pancakes, fried chicken, ice cream, and other artery-clogging but delicious foods. Fortunately, Buttermilk Channel does the word ""buttermilk"" proud with its brunch.There are a couple minor barriers you'll have to overcome: 1) the wait: when we arrived at 1ish on sunday, we were told the wait was going to be at least 1.5 hours. But if you don't mind sitting at the first-come, first-serve 10-seat bar, the wait can be as short as our 10-minute one; 2) the distance: it's not close to too many subways and is more in red hook than cobble hillBut oh the food is worth these minor obstacles--I was disappointed that they don't have their fried chicken and waffles on the brunch menu but my feeling was short-lived. The short rib hash w/ 2 sunny-side up eggs seemed like 95% short rib and 5% hash, a ratio that I was very happy about. The lox, scallion and cream cheese egg scramble was creamy and decadent, and it came with a savory hash brown and biscuit (which we wisely substituted for toast thanks to the advice of other yelpers). We also split a short stack (3) of pancakes that my g/f couldn't stop eating. I think there was a hint of vanilla in the batter that gave it a nice little kick. One of the best things about BC is that no brunch dish is over $15, and it comes with your choice of juice (although granted, it's a pretty small glass). The service was friendly and attentive at the bar, and I already have my sights set next on the pecan pie french toast after I lose a couple pounds from this meal. Maybe I'll just walk back to Manhattan next time.",4.0
"buttermilk is at the end of my street which makes me a very lucky man.  my wife and i go often and usually get the following:- pickles, grilled flatbread, soup (sweat potato and pumpkin in the fall was just as outstanding as the current cauliflower and apple), kale salad, pasta or grilled vegetable platter for the vegetarian mrs and usually the hake or lobster special for myself, and i can easily knock back 4 (or more) of the gentian sling, i would have been more particular about each plate but doug changes the menu based on what is seasonalyes, we eat a lot but the food is that good and fresh that we easily finish it up without feeing regret.  i try to leave room for the pecan sundae or the salted caramel sweatbread but its not easy.we have been over 20 times at this point and i have tried everything on the menu minus the pork products.  i would recommend it all.to me, this is one of those places that all new yorkers who enjoy a good night out should try at somepoint, it is a true gem.",5.0
"I LOVE this place!!! I definitely recommend making reservations.  We had a group of 7 people and were seated immediately (reservations were for 11:15am on Sunday). Despite having to wake up super early and trek from Harlem to Brooklyn, I had no regrets.I ordered the scrambled eggs with sausage and cheddar waffles, but had a bite of everyone's meal.  The pork chops...AMAZING. I also HIGHLY recommend the sausage.  I started raving about them at my table until i realized how obscenely inappropriate i sounded.

"It's strange, but it feels like the people at Buttermilk Channel really want you to eat at their restaurant. I've gotten so used to the irritated staff at other new places around Brooklyn who make you feel like you've really got a lot of nerve coming to THEIR restaurant and asking THEM to serve YOU.Really, the people were great, especially the host who had endless patience with our shrinking/expanding group and made us feel very welcome and non-nuisancey.Inviting people and atmosphere aside, a few things stood out:Vegetarian menu! They have one! Like a kid's menu but more fun! So liberating.Salt! The only times I usually notice salt is when there's too much. Here, I noticed flake salt and kosher salt and smokey salt. Each dish had salt that complemented its ingredients. Cranberry, bean and fennel stew. This is slow-food Brooklyn dining at its best. It's a thoughtful dish with the tartness of cranberries and a touch of coolness (spearmint?). Really amazing.",5.0
"Went for Brunch this morning and sat outside because there was a 45 minute wait inside. My silverware was hot-hot-hot. Had the Eggs Huntington. They eggs were nicely poached and overall is was a good dish, there's nothing like sopping up egg yolks with a nicely dressed salad. Yum! Also ordered the cheddar waffles since they seems to be a hit on here. Interesting combo of sweet and savory. You can definitely taste the cheddar. Had a traditional bloody mary and was not a fan; too many gritty chunks of garlic and coarse black pepper. Blech! Wished I'd saved the $9 on that one. I'll be back though; we want to try the monday night $25 dinner.",3.0

I've honestly made better fried chicken. When our waiter checked on the other table again, we had to call him to get his attention. I didn't want to have to do that.  After the long waits, my daughter just wanted to make sure she got her dessert that was included with her dinner. When the waiter came, he just started writing the check, even though we hadn't asked for it, and he was about to stiff my daughter out of her dessert. What did she do?? So I explained that her meal came with dessert. I know it had options but he insisted it only offered vanilla or chocolate ice cream. She ate her dessert, and we ran out of there so fast. We will likely never return.There's something wrong with these places that are getting cocky lately. Especially in this economy. This is not the first restaurant we've been to where our server has copped an attitude. We're always smiley, and friendly with our servers, and we're very good tippers so long as the service is good. I'm getting really tired of dealing with attitudes on servers.",2.0
"This is a great place for brunch, the wait can be a bit long, but they will take your phone number and call you when the table is ready and there are a few interesting boutiques nearby to distract you while you wait.I don't want to say that the food is typical Brooklyn Fare, but more restaurants seem to be trending towards new and upscale classic American. These guys just do it right, the quality exceed the price.I highly recommend the pork chops, and the sour cream doughnut which comes out warm and covered in powdered sugar (yeah!) and Brunch includes a alcoholic bev, I recommend the bloody mary, if your into them because they do it well.",4.0
"When a restaurant dares to use the word ""buttermilk"" in its name, I'm not going for wheatgrass shakes or sushi or Korean bbq.  The word ""buttermilk"" evokes pancakes, fried chicken, ice cream, and other artery-clogging but delicious foods. Fortunately, Buttermilk Channel does the word ""buttermilk"" proud with its brunch.There are a couple minor barriers you'll have to overcome: 1) the wait: when we arrived at 1ish on sunday, we were told the wait was going to be at least 1.5 hours. But if you don't mind sitting at the first-come, first-serve 10-seat bar, the wait can be as short as our 10-minute one; 2) the distance: it's not close to too many subways and is more in red hook than cobble hillBut oh the food is worth these minor obstacles--I was disappointed that they don't have their fried chicken and waffles on the brunch menu but my feeling was short-lived. The short rib hash w/ 2 sunny-side up eggs seemed like 95% short rib and 5% hash, a ratio that I was very happy about. The lox, scallion and cream cheese egg scramble was creamy and decadent, and it came with a savory hash brown and biscuit (which we wisely substituted for toast thanks to the advice of other yelpers). We also split a short stack (3) of pancakes that my g/f couldn't stop eating. I think there was a hint of vanilla in the batter that gave it a nice little kick. One of the best things about BC is that no brunch dish is over $15, and it comes with your choice of juice (although granted, it's a pretty small glass). The service was friendly and attentive at the bar, and I already have my sights set next on the pecan pie french toast after I lose a couple pounds from this meal. Maybe I'll just walk back to Manhattan next time.",4.0
"buttermilk is at the end of my street which makes me a very lucky man.  my wife and i go often and usually get the following:- pickles, grilled flatbread, soup (sweat potato and pumpkin in the fall was just as outstanding as the current cauliflower and apple), kale salad, pasta or grilled vegetable platter for the vegetarian mrs and usually the hake or lobster special for myself, and i can easily knock back 4 (or more) of the gentian sling, i would have been more particular about each plate but doug changes the menu based on what is seasonalyes, we eat a lot but the food is that good and fresh that we easily finish it up without feeing regret.  i try to leave room for the pecan sundae or the salted caramel sweatbread but its not easy.we have been over 20 times at this point and i have tried everything on the menu minus the pork products.  i would recommend it all.to me, this is one of those places that all new yorkers who enjoy a good night out should try at somepoint, it is a true gem.",5.0
"I LOVE this place!!! I definitely recommend making reservations.  We had a group of 7 people and were seated immediately (reservations were for 11:15am on Sunday). Despite having to wake up super early and trek from Harlem to Brooklyn, I had no regrets.I ordered the scrambled eggs with sausage and cheddar waffles, but had a bite of everyone's meal.  The pork chops...AMAZING. I also HIGHLY recommend the sausage.  I started raving about them at my table until i realized how obscenely inappropriate i sounded. I really wish i had tried the rib hash BUT i have a friend coming to town in June so I'll be back!! I also plan on heading there for dinner at some point since that menu looks just as mouth watering!!",5.0
"better than bubby's in manhattan...and that's saying something. AWESOME brunch. the biscuits are incredible. the bacon is delicious. scrambled eggs kind of mediocre but smoke salmon on rye with cream cheese and capers? yes. also, 4 kinds of interesting bloody mary's...one of them with oysters on top! you must spend a saturday or sunday afternoon there with special people to enjoy this meal.",5.0
"It's strange, but it feels like the people at Buttermilk Channel really want you to eat at their restaurant. I've gotten so used to the irritated staff at other new places around Brooklyn who make you feel like you've really got a lot of nerve coming to THEIR restaurant and asking THEM to serve YOU.Really, the people were great, especially the host who had endless patience with our shrinking/expanding group and made us feel very welcome and non-nuisancey.Inviting people and atmosphere aside, a few things stood out:Vegetarian menu! They have one! Like a kid's menu but more fun! So liberating.Salt! The only times I usually notice salt is when there's too much. Here, I noticed flake salt and kosher salt and smokey salt. Each dish had salt that complemented its ingredients. Cranberry, bean and fennel stew. This is slow-food Brooklyn dining at its best. It's a thoughtful dish with the tartness of cranberries and a touch of coolness (spearmint?). Really amazing.",5.0
"Went for Brunch this morning and sat outside because there was a 45 minute wait inside. My silverware was hot-hot-hot. Had the Eggs Huntington. They eggs were nicely poached and overall is was a good dish, there's nothing like sopping up egg yolks with a nicely dressed salad. Yum! Also ordered the cheddar waffles since they seems to be a hit on here. Interesting combo of sweet and savory. You can definitely taste the cheddar. Had a traditional bloody mary and was not a fan; too many gritty chunks of garlic and coarse black pepper. Blech! Wished I'd saved the $9 on that one. I'll be back though; we want to try the monday night $25 dinner.",3.0
"Very good brunch place in a nice bk neighborhood-- far less annoying to wait for than a Manhattan brunch restaurant.

"This was one of the best meals I had during my 4 months in NY!  Our party of 4 arrived around 7pm on a Sunday night.  It's somewhat inconvenient that they only take reservations for a party of 5 or more.  So we ordered drinks at the bar and waited.  The wait wasn't so bad though, considering they initially told us at least 45 minutes and a seat at the communal table.  Instead, we waited around 20-30 minutes and got our very own table.  We picked this place because it had a separate menu for vegetarians, but also had an incredible variety of interesting dishes.  It sure didn't disappoint.  Our vegetarian diner was delighted with her cheese waffles.  Based on a recommendation from our server, I went with the most popular dish of buttermilk fried chicken.  I didn't even realize it came with waffles as well...and of course syrup for dipping!  =)  It was excellent, along with the bacon wrapped trout ordered by the guys.  How can you possibly go wrong with anything that has bacon in it.  Really enjoyed the sweetness of the prune jam, which worked well with the saltiness of the bacon.Oh, I almost forgot about the highlight, which was the complimentary cheesy bread they serve at the beginning of the meal.  It was so warm and lovely; I wanted more!  We also shared the spiced ribs, which were good, although I thought could have been more flavorful.  The squash tart was nice as well.For dessert we split the pecan pie sundae and apple bread pudding.  I preferred the warm bread pudding, although my dining companions ate up the sundae, which is apparently their most popular dessert, according to our server.  I found it to be too sweet, but it was finished at our table.  I might be generous giving it 5 stars, but we had such a disappointing meal the night before and spent double what we spent here.",5.0

"I had been waiting to go to Buttermilk Channel for months and finally had the treat of going there for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago. We heard that it gets packed so we made reservations a little on the late side (had a crazy night planned for Saturday). Surprisingly, we all woke up early and starving. The staff was incredibly accommodating and moved up our reservations to satiate our empty tummies. We were given a great corner table and our waitress Caitlin was a saint. She knew from the look of us to promptly bring coffee was patient while we stared blankly at the menus salivating and wondering if we could maneuver ordering everything. As a former waitress, I know it can be very irritating when a table asks for a new thing every time you go there i.e. ""can we have some ketchup? syrup? more coffee? OJ? We had Caitlin running all over the restaurant and never did she roll her eyes or tsk, just kept smiling.Now to the food, after intense deliberation I ordered the Eggs Huntington. I normally am skeeved by runny yolks but they were just the right amount of runny to soak the warm biscuits with ham and hollondaise heaven. I definitely recommend it. The pancakes - though traditional - looked unbelievable as well. Brunch comes with coffee or tea AND juice, mimosa, bellini, or sparkling wine. Why only three stars? Though I love brunch, I am a big dinner person. I need to go back for dinner before I can give them the full 5.

Buttermilk Channel made my Bday suck a little.  Cute place but my oh my what a let down.  I had the special Monday 3 course special.  Soup.  Gross.  Poor waiter realized I didn't like it..sub'd it out with their watermelon salad.  Hmm..didn't touch it either.  But I didn't let that get me down.  Chicken and Waffles were up next.  How can you mess that up?  Ugh.  They did.  Although the chicken had a nice crust.  It wasn't seasoned.    The waffles were as good as the ones you find at the frozen aisle of your supermarket.  The coleslaw leaked onto your waffle.  Gross.  The coleslaw had raw red onions in it..so imagine the surprise when you take a bite out of your waffle with syrup..not noticing there are bits of onions clinging to the underside of your waffle.  yuck.  The only saving grace was the dessert.  Well happy bday to me : (,2.0
"All I had to hear was ""The best chicken and waffles..."" before I was game for Buttermilk Channel. A group of friends and I went to NYC for the day for a day of shenanigans, and needed a place to finish off the night strong. One of my friends mentioned Buttermilk Channel, where she said we'd find some of the best chicken and waffles. After having Roscoe's in LA and Lolos in Phoenix, I knew a thing or two about good chicken and waffles, so I held her to that.As we first arrived at BC, I was blown away. My expectations were along the lines of a hole in the wall in Brooklyn, not the very nice and trendy restaurant that we saw before us. After an hour wait, my group of 7 including myself sat outside on their enclosed patio. We had fantastic service, especially for a group our size. The chicken and waffles were excellent (we had 7 orders!). You get 1/2 of a cheddar waffle, cole slaw, and a 1/2 chicken sectioned in to 3 pieces. The chicken was tender, the skin was crispy, the waffles were fantastic, and the cole slaw was delicious. While there were many positives, the chicken was too boney with not enough meat (especially for $18) and the balsamic reduction I thought could be sweeter (it being a stand in for syrup). As for the best chicken and waffles? They polished this dish in to a fantastic presentation with a delicious taste, but there's something about Roscoe's that makes me think it's supreme. I give Buttermilk Channel 4 stars, and would gladly go there again!",4.0

She knew from the look of us to promptly bring coffee was patient while we stared blankly at the menus salivating and wondering if we could maneuver ordering everything. As a former waitress, I know it can be very irritating when a table asks for a new thing every time you go there i.e. ""can we have some ketchup? syrup? more coffee? OJ? We had Caitlin running all over the restaurant and never did she roll her eyes or tsk, just kept smiling.Now to the food, after intense deliberation I ordered the Eggs Huntington. I normally am skeeved by runny yolks but they were just the right amount of runny to soak the warm biscuits with ham and hollondaise heaven. I definitely recommend it. The pancakes - though traditional - looked unbelievable as well. Brunch comes with coffee or tea AND juice, mimosa, bellini, or sparkling wine. Why only three stars? Though I love brunch, I am a big dinner person. I need to go back for dinner before I can give them the full 5. Though I am sure I will not be disappointed.UPDATENow has become one of my favorite restaurants in all of Brooklyn. Great vibe, INCREDIBLE food. Buttermilk never disappoints. Everything on the menu is sensational. Definitely a must in your culinary exploration of Brooklyn.",5.0
"I visited this restaurant on the last day of Brooklyn Restaurant week. I thought that because it was a Thursday night the wait would not be long. I was wrong. I was told it would be 1hr and a half. The wait was well worth it. The food was great, my waiter attentive and informative, the atmosphere was cozy and nice. I highly recommend this place and you should try the buttermilk chicken. Just prepare yourself for the wait.",5.0
"Go on a Monday night and get the special $25 pre fixe menu. Portion sizes are the same and you can still enjoy the amazing buttermilk fried chicken and cheddar waffles (a must!), as well as a salad or soup and a delicious dessert. If you go early enough (6/6:30) you won't even have to wait!",4.0

Buttermilk Channel made my Bday suck a little.  Cute place but my oh my what a let down.  I had the special Monday 3 course special.  Soup.  Gross.  Poor waiter realized I didn't like it..sub'd it out with their watermelon salad.  Hmm..didn't touch it either.  But I didn't let that get me down.  Chicken and Waffles were up next.  How can you mess that up?  Ugh.  They did.  Although the chicken had a nice crust.  It wasn't seasoned.    The waffles were as good as the ones you find at the frozen aisle of your supermarket.  The coleslaw leaked onto your waffle.  Gross.  The coleslaw had raw red onions in it..so imagine the surprise when you take a bite out of your waffle with syrup..not noticing there are bits of onions clinging to the underside of your waffle.  yuck.  The only saving grace was the dessert.  Well happy bday to me : (,2.0
"All I had to hear was ""The best chicken and waffles..."" before I was game for Buttermilk Channel. A group of friends and I went to NYC for the day for a day of shenanigans, and needed a place to finish off the night strong. One of my friends mentioned Buttermilk Channel, where she said we'd find some of the best chicken and waffles. After having Roscoe's in LA and Lolos in Phoenix, I knew a thing or two about good chicken and waffles, so I held her to that.As we first arrived at BC, I was blown away. My expectations were along the lines of a hole in the wall in Brooklyn, not the very nice and trendy restaurant that we saw before us. After an hour wait, my group of 7 including myself sat outside on their enclosed patio. We had fantastic service, especially for a group our size. The chicken and waffles were excellent (we had 7 orders!). You get 1/2 of a cheddar waffle, cole slaw, and a 1/2 chicken sectioned in to 3 pieces. The chicken was tender, the skin was crispy, the waffles were fantastic, and the cole slaw was delicious. While there were many positives, the chicken was too boney with not enough meat (especially for $18) and the balsamic reduction I thought could be sweeter (it being a stand in for syrup). As for the best chicken and waffles? They polished this dish in to a fantastic presentation with a delicious taste, but there's something about Roscoe's that makes me think it's supreme. I give Buttermilk Channel 4 stars, and would gladly go there again!",4.0

"It can get pretty crowded at peak hours...but I say it's worth the wait in virtually every case.My personal menu favorite is the charred kale and fingerling potato salad & anchovy and lemon vinaigrette that comes with the Creekstone Farms skirt steak -- it's the kind of thing I would order as my last meal if I ever found myself on death row.But the duck meatloaf, buttermilk fried chicken and ham-wrapped brook trout are also solid choices.My advice? Go a little early or go a little late to avoid the masses. And order the kale.",5.0
I went here for dinner on a Friday night.  The food was delicious.  I had Caputo's Fresh Linguini and it was AMAZING.  The atmosphere was very nice too.  I would definitely go here again and would recommend it to others.,5.0

It's medium heavy battered and well seasoned, moist, piping hot, etc. the waffle was average and had a molasses sauce. Cole slaw was amazing. And I hate cole slaw usually... Loved the onion in it. We had a fly-by dinner of entrees only and were in a rush to get out of there. The hostess was really helpful and accommodating.

"There are moments in a person's life in which guilt is washed away and true pleasure reigns. This was the feeling I had, in an instant, when I bit into Buttermilk Channel's Bacon in a mustard sauce. For $5 you were served two pieces of thick-cut, high-quality bacon in a slightly smoky, sweet mustard sauce that brought hosannas from on high as your mouth rejoiced in it. This bacon could stop wars. It could start religions.Okay, enough about the bacon.  (But it was very, very good.)  The place is pretty loud, so if possible, sit outside (or just talk even louder than the crowd).  I'm not into very loud dinners so I don't think I'd be happy eating indoors.I had a fantastic time at Buttermilk channel for a number of reasons. My Fair Harbor cocktail was essentially a well-made Dark and Stormy.  Delicious, albeit somewhat pricey ($11). Oysters on the half shell are one of my many weaknesses, and my neighborhood suffers from a lack of places that serve them.  So I was delighted to order 8 of the succulent bivalves with the accoutrements of a housemade cocktail sauce and a blood-orange mignonette. At $2.25 a piece they weren't a steal but they were very good oysters and that price is maybe on the low end of standard for NYC.At the recommendation of a friend from an earlier BBQ in Fort Greene I ordered the Duck Meatloaf, not knowing what to expect.  What emerged looked like a large burger patty with an onion ring on top, in a gorgeous vibrant green puree of salsify.  The dish was rich, almost overpoweringly so, but flavors that made my eyes roll back into my head at least once.Service was excellent.  Tight, professional, never cloying.We got there at 7 on a Saturday and were seated almost immediately; by 8 o clock they were quoting over an hour wait.The only complaint, besides the noise was that the apple popovers (replacing what most restaurants would serve as bread) were slightly burnt and not good.I will go back, definitely.  They have a very good thing going, but know this--eating here will break any and all diets.  And that is something to embrace!",4.0

"Wow.  I think this is my new favorite restaurant in all of Brooklyn.  Hell, all of New York, the U.S., the WORLD!Everything was perfect.  From the dandelion green salad which was a perfect mix of slightly bitter greens with lovely slightly salty anchovy vinaigrette and warm egg to the trout which was fresh, light, tangy and not a one in sight.  And I can't even begin to describe the bliss that overcame me while eating the bread pudding with homemade whipping cream.  Warm with just the perfect blend of creamy and chewy and sweet but not too sweet.  Also, the staff is totally darling.  It started raining while we ate outside and they rapidly and professionally moved us inside in a matter of moments.Love love love this place.",5.0

"So I came here for my birthday with my family and a friend.  I came on Monday night with my family because I knew they had the Monday night dinner special for their chicken and waffles.  The special comes with an appetizer and a dessert along with the entree.  I'm not sure if it was just that day I went, but my chicken tasted a little strange, almost as if the chicken wasn't fresh or the type of chicken they buy are really old hens. They had a type of rancid after taste that I really couldn't stand, so I had to cover it up with the syrup they give you.  The chicken was prepared well though, it was super crispy and as any good fried chicken should be.  The waffle was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Honestly the clams that my friend had were probably the highlight of the dinner.  Her clams tasted so fresh and the broth it was cooked in was so flavorful.  I think I just need to return on a different day and try it again.",3.0

"It's like walking into a Manhattan establishment. Really. My girlfriend and her mother went here to eat and since they were locals of the neighborhood, they said that you really couldn't walk down this block at night and expect anything good to come out of it.Well here comes Buttermilk Channel, a newer addition to the lovely sky rocketing (and yet, still somewhat quiet) Carroll Gardens. Packed to the brim with an awesome Yelper at the hostess helm, we got drinks in the front corner of the long bar, and it's basically a very pristine place. It's old school decor, and seemed like a place that Dillinger would go to for brunch; the soft yellows and extremely friendly waitstaff combined to a great experience. It's a bit rollicking but that's exactly what a gangster would need to get some anonymity going.It's not a cheap place by any means, but the bacon-wrapped trout was pretty amazing (I love fingerling potatoes). I think our appetizers were nasty good; I had a few oysters which I downed and felt like a million even though I was wearing shorts.Is it my kind of Brooklyn? Probably not.

"There are moments in a person's life in which guilt is washed away and true pleasure reigns. This was the feeling I had, in an instant, when I bit into Buttermilk Channel's Bacon in a mustard sauce. For $5 you were served two pieces of thick-cut, high-quality bacon in a slightly smoky, sweet mustard sauce that brought hosannas from on high as your mouth rejoiced in it. This bacon could stop wars. It could start religions.Okay, enough about the bacon.  (But it was very, very good.)  The place is pretty loud, so if possible, sit outside (or just talk even louder than the crowd).  I'm not into very loud dinners so I don't think I'd be happy eating indoors.I had a fantastic time at Buttermilk channel for a number of reasons.

"This is so sad - but...I wanted to love it here, I really did. I had dinner here with several friends on a Wednesday night. We were brought out pop-overs and they were delish - I loved the honey that was drizzled over them. I got the burger - which apparently is made with bone marrow and ground there - unfortunately on 3 different bites I got a bit of gristle in my burger. Yeech. There is nothing more unpalatable and unappetizing than a bite of gristly fat in a burger. That pretty much did it for me. I am sure people have had a much better burger there - gristle free. Wish it was me because I would have surely gone back for another. My friend and life partner LOVED the fried chicken and cheddar waffles with the balsamic syrup. My other friend that was dining with us got the ""braised"" pork shoulder. It was tough and fatty - and not the good kind of ""fatty"" where it's been braised for hours and it just melts in your mouth - it was chewy and rubbery. The dish was also bland with an undertone of cilantro? - which was contrary to what the waiter told us it would be (""spiced, warm"" - he said).Won't be rushing back here but will probably give it another chance - for now, onward to other places in the hood.",2.0

It was superb, and I can't stand meatloaf. It was one of those singular meals for sure.

"I kept hearing about Buttermilk Channel. The New York Times ran an article, some women were gushing about it on the subway, and then I passed by it not long ago while going down Court Street. My nose sniffed a fad-laden, perhaps pretentious and maybe not so enjoyable experience, but boy, was I wrong. Buttermilk Channel truly pleased in every sense of the term. I kept searching the menu looking for something to criticize or scoff at, but it was not possible. Truly New American offerings are presented in a thoughtful and coherent manner that keeps with the uniqueness of a place like this. I went with a couple of friends on a Sunday evening and we were in for a real treat. I'll start first by saying that they don't accept reservations for parties under five. I guess it's popular enough, and totally excused based on the quality of the experience I had thereafter. We cleverly arrived around 4:45pm to wait for them to open at 5:00pm, thereby successfully avoiding a wait of any kind. We were promptly seated at 5:00pm and it was all excellent from there. Impressively so, by about 5:15pm, the place was packed and it already appeared that a wait list had materialized.The menu offers a truly impressive variety of simple, but elegant dishes that are sure to please. We started with the sweet potato & goat cheese croquettes and an organic green salad to start, both of which were lovely. I went off on a mini-tangent about how nice it is to see sweet potato used in a more savory approach - Fantastic. We were served a few Yorkshire Puddings instead of bread on the table, which was great - I had the duck meatloaf as my entree, which was presented beautifully on a layer of creamed spinach & celery root, and in a pretty generous portion. Another person in my party had the lamb romaine salad which looked delicious and everyone was really pleased. The wine and beer list is extensive and made to make any native New Yorker proud - All their beers are New York State, and a handful of their wines are too - Mostly Long Island and Finger Lakes. We ordered a very reasonably priced bottle of North Fork wine which was exquisite and I couldn't get over how lovely the presentation of everything was. The restaurant itself is a bright, buttery yellow space that is sun-splashed in the early evening and warmed by dark wood floors, exposed brick and tasteful lighting and candles. The prices are very reasonable for the caliber of a place like this and I was really satisfied above and beyond with everything. Overall, Buttermilk Channel is truly superb and I can give it my highest recommendation.",5.0
"I came here for the first time last weekend, after having had this place on my radar (and my official Yelp bookmarks) almost since it opened.  Mainly its been on my radar for brunch, as brunch takes precedence over dinner in my book; plus dinner is considerably more pricey.My brunch companions and I arrived around 9:58 on Sunday morning and were shuffled in the door promptly at 10, where we were settled with some coffee.  One bone to pick - they charge you for coffee, despite the conspicuous lack of a price listed for it one the menu, where the only mention of coffee is at the top of the menu, right under the blip about the free drinks that come with your brunch.  Shady!  Second bone to pick - you can't get a mimosa until after noon, so if you come early like we did, your ""free brunch cocktail"" deal suddenly doesn't look so good.I got the Short Rib Hash; my friends ordered the spinach/goat cheese scramble and the Eggs Huntington.  I was pleased they let me substitute the toast that comes with my meal for a biscuit.When the food came it was cold; the biscuit looked as if it had once been toasted but was now stone cold, and not as flaky and buttery as a biscuit should be.  The short rib hash was not stingy with the meat, but the flavor was nothing special - same for the salad that came with it.  My companions both said their food was good, but I got the feeling that it was only ""good"" in the same way that mine was.  Edible, but nothing special.Brunch for three came out to about $50 including tip, for cold food, no booze, and overpriced drip coffee (which should ALWAYS come standard with any brunch - they can afford to give me coffee if I'm paying them $12 for $0.50 worth of eggs).Three stars because the place was cute, brunch prices were standard, food was fine, and all in all it was a fun time.  We also stayed chatting until almost 1 and they just kept refilling our coffee, and our server was sweet.  However, it was a letdown after I'd been waiting to try it for so long.  I'd come back if I were in the area, but I won't be trekking down to Buttermilk Channel again otherwise.I have a feeling that maybe if you come during rush time, the food might get to your fresher and hotter, and that if I were to perfect my ordering it would be a 4-star brunch standard...Pecan Pie French Toast WHAT!  (We also saw some kids getting coffee cake with ice cream and syrup on top - those kids know how to play it!)",3.0

"Wait for a table for two was an hour at 6:30 on a Saturday, but the hostess reconfigured the dining room and squeezed me and my mom in after a few minutes. First score of the night.Wine I got wasn't full-bodied enough for my taste -- I got the Carignan -- but I probably should have gone with my instincts and went with something further down the list instead of the middle.

"I kept hearing about Buttermilk Channel. The New York Times ran an article, some women were gushing about it on the subway, and then I passed by it not long ago while going down Court Street. My nose sniffed a fad-laden, perhaps pretentious and maybe not so enjoyable experience, but boy, was I wrong. Buttermilk Channel truly pleased in every sense of the term. I kept searching the menu looking for something to criticize or scoff at, but it was not possible. Truly New American offerings are presented in a thoughtful and coherent manner that keeps with the uniqueness of a place like this. I went with a couple of friends on a Sunday evening and we were in for a real treat. I'll start first by saying that they don't accept reservations for parties under five. I guess it's popular enough, and totally excused based on the quality of the experience I had thereafter. We cleverly arrived around 4:45pm to wait for them to open at 5:00pm, thereby successfully avoiding a wait of any kind. We were promptly seated at 5:00pm and it was all excellent from there. Impressively so, by about 5:15pm, the place was packed and it already appeared that a wait list had materialized.The menu offers a truly impressive variety of simple, but elegant dishes that are sure to please. We started with the sweet potato & goat cheese croquettes and an organic green salad to start, both of which were lovely. I went off on a mini-tangent about how nice it is to see sweet potato used in a more savory approach - Fantastic. We were served a few Yorkshire Puddings instead of bread on the table, which was great - I had the duck meatloaf as my entree, which was presented beautifully on a layer of creamed spinach & celery root, and in a pretty generous portion. Another person in my party had the lamb romaine salad which looked delicious and everyone was really pleased. The wine and beer list is extensive and made to make any native New Yorker proud - All their beers are New York State, and a handful of their wines are too - Mostly Long Island and Finger Lakes. We ordered a very reasonably priced bottle of North Fork wine which was exquisite and I couldn't get over how lovely the presentation of everything was. The restaurant itself is a bright, buttery yellow space that is sun-splashed in the early evening and warmed by dark wood floors, exposed brick and tasteful lighting and candles. The prices are very reasonable for the caliber of a place like this and I was really satisfied above and beyond with everything. Overall, Buttermilk Channel is truly superb and I can give it my highest recommendation.",5.0
"I came here for the first time last weekend, after having had this place on my radar (and my official Yelp bookmarks) almost since it opened.  Mainly its been on my radar for brunch, as brunch takes precedence over dinner in my book; plus dinner is considerably more pricey.My brunch companions and I arrived around 9:58 on Sunday morning and were shuffled in the door promptly at 10, where we were settled with some coffee.  One bone to pick - they charge you for coffee, despite the conspicuous lack of a price listed for it one the menu, where the only mention of coffee is at the top of the menu, right under the blip about the free drinks that come with your brunch.  Shady!  Second bone to pick - you can't get a mimosa until after noon, so if you come early like we did, your ""free brunch cocktail"" deal suddenly doesn't look so good.I got the Short Rib Hash; my friends ordered the spinach/goat cheese scramble and the Eggs Huntington.  I was pleased they let me substitute the toast that comes with my meal for a biscuit.When the food came it was cold; the biscuit looked as if it had once been toasted but was now stone cold, and not as flaky and buttery as a biscuit should be.  The short rib hash was not stingy with the meat, but the flavor was nothing special - same for the salad that came with it.  My companions both said their food was good, but I got the feeling that it was only ""good"" in the same way that mine was.  Edible, but nothing special.Brunch for three came out to about $50 including tip, for cold food, no booze, and overpriced drip coffee (which should ALWAYS come standard with any brunch - they can afford to give me coffee if I'm paying them $12 for $0.50 worth of eggs).Three stars because the place was cute, brunch prices were standard, food was fine, and all in all it was a fun time.  We also stayed chatting until almost 1 and they just kept refilling our coffee, and our server was sweet.  However, it was a letdown after I'd been waiting to try it for so long.  I'd come back if I were in the area, but I won't be trekking down to Buttermilk Channel again otherwise.I have a feeling that maybe if you come during rush time, the food might get to your fresher and hotter, and that if I were to perfect my ordering it would be a 4-star brunch standard...Pecan Pie French Toast WHAT!  (We also saw some kids getting coffee cake with ice cream and syrup on top - those kids know how to play it!)",3.0

"After having had an incredibly delightful brunch at Buttermilk Channel a few months back I decided to come back and tackle the dinner menu. My brunch experience was great overall and although my group and I waited over an hour to be seated. The host was incredibly apologetic and offered us the maple bacon roasted almonds, which were nothing short of incredible, to tide our roaring stomachs over. I ended up ordering the Eggs Huntington, which was tasty but not necessarily remarkable. I ordered a side of waffles to see what all the chatter was about and wow...totally lived up to the hype. Absolutely incredible. I gushed about it to our waitress and she suggested that next time I have the Eggs Huntington, I should ask for it served on a waffle instead of the biscuit. Um... fuck yes I will!Ok, so back to dinner... I went last night with a friend and we ordered the foie gras to start with. (I know some people are touchy about foie gras but let's face it, if you're not a vegetarian or vegan why start making double standards on what animal part is and isn't acceptable to eat?  Just enjoy being at the top of the food chain.) The foie gras was tasty as expected and  with a nice sized portion. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and my friend the Duck Meatloaf. As much as I was looking forward to getting my hands on some waffles again they just weren't as I remembered them. The chicken was tender and the skin incredibly crispy but sadly not extraordinary.  I was really hoping it would beat the fried chicken at the Brooklyn Bowl but alas it didn't.   The sauce that it was served with the waffles and chicken was ill fitting. I couldn't quite place the taste of it but after having been to a handful of waffle houses I wasn't left very impressed. A delicious meal mind you but perhaps I just came in expecting too much. The star of the evening was the Duck Meatloaf. Dear lord, incredible! Why have I never had this before?  It was fantastic and if I could have traded plates without my friend noticing I would have. Overall a great place but maybe there could be a bit of improvement on the seasoning in the batter for the chicken.",4.0
"First, the restaurant is beautiful and I am glad they are in our neighborhood.  The staff I encountered on my first and only night to eat there was so kind (host, hostess, waitress, bartenders) and welcoming.  I felt like they wanted my business and they treated us very well.  My 3 star rating is because we had a few let-downs with our dinner.  We ordered the flatbread with squash blossoms and buttermilk ricotta to start.  Sounds wonderful and delicate, right?  It should have been, but whoever prepared it had a seriously heavy hand with the coarse salt.  I'm not opposed to salt and my husband is always telling me that I should add more to my cooking, but we could not eat more than 1 piece.  I had the bacon wrapped brook trout and it was good.  No complaints, but no real excitement.  My husband got the fried chicken. The chicken was great and I consider myself someone that knows alot about the dish.  However, the waffle was bland.  It would have been better with potatoes.  What redeemed the whole meal was the PEAS side dish!  Get it if you go and eat them with your fried chicken.  We did not try dessert.",3.0
"There's something extra romantic about the idea of opening a restaurant.  Despite the odds being stacked against you, you invest your heart and soul in it anyway.  I love that.  I love the boldness and daring and of it and the core belief that you must have in something.  I like it even more when a restaurant shares that with you; when the owners appear in the front of the house and greet you, check in with you throughout your meal and tell you to come back soon when you're on your way out.  It makes the city less sterile and the world a little warmer and, I think, your meal a little tastier.Buttermilk Channel tonight hit all those marks.  The owner greeted me as I walked in, held the door open for me and welcomed me. My friends who were sipping drinks at the bar because I was 15 minutes late (sorry guys, and screw you F train!) were able to transfer their bar tab to the table.  Too few restaurants do this.  It's classy and should be done everywhere -- you shouldn't have to settle up at a bar six feet away from where you'll eat your dinner.  Two points, Buttermilk.Another two points go to the restaurant for having a separate vegetarian menu.  While a meat eater myself, I always feel for my non-meat eating friends whose dining selections are more a process of elimination than they are a matter of choice.More points go to the place for the ambiance.  It's on the corner of the street so there are lots of paned windows and it's decorated with lots of white and nice light fixtures.  The music was good and jazzy and the overall feel was homey and warm.Now, on to the food!  One of my friends had eaten here before so she told us we *had* to get the sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes and delicata squash tart, with buttermilk ricotta, brown butter and greens.  She did not lead us astray.  Both were amazing. The croquettes were nice and smooth and salty -- the salt was really nice, I thought -- and the sweet potato really came through. They were fantastic.  The squash tart was incredible, especially with the amazing ricotta.  Now if only I could figure out how to make it myself....For entrees we shared the fried chicken with cheddar waffles and a winter slaw and duck meatloaf with creamed spinach and duck jus.  Both were delicious.   The fried chicken batter was crispy and flavorful and the meatloaf was tender and tasty. We closed the evening out with the pecan pie sundae, which was good.... but not spectacular.  Don't get me wrong, pecan pie filling and ice cream are independently great but I just didn't think the two combined were particularly special.  Good, just not special.All in all, I'm a big fan of this place and their menu left me wanting to try a lot more.  Can you say bacon wrapped trout?  Hello!?!  I'll be back.  Big fan.",4.0

"Buttermilk Channel filled my inbox last week with reviews and mentions in NY Mag AND The New York Times. Not one to succumb to reviews other than ones from my fellow Yelpers ;), I knew something was going to happen at this place and needed to try it. My friend Jay and I decided to grab brunch this past Sunday as he had a place right across from his apartment that was great. That place HAPPENED to be Buttermilk Channel! They knew the owner and he brought us to the table in the back on the window. This place was packed at 2:30 on a Sunday. I had an itch for breakfast and ordered two biscuits with hollandaise ham and eggs. Jay's bf did the same while he ordered two massive pieces of french toast with sugar and almonds. Add in a complimentary bellini and a bloody and this is a pretty nifty brunch.That said, I want to come back for dinner. (Miriam W /Chantelle K?) There are no lamps here so everything is lit by the lone chandelier or candles. How romantic (or perfect for girls nights!) The place is just perfect for people looking to relax and the food was delish. Can't wait to come back.",4.0
"I'll start with a brief summary: Good cocktails, tasty appetizers, OK entrees, and some highlights in the dessert. We ordered the $25 Monday menu, which come to think of it, was a great value for the price, but I think that the limited menu may have hurt my experience a bit. My date and I pretty much ordered one of each of the items on the menu skipping the pasta, because we eat that at home, naturally. The salad was exactly what I expected from apples and blue cheese, good. The pumpkin soup was multidimensional and flavorful. We had the fish and the fried chicken next. The chicken was disappointing, not as crispy or as flavorful as I would have liked it. The fish with the mustard sauce was good, but I may have ordered something different if given the chance. The pecan pie and the chocolate bread pudding were pretty good for dessert. Overall, with all the hype this place gets, I wouldn't say it lived up to it.

"There's something extra romantic about the idea of opening a restaurant.  Despite the odds being stacked against you, you invest your heart and soul in it anyway.  I love that.  I love the boldness and daring and of it and the core belief that you must have in something.  I like it even more when a restaurant shares that with you; when the owners appear in the front of the house and greet you, check in with you throughout your meal and tell you to come back soon when you're on your way out.  It makes the city less sterile and the world a little warmer and, I think, your meal a little tastier.Buttermilk Channel tonight hit all those marks.  The owner greeted me as I walked in, held the door open for me and welcomed me. My friends who were sipping drinks at the bar because I was 15 minutes late (sorry guys, and screw you F train!) were able to transfer their bar tab to the table.  Too few restaurants do this.  It's classy and should be done everywhere -- you shouldn't have to settle up at a bar six feet away from where you'll eat your dinner.  Two points, Buttermilk.Another two points go to the restaurant for having a separate vegetarian menu.  While a meat eater myself, I always feel for my non-meat eating friends whose dining selections are more a process of elimination than they are a matter of choice.More points go to the place for the ambiance.  It's on the corner of the street so there are lots of paned windows and it's decorated with lots of white and nice light fixtures.  The music was good and jazzy and the overall feel was homey and warm.Now, on to the food!  One of my friends had eaten here before so she told us we *had* to get the sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes and delicata squash tart, with buttermilk ricotta, brown butter and greens.  She did not lead us astray.  Both were amazing. The croquettes were nice and smooth and salty -- the salt was really nice, I thought -- and the sweet potato really came through. They were fantastic.  The squash tart was incredible, especially with the amazing ricotta.  Now if only I could figure out how to make it myself....For entrees we shared the fried chicken with cheddar waffles and a winter slaw and duck meatloaf with creamed spinach and duck jus.  Both were delicious.   The fried chicken batter was crispy and flavorful and the meatloaf was tender and tasty. We closed the evening out with the pecan pie sundae, which was good.... but not spectacular.  Don't get me wrong, pecan pie filling and ice cream are independently great but I just didn't think the two combined were particularly special.  Good, just not special.All in all, I'm a big fan of this place and their menu left me wanting to try a lot more.  Can you say bacon wrapped trout?  Hello!?!  I'll be back.  Big fan.",4.0
"Love this place! Have been a few times and it never disappoints! Love the darkness, casual hipness, don't like the wait(on a friday night was about an hour). Try this drink called a ""Beez Neez"" which is beefeater gin/lemon juice/honey.....WOW, ITS A PANTY DROPPER.....and save a few bucks and go on monday when they have the $25 pri-fixe menu so you and your crew can order some different things and see what you like best! I love the fried chicken and cheddar waffles(and that darn apple crisp salad..yum)......AND I WOULD DIE FOR THEIR BAKED OYSTERS.....PURE CRACK....BUTTERMILK HAS MY HEART",5.0

"Overall a nice place for dinner in Brooklyn.  It can get a bit crowded and loud, but the decor is still considered romantic.The fried chicken were very crispy, but didn't have much flavor in the meat.  The waffle was the winner!  The ham wrapped trout was delicious, but I left the grits almost untouched.  Appetizers and desserts are decent.  Probably will return for a brunch.",3.0

"Buttermilk Channel filled my inbox last week with reviews and mentions in NY Mag AND The New York Times. Not one to succumb to reviews other than ones from my fellow Yelpers ;), I knew something was going to happen at this place and needed to try it. My friend Jay and I decided to grab brunch this past Sunday as he had a place right across from his apartment that was great. That place HAPPENED to be Buttermilk Channel! They knew the owner and he brought us to the table in the back on the window. This place was packed at 2:30 on a Sunday. I had an itch for breakfast and ordered two biscuits with hollandaise ham and eggs. Jay's bf did the same while he ordered two massive pieces of french toast with sugar and almonds. Add in a complimentary bellini and a bloody and this is a pretty nifty brunch.That said, I want to come back for dinner. (Miriam W /Chantelle K?) There are no lamps here so everything is lit by the lone chandelier or candles. How romantic (or perfect for girls nights!) The place is just perfect for people looking to relax and the food was delish. Can't wait to come back.",4.0
"I'll start with a brief summary: Good cocktails, tasty appetizers, OK entrees, and some highlights in the dessert. We ordered the $25 Monday menu, which come to think of it, was a great value for the price, but I think that the limited menu may have hurt my experience a bit. My date and I pretty much ordered one of each of the items on the menu skipping the pasta, because we eat that at home, naturally. The salad was exactly what I expected from apples and blue cheese, good. The pumpkin soup was multidimensional and flavorful. We had the fish and the fried chicken next. The chicken was disappointing, not as crispy or as flavorful as I would have liked it. The fish with the mustard sauce was good, but I may have ordered something different if given the chance. The pecan pie and the chocolate bread pudding were pretty good for dessert. Overall, with all the hype this place gets, I wouldn't say it lived up to it. Cute decor and great location, but the food was just good, not great.",3.0
"Brunch here is a solid 4. I'd give my one dinner here a 3.5, but it's possible that I just ordered wrong, was in a bad mood, stars weren't aligned, etc. The brunch here is stupid good.  It is the best in the area. Prime Meats is good, but I don't think it's on the same level. The room here is really nice. The wait staff is sometimes understaffed and always busy. But stop being so impatient. Unless they f*ck up your order or take an insane amount of time, don't complain. Such is life in a busy and popular restaurant. If you like French toast don't miss the killer peacan pie version they're slinging here.",4.0
"Overrated.This place got a lot of hype for its fried chicken/cheddar waffle and was a nymag pick a year ago, and I've given it a bunch of chances, but Buttermilk is a dime-a-dozen.They try, but often fail, on a number of dishes, including the croquets, the bacon (the level of done-ness has varied from essentially raw to crispy), the salads (bland), and (DARE I??) the chicken.  I don't know what it is, but twice I've ordered the chicken and been repulsed... something happens in their process that really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.However, as Sam Sifton noted, the duck meatloaf is superb and, for me, saves the menu.  I would recommend sitting at the bar and getting the meatloaf.  Everything else is underwhelming.  Service is friendly and attentive, we had reservations for New Years Eve and everything went smoothly when we got there at 10 pm.",3.0

"I listen to Frank Bruni, and I'm not ashamed. In the past, he had led me to some of my now favorite restaurants, and Buttermilk Channel is no exception. After reading his flattering review of B.C. in the Times, I figured it was time to venture beyond Frankie's on Court Street and give it a try. I was impressed. I will return.I love the fact the B.C. gives props to the neighborhood, featuring Caputo's mozzarella and Esposito's sausage on the menu. There is also a general focus on local, sustainable, etc. etc. Imbibed:A house cocktail with champagne and Amaro, sort of an herbal, more serious French 75. A nice aperitif. Local beers...nice selection.Consumed:Maple and Bacon roasted almonds - Addictive, delicious smokiness.House-made pickles - one of the best dill pickles I've ever had, crisp, fresh with a great bite at the end.Daily special of pork cheek schniztel - I was slightly disappointed with my entree which then made me envious of the burger and fried chicken being enjoyed at the table. Thankfully, my husband gave me one of the cheddar cheese waffles on his chicken plate and that made up for the inconsistencies of my dish, The schnitzel was underseasoned, as was the accompanying celery root puree. The pork cheek meat is richer that the chop that normally gets pounded into a schnitzel and thus needs an extra hit of salt and definitely some acid to balance the flavors. This dish was too ""one note"". Pecan Pie Sundae - At the behest of Mr. Bruni, I had to order this dessert. Ridiculous, even if it did put me over the edge. Really, decadent, comforting dessert at it's best. Sweet, salty, and memorable.",4.0

"Buttermilk Channel is on par with Grocery and Good Fork as another destination restaurant in Red Hook/Cobble Hill/Carroll Gardens (ReCoCa?).  In fact, we're lucky to have the stretch around Buttermilk include notable locations like Frankies and South Brooklyn Pizza.Reservations are not taken for parties of 4 or less.  We were informed of a 45 minute wait when we arrived at 8PM.  We were halfway through our first drink at Minibar when the maître de called and let us know that our table would be ready in 10 minutes. Those in line ahead of us decided to eat at the bar. They offer a separate vegetarian menu however we ordered from the main menu.  We started with skewers of mozzarella and basil, which was very good but difficult to split between 4 people, and the sweet potato and goat cheese croquette place, which was fantastic.  For appetizers, we sampled the apple and cauliflower soup, squash and ricotta tarts, and a plate of Rhode Island and Newfoundland oysters.  All were excellent.  The oysters came with an unusual vinegar and orange sauce, as well as some lemon slices.Main dishes included pasta cooked al dente with a sweet potato and pumpkin mash, duck meatloaf, trout and bacon with jonnycakes, and the fish special.  My pasta was fantastic as was the duck meatloaf. Dessert servings were large and better shared.  We ordered the delicious pecan pie which is layered with ice cream in a tall ice cream sundae glass.   Apple donuts were freshly made but a bit dry.  The chocolate bread pudding with orange was awesome. Midway through, the owner Doug came by our table to check on us.  We complemented him on a creative and excellent meal and really lovely setting.  Service by the waitstaff overall was attentive and extremely polite but seemed a little shaky on some minor details, e.g. mixing up who ordered each plate on two of our courses.We ordered a bottle of Claar Cellars cab/merlot blend which was one of the lower-priced bottles on the menu and very good.

"I'd waited a long time to come to Buttermilk, so my expectations were pretty high. Overall I was definitely not disappointed. We showed up on a Friday night and were told we had an hour and a half waiting ahead of us so we put our names down (as well as our phone number). We went to a nearby bar and got a call 45 minutes later letting us know our table was ready. Nice.We arrived and were thanked by several employees for, ""being kind enough to wait"". Pretty nice considering waiting is pretty expected at a place like this. I appreciated that a lot. Makes you feel like not just another number, but a customer that they care about making happy.We ordered a bunch of stuff to start out (bacon/maple almonds, cheese plate, mustard crusted bacon). It was all pretty good. I liked the blue cheese and the mustard bacon best. Thought the almonds were a bit overrated, though interesting.We both had the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, because really, what else would you have on your first visit? It was solid. Very well done fried chicken - crispy and flavorful without being greasy at all. It really was a sort of ""gourmet"" chicken and waffles.For dessert (of COURSE we had dessert...) we got a cookie plate and a root beer float to share. Both solid, though nothing spectacular about either one.I'd come back and get the chicken and waffles again. A nice experience overall - probably best for special occasions with people who like fun food but are looking for something kinda ""classy"" for the night.",4.0

"I visited Buttermilk Channel with a friend for brunch. We were seated pretty quickly though it was a Saturday during peak brunch time, and a gorgeous day.  Service was very pleasant and the food was pretty delicious.  I opted for Eggs Huntington and my friend ordered Short Rib Hash.  I finished everything on my plate and proceeded to dip into my friend's because he was talking more than eating.  A grand time was had by all, and I think it's safe to speak for all those in attendance.  It's a pretty energetic crowd; the place seems to visited by families with small children; just a heads up if you're looking for a romantic or quiet brunch (I really don't know if there are romantic brunches) or if you're generally annoyed by children.  But come for the food.  You may find yourself stuffing your face with dense, delicious biscuits, topped with salty, crunchy, meaty hash, sopping with egg yolk that drips down your chin.  The tables are also ""intimately"" arranged; you will be quite close to your neighbors.  During our brunch, the dining area was flooded with sunlight, making it very pleasant and bright.  Overall, I'll be back, but perhaps I'll come for dinner next time.",4.0

"I'd skip this  channel and find something with food that matches the hype. Or just doesn't have hype.I ate here last week with my friend. We split four things. The green tomato soup was fantastic. The best thing we ate all night, I thought. Fresh and simple and balanced with some cream and maybe shallots pureed in there? It was great. We got a second bowl when our waitress spilled half of my beer into the first serving.We also shared the baby turnips with honey. They were fine. A little too much liquid for my taste, but they were good. Not great.We split the much-lauded chicken and waffles. Here was the biggest disappointment of the night. It was just mediocre fried chicken, at best. The waffles were similarly boring, and there wasn't enough of them to truly act as a side to the (admittedly large portion of) fried chicken. This just was not a memorable entree.We finished by splitting the pecan pie sundae which was f-ing delicious. And filling. Can't tell you how much I enjoyed that sundae, and half of it was plenty.But this place just didn't have much charm for me. The walls are sterile, not minimal, and the space just felt too pre-fab for me to ever get comfortable. The service, even before the beer spill (which, frankly, wasn't a big deal, I've done that at tables too) felt impersonal and cold. But after she soiled the table her demeanor just felt more and more cold, like it was our doing.I don't  know. It's not  a bad place. I just don't think I'll be hurrying back, and I certainly think it's overhyped.",3.0

"BRUNCH REVIEW: I live right up the street from this place, so I've been wanting to stop by for some time now.  My cousins and I decided to drop in this past Sunday for brunch.  We opted for the no reservation approach-- mostly because we figured like most NYC brunch places, they didn't take reservations... we were wrong!  Score one for Buttermilk.We arrived around 11:30am on this rainy, dreary Sunday morning.  There was, predictably, a 45-minute-to-an-hour wait, plus everyone was smushed up inside the area immediately next to the door.  Not wanting to stand around for an hour, we left and wandered around the neighborhood for a bit.  They took our phone number down and said they'd call when our table opened up.  After about 45 minutes, we headed back to Buttermilk.  Unfortunately, due to weather/parking issues and reservations showing up late, our table still wasn't ready.  So we stood inside browsing the menus for another 15 minutes or so.  Right around then, I thought to myself, ""y'know, they have been very gracious and apologetic about the wait situation, but it'd be really nice if they offered us some complimentary drinks to tide us ove--""  And before I could complete my thought, along came the manager to apologize and offer us a free round of drinks/coffee.  Another point for Buttermilk.We finally were seated after a total of roughly an hour and half wait.  They sat us at the end of the communal table, which, given the ample amount of space afforded to each place setting at the table, I thought was actually pretty nice and added to the homey feel of the place.  We ordered some bloody marys (I got the Classic, my cousin got the Court Street garnished with antipasti from Caputo.  She won.), and our food.I ordered the Salmon Platter.  I have to say, the salmon was pretty great and the dish as a whole was very tasty.  I think because I had been waiting around for so long, it wasn't quite enough to fill me up.  It's a good thing my cousins had some leftovers...One cousin ordered the Short Rib Hash and the other ordered the Fried Pork Chops & Cheddar Waffles.  Both were very good (my mouth is starting to water just writing about them).  The Hash wasn't too salty (which is my complaint about a lot of hash) and the Pork Chops were very juicy and tender.  The Cheddar Waffles were a near-perfect combo of salty and sweet (with the syrup).  Outside of the crazy wait (note to self: make reservations next time), the brunch as a whole was very solid.  It didn't blow my mind, but it's definitely worth coming back for.  And, if nothing else, I'm really excited to try their dinner!",4.0

We showed up on a Friday night and were told we had an hour and a half waiting ahead of us so we put our names down (as well as our phone number). We went to a nearby bar and got a call 45 minutes later letting us know our table was ready. Nice.We arrived and were thanked by several employees for, ""being kind enough to wait"". Pretty nice considering waiting is pretty expected at a place like this. I appreciated that a lot. Makes you feel like not just another number, but a customer that they care about making happy.We ordered a bunch of stuff to start out (bacon/maple almonds, cheese plate, mustard crusted bacon). It was all pretty good. I liked the blue cheese and the mustard bacon best. Thought the almonds were a bit overrated, though interesting.We both had the fried chicken and cheddar waffles, because really, what else would you have on your first visit? It was solid. Very well done fried chicken - crispy and flavorful without being greasy at all. It really was a sort of ""gourmet"" chicken and waffles.For dessert (of COURSE we had dessert...) we got a cookie plate and a root beer float to share. Both solid, though nothing spectacular about either one.I'd come back and get the chicken and waffles again. A nice experience overall - probably best for special occasions with people who like fun food but are looking for something kinda ""classy"" for the night.",4.0
"incredibly scrumptious fare, and refreshingly good service. i mean, chicken and waffles, really? yup, really. jusssst get them. or get something else and then yelp about it, hard, so that i can have all the more reason to go back. for now, i will rest on my perfectly fried chicken, well seasoned cabbage slaw, balsamic glaze reduction laurels. with a kale salad tiara on top.",5.0
"I visited Buttermilk Channel with a friend for brunch. We were seated pretty quickly though it was a Saturday during peak brunch time, and a gorgeous day.  Service was very pleasant and the food was pretty delicious.  I opted for Eggs Huntington and my friend ordered Short Rib Hash.  I finished everything on my plate and proceeded to dip into my friend's because he was talking more than eating.  A grand time was had by all, and I think it's safe to speak for all those in attendance.  It's a pretty energetic crowd; the place seems to visited by families with small children; just a heads up if you're looking for a romantic or quiet brunch (I really don't know if there are romantic brunches) or if you're generally annoyed by children.  But come for the food.  You may find yourself stuffing your face with dense, delicious biscuits, topped with salty, crunchy, meaty hash, sopping with egg yolk that drips down your chin.  The tables are also ""intimately"" arranged; you will be quite close to your neighbors.  During our brunch, the dining area was flooded with sunlight, making it very pleasant and bright.  Overall, I'll be back, but perhaps I'll come for dinner next time.",4.0
Well after wanting to come here for over 6mths I finally made my way. It was definitely worth it. I had a late brunch so we avoided the crowd. The food was excellent and the prices were right. The service was a little slow but the food and company made it all worth it.,4.0
"I'd skip this  channel and find something with food that matches the hype. Or just doesn't have hype.I ate here last week with my friend. We split four things. The green tomato soup was fantastic. The best thing we ate all night, I thought. Fresh and simple and balanced with some cream and maybe shallots pureed in there? It was great. We got a second bowl when our waitress spilled half of my beer into the first serving.We also shared the baby turnips with honey. They were fine. A little too much liquid for my taste, but they were good. Not great.We split the much-lauded chicken and waffles. Here was the biggest disappointment of the night. It was just mediocre fried chicken, at best. The waffles were similarly boring, and there wasn't enough of them to truly act as a side to the (admittedly large portion of) fried chicken. This just was not a memorable entree.We finished by splitting the pecan pie sundae which was f-ing delicious. And filling. Can't tell you how much I enjoyed that sundae, and half of it was plenty.But this place just didn't have much charm for me. The walls are sterile, not minimal, and the space just felt too pre-fab for me to ever get comfortable. The service, even before the beer spill (which, frankly, wasn't a big deal, I've done that at tables too) felt impersonal and cold. But after she soiled the table her demeanor just felt more and more cold, like it was our doing.I don't  know. It's not  a bad place. I just don't think I'll be hurrying back, and I certainly think it's overhyped.",3.0
I went last night and enjoyed an amazing dinner made of bacon. Everything was reasonably priced and service was good. 1) MAPLE & BACON ROASTED ALMONDS2) DELICATA SQUASH TART3) BACON-WRAPPED BROOK TROUT4) DOUG'S PECAN PIE SUNDAE,5.0
The most incredible fried chicken ever! The sliced pickles and cheese waffles are great compliments and friendly service too!,5.0
"BRUNCH REVIEW: I live right up the street from this place, so I've been wanting to stop by for some time now.  My cousins and I decided to drop in this past Sunday for brunch.  We opted for the no reservation approach-- mostly because we figured like most NYC brunch places, they didn't take reservations... we were wrong!  Score one for Buttermilk.We arrived around 11:30am on this rainy, dreary Sunday morning.  There was, predictably, a 45-minute-to-an-hour wait, plus everyone was smushed up inside the area immediately next to the door.  Not wanting to stand around for an hour, we left and wandered around the neighborhood for a bit.  They took our phone number down and said they'd call when our table opened up.  After about 45 minutes, we headed back to Buttermilk.  Unfortunately, due to weather/parking issues and reservations showing up late, our table still wasn't ready.  So we stood inside browsing the menus for another 15 minutes or so.  Right around then, I thought to myself, ""y'know, they have been very gracious and apologetic about the wait situation, but it'd be really nice if they offered us some complimentary drinks to tide us ove--""  And before I could complete my thought, along came the manager to apologize and offer us a free round of drinks/coffee.  Another point for Buttermilk.We finally were seated after a total of roughly an hour and half wait.  They sat us at the end of the communal table, which, given the ample amount of space afforded to each place setting at the table, I thought was actually pretty nice and added to the homey feel of the place.  We ordered some bloody marys (I got the Classic, my cousin got the Court Street garnished with antipasti from Caputo.  She won.), and our food.I ordered the Salmon Platter.  I have to say, the salmon was pretty great and the dish as a whole was very tasty.  I think because I had been waiting around for so long, it wasn't quite enough to fill me up.  It's a good thing my cousins had some leftovers...One cousin ordered the Short Rib Hash and the other ordered the Fried Pork Chops & Cheddar Waffles.  Both were very good (my mouth is starting to water just writing about them).  The Hash wasn't too salty (which is my complaint about a lot of hash) and the Pork Chops were very juicy and tender.  The Cheddar Waffles were a near-perfect combo of salty and sweet (with the syrup).  Outside of the crazy wait (note to self: make reservations next time), the brunch as a whole was very solid.  It didn't blow my mind, but it's definitely worth coming back for.  And, if nothing else, I'm really excited to try their dinner!",4.0
"This is one of my fav Brooklyn places, with an updated Southern American cuisine. Returned on an early Thurs evening after not wanting to wait over an hour on Sunday nite.   I got the Thursday special -  Berkshire Pork - a tender shank of pork with mussels and clams in a spicy tomato broth. It was devine - the pork was extremely tender, while the pork skin was crispy. Interesting combo - shellfish and pork - but it works!  The cauliflower soup was a decadent cream based affair that was heavenly, as were the squash tarts.  The only miss was I ordered the brussel sprouts as a side and never got them.  The waitress apologized profusely, but wish I had tried them. Atmosphere and service are a plus.  I am definitely returning. I am told the fried chicken and cheddar waffles are the star so I will try them the next time. Note: no reservations policy for groups under 6.",4.0
"From the very rude hostess to the mute bartenders who never uttered a sentence to me the entire time I seated in their section at the bar, the horrible service ruined my first and last experience at this restaurant.  I don't think the hostess saying ""yeah yeah, whatever"" and turning your back to a customer while they are speaking to is very professional or inviting!My meal was just ok and with so many other awesome restaurants (Prime Meats, Wing Bar, Clover Club, Frankies, Henry Republic) in the Carroll Gardens/Cobble Hill area (which I've lived in for 3.5 years), I don't feel like I am missing out if I never ate at this restaurant again.",1.0
"Sunday brunch is yummy! I had the eggs benedict, but they call it something else. Hamilton maybe. I don't like ham so I substituted bacon instead. It was great. Biscuits could have been more moist but the hollandaise helped with that problem. The manfriend had the short rib hash. Also good, but I think there's something about short rib that isn't appealing to me. He loved it, though. The one thing I did not get to try-their bloody marys. They claimed they couldn't sell alcohol till noon, and a virgin just didn't sound as good. I don't remember this alcohol law, though. Not sure what the deal was.",4.0
"""They could've served me brunch in the bathroom, and I would totally have loved it.""Strange, yes, but allow me to explain.  My friends and I arrived at Buttermilk Channel on a sunny Sunday afternoon, at precisely 12:20 pm.  The wait, we were told, for a party of three would be about 15 minutes.  We stepped outside to wait, but almost immediately were called back in.  Apparently, the party before us needed a high-top chair for their baby and the only empty table couldn't accomodate it, so we were seated rather quickly.  [Another note on the wait:  As we had our brunch, I had my back to the front, but my friend noted that the wait was getting considerably longer]The atmosphere was warm; the decor aesthetically pleasing.  Wholesome white walls, exposed brick (with a tiny cow hidden in a little pocket in the wall), hardwood floors, etc.  The whole place had a very New-England-Bed-and-Breakfast feel to it.  Cozy and simple.  Our server, Doug, was a little busy but charming, good-humored, and as attentive as possible.  He came to refill our coffees three times throughout the meal, and when there was a tiny mix-up in the kitchen with one of our plates, he caught the mistake and immediately took care of it.The FOOD!  I ordered the Esposito hot sausage, peppers and onion scramble.  The scrambles ($10) are served in a little bowl on a platter with toast, a hash brown patty, and mixed green salad.  The hot sausage scramble was actually surprisingly spicy (not unbearably, but noticeably).  The hash brown and salad were great - the salad had a very light vinagrette dressing on it.   I also ordered a cheddar waffle on the side ($4) because I read such good things about it on Yelp.  It was.  DELICIOUS.  I very much recommend trying one.My friends ordered the mushroom scramble, the pecan french toast, and a side of the breakfast sausage.  I think the mushroom scramble was fine.  The pecan french toast looked amazing, although the portion was a teensy bit on the smaller side.  I'm not sure how much french toast a person could eat, though.  I'm not much for the sweet breakfast foods.  The breakfast sausage side looked like they were homemade.The entire meal was incredibly affordable.  Brunch comes with a complimentary choice of coffee or tea AND mimosa, bloody mary, or juice.   So for a total of $14 dollars, I had the scramble, a side, coffee (endless), and a mimosa.  It was the perfect brunch.After the meal, I popped into the bathroom.  [Does anyone else think that you can truly gauge a restaurant's merits by the state of its bathroom?]  Um, forgive me if this is a strange recommendation to make, but... I think you should check out the bathroom.  In addition to the usual, there is a white bureau with a silver tray, which bears a pitcher with fresh tulips (gorgeous) and candles.  The entire bathroom is candlelit, and the mixed scent of candles and tulips... *happy sigh*No complaints.  Completely happy.  :)  Enjoy!",5.0

"I think Buttermilk Channel is going to fall into that realm for me where I think its a great place but possibly not enough so that I will trek back to Brooklyn just to eat here.

I don't even know how to describe them - they seem to be half beignet (sp?), half potato roll. The drinks menu is good and although I didn't order wine, the stuff they had was reasonably priced and quite good. The food was pretty fantastic and their hostess was really good to our group despite the wait. Quite frankly, call out there 2 hours prior to arrival and put your name on the list. Waiting even an hour or so before may already be too late...I saw a couple get seated from where they were having drinks at the bar and, as they were headed to their table, the guy turns to the hostess and says, with not a small amount of passive-aggression, ""that really was an hour and a half"".

"When I walked in I was greeted by Buttermilk Channel's owner, Jerry Seinfeld. Sorry, a look alike. He had the teeth, the hair, and the sweater, but since I adore Seinfeld all of this was vrey endearing.He led me to my table while I waited for my two girlfriends to arrive, and even though they were both about a half hour late, I was treated very kindly by my waiter. He had a genuine answer for all of my questions, especially when it came to cocktails.I ended uo getting a hot toddy - excellent but cooled quickly. When my friends finally arrived, we decided on what to order, all the while feeling the warmth of the service and the candles (oh, and the alcohol.) We began with housemade pickles (great - not too sweet,) and sweet potato croquettes with goat cheese dressing. These were like little fried truffles; knowing there'd be more food to come I abstained from going beyond a single ball.Then our real appetizers came. My friend had the cauliflower soup with apple - very good and creamy but too little! I had the endive salad which tasted little like its namesake anchovy dressing, but it made me feel relatively healthy. The winner was the delicata squash tart with ricotta...despite the fact that my friend ordered it, we all devoured it like a pack of hungry wolves. Definitely order it. Entrees were slightly more hit/miss, and very meat heavy. I had the buttermilk fried chicken, which was super crispy and moist, over a cheddar waffle sweetened with powdered sugar. To add to the sweet savory elements, maple balsamic dressing acted as a perfect dip. The buger, topped with onions, cheddar, pickles, and ketchup and mayo, was also really good, but this is coming from someone who has abstained from burgers for years despite her secret love for them. It comes with fries, which I did not try due to my general dislike of them. The ""miss"" of the night was the breaded hake. It came on a really nice kale stew with bacon 'n stuff, but the inside was raw! Too thick to be sashimi. Our waiter was very gracious though, and took it back to get us a new, freshly cooked one. Now, keep in mind that this dinner has been going on for a few hours by now due to our talkative nature. But we finally settled on desserts and got three to share. My favorite was the pecan pie sundae. Really that's all it is: pecan pie with ice cream and whipped cream in a parfait glass. Every bite was a corn syrup feast for the tongue. The carmelized chocolate bread pudding was good, but it was made better by the citrus cream on top. Added an extra dimension. My relatively least favorite was the dish of warm oatmeal raisin cookies. They were great, but not something I'd order when I could easily make them myself. After our dinner had concluded, the owner offered to call a car service to whisk us away to our abodes. We were also told to come back again soon; as you can see the niceness seeps into all the cracks.Another point of interest: if you don't like talking to complete strangers, you will probably feel uncomfortable when not one, not two, but three different people strike up a conversation with you on the line for the bathroom. Not just ""nice restaurant, eh?"" but a deep discussion of the food and ambience. You've been warned, but I personally was charmed. Sure the name is wacky but the food is overall delicious and a real treat. I'll be back.",4.0

"Sat at the bar and had dinner. I had the bacon-wrapped trout, which comes with grits and ""mustardy"" mustard greens (Dijon sauce, but ""mustardy"" is fun to say). The trout was tender and flaky and the bacon was crisp. I'm generally a pro-leafy greens person, so I loved the ""mustardy"" mustard greens. I even liked the grits, which were creamy and polenta-like. My fiance had the fried chicken. The skin was super-crisp. It might be a little too browned for some people's taste, but I was impressed with the level of crispness and the juiciness of the chicken within. I know that's a tough balance to hit, so it shows that the kitchen knows what they're doing.The people sitting next to us at the bar were working through the snacks and small plates. What I saw looked and smelled great. I definitely want to try the flatbread with ramps, the pickles, maybe some baked (broiled?) oysters.The room is very simple, but still warm and elegant feeling.

My god the Pancakes, Bacon and home fries platter I got was PERFECTLY made, everything was light, tasty and crispy, my god I was full and wanted to drool and force more food down. I observed a few people drinking at the bar and there cocktail concotions looked amazing, ill definitely be going back soon.",5.0
Went to Buttermilk Channel for brunch on Mother's Day.  I expected a line based on previous reviews I read but still hoped it would be worth the wait like everyone said.  Well we got there at 10:07am (they open at 10am) and the line was half way down the block.  The good thing is that the line moved fairly quickly & because there were only two of us we were able to be seated right away.  I would definitely recommend the Pecan Pie French toast - oh so DELICIOUS!!!!! Also the short rib hash was FANTASTIC nothing like I ever tasted....and the eggs.....I have never had restaurant eggs that I didn't have to add salt & pepper too until coming here.  They were the best eggs I ever had.  On top of all of this the service was great an very efficient.  We also didn't feel rushed or pressured to eat & run because of the crowd.  I cant wait to go back and try the fried pork chop and cheddar waffle.,5.0
"I went here for brunch on Sunday with a large group and this place is as advertised. Great service, perfectly cooked food, even a bit of innovation (the cheddar waffles and beef hash were awesome).

"Had a relatively lovely dinner here--service was a bit slow and we spent waaay too much money on watered down cocktails, but the food was solid. The maple bacon almonds were delicious, as was the simple apple-arugula salad. I wasn't starving so I ordered the squash tart for my main course, along with a side of bacon from the charcuterie. The mustard grill on the bacon was delicious, but the cut was a little fattier/thicker than I generally like. Sometimes I think the word ""bacon"" is thrown around too liberally. But I digress. The squash tart was good, but the ricotta lacked that heavenly flavor that you sometimes come across. Not the end of the world. My friend enjoyed her mussels. I think it was just a case of not ordering entirely correctly. Either way, I'd definitely go back--for brunch, for fried chicken, etc.",3.0
"Overall verdict: not bad for fancy pants.The spare ribs are absolutely incredible. Falls off the bone, sweet and with a slight hint of pepper. The chicken and waffles were interesting; the waffles have a cheddar flavoring that's very neat, and the chicken was pretty good. Slaw was...slaw. A fancy slaw, but still just slaw.The fish was reported as being excellent, and all the greens were very fresh.

"Very reasonably priced, generous portions, and delicious food. Had the pecan french toast which was amazing. Not too sweet but very flavorful.

Between the two of us we shared Esposito's hot sausage peppers and onions scramble, Buttermilk biscuits, Pecan pie french toast and a Jelly donut. Brunch comes with Mimosas or OJ.

"Sat at the bar and had dinner. I had the bacon-wrapped trout, which comes with grits and ""mustardy"" mustard greens (Dijon sauce, but ""mustardy"" is fun to say). The trout was tender and flaky and the bacon was crisp. I'm generally a pro-leafy greens person, so I loved the ""mustardy"" mustard greens. I even liked the grits, which were creamy and polenta-like. My fiance had the fried chicken. The skin was super-crisp. It might be a little too browned for some people's taste, but I was impressed with the level of crispness and the juiciness of the chicken within. I know that's a tough balance to hit, so it shows that the kitchen knows what they're doing.The people sitting next to us at the bar were working through the snacks and small plates. What I saw looked and smelled great. I definitely want to try the flatbread with ramps, the pickles, maybe some baked (broiled?) oysters.The room is very simple, but still warm and elegant feeling. The bartenders seemed to know their stuff and made good suggestions of cocktails and etc. The place seems to be consistently busy, especially for the relatively quieter part of Carroll Gardens it's in.",4.0

Enjoyed a leisurely Sunday brunch with the BFFs at this hopping local hot-spot. A latte got us through the 40 min wait. Nice decor and friendly staff. Tried the short rib hash..yummy!! I loved every bite! The cheddar waffles were excellent and my BFF enjoyed the fried pork chop & waffles. Will definitely return to try their regular menu items.,4.0
"Warm, friendly atmosphere. Very welcoming. A great combination of a local place and a really nice evening out. The menu is so terrific that you have to go back multiple times. I started with the Mixed Greens, and then had the Wednesday special of Schnitzel. It was perfectly crisp, and yet the Veal chop stayed juicy. We had a terrific Long Island Pauanok, Festival Red. Delicious. It was a perfect complement to our meal. We finished with the Donuts (a little dry) and the delightful Pecan Pie Sundae. That in and of itself is worth going returning for. I highly recommend Buttermilk Channel.",4.0
"I have only gone there for dinner. Half of the time I sit at the bar with or without company, half of the time I sit at a table. I have enjoyed every meal. I still love getting that popover to start with. On rare occasions, the food has taken too long to come out of the kitchen but overall the timing has been good and I do not go there if I am in a rush.  My favorite dish is the parsley crusted hake. It's moist, tasty,with a fabulously vinegary and complex light sauce. The dining room wait staff is excellent and well informed.The hostesses ( especially the one with dark hair and glasses ) are charming and welcoming.I took one star away because the bar staff could be more congenial. They need to be friendly to everyone, not just people they know ......The very young looking bartender last Tuesday did not know  how to describe dishes very well nor how they were prepared but maybe he is a newbie and there is hope for improvement.

I loved it!!  I definitely have to go back when they change the menu because it's seasonal.  I had the trout with grits and I was in love.  The portions are quite large for the entrees.  I also had the house made bacon with mustard.  Unbelievable!!  I'm still thinking about it.  Service was wonderful and the coffee was great.  They use Gimme Coffee.,4.0

"I'm surprised at these reviews. I wanted to like this place, but I just didn't think the food was very good. We had the hush puppies, fried chicken, and pasta.

"Went here for brunch on a Sunday, after reading reviews on Yelp and getting a very enthusiastic recommendation from my roommate.

"Update: 2/20/2010Last night we ventured to Buttermilk after getting hour long waits at Frankies and Prime Meats.  Boy did we make a good decision.  Again, Jennifer, the lovely hostess at the front was more than accommodating and gracious- we sat at the bar for dinner.  I really feel like something has changed here, the energy was different and the food was spot on.  We started off with the baby back ribs - a dry rub, scented with tarragon and served with a simple slaw.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  Vegetable tart was ridiculously buttery and very tasty as well as the bacon.  For the main course we had the Skirt steak cooked to the chef's liking (always do this folks) as well as the fried chicken and cheddar waffles. Simply divine take on the Southern classic and incredibly delicious.  How could we walk away without having a couple of desserts? We had the Pecan pie sundae; I believe I got one bite in before my comrades finished it off.  As well as the Bread pudding - you won't be able to stop eating this.The staff, the food, the scene (jason schwartzman was there) was fabulous. We could definitely call this a regular spot for us. Original Review:(Summer 2009)Buttermilk Channel - for some reason, the name makes me think of a viscous-sour-yellowish river with fried chicken floating down... but I am from the south, so of COURSE i'll think of fried chicken, or buttermilk biscuits... ok, enough of the diatribe!  Since we're new to the neighborhood, the top of the list is to find the best food haunts and I read some good reviews on this place. Unlike my interpretation of the name, the place is named after the real Buttermilk Channel en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu… - so, i'm not too far off in my imagination!  The crowd is definitely a mix of people grabbing grub after a day of work to young hipsters with kids and then the yuppy crowd too.  I tried one of their Signature cocktails; the blackberry something of the other - take my suggestion and skip this one; it's bland and boring.  The hostess was amazing and got us in an hour early, it might have something to do with that we figured out we have the same last name, but regardless, she was super friendly!  The menu is simple, american fare with lots of local grub from Caputos up the street.  I opted for the Mozz with bread and pesto - it's.. boring and the bread is larger than the mozz - so , skip this.  My husband had a green salad with dandelion greens and beautiful turnips - a great summer choice.  For dinner, husband ordered the bacon wrapped trout and I had the Beef.  It was SOLID good food, not overwhelming portions but after a couple of glasses of wine, set us back a good $100.00 or so.  I'm not really sure the food constitutes paying $100, but you could tell that BC uses great ingredients and they pay attention to the food, which in my opinion is a MUST.  SO, will we go back? Yes, we'll try the brunch one of these days - but the price range definitely makes this a non-regular haunt for us.",5.0
"A friend suggested we go here for dinner and my first thoughts where:- that name is a turn off- another locavore place? blah!I went for dinner, not super excited. Thankfully, it was really, really, really good. Flavorful and light local fare, and the bacon wrapped trout was so perfectly cooked i could have eaten three portions. The bratwurst was also a hit. The waitstaff were super competent and the kitchen was very accommodating when we asked for a slightly custom order. If I lived closer I would make it a regular place.As for the name - after you hear the story behind the name (look it up on their website) it becomes quite charming, but I wish they'd dropp the ""channel"" part.",4.0
"Who's not open on saturday? Buttermilk channel thats who. and THAT'S ridiculous.overall: QUESTIONABLE EXPERIENCE. The place comes off as upscale with its minimalist decor, napkin folding staff, and the khaki/buttoned up crowd.Our waitress smelled of contempt, sarcastically answering my request for suggestions, avoiding eye contact and being curt while taking our order. Two sneering waiters huddled by the computer admiring patrons with disdain.A masterful orchestration while either the host or manager were busy. The food: Bland, Mildly disappointing. Our dishes were well executed but with no flair. the biscuits were too dense, the plate basic. very basic.on the positive side, the host was very nice and accommodating, and the check came fast. i'm not sure we even asked for it.Great for dry conversation with minimalists.",2.0
"I remember going to a wedding where the groom's vows included how the bride had once described this delicious chicken dish was, ""...if chickens knew how good they were, they'd be eating it too!"".  That's what I think when I enjoy perfectly seasoned and lightly fried chicken.  Nothing where you feel like you've ingested a pound of crisco.  Buttermilk did a moistabulous job in insuring the chicken had its juice drizzling after each bite.  The taste was a little light.  I was a bit confused with the sauce that came with the chicken and cheddar cheese waffles.  Was it for the chicken or the waffle?For those who don't have the love affair with fried chicken, you can have just as much affection for the delicata squash tart.  Not only was the crust a perfect butter crisp but the ricotta was exquisite.  A tiny tart went a long way with the taste buds.And how clever of them to come up with a pecan pie sundae?  Layers of pecan pie topping in between blue marble vanilla ice cream.  The oatmeal cookies were mediocre.  And it comes in fours.  We were told three. It's a great space that welcomed us on a bone-chilling Sunday evening.",4.0
"In Love with this place. It is my happy place. Second time to dine in the past two weeks (1st for brunch, 2nd for dinner). Had a reservation for 8pm on Monday night (a very busy night because of the fab deal). Table wasn't quite ready at 8 so we waiting outside with multiple servers bringing us cocktails. Right as we were seated at 8:20pm, we were served two rounds of housemade pickles and cornbread as an apology for the delay in being seated. So not necessary, but so wonderful! Food is incredible - $25 deal on Monday's is pretty fantastic.Very fun atmosphere and great service.I'd say the only downside is the single bathroom. But not worthy of reducing to 4 star.",5.0

"Update: 2/20/2010Last night we ventured to Buttermilk after getting hour long waits at Frankies and Prime Meats.  Boy did we make a good decision.  Again, Jennifer, the lovely hostess at the front was more than accommodating and gracious- we sat at the bar for dinner.  I really feel like something has changed here, the energy was different and the food was spot on.  We started off with the baby back ribs - a dry rub, scented with tarragon and served with a simple slaw.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  Vegetable tart was ridiculously buttery and very tasty as well as the bacon.  For the main course we had the Skirt steak cooked to the chef's liking (always do this folks) as well as the fried chicken and cheddar waffles. Simply divine take on the Southern classic and incredibly delicious.  How could we walk away without having a couple of desserts? We had the Pecan pie sundae; I believe I got one bite in before my comrades finished it off.  As well as the Bread pudding - you won't be able to stop eating this.The staff, the food, the scene (jason schwartzman was there) was fabulous. We could definitely call this a regular spot for us. Original Review:(Summer 2009)Buttermilk Channel - for some reason, the name makes me think of a viscous-sour-yellowish river with fried chicken floating down... but I am from the south, so of COURSE i'll think of fried chicken, or buttermilk biscuits... ok, enough of the diatribe!  Since we're new to the neighborhood, the top of the list is to find the best food haunts and I read some good reviews on this place. Unlike my interpretation of the name, the place is named after the real Buttermilk Channel en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu… - so, i'm not too far off in my imagination!  The crowd is definitely a mix of people grabbing grub after a day of work to young hipsters with kids and then the yuppy crowd too.  I tried one of their Signature cocktails; the blackberry something of the other - take my suggestion and skip this one; it's bland and boring.  The hostess was amazing and got us in an hour early, it might have something to do with that we figured out we have the same last name, but regardless, she was super friendly!  The menu is simple, american fare with lots of local grub from Caputos up the street.  I opted for the Mozz with bread and pesto - it's.. boring and the bread is larger than the mozz - so , skip this.  My husband had a green salad with dandelion greens and beautiful turnips - a great summer choice.  For dinner, husband ordered the bacon wrapped trout and I had the Beef.  It was SOLID good food, not overwhelming portions but after a couple of glasses of wine, set us back a good $100.00 or so.  I'm not really sure the food constitutes paying $100, but you could tell that BC uses great ingredients and they pay attention to the food, which in my opinion is a MUST.  SO, will we go back? Yes, we'll try the brunch one of these days - but the price range definitely makes this a non-regular haunt for us.",5.0
"A friend suggested we go here for dinner and my first thoughts where:- that name is a turn off- another locavore place? blah!I went for dinner, not super excited. Thankfully, it was really, really, really good. Flavorful and light local fare, and the bacon wrapped trout was so perfectly cooked i could have eaten three portions. The bratwurst was also a hit. The waitstaff were super competent and the kitchen was very accommodating when we asked for a slightly custom order. If I lived closer I would make it a regular place.As for the name - after you hear the story behind the name (look it up on their website) it becomes quite charming, but I wish they'd dropp the ""channel"" part.",4.0
"Who's not open on saturday? Buttermilk channel thats who. and THAT'S ridiculous.overall: QUESTIONABLE EXPERIENCE. The place comes off as upscale with its minimalist decor, napkin folding staff, and the khaki/buttoned up crowd.Our waitress smelled of contempt, sarcastically answering my request for suggestions, avoiding eye contact and being curt while taking our order. Two sneering waiters huddled by the computer admiring patrons with disdain.A masterful orchestration while either the host or manager were busy. The food: Bland, Mildly disappointing. Our dishes were well executed but with no flair. the biscuits were too dense, the plate basic. very basic.on the positive side, the host was very nice and accommodating, and the check came fast. i'm not sure we even asked for it.Great for dry conversation with minimalists.",2.0
"I remember going to a wedding where the groom's vows included how the bride had once described this delicious chicken dish was, ""...if chickens knew how good they were, they'd be eating it too!"".  That's what I think when I enjoy perfectly seasoned and lightly fried chicken.  Nothing where you feel like you've ingested a pound of crisco.  Buttermilk did a moistabulous job in insuring the chicken had its juice drizzling after each bite.  The taste was a little light.  I was a bit confused with the sauce that came with the chicken and cheddar cheese waffles.  Was it for the chicken or the waffle?For those who don't have the love affair with fried chicken, you can have just as much affection for the delicata squash tart.  Not only was the crust a perfect butter crisp but the ricotta was exquisite.  A tiny tart went a long way with the taste buds.And how clever of them to come up with a pecan pie sundae?  Layers of pecan pie topping in between blue marble vanilla ice cream.  The oatmeal cookies were mediocre.  And it comes in fours.  We were told three. It's a great space that welcomed us on a bone-chilling Sunday evening.",4.0
"In Love with this place. It is my happy place. Second time to dine in the past two weeks (1st for brunch, 2nd for dinner). Had a reservation for 8pm on Monday night (a very busy night because of the fab deal). Table wasn't quite ready at 8 so we waiting outside with multiple servers bringing us cocktails. Right as we were seated at 8:20pm, we were served two rounds of housemade pickles and cornbread as an apology for the delay in being seated. So not necessary, but so wonderful! Food is incredible - $25 deal on Monday's is pretty fantastic.Very fun atmosphere and great service.I'd say the only downside is the single bathroom. But not worthy of reducing to 4 star.",5.0
"Pecan Pie French Toast is to die for.  Pancakes were yummy too and hashbrowns were good.  Went on a Saturday at noon and there was a 40 minute wait, but they call you on your cell when your table is ready, which is great.  At least you're not forced to stay in front of the restaurant.",4.0
Had an excellent brunch here today.  The pecan maple French toast with hash browns and a side of housemade sausage.  Loved the hash browns. Liked the sausage.  Really enjoyed their plating for the French toast. Whipped butter on the side. The French Toast was cut almost like two slices of pie. Drizzled with pecans and syrup. Beautiful.Service was good. Interior is minimal and clean.  Loved their bar and whatever use of light they can get in this part of Brooklyn where that can be challenging because everything is rectangle shaped with windows in the front.Will absolutely be back for dinner and other brunch adventures.,4.0
"I went for brunch with my mom and we waited for an hour - everyone did but it was worth the wait because this is the place with the best pancakes I've ever had in my entire life. They were absolutely perfect, delicious, sweet, fluffy - divine. And brunch came with choice of mimosa, bellini, juice, or sparkling wine. A meal per person was $11.50 which is a huge bargain especially for such incredible food. Also got the coffee cake which was amazing and unlike any coffee cake I've had before. I highly suggest this place for brunch and I'd like to come back for what sounds like a great place for dinner too.",4.0
"First, I have take say what an amazing addition this has been to the neighborhood.  From the moment I saw it under construction and the intention going into the atmosphere I was looking forward to stopping in.  Well it's been far too long since they opened and I final went in for dinner.No wait (we got there around 5:45 on a Monday). We all (3 top) jumped on the buttermilk fried chicken, two soups and a salad and the pecan desert.  The salad was fresh and carefully put together, the soup was wonderful proving the basics.  The desert was more than just ice cream and sugar in a fancy dish, the chef put some thought and time into prepping the pecans & cream.  The buttermilk fried chicken seemed to be the obvious choice as a namesake, but not so much. The pieces were small but we all received a good portion. The meat was very juicy and hot. The breading was the problem, a bit too crunchy and dry.  However clean with good flavor. I'd go back and try again, maybe it was just a busy moment and it stayed in a bit too long.The service was great. Not nearly as pretentious as I expected. Perfect neighborhood feel with a fine dining atmosphere. The owner stopping by to check on us when leaving was a welcome punctuation to an already great experience.",4.0
"First, the good. The atmosphere here is lovely. It's not too loud, the lighting is perfect, the tables are spaced well enough that you don't overhear every conversation, and the location is good. It's very comfortable. But that's where the pleasantness ends. Everything about my meal was wrong. The waitress took forever to come to the table, and not because she was busy. She was hanging out by the bar, chatting. When she finally brought my companion's wine to the table, it was ALREADY POURED, and she didn't wait to make sure it was okay. She just plopped it down and left. We were never offered a second drink either. That is messed up. And. . .  the food was mediocre. I know, I know, we didn't order the chicken. But it is acceptable for only one thing on a menu to be good? Really? My pasta was soggy and limp, way beyond al dente. And bland. My companion's meat was overdone. The pickles were good, but that was the highlight. Pickles.",2.0

"A lovely restaurant.  I'd describe it as old New American. They take classics like meatloaf, fried chicken, grilled sausages, creamed spinach, fish, and present it in a way similar to what you'd see at Chestnut on Smith Street or Applewood in Park Slope.The sweet potato/goat cheese croquettes are yummy, as are the home made pickles.  Amazing trout wrapped in bacon, and the broiled chicken looks and smells fabulous (from the table next to us)An impressive wine list with a lot of prize winners from Finger Lake and L.I. wineries.  I'm impressed that they have Herman Weimer Riesling (though not by the glass), though they do have Dr. Frank by the glass, which is good, but not as good as Weimer. A great dessert selection.  The room is pleasant.Mangement:  If you're reading this, I'll up you a star for Weimer by the glass and if you put a curtain by the door during the winter. I was the second table in and every time someone came or left, we got an arctic blast.I'll be back soon.",5.0

"Food is very yummy. The prefix has some nice selections off the main menu. I ordered the green tomato soup to start, which I thought was interesting and the little grilled cheese that goes with it hit the spot. Another dinner pal thought it was too acidic. I had the pasta- texture was nice but the pieces were a bit disjointed. Couldn't really get all the components in one bite...I guess that is the nature of peas. Could have used more pecorino. Heard the fried chicken was slamming as well as the brook trout. Pecan pie sundae made me smile. Also ordered the pickles, flat bread and chicken liver mousse off the main menu to share with the table. All very tasty. Biggest complaint is with the first server we had. She was incredibly indifferent and almost seemed put off if you had any questions. For example, she seemed very annoyed that after everyone ordered their food we added the three things that we wanted to share to have at the beginning. She never told us that she was leaving/finishing her shift so we had a second server for the rest of our meal who was lovely. The manager was also helpful with the wine selection.",4.0

The brunch menu looks outstanding and the Monday menu deal outtasight and could serve as a perfect epicurean complement to a special event. My only complaint about this place is the interminable wait. If you don't arrive at opening get ready to wait over 2 hours, even at 10 o'clock we had a cruel hour delay before tucking into the grilled kale and endive salad with anchovy dressing, soft boiled egg, astonishingly good croutons - a robust and refreshing starter.

Super friendly and prompt service. Cozy and upscale feeling. Con[ish]s: Saturday night at 7pm, 1.5 hour wait. Make reservations!My sister and I dined here as I insisted on trying the Fried Chicken and cheddar waffle after reading a favorable review of this dish in a recent issue of TONY. I've experienced the not so glam chicken & waffles (which I love) and wondered what the gourmet version might compare. I must say I was disappointed. The helping was hardy, but the chicken coating lacked flavor and both of ours came slightly over cooked/a little crispier than desired. The waffle looked good and was an adequate accompaniment but I could not taste the cheddar at all. The slaw had a distinct taste of mayo which is also disappointing.",4.0
"I think this is one of the best places I had brunch in a while.  The food quality, service and decor was very good.  I think they use organic ingredients for most of their dishes.I had the burger and fries. The meat and bun was very good for a hamburger.  My wife had the lamb salad which was very good, unfortunately I am not a big fan of lamb but I can tell it was made well. I was most impressed by their pancakes.  I think it was best tasting pancakes I have ever had.Overall I would definitely go back for brunch and dinner.  I think we will go back for dinner and try the fried chicken.  I have a feeling it will be very good.",5.0

"I have been to Buttermilk Channel many times, and it is always fabulous.  The atmosphere is very laid back, and the service is friendly.  Unfortunately they only take reservations for parties of five or more.  If you show up on a Friday or Saturday without a reservation, be prepared to wait.  The wine and drink list are great and the food is phenomenal. The house made pickles, the cheese platter and the chilled oysters are some of our favorite appetizers.  The honey-drizzled popovers they bring to the table are warm and delicious.   My husband always has the fried chicken, which is beyond amazing, as is the waffle and balsamic-infused maple syrup that accompany it.  I usually have the Friday pasta with lobster special, which you can sometimes find on a Saturday night, as well.  The desserts are always outstanding.  I truly feel that this restaurant lives up to the hype.  Can't wait for our next meal here.",5.0
"Ah Buttermilk Channel. I've been meaning to visit you for SO long. Ever since I read the rave reviews in countless magazines and blogs and then found out that an old friend who I grew up going to summer camp with is the owner, I've been meaning to get there. It took me way too long to finally go and when the 3rd annual random friends brunch came around (a little party I throw every year where I post an open invite on my facebook wall and the first 10 to respond join me in the fun) I thought this was the perfect pick.When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by Doug's (the owner) awesome wife and drink orders were taken while they got our table ready. My spicy bloody mary, complete with a homemade pickle spear, hit the spot. I LOVE horseradish, and this drink was bold and flavorful with a serious kick to it. The pickle was a cute, creative touch, so much more interesting than the typical piece of celery.When we were seated, Doug was kind enough to send over some snacks to munch on while we drank, got acquainted, and looked over the menu. As you can see by my first picture, we were hungry. We chowed down on the treats way too quickly for me to remember to snap a picture. What you see there are the remnants of homemade pickles, walnut coffee cake and these incredible maple, bacon almonds that I seriously would have eaten all of if I wasn't supposed to share with the others. Deeeeelicious.The menu is a bit quirky, totally comfort-food oriented, and what I'd call down-home-creative. The big hit at the table were the pork chops over cheddar waffles, but everyone enjoyed their own meals as well. I shared the mushroom, spinach, goat cheese scramble and the pecan french toast. The scramble was awesome, especially the many different kinds of mushrooms, and I really enjoyed it. The salad and toast that came with it rounded out the meal nicely, but the little potato pancake was a bit on the greasy side for my taste. Very crunchy and hot though, and I'd imagine that people who didn't grow up in Jewish families who make outstanding potato latkes would probably have loved it. The pecan pie french toast has been talked about on almost every review I've read so I felt like we had to try it. It was VERY sweet, made with fresh, delicious, thick-cut bread and served with a scoop of fluffy whipped cream or marscapone, or maybe whipped ricotta (oops, I forgot to ask) and covered with bourbon, molasses pecans. This dish WAS delicious, but I would really put it into a dessert category instead of a main course. I happen to have a pretty serious sweet tooth, and this was even a little too much for me.The overall vibe of Buttermilk Channel couldn't be more perfect. Hip, without being at all pretentious. Trendy, but also very chill. Relaxed, comfortable, warm, and the kind of place that locals must adore meeting at every Sunday. It's a bit off the beaten path for me- over an hour to get there, but even so, I will probably be back. Many thanks to Doug for making this event super special, taking such good care of us, and welcoming us into his second home.",4.0

"I'm so thrilled with this restaurant. My sister recommended this place (she is a foodie), I let her go to town on the menu and we didn't regret it.  Everything we ordered from cocktails to dessert (and we almost ordered everything) was fantastic. The wait was around an hour but well worth it. The wait staff was phenomenal, he was attentive yet not intrusive. Very knowledgeable and friendly. We never give five stars!!!!!!!",5.0

"Went for brunch on a Sunday. The fried pork chop & cheddar waffles with maple syrup was amazing.  The 'chop was coated in a thick, crunchy buttermilk breading and the waffles had a hearty flavor greatly enhanced by the cheese.  I also had some plump little breakfast sausage patties w/ dried pear on the side.  Really looking forward to a dinnertime visit.  Beware the crowds though, brunch was an hour wait for a table and no reservations for parties under 5 (so we ate at the bar).  The place was packed to the gills at 1:00pm on Sunday.Super friendly and helpful staff.

"Went for brunch this afternoon and it was GREAT! Staff is friendly, kind, helpful and very accommodating. The hostess met us on the sidewalk and was so casual and friendly that I thought she was a patron waiting for a table. The manager/owner person talked to us for a bit and came to take a drink order right away.Btw, the drinks are lovely, inventive and carefully made. The brunch prices are super reasonable and are accompanied by juice or tea and i believe a drink (unless ours were comped by the lovely person we spoke with). The brunch is classic with a little comfort food twist... I saw the porkchop and cheddar waffles and will order it next time!The pancakes are special, order a short stack to share or pecan french toast for the table in addition to your meal. I ordered the short ribs hash and it was a real delight. The hash was delicately spiced and tender with two sunny side up eggs that were perfectly soft and had slightly crispy edges.  Hubby ordered the Benedict (which was called something else), it was served on a real buttery homemade biscuit with thick cut ham that was tender juicy and out of this world. The hollandaise sauce was rich and slightly lemony Mmmmm. We will return VERY soon. Hopefully I can make it here with the girls for dinner & drinks this week as well.

I could mention it two more times and it wouldnt be enough.Summary:hi quality ingredients lovingly prepared + terrific service + special drinks = GREAT PLACE",4.0
"I came here on a Sunday at 12 pm.. Was told to wait an hour and a half to be seated .. Never in a million years would I wait so long but because I was really craving fried pork chops and waffles .. (Something I have never tried but really wanted to try and wasn't in the mood for your typical eggs Benedict brunch) I decided I would suck it up , walk around a little and wait. Besides the hostess having a little bit of an attitude, we were seated after exactly an hour and a half. So here I am all excited to try these pork chops.. I order them and right then and there, another lady comes up to my waiter and tells him we just run out !!!!!! You can just imagine my disappointment .. Oh man was I pissed. Seriously guys , your famous for this meal, why not be a little more prepared especially at the peak time of brunch. If I didn't have to wait so long to be seated and they were out , I would have been a little less pissed. You know you win some you lose some. But that wasn't the case ! I had to wait and I didn't get to eat what I wanted .. Double whammy .... Anyway, they had good bloody Mary's so I'll give them two stars for that and some comfy bench chairs. I ordered a side of waffles so I would at least have half of the meal I initially wanted . Better than nothing right? But even that was hard and dry !! Would I come back ?! Def not !!! I'll go try pies and thighs and maybe sweet chick the next time I'm in the mood for a fatty brunch. I'll wait 45 min if I have too !",2.0
"As far as brunch places go, this place is top notch. I've been to other brunch places that claim to be, or others claim to be the best brunch in NYC/BK. But how they are all so wrong. This is the place to go for brunch.After months of constant insisting by a friend, we went to Buttermilk for some Sunday brunch. With most places, when you get there between 11am and 12pm the wait is relatively short. However, because of the location of Buttermilk and its immense popularity, there is frequently a long wait. For my friend and I it was only about a 25 min, but we opted to sit outside in the heat because we were too hungry to wait. The wait after us was about an hour for most people. So if you should decide to go, I'd recommend to go early and be prepared to wait. On the bright side, the food does come out from the kitchen at a fast pace.After hearing so much about the delicious food, I had expected a lot, and Buttermilk Channel delivered. Every thing that we ordered was fantastic. The summer watermelon salad was great. I highly suggest it, especially for those who like goat cheese with their watermelon. Then there was the warm butter milk biscuits, served with a side of warm butter and a little jar of home made jam.  I also tried the buttermilk and cheddar waffles. It sounds like a weird combo, but its fantastic. Especially the fluffy waffles with the sharp cheddar and some maple syrup. I did not try my friend's ABC grilled cheese (Apple Bacon Cheddar) but it smelled great. I had the Scrambles with house smoked salmon. I don't usually like smoked salmon in my eggs, but this was great. Unlike most places, this dish was filling, and served perfectly. The eggs were fluffy and filling and not dry. Finally, the coffee was really good. Unlike most places, the coffee was flavorful and not burnt.Moral of my post, Run, don't walk to Buttermilk Channel for brunch.

"I'm pretty frugal, so catching me at a place with 3 $ signs is very very rare.  But I could not help myself when I saw this place on TV (I think it was the Cooking Channel), and this lady was going on about their chicken and waffles being *amazing*.  To be honest, I've never tried chicken and waffles in my life.  I've had fried chicken before, and I've had waffles separately; but the thought of putting maple syrup on a perfectly good piece of fried chicken seemed like it would ruin it.  I've never been a fan of mixing savory and sweet (I never eat my turkey with cranberry sauce).           Well, I thought it was as good a time as any to give it a try, especially since it seemed like a lot of people are raving about it.  I used my birthday as an excuse to go, since I always need an excuse to eat at pricey places.  It was pouring on a Tuesday, and we figured, 'what the hey, we won't need reservations'. WRONG.  We waited for 50 minutes for a table, and there were so many people waiting that there was no space at the bar even.  I thought this place HAS to be good if people are waiting on line on a rainy Tuesday.  The hostess and waiters were very professional and friendly--apologizing profusely for having us wait (when it's really our fault for not reserving a table).           I wasn't too ecstatic about paying $18 for fried chicken; but when that plate came....boy oh boy!  It was 3 pieces of chicken and a big waffle.  I dug in, and was amazed at  the flavors in my mouth.  The batter used for the chicken, was slightly sweetened--not overly, but just a touch that perhaps even most diners would have missed it.  And then the waffle, with a bit of cheese baked in the batter, was just a touch savory!  This was genius food, with such restraint.  To top it all off, there's a slightly sweet syrup to go on top of everything, I think it was a balsamic reduction syrup.  This syrup is definitely a LOT less sweet than maple, which is perfect for me, it tasted great, but to be honest, I didn't need it.  In fact, pouring some on made my gorgeous crispy waffle turn to mush on my plate, since the 'syrup' wasn't very syrup-y, and therefore doesn't coat your waffle, it mostly gets soaked into the waffle.  So I stopped using it.             We also got the duck meatloaf.  I scoffed at how small it was for $20, but I can't scoff at its flavor.  That is seriously the most flavorful meatloaf you will ever eat--full of smoky duck flavor.  The large onion ring was kind of confusing and slightly odd on the plate, but provided some nice texture contrast to the (somewhat soft) meatloaf and the (very soft) parsnip mash underneath.  The mash was also quite flavorful, but there wasn't very much of it at all.  My poor boyfriend had to watch me eat my food while he finished his in 12 minutes.  I let him have a drumstick. Hey, he's paying for this meal, he deserves some chicken.",4.0

"What an amazing experience we had last night at Buttermilk Channel! The service was excellent, the ambience was just right, and the food was delicious. The house-made bread & butter pickles were addictive - I'm not usually a fan, but could have eaten a bowl myself. Not too sweet, the perfect mix of flavors. We shared three insane entrees. The warm lamb & romaine salad was absolutely perfect - salty, crunchy, creamy and meaty. It was definitely a dinner sized portion with lots of moist pulled leg of lamb over romaine and frisee. Certainly enough for one person if you're not into sharing. The duck meatloaf was nuts! From the giant onion ring on top to the jus at the bottom, this  made me close my eyes to appreciate the perfection. Because we were sharing, the rich, creamy flavors never overwhelmed, but I might not get this on my own. Then, of course, we had to sample the buttermilk fried chicken. Three large pieces of super juicy chicken perched on a not-too-large waffle. The syrup was not too sweet or mapley, which was perfect for dinner. Cole slaw went super light on the mayo and was a nice crunchy compliment to the other flavors and textures. I can see why this is a crowd favorite - it didn't disappoint. The chicken even held up as a 1:00 am snack - still crunchy!  It was hard to pick a favorite among these 3 gems, and I would recommend all three. For dessert we tried the pecan ice cream sundae and the chocolate & caramel tart. Both tasty but they didn't blow our minds. But the coffee was very good, hot, and strong, which is a big plus for me. (There's nothing worse than ending a meal with a weak cup of coffee...ugh) Thanks for a wonderful evening, Buttermilk Channel! We can't wait to come back and sample the rest of the menu.",5.0
"AMAZING. I was wow-ed by this place. I took a friend for her birthday and boy did they impress.The staff was super friendly, the food was indescribably delicious and the ambiance was impeccable. I suggest the cheddar waffles and the bread pudding.",5.0
"Perfect.   Lets start with the bar.  Cute and attentive bartenders.  5 stars.As for the food, I had the bacon almonds (I have the leftovers wrapped up in my purse for a plane  snack) the fresh mozzarella, the chicken liver (perfect toast and salt on the side) the mustard green salad and the fresh linguine with mushrooms and bread crumbs.    Everything was  perfectly done.  5 stars.    And the price, 6 stars.  Very  reasonable.  I wish this place was in the bay area so I could go all the time!",5.0
"My friends and I went to Buttermilk Channel last Saturday. We went for brunch to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  Even though we wanted eat brunch at 11 am we got there for 10:45 as we heard there is ALWAYS a wait...and there was.  Thank goodness it was only a 40 min wait. By the time we returned from the bank 5 blocks away, our wait was only 10 min. We we sat down ordered out brunch and everything was delicious. I ordered the poached eggs. It was a bit salty but that was due to the ham. Everything was fresh! Pancakes was divine! One brunch type drink was included. The best part was the whole brunch was inexpensive. The 5 of us ate for $80. I would definitely go again!",4.0
"The food and service are very good.  While the food is very good it isn't excellent, I gave 5 stars because the service and the food combined make this restaurant a must!  I was there on Saturday with my brother and while there is a wait, it is worth it.  Come prepared to visit a surrounding bar or store if it is early enough.  They will call your cell when your table is ready!  The fresh oysters were fresh!.  The cooked oysters were amazing. Both our meals - I had steak, he had the chicken were real good.  I had the peacan Sunday for dessert and he had the chocolate tart.  Drinks were good and they have a nice wine list.",5.0
"I have been here several times and have loved every meal.  I finally had the favorite, fried chicken and waffles.  I'm sorry to say the chicken was tasteless and slightly burned.  Anyone from the South would disapprove but the Northerners don't seem to notice. The trout is wonderful as is the brunch.  I would vote it best brunch in the city.  The service is really great and I'm always happy when I leave.",4.0
"I had the best brunch here. The service was so nice and the food was excellent. I had the pecan french toast which is was a delicious combination of breakfast and dessert. The doughnuts were not sweet and were warm and crisp. So great. Best of all, all brunch items come with a complimentary drink. The sparkling white wine went down smooth!",5.0

"Been here for brunch multiple times. Love to go sit at the bar and order. The servers are always really friendly, the food is delicious. For brunch -- the pork chop and cheddar waffle is great.... as is the short rib hash. For lunch/dinner -- I've had the lamb salad which almost blew my mind. It's a touch salty with the lamb and capers, but really really amazing.",4.0
"Great place, friendly staff, yummy food, yummy drinks, can't go wrong. We had dinner on a weeknight durning the holiday season, had the pickles, oysters both way, bacon almonds, duck meatloaf, trout wrapped in bacon, and a nightcap with the pecan sundae = happy tummy",4.0
"Such a cozy restaurant. I came with a group of girl friends to celebrate a birthday and it was a lovely pleasant place to do so! I think this would be a nice spot to stop and have a cocktail and a snack at the bar (or maybe that killer pecan pie sundae), however I wouldn't probably do the whole dinner thing again. While the service was friendly and the atmosphere lovely, the food was just not up my alley. I think that the menu and the food rely too heavily on animal fat to supply ALL flavor and it's just boring. Not to mention heavy heavy heavy. I would've appreciated a more balanced menu to suite a variety of moods. Instead, it's heavy heavy heavy appetizer, entree and dessert. oof. Too much of a good thing can indeed be wonderful, but it can also be gross feeling.",3.0
"It was good the first time, but now we would definitely not go back. We all ordered the chicken and waffles. My daughter's chicken was completely RAW. It is very dark in there so we are fortunate that she looked closer with the candlelight. The popovers, which are usually good came out burnt. They brought us a new burnt batch instead. All of of waffles were burnt as well. The slaw was very bitter and our chicken was flavorless. The wait staff seem annoyed. The manager was good about it, but it was too late by the time she came over to our table. The food is so inconsistent that we will not be returning.",2.0
The worst service I have ever experienced in my life. To say the wait staff was inattentive would be a understatement. The fried chicken supposedly their signature dish was tasteless.I really have no clue why people line up and wait for hours to get into this place when there are much better choices within walking distance?,1.0
"Went with a friend to this great little spot.  Sat at the bar, which was a good idea as the bartenders were great.  It was a little busy and pricey, but the food was good and the atmosphere was great.  Good beers and wine and was able to fill up on appetizers, which is what I would recommend.",4.0
"This was an ""experience"". It was totally buzzin' on a sweltering Wednesday night too. We started off with an excellent white wine from NY (yes- NY but cant remember the name) &  a delish  rum & ginger beer Mule & the Hush puppies which were very small, dense yellow cornmeal but a nice flavor & texture served with a creamy lime dipping sauce which was a surprising compliment. The acoustics need some adjusting as it was very loud but the live Billy Holiday created a nice mood as does the interior with its low lit sconces, exposed brick, pine bar and creamy walls. The smaller tables are a bit too close for my comfort but our adjacent dinners were friendly & inquisitive about (each others meal's). My friend had the Trout stuffed & wrapped w/bacon with creamy grits- she loved it! & I had what I specifically went there for: their Fried Chicken & Waffles. It was excellent. The chicken was lightly spicy, crispy, crunchy but the meat was tender & juicy. The waffles were light but didn't detect the cheddar, & the Balsamic syrup was divine & a wonderful accompaniment- big portion too 3 pieces of chicken. The coleslaw was unnecessary.  For dessert we shared a decadent bread pudding with a buttery caramel sauce. The prices were very reasonable. There is dining outside too. The service was attentive , service was timed well. Street parking.",4.0
"I love the fried chicken and waffles here. *Warning* The size of the chicken is enough to feed a small family and you should ask for more syrup, because the container of syrup they serve you must have been miniaturized.  However, my new absolute all time favorite is the herb crusted fish with creamy grits.  Oh.my.god.  I would sell a major organ for another taste of that...ok, maybe not.  But it was damn good.",4.0
"Whether I come for brunch on Sundays, an early weeknight dinner with my toddler or a date night with the husband, I consistently Love, Love, LOVE this place.  I think I've sampled almost everything on their menu (including the kids' menu) and have not been disappointed yet.  The duck meatloaf, cheeseburger, fried chicken & waffles, almonds covered in maple syrup & bacon, and pecan pie sundae are all incredible (not that I recommend ordering them all in one sitting!).Doug and his staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome (even if you have a kid in tow--can't say the same for a certain restaurant up the street, hint, hint PRIME MEATS).  I live in the neighborhood but it's worth the trek if you're coming from elsewhere.",5.0
"Came here on a Monday for the three course tasting. This was my second visit to this awesome restaurant. The food is decadent but well-spiced, leaving everyone's palate very pleased. The atmosphere is lively and romantic and also good for groups. The real kicker, though, is the pecan pie sundae. i think i almost died and went to sugar-sweet dessert heaven while inhaling this.

"Yes - the pecan pie sundae is excellent. It's too bad everything else tastes like dessert. Both mains - the much heralded Fried Chicken and the Duck Meatloaf were very sweet to me.

"BC was pretty good.  Good variety on the menu and they have a vegetarian menu for those who don't eat the meat.  My food was quite good, the kale salad and fried chicken with waffles were great.  The pasta dish was decent, but don't come here if you want a great pasta dish.  The service was very good, the decor very nice and the place wasn't too loud or crowded like some others have mentioned here.  I'm sure if they have a full house it can get noisy, but it was just fine for us.",3.0
"Went last night. House-made pickles, sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes, maple & bacon roasted almonds (smoky, sweet), grilled kale & endive salad (nice grilled flavor, bit crunchy for me but then again I like my steamed broccoli flaccid), duck meatloaf with creamed spinach and the most perfect onion ring on top - crisp and the onion didn't come out like some big wet noodle after the first bite.

"Boy, this was one of the Meals, the capitalized kinds. It was, as the Great ones are, heavily influenced by the company and the timing, but even so...I am a picky fucking eater even when my mind is on other things. And this place is super awesome good. Potato and Goat Cheese croquettes? A MUST!!!! Cheese tasting plate was pretty good if a little towards the pungent side of the spectrum. It had these really good little fruits on it. Mmmm. I had the apple and cranberry mixed green salad, it was good but could have used something more in the dressing which was just lime juice and olive oil. My dining companion had the Kale salad.

She was super friendly and seated us a few minutes prior than expected.  She even called us to let us know the seats were available.  We planned for brunch and just made it (sorta) around 2:30 ish (ends at 3 PM).  We all pretty much reviewed the menu a few days in advance and had an idea of what we wanted.  Fried pork chops/waffles and bloody marys were on the top of the list.  We initially ordered the fried pork chops/waffles and short rib hash BUT wait for it....they were out!!!!!

"It was a Friday night walked in with some girlfriends to celebrate a friends bday party. We had no reservation but we were able to get a table in about 30 minutes. Nice ambiance & very friendly staff. The wait was a bit long to take our orders but the food was soooo worth it!. First off we tried the mussels & mozzarella dish for appetizers. The mussels had this green chile sauce that was sooo good. The mozzarella was sooo fresh and the anchovy basil sauce was such a nice touch. As the main course I had the chicken and waffles, the chicken was sooooo delicious. The waffles were incredible, not your traditional one either. They were cheddar waffles...YUM! For dessert I had the Pecan Sundae...do yourself a favor and try this! You will not be disappointed.

This place is really great. The ambiance is just beautiful. Its got a comfy country feel. When we got there we sat at the bar for a while. The have these cool vintage syphons that is filled with brooklyn-made seltzer water. After a while we were taken to a table which had a cool church bench behind it and above the bench there was a huge mirror. The place is totally a great date spot.Now for the food... We specifically went there for the chicken and waffles because we heard so much about it. The interesting thing about the meal was that it was entirely savory and not sweet. Usually with chicken and waffles the chicken seems sweeter to match the waffles or there is a balance between sweet and savory. The meal there had cheese waffles and the syrup was something like balsamic vinegar and honey. The chicken was very crispy and moist but they definitely could have marinated it longer.

"A friend once noted to me that Carroll Gardens is basically ""urban utopia"", and I think I'd have to agree.  They've got quiet, tree-lined streets, dozens of high-quality independent businesses, and nary a high-rise in sight.  It's not touristy or douchey, and it's serviced by the F train, The City's Most Useful Subway Line.  I'd totally move there if I weren't madly in love with my apartment in DUMBO.  Buttermilk Channel sits on the southern tip of Carroll Gardens, and its modernized comfort food, its reference to a local waterway, and its fresh whites/dark wood decor are the neighborhood embodied.  Classic, nostalgic, but new.  I've been now for both brunch and dinner, and can say with confidence that I'd highly recommend the former, but the latter not so much.  If you do go for dinner, without question start with the chicken liver mousse.  SO DIVINE, and they were super nice about giving us extra toast so we weren't reduced to licking the bowl, which we absolutely would have done.  It was incredible.  The entrees didn't work so well for us--the waffles (as part of the chicken and waffles) were too dry to be helped by the drizzle of balsamic reduction that accompanied them--at least for me, waffles need to be smothered in maple syrup, no substitutions.  And while the bacon-wrapped trout had promise (how could it not, being bacon-wrapped?), in execution it seemed not very well thought out.  The trout itself was cooked perfectly, but the bacon wrap--which was really more like a tiny bacon ribbon--didn't add much of anything in the way of flavor, and the fingerling potato and ramp ""hash"" was not at all hash-like, but simply a couple of fingerling potatoes sliced lengthwise and tossed in mustard.  I'm sorry, but where I come from we call that potato salad.Brunch, on the other hand, YES YES YES!!  $10 or $11 gets you an entree, coffee or tea, and a champagne cocktail.  How are they even making money on this?  My Eggs Huntington (essentially Benedict, but with biscuits and fancier ham) were probably the best egg dish I've had this year.  The ham was smokey and juicy and utterly amazing.  The eggs were perfectly poached, and the dish came with a nice little side salad, so I didn't feel like a complete oinker (I felt like a complete oinker an hour later at the Brooklyn Beer experiment, where I pretty much had a second brunch).  My friend's short ribs hash happily fell well within the category of ""hash-like"".  Delicious, supremely affordable brunch? I'm pleased to report that Carroll Gardens' urban utopia status is most definitely still in tact.",4.0

"Have had brunch here twice, each time enjoying delicious eggs with a biscuit on the side and a variety of breakfast-time-drinks (which were tasty, but standard).  Unfortunately, while the eggs were good enough to order a second time, my latest trip involved a less fortunate repeat: the same waitress. I hate to nitpick to death in a review, but a waitress who is both clueless AND rude, should probably look into a new profession (running for congress perhaps?). Good food, but since the odds of getting frustrating service seem pretty high, don't go unless you're in a mood so good nothing can tarnish it.",4.0

"A few weeks ago, my daughter and I went to Buttermilk Channel for dinner.  We know that this is a very busy place so we were there at 5 PM right when they open to make sure we got in.  Very nice atmosphere and we were greeted warmly.  After looking at the menu, I decided to try the Steamed Mussels with Pepper Stew breadcrumbs and aioli.  This was an appetizer and it was a good portion, quite delicious and tasty.  My daughter chose to have the Warm Lamb and Romaine salad.  This was a good size as well and she said the lamb was quite good and the presentation was very attractive.  We decided to have the homemade strawberry ice cream for dessert.  Heavenly...  We were sitting next to a couple and they were having the fried chicken and waffles.  It looked very good and when we come again, we will try them.  It was a very pleasant dining experience and with good service, you can't go wrong.  Try them, you will be pleased also.  Sheila F.

"Good drinks, middle of the road food. Having been to Buttermilk for both brunch and dinner, I found the bland batter used to fry things makes all the fried foods taste the same. The brunch donuts taste exactly like the hush puppies and fried chicken served at dinner. Though most people swear by these fried foods, I've found that the best of Buttermilk's dishes are not fried. The squash tart and brussels sprouts are pretty amazing.",3.0

"A friend once noted to me that Carroll Gardens is basically ""urban utopia"", and I think I'd have to agree.  They've got quiet, tree-lined streets, dozens of high-quality independent businesses, and nary a high-rise in sight.  It's not touristy or douchey, and it's serviced by the F train, The City's Most Useful Subway Line.  I'd totally move there if I weren't madly in love with my apartment in DUMBO.  Buttermilk Channel sits on the southern tip of Carroll Gardens, and its modernized comfort food, its reference to a local waterway, and its fresh whites/dark wood decor are the neighborhood embodied.  Classic, nostalgic, but new.  I've been now for both brunch and dinner, and can say with confidence that I'd highly recommend the former, but the latter not so much.  If you do go for dinner, without question start with the chicken liver mousse.  SO DIVINE, and they were super nice about giving us extra toast so we weren't reduced to licking the bowl, which we absolutely would have done.  It was incredible.  The entrees didn't work so well for us--the waffles (as part of the chicken and waffles) were too dry to be helped by the drizzle of balsamic reduction that accompanied them--at least for me, waffles need to be smothered in maple syrup, no substitutions.  And while the bacon-wrapped trout had promise (how could it not, being bacon-wrapped?), in execution it seemed not very well thought out.  The trout itself was cooked perfectly, but the bacon wrap--which was really more like a tiny bacon ribbon--didn't add much of anything in the way of flavor, and the fingerling potato and ramp ""hash"" was not at all hash-like, but simply a couple of fingerling potatoes sliced lengthwise and tossed in mustard.  I'm sorry, but where I come from we call that potato salad.Brunch, on the other hand, YES YES YES!!  $10 or $11 gets you an entree, coffee or tea, and a champagne cocktail.  How are they even making money on this?  My Eggs Huntington (essentially Benedict, but with biscuits and fancier ham) were probably the best egg dish I've had this year.  The ham was smokey and juicy and utterly amazing.  The eggs were perfectly poached, and the dish came with a nice little side salad, so I didn't feel like a complete oinker (I felt like a complete oinker an hour later at the Brooklyn Beer experiment, where I pretty much had a second brunch).  My friend's short ribs hash happily fell well within the category of ""hash-like"".  Delicious, supremely affordable brunch? I'm pleased to report that Carroll Gardens' urban utopia status is most definitely still in tact.",4.0
Went there for a brunch and had Warm lamb @ Romaine salad. Was excellent. Can't wait to go again and try more.,5.0
"I had the scallops, my friend had the fried chicken. Both were delish! Also got the side of cauliflower, and started with the bacon maple almonds. Both were great as well.I really wanted to try the desserts b/c they sounded great, but was too full to do so. I definitely will be back again.Only downside was the hour and a half wait. The hostess took our number and called us when our table was ready. Thankfully it was just an hour and we went to a nearby bar. It was beyond well worth the wait.",5.0
"Have had brunch here twice, each time enjoying delicious eggs with a biscuit on the side and a variety of breakfast-time-drinks (which were tasty, but standard).  Unfortunately, while the eggs were good enough to order a second time, my latest trip involved a less fortunate repeat: the same waitress. I hate to nitpick to death in a review, but a waitress who is both clueless AND rude, should probably look into a new profession (running for congress perhaps?). Good food, but since the odds of getting frustrating service seem pretty high, don't go unless you're in a mood so good nothing can tarnish it.",4.0
"We thought this place was going to be awesome, it was OK. We both had a dandelion salad which was really good. I had the fried chicken after the waitress said they had won awards and they were nice to give me the parts I wanted, the crunch was nice but the taste was a nonevent. The sweet waffles that went with it were just not the flavors I want with fried chicken, give me salt or spice please. My friend had a steak which she did not even finish. We skipped desert because we were bored by that time.",3.0
"A few weeks ago, my daughter and I went to Buttermilk Channel for dinner.  We know that this is a very busy place so we were there at 5 PM right when they open to make sure we got in.  Very nice atmosphere and we were greeted warmly.  After looking at the menu, I decided to try the Steamed Mussels with Pepper Stew breadcrumbs and aioli.  This was an appetizer and it was a good portion, quite delicious and tasty.  My daughter chose to have the Warm Lamb and Romaine salad.  This was a good size as well and she said the lamb was quite good and the presentation was very attractive.  We decided to have the homemade strawberry ice cream for dessert.  Heavenly...  We were sitting next to a couple and they were having the fried chicken and waffles.  It looked very good and when we come again, we will try them.  It was a very pleasant dining experience and with good service, you can't go wrong.  Try them, you will be pleased also.  Sheila F. White",4.0
"Good drinks, middle of the road food. Having been to Buttermilk for both brunch and dinner, I found the bland batter used to fry things makes all the fried foods taste the same. The brunch donuts taste exactly like the hush puppies and fried chicken served at dinner. Though most people swear by these fried foods, I've found that the best of Buttermilk's dishes are not fried. The squash tart and brussels sprouts are pretty amazing.",3.0
"Best fried chicken ever. Friendly wait staff. Try chocolate carmel tart with salted peanuts & think you're in heaven.    No rez for parties under 6. No waiting for 4 on Wed night in Sept. Extensive vegetarian menu. For NYC, reasonable prices.",5.0

"Really should be 3.5 stars.  The food was great.  I had the Hamilton Benedict and my date had the Pecan French Toast.  The homemade sausages were a little bland, but other than that all was very good.  Would give it more but the service was not great.  We went at 2:45, which is the later potion of brunch, and were definitely rushed to leave.  Had to call the waiter over a few times to refill our drinks.  Other than that all was good.",4.0

"Went to brunch here this past Sunday after hearing good things about this place from a few coworkers and it's been on my ""Places to try"" list. We expected a wait so when we were told it was 45 minutes, there was no surprise. Walked around the area and then about 50 min -1 hour later, we got the call that our table was ready.  When we got back to the restaurant, the hostess told us that there was only seating available outside! Firstly, it was a somewhat cool day (50 degrees and kind of cloudy) and sitting outside was not something I really wanted to do, especially after waiting an hour. She should have been asked where we wanted to sit!  Secondly,  as she was telling us this, I saw about 3 empty tables inside!!  I asked her ""how much longer is the wait before we could sit inside?"" and she ""went to check"" and miraculously .. ""Oh, there appears to be a table inside!""  It definitely seemed like they were trying to get people to sit outside first since there were clearly like 8 tables open out there and many other people waiting to be seated.  That left a bad taste in our mouth but whatever, we were willing to get passed that and see what the food was about!  The décor was nice! Spacious, simple and having a very airy feel. We got seated and decided to share something sweet and something savory, so we ordered the pecan french toast, eggs benedict and a side order of the cheddar waffle. While waiting for our food to come and enjoying our coffees and mimosas, the Manager (?)came over to us and started telling us ""how he has a party of 4 and he's so sorry but would appreciate if we could shift our seats to accommodate this party."" Of course we moved and squished into a tiny little table between two other table.  Talk about strike 2. If the first incident didn't happen, it probably wouldn't have been a big deal, but it did and my boyfriend was pretty annoyed at this point. Greaaaaaaat! We finally got our food and I must say, I thought everything was delicious so I want to be fair there. I will say, I wish the cheddar waffle was a little warmer (it was kind of cold, but I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be?!) but the taste was delicious. The pecan french toast was amazing!!  I loved the eggs (which came on top of a biscuit), my boyfriend not so much.  In general, I thought the food was very good. He didn't love it but I think it's because he was off put by the entire situation.  He mentioned to me that the only way he would feel slightly better is if they took one of the drinks off the bill, and that they did..    so, we will give them credit there since that was the right thing to do.All in all, I'd come back for dinner, but it would have to be with my girlfriends b/c my boyfriend said there was no way he would go back..  Oh well! I don't totally blame him.",3.0

"I love this restaurant.  I have been here for both dinner and brunch and both were excellent.  Dinner was a bit of a special occasion, and I can't imagine a more perfect dining experience.

Next we were sent a squash and ricotta tart as our appetizer. The ricotta was amazingly light and fluffy and the tart was delicate and not too filling. For entrees we had the pasta with pumpkin and black olives and the fennel and white bean stew. My favorite dish of the evening was the pasta. The contrast of the sweet pumpkin and the salty olives was brilliant. The stew was also very good--I loved the kale that accompanied it. For dessert we couldn't resist the apple cider donuts and a glass of late harvest zinfandel. I say the donuts are totally worth it and will transport you back to childhood fair grounds.Now for brunch. I was with a group of 5, so we sampled a lot! We started with bloody mary's that was garnished  with a fresh east coast oyster and we were sent the delicious donuts and coffee cake muffins. Off to a very good start! For the table, we shared pickles, a salad of kale, endive,& hard-boiled egg, a short stack of pancakes, a cheddar waffle,  and apple and fennel soup with bacon. The pancakes were light and fluffy, the waffle savory and hearty. My favorite was the salad which was deliciously salty with anchovy dressing. I also has the egg scramble with house cured lox and a few others had the scramble with mushrooms and goat cheese, and a side of sausage. I loved my eggs which were creamy and salty. The great thing was even though we had a ridiculous amount of food, all the portions were on the small side so it was easy to sample everything.

NO ALCOHOL BEFORE NOON ON SUNDAYS! friends, did you know about this? we certainly did not. or maybe we did but we always seem to forget. i mean i don't know! we are constantly drinking at brunch in this town, are we not? do we check the time when we partake in this jolly activity? i don't think so. anyway. this is the rule at buttermilk and they are sticking to it.so i'm sorry, dozens of people who were waiting for a (our) table. we had no choice but to eat our food VERRY VERRRY slowly because you see, there's a cocktail included in the brunch prix fixe (smallish portions but still a good deal, as the food is delish). and we weren't going anywhere till we got it.and i'm sorry, nice waitress who kept asking ""are you finished?"" while peering at our plates with tiny morsels left on them. no, we're not done here. we won't be till noon. at which time we politely asked for our cocktails (and asked for the check), downed them and left. a sweet hereafter.i'd write more about the food, but i don't remember much about it other than it was awesome. i was consumed by nerves. watching the clock is stressful!",3.0
Absolutely fantastic. One of the best meals I've ever had in NYC and I've lived here all my life. The scallops were amazing as was the banana bread pudding for dessert.,5.0
"The drinks, appetizers and first course were great.  The second course was a miss, pretty much all the way around our party of four.  The fried chicken was passable, but not amazing (volume over quality).  The trout wrapped in ham was just OK.  (Why didn't they create a sauce for the grits?  Maybe from the pan the veggies & fish were cooked in.)  Hake was nothing to write home about.  Anyway, if we return we'll probably create a meal out of appetizers and first course options.  Or maybe give it another chance with the remaining entres.  Sigh.  I really wanted to love this place.",3.0
"I was with a friend on a Saturday afternoon and we were casually strolling around for a brunch spot. When we passed this spot, we both noticed some amazing-looking food on people's plates at the tables outside, particularly the french toast. We only had to wait 5 minutes for a table, and we both ordered it after the waiter said it's extremely good and probably the best choice. When our french toast arrived, the table next to us (with 6 people) gasped and asked us what that was and exclaimed how delicious it looked. It was immaculate. Just when I think I've had the best french toast of my life (at some spot in Manhattan), I come across this place and think it may have just taken the top spot. The pecan topping, the incredible texture of the crust and the inside, and some nonsensically delicious whipped cream-ish stuff on the side... perfection.

"I had a steak here a couple of months ago and *still* can't get over how bland and overpriced it was.

"After hearing great things from various friends, I decided to venture to Buttermilk Channel. The staff and the atmosphere is great. Nice environment and pleasant staff goes a long way in my book. I wasn't, though, taken by the food. I ate there for brunch. I ordered the short rib hash, which had too much of a spice in it for my taste. I think there was too much cinnamon in it. My friend had the fried pork chop and cheese waffle, which was okay/good. The meat was cooked well, however, the chop didn't hold much way in terms of flavor. If it wasn't for the breaded coating, it would have been a very boring piece of meat. Also, I ordered the warm coffee cake as a side. It came in the form of fa cupcake and was too sweet and on the dry side. All-in-all, I've definitely had better.",2.0

They were more boiled with a hard yolk. It wasn't just my eggs either but also my friend's who ordered the same thing. However the burger another friend ordered looked delicious.

We arrived at the restaurant and there was an hour wait. It seemed kind of crazy but I had made the trek from Manhattan so I was going to wait. The restaurant looks wonderful - really simple, but really comfortable - it was a place i would want to just hang out at the bar for the day. My friend and I noticed 2 empty seats at the bar so we decided to have brunch there - it was a great people watching spot and we didn't have to wait at all for our bloody mary's, which by the way were delicious. I ordered the the Star of the Sea which was good, but I didn't taste the cucumber and dill. My friend ordered the Court St which was fantastic, I will get that one next time! We started with the Maple and Bacon Roasted Almonds which were really tasty, though i wouldn't have minded if they were a bit crunchier. As it was my friend's birthday she went all out and ordered the Cheddar Waffles and fried pork chop - Yuuuuuuuuum! Seriously, it was awesome and I can only imagine how much more awesome it would be a cure a hangover. I had the short rib hash (the bartender's favorite, she said she ate it everyday!) and it was tasty, but I felt like there was something missing - just that certain Je ne sais quoi. Overall though everything was really well done and it was such a pleasure to see a successful new restaurant owned by someone I used to work with! I know I said I could spend the day at this restaurant, but to be honest, half of the day would be spend in bathroom and for only good reasons. That bathroom is bangin'!

The service was good as my waiter was able to accommodate my mock-tail order with ease. There are no mock-tails on the menu. I guess the place was somewhat full, but not really packed. We ended up having to wait longer than I expected for our main entree to arrive. I ordered the duck meatloaf and was really happy with it. It was a small - regular portion which was fine with me. It was moist and interesting, but in a good way. My guest ordered the fried chicken, but was unfortunately, underwhelmed with it. The texture was good enough (juicy inside and crunchy outside), but it wasn't seasoned very well, if at all. I tried a small piece of the chicken and totally agreed with her. I honestly don't get what all the rave reviews over the chicken are for. I recommend the duck meatloaf and would go back for that, but I'll stick to getting fried chicken elsewhere.",3.0

The smoked salmon platter definitely intrigued me as the fried capers were an awesome touch to the dish. Very good. My short ribs hash wasn't as generous as I thought it would be but the flavors were spot on and the eggs were perfectly runny. All strong dishes. The hash browns were awesome as well.

First of all, I had flowers delivered that day to the restaurant to surprise my friend during dinner and not only did the owner Doug call me to let me know he'd spoken to the florist, but they kept the flowers in their refrigerator during the day so that they wouldn't wilt. When we arrived the lovely hostess seated us promptly despite the longish line and our lack of reservation (since we were less than 5 people) for a table because they could tell that it was a big occasion. They also brought the flowers over to the table at the perfect time so that my friend could be surprised by them.The food was amazing, the fried chicken is out of this world, even if you're not a fried chicken person.  Ditto on the squash ricotta tart and the homemade pickles.

"I picked this trendy place to stop for dinner on my last trip to NYC. It's very near the Gowanus Canal and is in a cool nabe that's rebounding quite a bit since I was last in Brooklyn in 2008.Had a really great cocktail while I waited for my friend. It was a cooling gin drink. I have the sort of luck that I always happen to get a free drink or food; this time a bartender sitting at the bar (note: he worked somewhere else) bought drinks for the whole bar. Yeah, not good at scoring a job these days, but I do get free refreshments thrown my way.I had a delicious grilled striped bass wrapped in bacon. I only eat bacon if it's that thick-cut organically grown kind, because I can really only rationalize the calories that way. Well, it was wonderful. My friend had the fried chicken. We were both so happy that we forgot to ask for a taste of each other's meals. It's really the kind of food that you want to have for dinner every night of the week but are too tired to make at home after a long day's work. So yes, it's American food, it's nothing spectacular, but it's well-cooked and good. The wine and beer list were well-selected and short enough for someone starving with low-blood sugar (like me) to be able to read and quickly choose from.The service is really nice and the environment is very relaxing. I love the type of interior where you hardly notice it because the designer thought for weeks about which white paint was perfect for the natural light streaming through the front windows. The temperature was perfect, acoustics were good enough for conversation but you could definitely hear the tinny restaurant noises in the background. Nice touches.

"The brunch at Buttermilk Channel is as heavenly as its name (which references an interesting bit of nyc lore: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu…). I went during Memorial Day weekend and the scene was lively, but not overcrowded. Our group of five sat at the large center table and enjoyed the charming, sun-drenched dining room as much as the yummy food. My pecan pie french toast was so delightful that I paid no attention to what my friends were eating (but from the sound of things, it seemed that they too were enamored of their breakfast), and the buttermilk biscuits were perfectly flaky.  I'll definitely be back to try their dinner.",4.0
"So the past few days have been drenched in end-of-the-year get togethers with close friends.  As we ALL seem to live in Brooklyn these days, it's just too obvious to go out in and around the boro, right?Okay, so, I'd heard great things about B'milk Channel, through Andrea Strong's blog, and various other sources, so we eagerly anticipated eating here.Meeting our peeps (Chris and Beth) proved to be a bit more difficult than I thought, but maybe led to the discovery of a site for an uber-cool speakeasy (more on that after we open it!).  While waiting, though, the wine list proved worthy (all North American), and the smoked almonds were so fantastically good (bacon and maple syrup) that I didn't mind waiting and could in fact have stayed at the bar forever!Alas, we sat at a cozy corner window table (thought it would be freezing but was in fact warm and, well, cozy).  There's a daily specials menu, and everything seems to generally fall into either the local, seasonal column or the Brooklyn youngster seeking comfort food category.  We deftly split the menu, touching on all aspects.Cauliflower soup, organic greens salad, cheese plates abounded for appetizers.  Short ribs, hake, and duck meatloaf did justice to the kitchen's skills.Desserts included Apple Cider Donuts (Farmer's Market worthy) and brioche bread pudding (great ratio of bread/custard).I will definitely be back, many times.",4.0

"We went to this place last night for my best friend's birthday - it was amazing. First of all, I had flowers delivered that day to the restaurant to surprise my friend during dinner and not only did the owner Doug call me to let me know he'd spoken to the florist, but they kept the flowers in their refrigerator during the day so that they wouldn't wilt. When we arrived the lovely hostess seated us promptly despite the longish line and our lack of reservation (since we were less than 5 people) for a table because they could tell that it was a big occasion. They also brought the flowers over to the table at the perfect time so that my friend could be surprised by them.The food was amazing, the fried chicken is out of this world, even if you're not a fried chicken person.  Ditto on the squash ricotta tart and the homemade pickles. Absolutely delicious. In addition to the superb food the service was just as excellent. This was our first time at Buttermilk Channel but they made us feel like regulars and that's what will keep us coming back. Thanks again for making my buddy's birthday special!",5.0
"This place lives up to the hype.  Brunch was excellent... well prepared food (eggs in the mushroom/goat cheese scramble were perfectly done), portions were just right in size, and to top it off, the staff is super friendly.  I haven't seen such happy restaurant servers since my trip to New Zealand.  Amazing prices for brunch, with complimentary mimosas!  Looking forward to trying this place for dinner sometime soon.",4.0
"Ate here for my birthday.  Place was beyond packed, but I would soon learn why.  The food was amazing.  I had the fried chicken, with the roasted brussel sprouts.  Out of this world.  The pecan pie sundae is possibly the single greatest dessert I've ever eaten.  The bartenders are like scientists.  The staff was extremely nice and helpful.  Got the chance to meet the owner when we inquired about having a private function there.  Cannot say enough good things aboput this place",5.0

The restaurant is beautiful and the staff is extremely attentive, knowledgeable, and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and appreciated. The last time I went was with my wife's family. I ordered the Duck Meatloaf which was incredibly flavorful and tender. I've never had anything like it but I will definitely order it again the next time I go... Instantly hooked. My wife's father ordered the chicken and waffles which were fried to perfection... crispy, but not too much, and the waffle was delicious as well. Everything's good with syrup isn't it? The waiter, in addition to giving us great wine suggestions, overheard that we were going to the North Fork the next morning, took it upon himself to go behind the bar, ask a few people, and wrote on a napkin the best vineyards that we should visit. It is this out of the way random kindness and helpfulness that will keep us coming back to this place for years to come... besides the fact that the food is just plain awesome.",4.0
"Not to exaggerate, but our meal at Buttermilk Channel tonight is in the top 10 best meals I've ever had.  The real bonus is that the service was also 5 star; something that is usually lacking from other top tier restaurants.  The squash tart app is really exceptional; so are the chicken and waffles.  The hake entree that I had was also one of the best cooked fish I've ever had.  The pecan pie sundae was also good.  However, the real scene-stealer was a little snack for $3: bacon-roasted almonds.  I can't describe how perfect they were.  The cocktails were so well done--celebrating the resurgence of the old school art, but not too sweet or over-wrought.  In short, believe the hype: simple flavors expertly prepared.  Less is not more, it is best.",5.0

"Buttermilk Channel is a good local restaurant.  The food is ok.  I have had most of their entrees which are C+ at best.  The best things are the meals that are not great for you i.e. fried chicken, sausage and cheeseburger.They need to revamp the menu and add healthier options especially the salads which are very mediocre.I would not go out of my way to go to this place but if you are near I would check it out.The best part is the staff.",3.0

"Nice spot, I can see why it is so popular. But holy SALT. And let me assure you, I love salt, like eat half jars of pickles at home while making dinner LOVE salt. But their food was over-seasoned. That being said, I loved the decor, the staff was very nice, and the service was effortless. No attitude! We waiting exactly 45 minutes, as we were told by the hostess we would. She took our cell number so we could wander down the street for a cocktail. Our waitress was helpful with the menu, suggesting that if we shared a few starters and snacks that probably one entree would be enough for my friend and I. It's so refreshing to have a waitress who is honest and not trying to up-sell the entire bill! We shared a bottle of Gruet, a nice minerally sparkling wine that goes with pretty much anything. We had the pickles which were awesome (and appropriately salty), the BBQ'd oysters, which were succulent, smoky, and beautifully presented. The mustard greens salad had radish, pickled sunchoke, and dried pear (I think) and was lightly dressed. Then came our entrees- the famous chicken and the hake. Now the chicken was mouth numbingly salty. I felt like my tongue was shriveling. Had it been incredibly juicy and succulent, I would have been more understanding about the saltiness, but I think this order was slightly over cooked. It was a shade darker than I would have preferred, and tasted accordingly. The battered coating was hard and the interior was barely clinging to its last drop of moisture. The hake was a let-down as well, the sweet mild fish was bread-crumbed to death, reminiscent of a filet o fish. The vinegary beans served with it were also a bit too sour and salty for the dish. It wasn't up to par with the rest of the meal, even the salty chicken. I will definitely go back, as there were more pros than cons, but I'd probably order heavy on the apps and maybe skip the mains all-together. I would also only go here with a party of 2 maximum, as there are very few larger tables and a tiny dining room.",3.0

"My boyfriend and I recently went to Buttermilk Channel for dinner on a Tuesday night. Both of us live in Brooklyn and had heard many great things about the establishment. It was the first time there for both of us. Upon entering, we were greeted by a pleasant hostess and told there was a ten minute wait. We were fine with that, as the restaurant was quite full. We kind of stood and waited off to the side and the bartender caught my eye and handed me a drink menu. Very nice and accommodating. We ordered one round of drinks. We were sat about fifteen minutes later. The experience  as a whole was great up until being seated and my only gripe with the  over all night was the less then mediocre service by our female  server. The food proved to be wonderful but the server neglected us for the majority of the evening. The  fundamentals of service were not in place and the lacking of the basics seemed even more glaring in such a nice restaurant. Id compare the level of service to that of a diner. Our entrees were great, but we were turned off by the service to stay for desert. Hopefully next time service at this restaurant will redeem itself.",2.0

"Buttermilk Channel, named after the strip of water between Governors Island and Brooklyn, opened last week in Carroll Gardens.  The atmosphere is clean and minimalistic, yet warm and inviting and is a welcome addition to the otherwise quiet strip of Court Street.  The menu has some classic southern elements to it (baby back ribs & chicken & waffles); however offers some gourmet and inventive twists (head cheese, duck meatloaf & flap steak served with roasted marrow).  The wine list featured mostly US wines, with an emphasis on those made in and around NY state.  The selection was reasonably priced and did have a couple of CA wines, if you are looking for something a little more robust and complex than a Long Island wine can offer.  They also had a nice selection of draft beers which are served in borderline too cold/frosty beer mugs.Maple glazed, salted ""pop-overs"" were brought to the table instead of the perfunctory bread and butter, which was a nice down-home start to the meal.  We began with housemade pickles, spinach ravioli, an endive and kale salad and local oysters on the half shell.  The spinach ravioli were very delicate and subtle-- the pasta itself was nearly translucent.  The endive and kale salad was a favorite of mine.  It was served with homemade croutons and a soft boiled egg in an anchovy dressing.  The anchovy dressing really made the salad.  The only complaint I have is that the kale, which I believe is a lacinato (or black) kale, was not de-ribbed, and while the leaves are tender enough to be eaten raw, the ribs are too fibrous for the likes of most people.  The oysters (we ordered Malpec and Welfleet) were delicious and very fresh tasting and were served not only with lemon and cocktail sauce, but also with a kimchi type accompaniment. For entrees, the highlight of the meal was the fried chicken with waffles and winter vegetable slaw.  While the cheddar waffles themselves were not better than good, the fried chicken was tremendously moist and cooked perfectly.  The hake with wild mushrooms, bacon wrapped trout and hamburger were also very nice.We skipped dessert, however next time I will save room for their root beer float-- because when is the last time you have seen that on a menu?The service was surprising strong, considering the restaurant opened less than a week ago.  While all of the waitstaff was not completely comfortable describing every menu item, service was friendly and efficient. Price-wise, with tip, we ended up spending about $50 per person.  A little more than we would normally spend in this area; however we did not mind, as the food, service and atmosphere were a little better than most places the neighborhood.",4.0

It turned out to be one of the best restaurants I've dinned at in a while.  And definitely surpassed all other restaurant experiences I had while visiting New York. It was busy, but since it was still early we were promptly seated and greated by a very warm atmosphere and wait staff.  I found that they had quite a wonderful menu with reasonably priced appetizers and main courses. For appetizers we tried the homemade pickles which were very crisp and delicious as well as the bacon almonds which were coated with sweet and savory heaven.We had the ribs and bacon wrapped trout with johnnycakes and greens, both of which were perfect!  The beers selection was decent as well.The pecan desert was soo fantastic as it was made from real pieces of pecan pie chunks.  I'll surely be going back the next time I'm in the area.",5.0

It was the first time there for both of us. Upon entering, we were greeted by a pleasant hostess and told there was a ten minute wait. We were fine with that, as the restaurant was quite full. We kind of stood and waited off to the side and the bartender caught my eye and handed me a drink menu. Very nice and accommodating. We ordered one round of drinks. We were sat about fifteen minutes later. The experience  as a whole was great up until being seated and my only gripe with the  over all night was the less then mediocre service by our female  server. The food proved to be wonderful but the server neglected us for the majority of the evening. The  fundamentals of service were not in place and the lacking of the basics seemed even more glaring in such a nice restaurant. Id compare the level of service to that of a diner. Our entrees were great, but we were turned off by the service to stay for desert. Hopefully next time service at this restaurant will redeem itself.",2.0
"Consistently great brunch and a pretty decent dinner.  If you're trying this restaurant for the first time, try the brunch, and expect to wait a bit to be seated.",4.0
"Buttermilk Channel, named after the strip of water between Governors Island and Brooklyn, opened last week in Carroll Gardens.  The atmosphere is clean and minimalistic, yet warm and inviting and is a welcome addition to the otherwise quiet strip of Court Street.  The menu has some classic southern elements to it (baby back ribs & chicken & waffles); however offers some gourmet and inventive twists (head cheese, duck meatloaf & flap steak served with roasted marrow).  The wine list featured mostly US wines, with an emphasis on those made in and around NY state.  The selection was reasonably priced and did have a couple of CA wines, if you are looking for something a little more robust and complex than a Long Island wine can offer.  They also had a nice selection of draft beers which are served in borderline too cold/frosty beer mugs.Maple glazed, salted ""pop-overs"" were brought to the table instead of the perfunctory bread and butter, which was a nice down-home start to the meal.  We began with housemade pickles, spinach ravioli, an endive and kale salad and local oysters on the half shell.  The spinach ravioli were very delicate and subtle-- the pasta itself was nearly translucent.  The endive and kale salad was a favorite of mine.  It was served with homemade croutons and a soft boiled egg in an anchovy dressing.  The anchovy dressing really made the salad.  The only complaint I have is that the kale, which I believe is a lacinato (or black) kale, was not de-ribbed, and while the leaves are tender enough to be eaten raw, the ribs are too fibrous for the likes of most people.  The oysters (we ordered Malpec and Welfleet) were delicious and very fresh tasting and were served not only with lemon and cocktail sauce, but also with a kimchi type accompaniment. For entrees, the highlight of the meal was the fried chicken with waffles and winter vegetable slaw.  While the cheddar waffles themselves were not better than good, the fried chicken was tremendously moist and cooked perfectly.  The hake with wild mushrooms, bacon wrapped trout and hamburger were also very nice.We skipped dessert, however next time I will save room for their root beer float-- because when is the last time you have seen that on a menu?The service was surprising strong, considering the restaurant opened less than a week ago.  While all of the waitstaff was not completely comfortable describing every menu item, service was friendly and efficient. Price-wise, with tip, we ended up spending about $50 per person.  A little more than we would normally spend in this area; however we did not mind, as the food, service and atmosphere were a little better than most places the neighborhood.",4.0

"worth the wait - and wait we did, over an hour on a sunday, but worth it on a decent day.  the bloody mary classic was fantastically spicy with a great housemade pickle in it and everything else was perfect as well: Great roasted coffee and the fried pork chop on cheddar waffles was moutherwateringly delcious...i LOVED it.  perfect amount of cheddar in the waffles and evenly cooked and flavored pork chop.  besides that the place is bright and open and inviting...I'll be back.",5.0
"I was there for their new brunching experience and must say that I was satisfied.  My original intent was to try dinner as their dinner menu is very different then their brunch menu.  I ordered the short-rib hash accompanied by a nice glass of spicy and strong bloodymary.  My wife had the pork chop and cheddar waffles which were much better than my entree.  Although my selection was not the best, I can see that there is potential with the other dishes. Service was great and decor was simple.  I will update my review after my dinner visit in the near future.  Definitely a good brunch experience.",4.0

"A couple weeks ago I was in Brooklyn visiting my brother.  On my first day of arrival, a Saturday, my bro suggested we try the Buttermilk Channel for an early dinner as I was very hungry after the flight. It turned out to be one of the best restaurants I've dinned at in a while.  And definitely surpassed all other restaurant experiences I had while visiting New York. It was busy, but since it was still early we were promptly seated and greated by a very warm atmosphere and wait staff.  I found that they had quite a wonderful menu with reasonably priced appetizers and main courses. For appetizers we tried the homemade pickles which were very crisp and delicious as well as the bacon almonds which were coated with sweet and savory heaven.We had the ribs and bacon wrapped trout with johnnycakes and greens, both of which were perfect!  The beers selection was decent as well.The pecan desert was soo fantastic as it was made from real pieces of pecan pie chunks.  I'll surely be going back the next time I'm in the area.",5.0

"My husband might drag me back here because he pronounced his warm lamb salad 'genius' but my pork chops and cheddar waffles were as bland as the sterile dining room. The pork was indistinguishable in its flavor and texture from the innards of a chicken cutlet from your standard pizza store and the coating was like  too much Shake N Bake from your mom's in Cleveland. The waffle was lukewarm and only had a cheddar aftertaste that reminded me of Cheese Nibs. Even the accompanying syrup was bland and tasted like water-down agave. The not-Stumptown coffee was good and I liked the lightly pulped orange juice. I was depressed at having to pay $15 for this meal, so great in conception and so flavorless in execution. Meanwhile, my SO was babbling happily about 'delicious jus' this and 'incredibly tender meat' that in between lusty bites so if you are going to Buttermilk Channel, consider that a lamb salad endorsement.",3.0
