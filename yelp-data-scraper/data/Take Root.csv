"In the middle of nowhere, one seating per night on a three-day serving week, impossible reservation...nothing stopped me from coming here, my second to last Michelin star in the city.Since there is no menu anywhere, I brought an open mind before dining in. Turned out that they would provide you the menu upon completion of meal. Dinner kicked off with the carrot ball - as I dipped my ball into the green garlic sauce, I literally started to feel my palate opening up. The course that absolutely amazed me the most would be the sour beef soup with squid - with the help of ginger oil, the soup presented a slight touch of umami flavor that caught right into my heart. The savory main course duck was impressive to the least - very tender breast, extremely flavorful sausage, and crispy skin with sweet potato. I could never imagine someone cooking duck with sweet potato until today...The ""pie"" type apple sorbet towards the end was refreshing and cleaned up the thickness of food.I felt like each single course at Take Root was seamless and full of imagination. Flavor was one element of its success, but I guess the crucial factor that brought its fame was collaboration. I'm really looking forward to coming back and enjoying more seasonal adjusted dishes; the only concern was that probably I would not be fortunate enough to secure another reservation...",5.0
"My husband took me here for my birthday and I was very pleased.We first had the lambballs and crones. The lamb was flavorful and fluffy. We had crones for the first time and although they do not look appealing, they tasted very good-it was a pickled vegetable.I am not a fan of oysters, but the oyster with white soy tapioca was delicious.We were also served a beetroot, marigold and begonia salad with hickory smoke. It was scrumptious. It was a perfect combination of salty and sweet with a hint of smoke.I also felt like a scientist when we were served the cabbage ""tea"" which was like a soup. We were given a ginger oil bottle and an onion paste with a piece of persimmon. It was suggested that we add each as we pleased. I added the onion paste first and it tasted like a meat broth. Then I added the ginger oil and it tasted like a Chinese soup I have had before. I had bites of the persimmon after each sip and it added a sweetness that went perfectly with each sip.Complimentary: We were then served the best slice of bread I have ever had in my whole entire life. This probably sounds crazy-I am writing about a piece of bread, but it was as fluffy as a cloud and the crust was like a piece of a croissant. It was served warm and I added butter. It tasted good with and without butter. I can have this slice of bread every day of my life. If they sold this bread I would buy a loaf every week. I was actually upset because I saw other patrons NOT finishing the fabulous bread. The tuna with the peanut sauce was cooked perfectly and was like eating a piece of steak.We also had squash with sweetbread and lobster foam. I love squash and lobster bisque. It was a great combination- it tasted like squash and lobster soup in one.I love duck and duck was served three ways by sausage, chicharon (crispy diced duck skin pieces) in a salad and sliced pieces of duck. It was so good and this was the first time I have had duck sausage. We also loved the dessert. We had eucalyptus ice cream with an apple pie mix. I was hesitant about the ice cream, but it was mild and tasty, and surprising went well with the apple pie.We also had a molasses, clementine, sesame desert. I loved the combination of the sesame with everything else which made each individual flavor jump on the taste buds.Complimentary: We were also served a mini chocolate fudge that I ate in one bite. The chocolate was perfectly smooth and not too sweet. We were also given a sweet wine that wast a perfect ending to a great meal.I would love to go back.",5.0
"Almost cried before, during and after. Still shocked by basically the best dining experience I've ever had in NYC. I already tried this concept back in Porto, Portugal and was very glad when I was invited to Take Root. Price fixe, 12 seats and the beginning of the meal starts at 8. Don't worry, they will wait for you. And you will feel at home.Exquisite ingredients for highly creative and original cuisine. The elegance of the plating, the music, decoration and general ambience is nearly sublime.The owners, Anna and Chef Elise, a couple of under 30 years olds, makes me even appreciate more their work and passion for what they do.Not so expensive for the experience, 7 courses plus two desserts. Can't wait to try it again since they change their menu very often.Thanks for feeding us and showing us your talent in your own ""home"". I will see you again soon.",5.0
"Dammit, why is there no 6 star option on Yelp, as Take Root absolutely deserves it?!?!.  Probably the best meal I have had in NYC in 5 years.  After booking a month in advance the wife and I went on their first night open in months after an extensive renovation (November 5th).  It was a complete gamble in our eyes, as despite the Michelin star there were only 12 Yelp reviews at the time and you have absolutely no idea what they are going to serve you (and there are no substitutions or special requests). This is an ideal scenario for me as I hate making decisions and will eat pretty much anything.  My wife is adventurous but is always wary of places where you don't have any say or choice.  At $120 a person and 1/3rd the price of Brooklyn Fare, we decided to take the gamble and man oh man do we not regret it.  The first thing you need to know going in is that while you are in for a world class meal, this is not like The Modern or Daniel, where there are essentially 5 staff members for every diner (who are so attentive that they know you have to go to the bathroom before you do).  Instead, here you just have 2 people (the chef and her partner) working their asses off to serve a 10 course meal to 14 people. Unlike other equally high caliber restaurants, where there is an army of sous chefs in the kitchen making your meal so the the chef has all the time in the world to come out and chat it up with you, the chef at Take Root is working far too hard to do this.  Nonetheless, we were impressed she did take the time come out and individually, yet albeit briefly, introduce most of the courses to each table.  That being said, give her a break and don't try to start a conversation....just shut-up and dig into the amazing food.  If you really need to have a world class chef falsely stroke your ego while you bore them to death with your oh so impressive food scene knowledge, do us all a favor and go somewhere else.   The second thing you need to know is that this is a tiny space, so they are going to sit you where they need to sit you (they make this very clear on their website).  I recommend making sure you are the first one there so the odds are more in your favor of getting one of the tables.The third thing you need to know is that they will not be showing you the menu in advance, so enjoy the ride as you go into this meal blindly.  The cool thing is that they do give you a hard copy of what you had at the end of the meal, but unfortunately, it is just a basic description, versus the detailed explanation they give you while presenting each dish.  I wish I could have recorded their presentation! I am not going to run down the list of insanely good courses we had, as I could never give it justice.  Just trust me, and understand you will be blown away by both the food and the very inventive presentation.  Also not giving the meal justice are my pictures (it is dark and romantic in there so hard to photograph), but nonetheless, am including in this review just to give you an idea of the incredible range.While the $120 doesn't include alcohol, we were pleasantly surprised that the wine and beer list was very reasonable.  As per their recommendation, we went with a sparkling pinot noir ($40). Yes, sparkling sounded odd to us, but since we were already trusting them on the meal, figured we would go for it and it was fantastic.  Was also impressed they had a Maine Beer Company beer, so had to go for that.Trust me and just make your reservation at Take Root today before it is too late and there is a 2 year waiting list....you will thank me.  I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"I generally prefer small ""mom & pop"" restaurants, tasting menus, and wandering through new areas in BK. I think, at cheaper price point, this would be a 4 star but i can't justify cost with what we got. at $120 per person, it's on par with Momofoku Ko in price ($175 pp) & just about any other city tasting menu. In ingredients, while yes, they were fresh & obscure, most skewed to be vegetables which didn't justify the premium price point. Portion size (while still filling at the end of the meal) were diminutive - we had 4 jawbreaker sized potato croquettes. Service was brisk & clinical but not personable - perhaps it was an off day as everyone else is glowing about it. The ambiance is certainly intimate as it only seats 12 people. We sat at the counter, which usually means you'll be able to talk to the chef etc. But that wasn't the case here so ask for a table. You'll also be more comfortable as i spent much of dinner perched at the edge of the seat but angled so my knees wouldn't hit the counter backing. (i'm 5'8 with about normal proportions for torso:leg)Presentation & food was excellent. everything tasted great & it definitely seemed as each dish involved much thought... and while yes, part of the experience... so is price for value.",3.0
"The concept was great but execution hit the mark. For such an intimate setting, the chef provided little to no commentary on the food and just regurgitated what was already on the menu for the night. Comparing it to other Michelin restaurants, like Brooklyn Faire where the chef really took the time to talk to each guest, I didn't get that vibe here. With the price, you are also paying for the experience and it just wasn't there. High price point given the food and experience.",2.0
"Creative and tasty food that features intersting ingredients. I loved the blend of crunchy and soft textures and sweet paired with salty flavors. Service was excellent as the co-owners serve every dish. It's very hard to get a reservation at this 12-seater with only one seating per night. Luckily I got off the wait list. To get an idea of the quality of the food, take a look through my pictures. The most exotic thing I tasted was the lamb tongue.",5.0
"Eating at Take Root is a commitment. You have to make a reservation a month in advance and be prepared to fork over the cost of the meal ($105 per person) if you cancel less than 3 days in advance. You must arrive promptly at 8 and be willing to be surprised by the food since there is no menu online. But if you're serious about food and want to experience a pretty unique dinner, the commitment is definitely worth it.My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday. We arrived about 20 minutes early and were seated at the counter (the restaurant only accommodates 12 people and you are told via e-mail in advance where you'll be sitting). Dinner service doesn't begin until 8, but the owners will bring you beer or wine while you wait. Once dinner starts, you will be served in the order you arrived. In this day and age, everyone is used to looking at menus online before going out to eat, so there's virtually no element of surprise involved in eating anymore. This is why I loved the fact that we had no idea what to expect at Take Root. Needless to say, the surprises were all delicious. In order, here's what we had:--*Mussels with mustard seed and fennel frond --*BBQ flavored beet with hickory and chicken egg yolk --Butternut squash with coriander, chocolate mint, and butternut tea --*Sweet potato crisps with yukon gold potato dip with trout roe --Duck breast with pearl onions, walnuts, and black garlic--Diver scallops with cabbage, pear, sorrel, and mustard greens--*Sunchokes with eucalyptus, chestnut, and truffle--Lamb with wheatberry, cauliflower, and olive berry--Labneh with grapefruit ice--*Chamomile ice cream with molasses and honeyThose of us sitting at the counter also got a lamb belly fritter. And everyone received a mini apple pie (sort of like an apple pie cookie) after the final course. Everything was great, but the dishes marked with asterisks above were my favorites. If you're like me and want to remember everything you ate, don't worry. They will give you a copy of the menu at the end of the meal.Both of the owners are gracious and attentive. You can tell they put a lot of care into everything they do. Eating here was a special experience--one that is worth the wait and the cost. I certainly hope to return at some point in the future.",5.0
"Take Root offers an affordable, quality tasting menu in a casual, yet intimate environment. This cozy storefront turns into a 14 seat gourmet experience three nights a week at the expert hands of Elise and Anna. Reservations are a must. The only ""con"" is the location which is a hike from the subways and has tricky street parking - but that means there should be more tables for me!Perry L. and I opted to try Take Root for our staycation special meal. I love tasting menus - the variety, the beautiful plating, the clever flavor pairings you would have never imagined. Tasting menus are an invitation to open your palate's horizons and you don't have to lift a finger or make any decisions!We entered Take Root in the middle of a downpour, wet and not a little grumpy. We were ten minutes late because the walk took longer than we thought. Ana greeted us warmly when we entered, the last party of the evening, and happily took our sopping wet umbrellas and got us a drink.  (They do offer several wines, but opted for Boylan's ginger ale.) The intimate homey environment allowed us to relax, chill out after our hectic walk, and enjoy the soundtrack to a pleasant evening. The dress code is lax for a meal so fine - many of us were in jeans, a few in blazers or dresses. A pair were having an anniversary meal. The largest group was a table for 6 - I would guess the largest party they could accommodate at one table is 8. The courses are paced well and portions are small, but for eleven different dishes, there was plenty of food without feeling like a stuffed turkey at the end. Every dish was plated with care and Elise takes time to explain each dish's ingredients. She also was cognizant of the allergies we wrote in our reservation (she can't make too many substitutions, but she will leave things out if you may have problems). The courses:Malt vinaigrette potato croquette with caviarRadishes with ramp yogurt and chicken skin saltFennel and black garlic encrusted sweetbreadsFresh loaf of bread with whipped brown butterCured asparagus in macadamia olive oil soup with coriander blossomsMorels with hickory smoked musselsSpring green pea tortellini with chocolate mint leavesHudson valley duck with chickweed and sweet onion puree and lobster sauceGala apples with goat milk emulsionCoffee mouse w/ toasted coconut, lucky sorrel, and chocolate ganacheChamomile shortbread sandwich cookie with milk jam (caramel)Each dish was incredible. I enjoyed every single one of them. And Elise and Anna pour a lot of love into their work together, which seals the deal for me!They are in the New York Times here:  nytimes.com/2013/08/28/d…I would recommend Take Root wholeheartedly for a special meal. Maybe a proposal in Brooklyn Bridge Park, then a lovely meal here. Or celebrating a parent's milestone birthday. Take Root's $85 tasting menu isn't cheap for an average meal, but for a tasting menu of this caliber and for the right occasion, I find it well worth it.",5.0
"Care.It's a simple word, but one that permeates every aspect of dining at Take Root. From the food (exemplary) to the wine list (curated), the service (immaculate) and ambiance (intimate). Each step Take Root makes is full of care, full of precision, and each bite from Elise's kitchen is oh. so. delicious.One thing I particularly enjoyed about the Take Root is the reverence of my fellow diners for each aspect of Take Root. This restaurant invites the kind of folk who, simply, worship food. No pretense.I was not in a large stuffy restaurant looking around nervously at the other tables to see if my clothes were fancy enough (aka: me @ Le Bernardin last month); I was not in a typical Brooklyn trend-spot hoping the drink/dish I ordered was cool enough to impress my waitress (Does everyone in Brooklyn have to wear that many accessories? Am I going to be deported from this borough for liking rose wine??) For the record, rose is a GREAT choice to go with this nuanced and eclectic menu.Each time a new course came out, voices became hushed, we strained to peek at the lucky diners who received it first (Democratically, they serve patrons in the order that you arrive). When Elise or Anna shared what went into each dish, we listened, earnestly. It was a unique experience. Neither of them explained what was most obvious- each course came had a cloud of Care floating above the plate, dreamy enough already but further frothed with giddiness & love.And all that is necessary because they recently raised the price from $85 to $105, which, for me, takes the meal from ""Oh I can splurge on this if I skip wine & tighten my belt for a few weeks!"" to ""Do I deserve this Splurge? (Capital S there)  Umm..."" I don't know the answer to that. But if the question is, ""Do i recommend Take Root?"" YES. Unequivocally.",5.0
"Without a doubt one of the most intimate and special dining experiences I've ever had.  Joe chose this as my birthday dinner and he couldn't have picked a better place.  With tables for only 12, and a soundrack set to ""woo"", Take Root is romance central.With only a chef and one server (I believe they are a couple - another notch on the romance-o-meter!) everything is personal and special.  The chef brings over every dish, lovingly explaining her inspiration.  The tasting menu is seasonal so you probably won't get what I had - but some highlights for me:- the salt and pepper potato pop (my words), with caviar amuse bouche - its like condensing a traditional British fish and chips with salt and vinegar into a single, precious mouthful of BANG!- I also absolutely adored the little sunchoke parcels bathing in a pool of fragrant mushroom and eucalyptus.  I'd never have believed it possible, but this worked beautifully and was the very epitome of a wintery meal.- also the finale of duck breast presented with two carrot jous (or is that jouses) - one from the carrots and one from the carrot tops.  The juxtaposition of the bright green and orange look amazing and tasted just as good.Honestly I could was lyrical about every course - but you get the idea.  Its wonderful, worth a visit and with a reasonable by the glass wine list, you really can't go wrong!",5.0
"Absolutely amazing, a splurge that was totally worth it! Came here on a rainy Saturday with the boyfriend. The ambiance is nice - the restaurant is lit well enough to see the food, the music is just the right volume where you can hear your date talk but not necessarily every other word being said at the other tables, and the décor is charming. This is not a party atmosphere, nor is it super overtly romantic, but the room has a definite warm glow-y buzz as the clientele seemed to be all couples and everyone seemed really into the food.The food is unbelievable - some dishes are mindblowing in their flavor combinations, others are for their high level of execution. I have never had better octopus or ice cream in my life, and the butternut squash tea soup with husk cherries blew my mind. The care in which both the chef and front of the house take in explaining the dish to each table shows how much pride they take in their craft. The service toes that perfect line between attentive and unobtrusive. The playlist rocks. The wine list is great as well, plenty of reasonable options. We will be back for another special occasion, if we can even score another reservation.Tip: We got there exactly at 8, but felt like we were a little behind as other tables had drinks and snacks. In the future, I'd try to get there around 7:45. Also, the neighborhood is charming and good for a post-meal walk!",5.0

All in all, you won't regret visiting this well ran establishment and taste some great food without dealing with much formality.  I'm just expecting and hoping for more and would like to try again when the menu changes.",4.0

It's a pre-fixe menu, and they only have one beautiful wooden, communal table in the restaurant, which seats ten people. They take reservations from various people and we all share in this gastronomic experience as a story is told in scents, textures and flavors over a seven course meal. It's poetry brought tears to my eyes....All art overwhelms me, but the culinary craft can be experienced through taste as well as through the other senses which makes for a truly immersive journey. I doubt anything could be better than a well articulated meal that is both visually enchanting and sensual to consume. Take Root delivers on every account. I can't wait to go back to enjoy other delicacies in the near future!",5.0
