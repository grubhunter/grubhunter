"This is how it's done right. Before you even get to the food, the main thing about Michael's is they are there to take care or you the moment you walk in the door. Tired of modern Brooklyn cuisine that may be good but your hosts could care less you are there and want you out the door ASAP? Come relax here for a while and be reminded what dining out used to be like. And it of course helps that the food is outstanding, the bar knows how to mix a good cocktail, and the wine list won't disappoint. Their ""Smash Job"" veal parm is the best I've ever tasted. All pasta cooked to perfection. Italian pastries delectable.",5.0
"Michael's is a popular Italian spot in Brooklyn. They are known for their sauce and pastries. They have a spot across the st that sells just bakery items and their sauce can be purchased online or buy a jar while you are there. We were there for a repast so our choices were preselected. What was served was really good. The bread was warm and delicious. The all important soft butter could have been masticated without bread. So good! We started with fried calamari, fried artichokes, mozzarella w/tomatoes & roasted peppers and clams oreganato. Everything was delicious except for the clams. A little too chewy for me. Then the pasta came out. Cooked al dente with vodka sauce. A great choice. The tomato sauce was just ok. Not sure what the hype is about. Mamma makes a better sauce. For entrees I chose the veal. It was average. A little too rubbery. Then the dessert arrived...their famous pastries...all of them were fresh and delicious...completely devoured in no time. Service was exceptional! Staff was very attentive and friendly. Overall a great experience. A return is a must. ENJOY!",4.0
"Really nice environment with very good staff and live piano but I don't understand the rave reviews for the food. Average tasting braised rib, the chicken was borderline dry, steak was burnt. Mediocre food that doesn't merit a second visit.On the plus side, they did have good bread and cheese.",3.0
"On the occasion of a friend's birthday, I finally had the opportunity to dine at Michael's. It is a very nice restaurant and obviously popular, because there wasn't an empty seat in the house. I loved that the owner and/or manager (not sure about his role) was interacting with his patrons. It was super helpful that another staffer collected our coats as we walked in. I thought it was pretty cool that there was a piano slightly above and adjacent to the bar. The pianist played very softly in the background. The conversations in the dining room was not at all loud. I could enjoy conversing across my table of 10. Our server was so friendly and full of personality. Great, delicious bread to delay the growls of an empty stomach. My favorite was the one that tasted similar to bread and marinara sauce. With a full house, you can expect the arrival of your food to be delayed. I ordered the chicken parmigiana (breaded, fried chicken then covered with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese) and a small plate of potatoes and vegetables for $25.  Please note any additional sides like pasta costs $5 extra. I can definitely say that when you dine at Michael's, you are paying for the name and quality depending on the dish. I felt my dish was overpriced. I love dessert, but resisted the urge since I didn't think the portion of tiramisu for example was worth $8.50.  Great ambience. Ideal for families. Wonderful that there was an ADA restroom on the main level and additional restrooms below. Spacious and clean.",4.0
"For years when I was growing up in the neighborhood, Michael's was this big, mysterious brick outpost of old-school fine-dining. Most of my experience with Italian food in Brooklyn was pizza-related, and when we did splurge, my family tended to take our money to the Russian dinner-and-a-show event spaces in Sheepshead Bay/Brighton Beach.Recently, we came for my nephew's high school graduation and I finally had a chance to rub shoulders with the neighborhood regulars who have been patronizing this institution for years. Michael's occupies a large floor with the timeless staples of Italian-American fine dining"" wall mirrors, round white tablecloth tables, and muted lighting, the kind my grandparents used to create with their dimmer in the living room whenever I visited. The waiters are decked out in formal wear, a veritable team with its captain overseeing proceedings.The food is solid across the board. If you like red sauce, you'll be very happy here, as Michael's makes its own, and ladles it on pretty much everything. Many in our party had pasta, which is a pretty unassailable choice here. Though it was Friday night, I went with something called ""Sunday Plate"" from the specials menu. It was a lot of everything meat: veal sausage, lamb, pork, and prime rib. A real gut-buster, and I had plenty to spare for the next day.Extensive wine list. Prices are definitely inflated, but it's a nice place to bring your family who appreciate old-time Brooklyn Italian dining.",4.0
"Ok it's the Sunday after Christmas and we are in a mood to try a new place. I've been driving past Michael's for 30 years and never dropped in.  I knew the guy who owned this place a long time ago. After checking the Yelp reviews we're finally here.  Our waiter Gabriel says the restaurant will be showcased on the Food Network in 2016, as one of the top five Italian restaurants.  Ok we're getting psyched.We've started with minestrone soup and baked clams.  Clams are fresh and baked just perfectly. The soup is robust with all the ingredients    Absolutely wonderful!!Then followed by the Australian rack of lamb and veal alla Michael. The veal is thin tasty topped with scrimp mozzarella and spinach.  My son says the lamb is just like grandma would make. It really was deliciously unique!Well this place lives up to it extraordinary reputation.  Five STARS!!",5.0
Michael's of Brooklyn is my #1 spot to go to when out with my friends. The service is always great & the food is always on point. I usually get pasta with one of their amazing sauces but tonight I wanted fish & I got the Salmon with Crab Meat in a Mustard Dill Sauce & of course it was DELICIOUS!,5.0
I buy the sauce (yum) in local Albertson's in south OC/CA-but never realized that it was a block and a half from my grandmother's old house until now...must visit when in Brooklyn :),4.0
"Probably the best Italian food I've ever had. My dad was in town from Philly & he buys their sauce in the grocery store, so we had to check it out. I made a reservation for 12, but we got there a little early. They let us in and seated us anyway even though they didn't even open until noon!Fast, prompt service & an incredibly attentive staff made this such an enjoyable lunch. It was great to talk to staff & owner!",4.0
"Growing up in south Brooklyn there is no shortage of Italian food, we Truly know good Italian food. That being said there isn't a large selection of upscale resturants like Michaels around. I have been coming here for most of my life. The people are very sweet and remember you when you walk in, the waiters are very classy and great at timing. They also could have a good conversation with you if you'd like.As for the food ... I am a fanatic for their vodka sauce it by far is the best vodka sauce I've ever had and I have had a hell of a lot. My mother raves about the bacon wrapped scallops (I don't eat pork but she's very picky so that speaks volumes). Everything I've had has been great and I love the almond biscottis that they bring out for dessert they are ridiculously good. Being that michaels also has a bakery there is plenty of dessert options and if you stop over at the bakery make sure to pick up some cannolis. You can't beat this place",5.0

"Amazing place, the food is out of this world.  I ordered a dish Sunday Dinner, comes with 3 different types of meat, lamb, sausage, and beef cooked in gravy (tomato sauce) with a side of pasta of your choice.  This dish brought me to tears.  It reminded me of my adopted Nona when she would make this for us.   This place is amazing, everything is wonderful and the service keeps you coming back again and again.",5.0
"Another fantastic meal/night at Michaels of Brooklyn. Our dish of the night was the Veal chop (smashed thin on the bone) lightly fried, fresh handmade mozzarella  with their home made Filetto do Pomodoro :-)  they call it the Smash Job, I call it amazing (my husband has been calling it by the wrong name all this time we found out last night). Whatever you call it - it's a MUST! The veal falls off the bone, you can cut it with a fork and it's Michaels sauce!! Enough said!Other dishes were the Australian Rack of Lamb (out of world this flavor, cooked to perfection & huge portions), 42oz Steak - there wasn't a morsel left on the plate and their always perfect fried filet of sole!No one goes home hungry - ever! Now YELP what happened to my profile, it's gone????",5.0
"Excellent customer service regarding the jarred sauce. If I'm ever in Brooklyn, I'll stop by.",4.0
"Great old school Italian restaurant. The Veal smash job was as advertised, huge portion, tender and delicious and while not on the menu, the chef makes a mean fettuccini Alfredo. Great wait staff (Cara you're the best) keeps your glasses full and takes care of you like you're in their home.",5.0
"When my grandmother was alive, her house was just blocks from Michael's of Brooklyn, so this restaurant has been a destination of choice for quite literally decades.  I hadn't had the chance to go in years, but had the chance to have lunch here a few weeks ago when my husband and I were in town visiting family.The restaurant was insanely crowded on a Sunday at lunch due to several large first communion celebrations, but the staff took it all in stride.  Service at Michael's has always been impeccable.  Our group ordered way too much food for the table, but things I remember being ordered include:--grouper special-- my husband ordered this and said it was quite good.  He ended up with a slightly different variation that what he ordered or intended to order, but it worked out in the end.--chicken marsala-- a very good interpretation of this dish.  Not the best sauce I've ever had, but the mix of mushrooms was excellent and the chicken itself was delicious. This is on the menu as a veal entree, but they're happy to use chicken instead.-- pear arugula salad-- this was a special, and everyone who had it really enjoyed.--fried zucchini flowers-- this was the only dish I would say was a miss.  They just weren't fried quite properly so they were missing the crispiness they really needed.--chicken and eggplant parmesan-- I didn't taste them on this visit, but I grew up ordering them every visit to New York and was told they were just as delicious as they've always been.My only hesitation in giving Michael's five stars is the price.  While the entrees are great and the portions are large, $24 is a lot to ask for chicken parmesan.  Sides and substitutions are also expensive-- I asked for a side of spinach instead of the regular vegetables, but instead got it as an additional side, for a charge of $8.Overall, though, Michael's definitely earns the ""I'm a fan"" rating, and is a lovely spot with great food and excellent service.  I'm always happy to find myself here.",4.0
The first restaurant we planned on visiting tonight didn't work out and we stumbled upon Michaels and I couldn't be happier. It is one of the better Italian restaurants I've been too. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great traditional Italian meal in an intimate atmosphere. I would definitely travel over an hour again to visit this restaurant again. Excellent service and delicious food. Not to mention they give you a complimentary bread meat cheese and olive platter upon being seated and end the meal with Italian biscotti!,5.0

"Having grown up in New Jersey, we are fortunate to have more than our fair share of Italian places to eat.  At the urging of a friend, we went to Michaels of Brooklyn.  Great service, awesome food and an entire staff of people who seem to really enjoy what they are doing and appreciate the business.  I highly recommend Michaels of Brooklyn.  Since I cannot make it to Brooklyn every weekend, I now purchase Michaels of Brooklyn Sauces at my local Shop Rite Store.  They make it right on the premises and that is a nice treat for dinner at home.",5.0

The bread basket they brought to the table was huge, and HOT. They also brought a small plate of antipasto which was nice. Everyone's food came out quickly, and without error. I ordered the Penne Vodka, which was really good and the serving was huge. My husband had the Chicken Francese, moy mom had the Veal Scallopini, my father-in-law the Fisherman's Platter (which was HUGE) and my mother in law the Pasta Puttanesca.

My hubby had clams.  Main dish was pasta which was prefect. We topped the whole meal off with the most delicious chocolate molten cake with ice cream.   Yummy.  Michael 's never disappoints.",5.0
"I can't say enough about Michaels and how good it is, this is the rare occasion when a 6th star would be helpful! If you are looking to get a little spendy and enjoy some top of the line Italian cuisine you have to make it to the border of Marine Park and Midwood and give Michael's a shot. You can't miss it when crossing Nostrand and Avenue R, it's an old looking place with a blue awning and from the outside you would think you are heading into an outdated place, but it's farther from the truth. The dimly lit restaurant has stone walls and a bar when you first walk in, along with a stack of sauce jars that you can purchase, and when you try it you will want to bring a jar or two home!It's one big room with tables everywhere, but they are not cramped together, On weekends there may be a wait because it's VERY busy, and they do not accept reservations for parties less than 4. If you have a group larger than 4 you will need a reservation for sure. Now let's get to the fantastic food!Before you even order, you will be greeted with a big basket of bread, focaccia and crackers, along with a dish of mixed olives, artichoke hearts, cheese and sun dried tomatoes, it's all amazing and you could fill up on this pretty fast but you'll want to save some bread for later (see below).There's so much to choose from! I suggest taking a few minutes to look things over because there's a diverse list of items that might catch your eye. They have a list of specials on the menu too, although it doesn't seem to change much. My favorite all time appetizer is their shrimp, crab and avocado salad, it comes lumped together with the avocado and shrimp sitting in the delicious lump crab with a light glaze of oil, Believe me when I say this is my favorite appetizer of any Italian restaurant, it is that good (and not too big, it takes up only half the dish but packs so much flavor that it's worth it). Other appetizers to try are the hot or cold antipasto, the walnut goat cheese salad and the grilled octopus, which is also on the small side but worth a try. Also coming close to my favorite app is the eggplant rollatini, it's a big dish for an app and the ricotta inside is so creamy and dreamy I can taste it as i'm typing! I often times make my wife order it so I can get a taste of two of my favorites!I've had so many main courses at Michael's and loved them all, everything from the swordfish to the salmon to a simple fettuccine alfredo dish, but my favorite is the fisherman's platter. Get ready for this, it's a massive plate that you will never finish in one sitting, and comes with lobster, giant shrimp, mussels, clams and un-breaded calamari over linguine with Michael's signature spicy sauce. They take a little while to make this dish to make sure the flavors from the lobster and clams blend in with the sauce, and it all comes out to a masterpiece! You'll want to save some of the bread or focaccia (or ask for more) because you will be so addicted to the sauce and all you will want to do is dip!You won't finish that dish, so be smart and save some for home and ask for an extra serving of focaccia bread to go with it. For dessert my favorite is the lemon sorbet with fruit, but you can also go with the warm apple crumb with ice cream which is a big dessert dish and would be good for sharing or go for the reliable tartufo. I can't say enough about Michael's to justify how good it is, give it a try one day and you will thank me later!",5.0
"We had a birthday luncheon for my mom there.  It was pretty decent in décor, clean and the wait staff was very nice -- on the ball!!!The food was good, and since we had about 30 people (give or take), it was amazing that everything turned out good.  Usually with some places and big groups, some order gets lost in the kitchen, but not here.The food was pretty darn good too.  They provided us with the cake as well, and that was delicious! They also have a full bar.  It's worth the trip, especially if you have a group.",4.0

"Watched the videos and can't believe the chef doble contaminated the wooden board with raw chicken, you can't just simply wipe it off with a dish towel and proceed to chop everything else on the raw chicken board.  Then he continued to use the raw chicken dish towel to cook and wipe with.  Bad, that's how you spread salmonella!",3.0

"Ever since my mother got sick, we decided that life is too short and realized that money isn't everything. We started to frequently go to michaels, which is hands down one of the best restaurants in the marine park area. It then became our choice for Christmas Day each year, and we have continued to keep the tradition. The lobster fra diavolo is my dish of choice, however they can make anything you virtually wanted and it's absolutely worth every penny. If you are in the area, this is truly a place you can't miss. The only downside is that the place has no windows! But the live piano music makes up for it! Cheers!",5.0
"They don't need my review, but im going to write it anyway. Michael's is a wonderful restaurant that I would recommend to anyone. I've been here twice now, and have had a great experience both times.Tonight,  I had the Lobster Crepe special, which was out of this world. It was so decadent and delicious, it was well worth the price. I had the filet of sole francese, which was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. For dessert,  I had a lovely, moist (but not soggy!)tiramisu. The staff was very attentive and made sure I was well taken care of -- often dropping by my table to ask how I was doing or to wish me a cheerful ""bon appetit!""Michael's is a bit on the pricey side for everyday dining,  but this is absolutely a Brooklyn institution everyone should visit at least once.",5.0
"Very smooth Cabernet Sauvignon red wine along with our fresh, crisp green apple, walnut & arugula salad that had a zesty low cal dressing which made the salad spectacular. I also had grilled calamari as an appetizer, it was seasoned perfectly, no sauce needed it melted in your mouth. My entree was grilled salmon, the portion was on the smaller side, but marinated with a zesty taste & prepared medium rare, it was excellent. The grilled vegetable medley was on the small side with carrots, spinach, dessert was traditional Italian cookies with a double espresso",5.0
"Visited this restaurant a few times and enjoyed the food, so we took a chance and set up a large b-day dinner.   Mistake. Food was cold, wrong orders, and we were shoehorned into a too-space space despite the fact that the restaurant was 75% empty and we had made the reservation weeks in advance.   The manager/owner could not be bothered to check on us once, and when we approached him with a simple question, he was rude and basically walked away.   The wait staff was awesome and we showed our appreciation to them, but Michael's has seen my last dollar.",2.0
"Came here on the 12th with my husband to celebrate the start of our vacation as well as our upcoming anniversary.  We were immediately seated and Enzo had our drinks in front of us like magic.  That is one of the best things that I love about this place, they have a wonderful eye for detail and make you feel special and catered to.  This time I had a crab, shrimp and avocado salad that was amazing.  The chunks of crab mixed with large bites of shirmps, the smooth yet firm avocado cubes, all kept together by a light creamy mayo type of dressing was so good that my mouth is salivating as I write this. My hubby had clams.  Main dish was pasta which was prefect. We topped the whole meal off with the most delicious chocolate molten cake with ice cream.   Yummy.  Michael 's never disappoints.",5.0

"For Christmas dinner, a companion and I decided to venture deep into Brooklyn to try a place that we hadn't before.  Michael's is a place that my parents went to years ago when they lived in this area.  It wasn't their go-to, as they found it a little expensive with the food not being great.  However, that was then when there were dozens of old school Italian restaurants across Brooklyn.  Today only a handful remain.  Looking at the reviews here, it looks like Michael's held up well and even modernized with some newer dishes.  Given that we gave it a shot.  Walking in, you can tell this is very much a regulars place.  Stucco ceilings, wood paneling separating the bar from the dining area, and a whole lot of Christmas decorations.  We got seated almost immediately, which was good because it filled up soon thereafter (including a large party room in the basement by the bathrooms).  Service was good, although it was very obvious that they were trying to maximize their tips.  Negronis were on the small side.  The atmosphere was perfect for the occasion and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  However, my parents may have been right about the food.One nice thing is the bread basket and antipasti Michael's gives you.  When you sit down, the bread basket they give you has breadsticks, Italian bread, and some garlic crackers as well.  To go with this are little dishes of olives, salame and provolone.  It's not much, but it doesn't have to be.  It's a very nice addition to the meal.  We got an order of baked clams and crab, shrimp avocado salad that everyone here seems to like for starters.  The salad was the easy winner.  The crab meat was served in big chunks and was nice and fresh.  The shrimp was great too, but a bit skimpy on the portion.  Avocado was left in chunks and there wasn't too much of it; just enough to contrast the textures of the shrimp and the crab.  Overall a very well made dish.  The baked clams were mediocre.  Too much breadcrumbs, a tasteless broth underneath them, a little on the tough side...not impressive for an old school Italian restaurant at all.For a main, I got the lobster fra diavolo.  The lobster was fresh and good quality, although the claws were a bit uncooked which was a first for me.  I enjoyed it regardless.  The fra diavolo, normally a spicy, bold sauce, was muted and only mildly spicy.  Linguini was on the firm side at least.  This was priced well for an entree around $30 to be fair.  The other one got a black squid ink linguini special that came with calamari.  I didn't try any, and she didn't come close to finishing the huge portion although she insisted it was good.  My dining companion later insisted on a creme brulee.  That isn't my favorite dessert and I have no idea why you'd order that in an Italian restaurant, and as you could expect it was just okay.  We didn't finish it.  I also got a dessert drink that consisted of amaretto, espresso and vanilla ice cream.  For what it was, it was very good and a good change of pace.Michael's definitely got some things right, but based on what I saw it isn't the amazing old school Italian restaurant that some seem to think it is.  It's good, but not great.  Actually, they seem to do modern dishes better than the classics, especially reading through the reviews here.  Stick to the specials and the more unique dishes I supposed.  Michael's may have been open since 1964, but they're better as a modern Italian restaurant.  One thing that was a pleasant surprise was the prices.  It was $150 for 2 including tip which is Manhattan pricing.  Given that this is fancy for the area, I had a few drinks, and the quantity of food, it was a good value.  I'd come back here if I was in the neighborhood for some reason and craving Italian food, but generally I'll be sticking to my go-to's.",3.0

I had the Lasagna, and a side of the spinach. Try not to fill up on the olives, bread and cheese. Good luck because the cheese is fantastic.

The super polite waiter remembered everyone's orders aside from the bunch I ordered to share family style (we had 9 people) and also gave us a free dessert on the house that my cousin inquired about! We also embarrassingly asked for a box to take the complimentary almond biscotti to go since they were so yummy and were given an extra box! Aside from that, the food was really good and the ambiance is really nice. I especially liked the penne with tomato & basil sauce and the calamari. The portions of pasta weren't as big as I expected, which is really a good thing. We were able to finish everything we ordered, which is always a happy accomplishment.

"Friday, February 6, 2015.  Lunch at Michael's:  We all met at 12:30pm.  We left at 4:45pm.  There were five of us.  Drinks, appetizers consisted of fried calamari, fried egg plant, crabmeat cocktail, lobster bisque, baked claims and mussels.  The mussels needed a little more garlic.  Other than that everything was perfect.  Entrees consisted of ravioli in tomato and basil sauce and linguine in white clam sauce.  After lunch espresso, coffee and Sambuca Romana, tiramisu, tartufo, spumoni and regular ice cream.  The food and the good conversation just flowed.  It was a meal that I will not soon forget.  This restaurant is about the best I have ever been in.  I have lived in several cities in both this country and Canada, this is the top.  The service is excellent.  The atmosphere elegant.  You are never rushed.  I cannot thank the owners and employees more.  My friends cannot wait to come back to this gem.",5.0

We've driven by so many times, and it looks so unassuming on the outside. But we finally got it together after 20+years in Brooklyn, made a reservation, and can't wait to return.",5.0

"My boyfriend surprised me by taking me to Michael's again for the third time. We always come here for a special occasion. Last year, we came here for my 23rd birthday and it was absolutely perfect and came here also for our half year anniversary.Michael's is still as beautiful as I remembered from our visit last summer. Elegant. Classy. Romantic. Classical Music. My boyfriend made early reservations so the wait didn't take long at all. We started off with some bread and bread sticks which was a wide selection. There were also a few light appetizers - olives, cheese, and slices of pepperoni or sausage. I didn't touch too much on these. The Valentine's Day Menu Special had a variety of items to choose from. First, you select your entree which are in the range of $40-$70 and this encompasses the appetizer you order, a signauture salad, after-dinner beverage, and Valentine's Day Dessert platter.My boyfriend ordered a fried calamari with marinara sauce as an appetizer and a linguine with white clam sauce for an entree.For my appetizer, I ordered a mini meatball with ricotta cheese. This was a new appetizer that I haven't really tried before so I decided to order it. I'm battling a horrible cold right now, so I wasn't allowed to eat anything fried and nothing else appealed to me really. The mini meatballs were absolutely delicious and way better than the ones you used to eat in elementary school. They were soft and moist just the way I like it!For my entree, I decided to try something new: Veal marsala. I never really had veal and chicken marsala wasn't on the menu so I tried out the veal marsala. I must admit I wasn't too crazed about this dish after I tried some of the veal. I didn't really like the texture too much cause it was chewy and I'm so used to having chicken marsala cause the chicken is smooth, soft, and easy to chew. The veggie sides were light and I enjoyed them very much.The Valentine's Day dessert platter wasn't what I expected cause I was expecting something nicely plated and like a trio of desserts. Basically it was a velvety and chocolatety cake, chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate candy, biscotti, and some whip cream. The presentation wasn't too elegant, but my favorite part was the chocolate covered strawberries! I love them and they're such a romantic piece of food.All in all, a great dinner shared with the one I love! Although I'm still battling with my cold, we made the best out of the dinner as possible and I loved every moment of it.I highly recommend Michael's if your looking to bring your loved one or family for a nice, sit-down, and formal dinner. This is a great restaurant, with service that's to the point, and top notch food.",4.0
"This restaurant is amazing. The food is excellent and the service is wonderful. I got the chicken rollatini it was outstanding! Others got the lasagna, pasta dishes, ravioli. everything was delicious. They give you lots of bread (focaccia, rolls, sliced bread and cheese, olives and salami) to start with!! The atmosphere is nice. Very laid back but super friendly. Nice big round tables for a family night out. I would recommend eating at this restaurant anytime you are in Brooklyn!!",5.0

Excellent spot. So glad we found it. The service was great. The food arrived miraculously fast and was delicious. The crowed was mostly big groups my wife and I enjoyed it though I think we were the only couple there and the rest were groups. The place looked big enough that you might not have to make a reservation. We just walked in and I am glad we did.,5.0
"I could spend 10000 characters writing about my Dinner at Michael's with my entire Italian family but I will not. Lets just say, for a table of 10 Italians to all say this was the best Italian dining experience they've ever had, that says something. Advice: Get anything. It was all fantastic. I had the Lasagna, and a side of the spinach. Try not to fill up on the olives, bread and cheese. Good luck because the cheese is fantastic. The wine was great, the dessert was great, and Enzo made us all feel very welcome and shared some great conversations. The whole ambiance of the place makes you feel like you walked onto the set of Goodfellas, except no one gets shot. Easy 5 star rating.",5.0
"5 stars for the great service! The super polite waiter remembered everyone's orders aside from the bunch I ordered to share family style (we had 9 people) and also gave us a free dessert on the house that my cousin inquired about! We also embarrassingly asked for a box to take the complimentary almond biscotti to go since they were so yummy and were given an extra box! Aside from that, the food was really good and the ambiance is really nice. I especially liked the penne with tomato & basil sauce and the calamari. The portions of pasta weren't as big as I expected, which is really a good thing. We were able to finish everything we ordered, which is always a happy accomplishment. And to end the dinner, we had 5 (+1 free) desserts, of which the warm cookie with vanilla ice cream and profiteroles stood out to me the most. :)",5.0
"Friday, February 6, 2015.  Lunch at Michael's:  We all met at 12:30pm.  We left at 4:45pm.  There were five of us.  Drinks, appetizers consisted of fried calamari, fried egg plant, crabmeat cocktail, lobster bisque, baked claims and mussels.  The mussels needed a little more garlic.  Other than that everything was perfect.  Entrees consisted of ravioli in tomato and basil sauce and linguine in white clam sauce.  After lunch espresso, coffee and Sambuca Romana, tiramisu, tartufo, spumoni and regular ice cream.  The food and the good conversation just flowed.  It was a meal that I will not soon forget.  This restaurant is about the best I have ever been in.  I have lived in several cities in both this country and Canada, this is the top.  The service is excellent.  The atmosphere elegant.  You are never rushed.  I cannot thank the owners and employees more.  My friends cannot wait to come back to this gem.",5.0

I'm dreaming of my next meal and it's only hours since we finished dining  Our party shared burrata, an outrageously good stuffed artichoke and a tricolore salad.Entrees of seafood risotto, a veal with mozzarella and shrimp, the Sunday dinner (bracciole, sausage, meatball, braised beef in red sauce...so so delicious). We've driven by so many times, and it looks so unassuming on the outside. But we finally got it together after 20+years in Brooklyn, made a reservation, and can't wait to return.",5.0

"My boyfriend surprised me by taking me to Michael's again for the third time. We always come here for a special occasion. Last year, we came here for my 23rd birthday and it was absolutely perfect and came here also for our half year anniversary.Michael's is still as beautiful as I remembered from our visit last summer. Elegant. Classy. Romantic. Classical Music. My boyfriend made early reservations so the wait didn't take long at all. We started off with some bread and bread sticks which was a wide selection. There were also a few light appetizers - olives, cheese, and slices of pepperoni or sausage. I didn't touch too much on these. The Valentine's Day Menu Special had a variety of items to choose from. First, you select your entree which are in the range of $40-$70 and this encompasses the appetizer you order, a signauture salad, after-dinner beverage, and Valentine's Day Dessert platter.My boyfriend ordered a fried calamari with marinara sauce as an appetizer and a linguine with white clam sauce for an entree.For my appetizer, I ordered a mini meatball with ricotta cheese. This was a new appetizer that I haven't really tried before so I decided to order it. I'm battling a horrible cold right now, so I wasn't allowed to eat anything fried and nothing else appealed to me really. The mini meatballs were absolutely delicious and way better than the ones you used to eat in elementary school. They were soft and moist just the way I like it!For my entree, I decided to try something new: Veal marsala. I never really had veal and chicken marsala wasn't on the menu so I tried out the veal marsala. I must admit I wasn't too crazed about this dish after I tried some of the veal.

Very disappointed with the food on Easter sunday. The Veal entres were not prepared properly and looked if it was frozen or came out of a box with cheese and/or mushrooms placed on top. The Veal was not tender and over cooked. Had to use a knife to cut.The certain entrees were not warm when served.  Overall the food was not worth it and too pricey for what was served.  It not good idea to dine on a holiday. Serve is not the best and waiters were not able to handle the pack house.  Had to ask several times just for water or a drink.  Not a place I would recommend. there are to many good place that know how to prepare an Italian meal.Disappointed....,1.0

"Coming here from Berkeley was like visiting another planet.  My parents have been going here for decades, but somehow I had never visited before.  The ""other planet"" aspect mostly has to do with the ambiance, which I'd have some trouble describing.  (See the other reviews, however.)  Let's just say that you feel a bit as if you're in a movie.The food was actually quite good.  I started with one of the specials, a fava bean puree with grilled portobello mushroom.  This was delicious!  Then I had quite a bit of some lentil soup that was another one of our starters -- the portion was enormous.  My main dish was a pair of soft shell crabs that had been sauteed with garlic; again, this was really good.  The other mains on the table were pieces of grilled fish that I found ""A-OK"" but not exceptional in any way.  Somehow with all of this we managed to order a small side of angel hair pasta; in addition, each main dish came with a side dish of vegetables.The bottom line: I ingested a month's worth olive oil and garlic at one sitting but figured that this was alright because I hadn't had much lunch on the plane.I got two wines by the glass, one $9 and one $10.  The Chilean sauvignon blanc was not a disaster, and the Sardinian red was quite interesting.  I steered around the Kendall-Jackson chardonnay in order to get to these two choices, which I thought were optimal.The main dishes ranged from $22 (crabs) to $28-29 (fish).  The prices are a tad on the high side, but they take care of you pretty well.I should return to check out the business across the street for lunch: they specialize in Chinese and Tex-Mex food.  You can get tacos and egg rolls on one plate!!",3.0

"This place is a Brooklyn staple and yet I hadn't eaten here ever until just last week. The food and service is top notch, although the prices are a bit on the expensive side for a local, Marine Park restaurant. However, you do truly get what you pay for here, so even if it will likely cost an average of $40 a person for just an entree and a few shared appetizers (without any alcoholic drinks ordered), it is definitely worth it. The meal starts off with complimentary bread basket and assortment of cold antipasti, including olives, parmesan crumbles and sopresatta. It ends with complimentary biscotti from their bakery across the street. In between, there is a fine choice of true, authentic homemade Italian dishes including rabbit, chicken rollatini, veal scaloppini and a fisherman's platter served in fra diavlo sauce. I'd recommend Michael's as a place for a romantic date or to celebrate a special occasion. It's not the type of restaurant that an average working man can afford to frequent multiple times a month, but it's really a nice treat in an area of Brooklyn that isn't necessarily well know for their high-end culinary offerings. A true hidden gem that you should definitely check out! I definitely plan on returning here soon.",4.0

My family owns a similar type restaurant in LI and I always compare and I have to say I will certainly take the trip to eat here again for leisure...

What ever you do DON'T GO TO THIS RESTAURANTThe biggest rip-off.  So over priced and food is terrible.I went here with my family for my moms 83rd birthday Sunday 10/21/12  they rushed us through the meal so quick I felt like I was at a Chinese restaurant not a fine Italian restaurant.  Then the bill came $600 later for only 7 people without any alcohol crazy.  This is Nostrand ave Brooklyn not the upper east side of NYC.Place needs updates as well  stinky and smelly old carpet.

"Classic, somewhat fancy Brooklyn Italian restaurant. Very good food, very good service. Was very impressed with the array of breads they presented before the meal, as well as a spiced pepperoni-like meat, aged Parmesean bits and olives. Got the mozzarella and corraza for an appetizer, which was good, but was a bit soft for my tastes. I like my mozzarella and corraza a little crispy. My entree was the shrimp oreganata. Yum yum. It was served with a potato croquette and very crisp green beans and carrots. We didn't get dessert there, instead opting to visit their bakery across the street (where I got a divine small slice of red velvet cake), but were served complementary biscotti. They also have a private party room, and I would definitely host a party here.",4.0
Amazing food and service. Interesting decor and nice atmosphere. The only downgrade was overcooked chocolate desert.,4.0
Michael's works hard to be good- I've never had anything but a good meal there. The calamari is delicious as is the shrimp parmesan. I'm pretty sure they are doing something to the shrimp to make them so freaking huge- it's a reasonable $28 as half the plate is enough even for a shrimp lover like me. The service is fantastic- they interact without being intrusive and just treat the customer very well. I just went with a co-worker last week and she is still talking about our meal and already has plans to go back. This place is fine dining. You will not leave hungry. Yes it is a little pricy but this is one place I never feel bad about spending my money at. I am thrilled to see them doing so well even in this horrible economy.,5.0

"Reasonably priced, considering the portion sizes, incredible service, & atmosphere.  Very classy & very nice, w/ valet parking, as well as street parking.  They are the best at what they do for a VERY large radius of south Brooklyn.  YUM !",5.0
"This place is a Brooklyn staple and yet I hadn't eaten here ever until just last week. The food and service is top notch, although the prices are a bit on the expensive side for a local, Marine Park restaurant. However, you do truly get what you pay for here, so even if it will likely cost an average of $40 a person for just an entree and a few shared appetizers (without any alcoholic drinks ordered), it is definitely worth it. The meal starts off with complimentary bread basket and assortment of cold antipasti, including olives, parmesan crumbles and sopresatta. It ends with complimentary biscotti from their bakery across the street. In between, there is a fine choice of true, authentic homemade Italian dishes including rabbit, chicken rollatini, veal scaloppini and a fisherman's platter served in fra diavlo sauce. I'd recommend Michael's as a place for a romantic date or to celebrate a special occasion. It's not the type of restaurant that an average working man can afford to frequent multiple times a month, but it's really a nice treat in an area of Brooklyn that isn't necessarily well know for their high-end culinary offerings. A true hidden gem that you should definitely check out! I definitely plan on returning here soon.",4.0
Food was great..service was amazing..paying $160 bucks on the date was not my first but for this fit defiantly my LSAT lol..I like showing i'm independent lady n paying the bill sometimes but only to a man that deserves it,4.0
"So I YELP'd restaurants in the area bc we were from out of the area and were here for a wake...I saw Some reviews, some good some ehh... So we decided to drive around... After 30 min we passed by Michaels  and decided to just go in bc it was getting late... I have to say that anyone that gave this place a bad review is obviously not Italian lol!! It was AWESOME!! Had the Cesar salad LOVED it... Service was by far way above what you usually get these days... My family owns a similar type restaurant in LI and I always compare and I have to say I will certainly take the trip to eat here again for leisure...

"Very good Italian food but I'm no expert. All I can say is it's gotta be good when the restaurant's sauce is sold in major super markets. I've been coming here very infrequently (maybe once a year) for about a decade and have to say one of the things that impresses me most about this place is their ability to stay the same. The place definitely has old world charm, from the dressed up waiters to the piano player, to the owner who walks around the tables and makes chit chat with the patrons all of whom seem to be frequent visitors and intimate friends of the owner. It's just an awesome spot for this part of Brooklyn.",4.0
"I didn't actually go out to Sheepshead Bay to enjoy Michael's restaurant, but I did enjoy samples of their sauces at WholeFoods Market in Columbus Circle yesterday. I had an hour to kill, so I was there looking for the Wine Cellar sorbets, but ending up finding some really good sauce from Brooklyn.I never made it to the freezer section. I got stopped by some guy from Brooklyn handing out samples of sauce. Michael's from Brooklyn. The sauces were in glass jars, with simple white labels. The sauces were... WOW !!The sauces are made on site at the restaurant by their chef's in a second kitchen they built downstairs just to make the sauce. That day they had arrabiata, a hot pepper sauce with a little heat that was my favorite. They also had marinara sauce, which I was avoiding because most places make a very wimpy marinara. Michael's had chunks of garlic in it. It was anything but limp. Another good one. They also had Tomato and Basil that everyone who was walking up loved. I had Tomato & Basil, right after the hot pepper sauce, so being so mild I could hardly taste it.Didn't get the sauce. I like making my own sauce fresh. And I still have a jar from some other tasting a year ago that was also to die for. I hate bottled sauces. Most of them taste nasty. Like I said, I like making my own. So I get excited when I find sauces that are so good they taste homemade.For those who want an awesome sauce and don't like to cook. Check out Michael's of Brooklyn, at Wholefoods and other local specialty markets. You only $8.99 you get to impress a date with your fine gourmet cooking skills. Just boil the pasta, throw some asparagus in pan with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and some crushed garlic. Shake the pan a couple of minutes to make it look like you're working hard making dinner. Open a bottle of wine. Trust me. Impressive.For me, it means I'll be making a trip to Sheephead's Bay sometime in the future to check out the origin of this impressive sauce.Time ran out. Gotta go. WT worthy.",4.0
"Last night I attended a medium sized dinner party at this restaurant. Before the invite I had never even heard of Michael's. Upon walking in my expectations were pretty high. It looked and sounded very much like an authentic Italian restaurant. From the friendly Italian proprietor who greeted us as we waited for our 15 top table to the low murmur of the patrons accenting their conversations with their hands. From there everything went sour. We simply were there for entrees, and after ordering it took nearly an hour for the food to arrive. Bread was plentiful, but never refilled our water. Everyones' food was unseasoned, with the most egregious example being the salmon that had no flavor whatsoever. I had the Veal Scaloppini Sorrentina. It was cooked quite well, but it lacked spice. We were given the excuse that the poor service was due to a bar mitzvah being hosted next door - I'll chalk our poor food up to that as well.",2.0

The bread is very good but should be eaten sparingly since the meal was out of this world. I had the veal sorrentina which was buttery and crisp in a tomato onion gravy that I would have licked clean if I had no dinner guests.They make these woonderful potato croquettes that are light, soft and crispy.Although I was stuffed and truly uncomfortable I continued to eat. The food was divine . I only weigh 103 so to eat as much as I did , I am still full a day later. I tasted my husband's veal parm which was fantastic; a good gravy, buttery veal with fresh mozzarella.we were given a small sampling of olives, fresh parmesean and soppressata. The food was fresh, delicious and really very good.What was a really nice pleasure was that we were able to talk without hearing any of the other diners. It was an old school classic Italian meal.Was it the atmosphere or that we were lucky not to have any loud diners.I would say it was the restaurant itself that makes you relax, eat and enjoy.As far as the reviewers who were upset they had to wait...... they treat everyone with a courtesy whether you are a first time or a lifer.I loved our meal.

"Why is Michael's Restaurant at Nostrand Avenue and Avenue R not recognized as a top-flight Italian restaurant?  Is it because it's located outside of the fashionable Brooklyn Heights/Park Slope neighborhoods where no reservations, tight quarters, and indifferent atmosphere win accolades?Michael's is spacious, elegant, and comfortable with table spacing that permits civilized conversation.  It has a private dining room downstairs facing its glass wall wine cellar (a collection of thoughtfully chosen, equitably priced wines).  This room sits 20 comfortably -- maybe 24 if they're very friendly.  It also has a catering hall that can serve about 250 people.  A valet-attended parking lot rounds out the physical plant.  It's impressive, but it's not what sets Michael's apart.What sets Michael's apart is the insight of its owners, the quality of its food, and the attitude of its staff.  The second-generation brothers, Freddy and Johnny Cacace have taken their father's vision and refined it.  It's been at the same location for 40 years.The restaurant's conventional menu offers the expected array of Italian dishes lovingly prepared and handsomely presented.  But it's in the ""Specials"" portion of the menu where the restaurant really shines.  The ""Specials"" is populated with interesting, savory dishes some with international influences.  There's an intriguing chunky crab salad blended with tropical fruit; a crunchy dish of pulpo, olives, onions, and garlic; succulent veal or lamb ossobucco; baby sardines with just a hint of olive.  And the best salmon we've eaten anywhere.  (Maybe it's because Johnny buys the entire salmon fresh and fillets it himself.).  These are only a few of the creative, tantalizing choices.  These ""Specials"" change frequently, which is important because Michael's has a large contingent of frequent customers.  We're among them, eating there a couple of times a week.Johnny runs the kitchen, although he's regularly seen in the dining room checking the customers' satisfaction index.  Freddy greets customers and oversees the dining room.  Somewhat casually but continually, he ranges around the room chatting with customers, assuring that they are content, yet keeping a vigilant eye on staff performance.Some of our favorite moments during a busy time are watching Johnny or Freddy (or third generation Michael, who is engaged in the business and shows no weakening of the bloodline) pitch in to rearrange tables, bus tables, flick table cloths, open wine bottles--and generally perform every necessary task, that only owners who live the business do.In the past several months we've eaten at least once at Scarpetta, Perbacco, Centro Vinoteca, Del Posto, Esca, Fiamma, Babbo, and Felidia.  We mention this not to boast but to establish our passion, perspective, and palates for Italian food.  These are all extraordinary (and expensive) restaurants with much to recommend them.  But Michael's deserves a best-in-class award as a Brooklyn neighborhood restaurant",5.0

"Michael's is our favorite restaurant. The food and service is consistently on target. Fine food requires the best ingredients. I read some reviews that state it's pricey for a neighborhood place. If I lived in Williamsburg, Peter Lugers would be a neighborhood place.....right?  Whenever we plan on going to Michael's we always call for reservations, as it can be busy any night of the week and we are regulars there.  We don't feel that entitles us to special treatment.  Courtesy counts!  Love the lobster Luciano with linguine, goat cheese salad, fresh strawberries with whipped cream.  Very yummy.",4.0

"Why is Michael's Restaurant at Nostrand Avenue and Avenue R not recognized as a top-flight Italian restaurant?  Is it because it's located outside of the fashionable Brooklyn Heights/Park Slope neighborhoods where no reservations, tight quarters, and indifferent atmosphere win accolades?Michael's is spacious, elegant, and comfortable with table spacing that permits civilized conversation.  It has a private dining room downstairs facing its glass wall wine cellar (a collection of thoughtfully chosen, equitably priced wines).  This room sits 20 comfortably -- maybe 24 if they're very friendly.  It also has a catering hall that can serve about 250 people.  A valet-attended parking lot rounds out the physical plant.  It's impressive, but it's not what sets Michael's apart.What sets Michael's apart is the insight of its owners, the quality of its food, and the attitude of its staff.  The second-generation brothers, Freddy and Johnny Cacace have taken their father's vision and refined it.  It's been at the same location for 40 years.The restaurant's conventional menu offers the expected array of Italian dishes lovingly prepared and handsomely presented.  But it's in the ""Specials"" portion of the menu where the restaurant really shines.  The ""Specials"" is populated with interesting, savory dishes some with international influences.  There's an intriguing chunky crab salad blended with tropical fruit; a crunchy dish of pulpo, olives, onions, and garlic; succulent veal or lamb ossobucco; baby sardines with just a hint of olive.  And the best salmon we've eaten anywhere.  (Maybe it's because Johnny buys the entire salmon fresh and fillets it himself.).  These are only a few of the creative, tantalizing choices.  These ""Specials"" change frequently, which is important because Michael's has a large contingent of frequent customers.  We're among them, eating there a couple of times a week.Johnny runs the kitchen, although he's regularly seen in the dining room checking the customers' satisfaction index.  Freddy greets customers and oversees the dining room.  Somewhat casually but continually, he ranges around the room chatting with customers, assuring that they are content, yet keeping a vigilant eye on staff performance.Some of our favorite moments during a busy time are watching Johnny or Freddy (or third generation Michael, who is engaged in the business and shows no weakening of the bloodline) pitch in to rearrange tables, bus tables, flick table cloths, open wine bottles--and generally perform every necessary task, that only owners who live the business do.In the past several months we've eaten at least once at Scarpetta, Perbacco, Centro Vinoteca, Del Posto, Esca, Fiamma, Babbo, and Felidia.  We mention this not to boast but to establish our passion, perspective, and palates for Italian food.  These are all extraordinary (and expensive) restaurants with much to recommend them.  But Michael's deserves a best-in-class award as a Brooklyn neighborhood restaurant",5.0
