"I have to say, the best tasting food from the Levant region is served here. Authentic tastes and ambiance. Knafeh was made to order and was out of this world (MUST TRY).One small note, the mansaf dish wasn't really ""authentic"", don't get me wrong, it tastes great but In my my mind a big chunk of lamb should be served rather than smaller pieces, it's a ""tamed"" version of the real mansaf :)one last note, my advice is to order your food without the parsley garnish!",5.0
"Holy Parsley ! Ended up going here for a birthday, (last year) she didn't want what I made reservations for so she slapped me in the face with ""Let's go to Tanoreen!!"". My first reaction was please no, because I can't take all those spices together..my palette doesn't like any of that. We ended up going for the birthday girl. The wait was about 5 minutes & we called last minute so that was cool. Waitress was super friendly. Ordered an awesome gin, cucumber & mint cocktail. Best part of my meal. As soon as we sat they brought us some flatbreads & stuff to dip / eat with it, hummus & olives, eggplant. Not bad. Ordered stuffed grape leaves for an appetizer which were covered in maybe their signature spice, which I didn't like at all & it disappointed me because I love the Greek style ones. Sent it back for the baba ghanouge which was incredible & a huge portion. Waitress was cool & understanding with it & there was no problem at all. For the entree I ordered the Grilled Combo which was a little hard to find under the blanket of parsley they covered it in. It was a lot of food & looked great, til I bit into the meats that were smothered in that signature spice once again which ruined it for me. I ate half of it because at this point I was starving. Not my type of place so I won't be going back but if you like middle eastern spice filled foods this is your spot. 2 1/2 stars.",2.0
"Some good Middle Eastern food. I got full off of the crispy flatbread with herbs (i forgot what it's called.. grr) along with some grape leaves / baba ghanoush.. and still managed to devour some entrees. Sometimes you just need to call up your second (and third) stomachs. We had the Chicken Fetti, Grilled Combo, Cauliflower Steak, Lamb Chops, and Sayadiyya. Would definitely recommend the Sayadiyya (fish dish), lamb chops and the cauiliflower steak. The knafeh is an interesting dessert worth trying.Good service as well. Will come back.",4.0
I ordered food for delivery and I wAnted that shepard pie . I dont know if that's how it should look like but thats what i got . Usually the other ones in the pictures look more crispy .. Plus the taste was not delicious at all . Plain potatoe taste with ground meat inside and that salad had no taste either Overall i was dissapointed !,2.0
"Love, love LOVE this place. Impeccable staff, delicious fare, and great atmosphere makes it a soon-to-be favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. Wish the prices, though decent, are more reasonable.",4.0
Have consistently been impressed by Tanoreen and more so today than any time before. We met Chef Rawia who was gracious enough to let my Molokhia loving children try the Palestinian Molokhia before ordering it since they're more used to the Egyptian minced version. My favorites have always been the shawarma sliders and the musakhan. I find the lemon and sumac in the salads and cold vine leaves to be a little strong but that's a personal preference!,5.0
"A Bay Ridge staple. You have to eat here at least once. The owner runs a tight ship with great takes on Middle Eastern classics. Lovely service and great culinary and sensory experience every time. We came here many times before and will definitely be back. As far as the menu, you can't go wrong.",5.0
"This is by far my favorite place in Bay Ridge and everyone I bring here always agrees.  The food is exceptional and there's a great variety.  The owner is very present and is always walking around the restaurant, stopping at every table to make sure everyone is okay.  The staff and very friendly and responsive.",5.0
"the food here is delicious. All of it. ive had the lamb, chicken, beef, all so deliciously seasoned. ive had eggplant dishes, fish dishes and out of all the times ive been here ive had only one bad meal and they more than made up for it even though it was a bit of headache. but thats because the chef/owner takes so much pride in her food it seemed she couldnt believe that the kitchen put out a bad plate lol. I applaud that passion because it is evident in the food. great place for a date or family meal. i always leave so full and happy.",4.0
"The food here is delicious!  Starting with the first bite, it is an explosion of bursting flavors in your mouth. We ordered a grilled (combo) sampler and all of the meats were tender as well as flavorful, and unlike other Mediterranean/ Middle Eastern restaurants, the spices are not overwhelming and don't linger in your mouth. LOVELY!",4.0
"The environment is great. Service is good. Food is mediocre..every thing we order was extra sour.We had chicken kabob platter, hummus, and feta salad. Every item was drenched in lemon. Will not go back",2.0
During my short stay in NYC I stopped by this place twice in one week. It's a great fresh take on traditionally Arabic food. Definitely try the lamb shank and Brussel sprout. Additionally the restaurant seating is adorable and for quick takeout there is mini fast food version of this restaurant in the back,5.0
"My husband made reservations here for my bday dinner. The service and food were both top notch. Our waiter gave us great recommendations and was courteous and attentive. We started off with the eggplant Napoleon which was delicious! The eggplant was fried perfectly, and even though it was fried the whole dish felt light and fresh. We got the lamb special and the lamb fetti for our entrees. The lamb special was a shank cooked upside down (which I think is what the waiter said), and was super tender and fell off the bones without being fatty. The fetti was a delicious rice dish with crispy pita pieces mixed in which gave it a nice texture. I regretted eating such a big lunch that I didn't have room for their popular knafeh dessert. I always have a second stomach for dessert so I was disappointed in myself. Will have to try it next time!",5.0
"Make a reservation, every day is busy. The service is excellent. All staff are well trained- the bussers clean the tables between courses and kept my water glass filled to the rim, the waitress have wonderful selections. The menu is labeled for gluten and nut-free as well as vegetarian. Food: The table is started with complimentary pita (cold) and toasted and seasoned flat bread. I wouldn't say anything was exceptional, but everything I had was good. The stuffed cabbage, filled with lamb and topped with a lemon sauce, was lighter than I expected. I liked the red pepper and walnut purée but found it lacking something.  I liked the fried halumi, but I thought the veggies it came with should have been seasoned, not just chopped and plopped. The prices are good. I suggest getting a few plates and sharing.",4.0

"People trek to Midwood for DiFara Pizza in a way that is similar to how people trek to Bay Ridge for Tanoreen Middle Eastern food. Tanoreen is the Mecca of Middle Eastern food in NYC. When I had to host a fundraiser in the Park Avenue apartment of a Middle Eastern IBanker's home a few years ago, it was catered by Tanoreen (that was my first foray into this hot spot). If you want to feast with your family on fresh Middle Eastern food, go here because the portions are huge - it is a real family style restaurant! You may have a foodgasm when you dig into your entree and uncover the subtle and interlacing flavors, aromas and textures.  My favorite? Eggplant Napolean!!! o.m.g. I have never had anything like it. Besides that the hummus, labaneh, entrees (especially the lamb, according to my spouse) are really good and authentic. Their lentil soup is chunkier than most Middle Eastern restaurants and uses brown/french lentils (as opposed to the yellow ones), but it is still good. Order the small knafeh for dessert because it is HUGE. TIPS: 1) Make a reservation, because the restaurant is always full. 2) Come with a lot of people and order family style.  The portions are WAY too large for 1-2 people and you will want to order a ton of options. BEWARE: Do not order the Shepherds Pie or other fusion items invented for the Western palate.  They are not the highlight and not what the restaurant specializes in.",5.0
"Vauuuu!!! If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. The food was the best Mediterranean I've tried so far. We got the usual kebabs, falafel, hummus, etc and it was ALL good. They brought out bread and all these dips and the whole shebang. Service was perfect and made our dinner so enjoyable. Prices are great as well. The owner came out to say hello afterwards.

"I am only rating this place based on take out. Me and my co-workers decided to order from this place for lunch. When we called about 11:45am, the lady seemed pretty reluctant to deliver and informed us that their delivery guy doesn't come until 12:30pm and told us we should call back later and place our order  when he arrives so that our food doesn't get cold. I was a bit confused, and asked her if she could maybe take our order and prepare it a little later when the driver arrives, she agreed that would also work. I had suspected that. She then proceeded to call us back at 12:30p and told us the driver came in and our food is being prepared now. We asked if they can make sure they give us plastic utensils and plates incase we wanted to re-heat our food, she proceeded to state that they don't have paper plates or plastic utensils but if we want, the driver can stop by and buy us some paper plates and utensils before he brings us the food. How sweet!but we passed on that. Am I missing something? I mean if you deliver takeout shouldn't plastic utensils be included? I don't know maybe I've become to spoiled by life. Anyway bottom line, food came and it was bad. I had the baked eggplant and it was super oily, very mushy and heavy and under-seasoned. My friend got the Shepard's pie which he felt was very salty. My two other friends got some sort of chicken kabobs. They said it was a little dry. I mean I don't usually have high expectations for takeout, but when I spending close to $25 for eggplant it better be pretty frieken good eggplant. Overall I suspect our takeout were left overs from yesterday or a few nights before.

"Really, I was underwhelmed by this place after hearing about it for years.Excellent hostess and seated quickly, but the simple order of chicken kebob for sharing, took about a half hour to pop out of the kitchen with only one or 2 other tables occupied for this Saturday lunch.First taste of the hummus was good, but decided it was a little too thin and creamy, with too much citric taste.The citric taste overpowered the main entree of chicken, salad and rice.That's just not a taste I like to dominate my food.When considering the food, I can't really say it's worth the premium.Nice place for a small group for dinner, or if you have out of town guests, but too many other options for me to re-visit.",3.0

At that point, I walked out of the restaurant. Now, I understand that restaurants allow reservations and must reserve tables accordingly, but to tell potential patrons that they only have one hour to eat is unacceptable.  I understand that this restaurant is very popular and has even knocked other, more seasoned Middle Eastern restaurants out of business in the neighborhood, but the staff of Tanoreen needs to learn how to not only be professional but humble too!",1.0

"Tanoreen is a big part of why I will maybe never leave Bay Ridge. To call it a ""restaurant"" is like calling Monet's Water Lillies ""some dude's picture."" I don't go often as I should (best enjoyed with larger parties, but if not, don't deprive yourself) and for that, I will likely have to devote an entire chapter of my memoirs to my regrets of uneaten meals I could have enjoyed at Tanoreen. I'm also a vegetarian (because I intend to have my life spared during the animal uprising) but this is one of those rare instances where my plate is the envy of all carnivores at the table. That isn't to say the meat isn't fantastic (everybody seems to love it). It's just nice to feel catered to at such a great restaurant that isn't solely or largely targeted at vegetarians or vegans.I recommend the...everything. No, really, Tanoreen brings it in all categories from appetizers to desserts (I cry thinking of the fact that I am not currently eating one right now).

"I am so happy that I tried this trendy spot for my mother's 45th birthday, it was a slam dunk.We actually arrived a half hour earlier despite the terrible parking situation in bay ridge, and they were more than happy to hook us up with a table early, the place itself was packed for a Sunday, a lot of locals were seated by the bar and in all tables, reservations are a must here.The menu consisted of middle eastern dishes , from babaganoush to hummus platters, various salads including feta cheese, mini pies with lamb and cheese, various soups, small rice platters like a pilaf, and tons of bread, really delicious soft and fresh bread, we must of had 3 baskets with spices added to the bread , and the hummus had amazing flavor, it wasn't too oily which was a plusthe feta cheese salad was excellent, it had the perfect amount of spices and cheese, it was so freshalso the fried cheese wasn't too salty or oily, also major plusthis place doesn't allow you to bring bottles from outside, but they have a fully stocked wine bar, with top shelf options available too, on average the wine bottles are 30-50 dollarsthe service was excellent, the waiters were friendly and professional, and very polite, they were more than happy to go over the menu with usRawia was such a sweetheart, she introduced herself and gave us a background of where she was from, with Palestinian roots, she has mastered this style of cuisine, where it really hits home since my family is from IsraelShe even sells a cookbook that has these same recipesThis place services a lot of lamb dishes, its a staple, whether its a lamb pie, shepherds pie, or lamb shank, or grilled lamb, the spices that they put on the lamb is perfect, not too over whelming. Nor was the meat too dry in any of these dishes, shepherds pie thus far was the best dish, the amount of garlic and butter that was baked into the piece was perfect, and the lamb had excellent flavor, it also came with a salad on the side with a lot of mint added, and there was even almonds added to the piece, as a matter of fact a lot of the dishes had almonds added, it was a very nice touchmy father had a tilapia dish which had almonds added to, im not a seafood lover but he really enjoyed the fish, it was fresh and not too overdonethe best has to be the desserts, oh my god, don't even get me started, I think we loved the desserts more than the entreesfirst we got mint tea, it was perfect, not too strong, it goes well with any dessert on the menuthe deserts listed included baklava, Arabic ice cream with pistachios on top, kharissa which is a coconut cake, and knafeh which was featured on food network with a wait time of 15 minutes since it is freshwe decided to go with the kharissa and knafeh since our stomachs were about to explode anywayoh my god, the kharissa was gone in less than 5 minutes, it was that good, it was light yet so flavorful and sweet, the texture was on point!the knafeh was fresh, it was oozing cheese, and it was very crunchy on top, it wasn't too sweet or too salty, it was the perfect balance, and it wasn't too heavy, no wonder everyone raves about it, next time im getting a large !I think the only thing that holds me back from giving this place 5 stars is that the options for kids are limited, there was an option of chicken and fries, and my sister wasn't too crazy about it, they should offer some sort of kids menu for those picky eatersthe bill for 4 people with drinks included was 200 dollars, it isn't cheap but you get what you pay for in terms of portions and quality, there was so much food left we took it all home",4.0
"I eat here 3-4 times a year and don't mind at all that I have to drive an hour plus to do so. What sets Tanoreen apart is how carefully everything is seasoned with their fresh herbs and spices, how much is homemade (the bread and the yogurt, for example) and the unique way they cook their food. The baba ghanouj's eggplants, for example, are charcoal-grilled- Palestinian women used to do that in their villages way back when, otherwise it is hard to find. It's that type of attention to detail and tradition that makes the food pop with flavor unlike food you'll have at the vast majority of restaurants. There is not one thing I've had here that I haven't loved. My favorites, though, are Mansef (with this being a traditional Jordanian dish I've had it at least 250x in my life - it's top 5), and Fetteh (chicken is on the menu - lamb often on special).Couldn't recommend it more and if I lived closer I'd eat here all the time!",5.0

"Restaurant Week '14.It's a quiet Thursday afternoon, strolled in for lunch with the hubby and bro in-law today.There isn't a separate menu for Restaurant Week, you choose your 3 course meal from the entire menu! I've been here a couple times, so it was a surprise when I saw them on the list! HUGE portions and had to take it to go, almost everything. Our waiter was a very cool guy who was very knowledgable in the menu items, also, he looks like Howie Mandel, to me at least LOL.The interior looked modern and romantic, towards the back there is a couple of tables along a long window wall, best seats in the house during lunch!Appetizers:1. Eggplant Napoleon: Haven't been here in over a year, and this dish is still my favorite! Crispy eggplant layers with hummus and embedded in a pool of tomato salad. All the flavors, the hot crispy eggplant warmed up the hummus, goes perfectly well together, such a great dish! Portion for this dish was so big, not kidding, that it could've filled me up if I ate it all myself.2: Tabouleh: Again, potion so big, we all could't finish. Big bowl of green yummy salad, so lemony and minty. We kept it with us throughout the meal and used it as a side.3. Sujok: Dry sausages sliced and sautéed with garlic and a hot chili pepper sauce. A bit over seasoned, but the complimentary pita puts a cut on it.Entrees:1. Artichoke Beef Stew: Big chunks of artichokes and beef cooked in a yummy stew, but a bit on the salty side. The sauce was very beefy, and artichokes had sorta like a potato texture. 2. Combination Platter: Three different types of meats including chicken, beef, and lamb. We found the dish on the salty side as well. Ordered the meats to be cooked well done, cooked too well that the meats were very dry and tough. Dessert: 1: Mediterranean Ice Cream: The scoops of ice cream that includes pistachio, chocolate, and ashta (sweet cream). Not sure if the flavors are homemade, can't really describe the texture of the ice cream, had a melted cheese texture, but still really good settled flavors.2. Knafeh Harissa Crossover: This item is off menu and is on a daily special. It's a fusion of their most popular dessert, Knafeh, missed with another one of their dessert which is the Harissa cake. Lovely combo, but I still preferred the Knafeh more. The coconut cake is soaked in a  rose water syrup which made the dish very elegant. Overall food was good, despite most of our hot dishes were a bit too salty for us. But the food portion on the other hand is well worth the $25 per person! All the dishes put together could have easily fed 6 people! Thats a lot of food, at least I can take it to go, I love leftovers!",4.0
i really like that the owner welcomes you and she is very friendly. Servers are very attentive. Restaurant nice and clean. My only negative comment would be usage or parsely. Too much parseley. Tandoori did not have grain. İt was only chopped parseley. İ don't think it is the original style. Overall really good experience...,4.0
"Wanted to try this place for a while now. Came with one of my girlfriends on a Wednesday night and it was pretty busy. A lot of reservations were made(we didn't make one), but saw reserved plates on a lot of tables. However, we were seated instantly. So ++++ being that we didn't make a reservation. Our waiter(didn't get his name) was very attentive and checked up on  us when needed.Now the food. Baked Kafta - We got this in the tahini sauce which went well with the lamb and potatoes. He let us try the tahini sauce first too, to make sure we liked it! Great guy, great guy! Great flavor but the tahini sauce got a bit overwhelming after a while. But still amazing. Bell Peppers - This was so good. It was filled with flavor. Basically stuff peppers with rice and meat in tomato based sauce. You get a red pepper and a green pepper. Weird to say but I like the red pepper more, perhaps the red peppers are sweeter and adds a kick to the rice? But very good dish overall. We didn't get to finish everything. I was looking forward to dessert but I overstuffed myself and didn't space room for dessert. How does someone not have room for dessert? I know. Bummer. I will be back next time to try it though!",4.0

"Tanoreen is a big part of why I will maybe never leave Bay Ridge. To call it a ""restaurant"" is like calling Monet's Water Lillies ""some dude's picture."" I don't go often as I should (best enjoyed with larger parties, but if not, don't deprive yourself) and for that, I will likely have to devote an entire chapter of my memoirs to my regrets of uneaten meals I could have enjoyed at Tanoreen. I'm also a vegetarian (because I intend to have my life spared during the animal uprising) but this is one of those rare instances where my plate is the envy of all carnivores at the table. That isn't to say the meat isn't fantastic (everybody seems to love it). It's just nice to feel catered to at such a great restaurant that isn't solely or largely targeted at vegetarians or vegans.I recommend the...everything. No, really, Tanoreen brings it in all categories from appetizers to desserts (I cry thinking of the fact that I am not currently eating one right now). I would steal a child's inhaler for a piece of Tanoreen's Harissa cake. But then that child would be in the hospital and I would be in jail. There is no Harissa cake in jail :(",5.0
"I am so happy that I tried this trendy spot for my mother's 45th birthday, it was a slam dunk.We actually arrived a half hour earlier despite the terrible parking situation in bay ridge, and they were more than happy to hook us up with a table early, the place itself was packed for a Sunday, a lot of locals were seated by the bar and in all tables, reservations are a must here.The menu consisted of middle eastern dishes , from babaganoush to hummus platters, various salads including feta cheese, mini pies with lamb and cheese, various soups, small rice platters like a pilaf, and tons of bread, really delicious soft and fresh bread, we must of had 3 baskets with spices added to the bread , and the hummus had amazing flavor, it wasn't too oily which was a plusthe feta cheese salad was excellent, it had the perfect amount of spices and cheese, it was so freshalso the fried cheese wasn't too salty or oily, also major plusthis place doesn't allow you to bring bottles from outside, but they have a fully stocked wine bar, with top shelf options available too, on average the wine bottles are 30-50 dollarsthe service was excellent, the waiters were friendly and professional, and very polite, they were more than happy to go over the menu with usRawia was such a sweetheart, she introduced herself and gave us a background of where she was from, with Palestinian roots, she has mastered this style of cuisine, where it really hits home since my family is from IsraelShe even sells a cookbook that has these same recipesThis place services a lot of lamb dishes, its a staple, whether its a lamb pie, shepherds pie, or lamb shank, or grilled lamb, the spices that they put on the lamb is perfect, not too over whelming. Nor was the meat too dry in any of these dishes, shepherds pie thus far was the best dish, the amount of garlic and butter that was baked into the piece was perfect, and the lamb had excellent flavor, it also came with a salad on the side with a lot of mint added, and there was even almonds added to the piece, as a matter of fact a lot of the dishes had almonds added, it was a very nice touchmy father had a tilapia dish which had almonds added to, im not a seafood lover but he really enjoyed the fish, it was fresh and not too overdonethe best has to be the desserts, oh my god, don't even get me started, I think we loved the desserts more than the entreesfirst we got mint tea, it was perfect, not too strong, it goes well with any dessert on the menuthe deserts listed included baklava, Arabic ice cream with pistachios on top, kharissa which is a coconut cake, and knafeh which was featured on food network with a wait time of 15 minutes since it is freshwe decided to go with the kharissa and knafeh since our stomachs were about to explode anywayoh my god, the kharissa was gone in less than 5 minutes, it was that good, it was light yet so flavorful and sweet, the texture was on point!the knafeh was fresh, it was oozing cheese, and it was very crunchy on top, it wasn't too sweet or too salty, it was the perfect balance, and it wasn't too heavy, no wonder everyone raves about it, next time im getting a large !I think the only thing that holds me back from giving this place 5 stars is that the options for kids are limited, there was an option of chicken and fries, and my sister wasn't too crazy about it, they should offer some sort of kids menu for those picky eatersthe bill for 4 people with drinks included was 200 dollars, it isn't cheap but you get what you pay for in terms of portions and quality, there was so much food left we took it all home",4.0
"I eat here 3-4 times a year and don't mind at all that I have to drive an hour plus to do so. What sets Tanoreen apart is how carefully everything is seasoned with their fresh herbs and spices, how much is homemade (the bread and the yogurt, for example) and the unique way they cook their food. The baba ghanouj's eggplants, for example, are charcoal-grilled- Palestinian women used to do that in their villages way back when, otherwise it is hard to find. It's that type of attention to detail and tradition that makes the food pop with flavor unlike food you'll have at the vast majority of restaurants. There is not one thing I've had here that I haven't loved. My favorites, though, are Mansef (with this being a traditional Jordanian dish I've had it at least 250x in my life - it's top 5), and Fetteh (chicken is on the menu - lamb often on special).Couldn't recommend it more and if I lived closer I'd eat here all the time!",5.0

"Place is very cute and cozy, and thus gets crowded, so make reservations! Eggplant napoleon and Falafels were excellent.The various kebabs were good too. I decided to be adventurous and try the ""Mlookhia Leaves""  special (which the menu denoted as Chef's favorite and 'food of kings') and hated it. The chicken in it was nicely seasoned though.",4.0
"Restaurant Week '14.It's a quiet Thursday afternoon, strolled in for lunch with the hubby and bro in-law today.There isn't a separate menu for Restaurant Week, you choose your 3 course meal from the entire menu! I've been here a couple times, so it was a surprise when I saw them on the list! HUGE portions and had to take it to go, almost everything. Our waiter was a very cool guy who was very knowledgable in the menu items, also, he looks like Howie Mandel, to me at least LOL.The interior looked modern and romantic, towards the back there is a couple of tables along a long window wall, best seats in the house during lunch!Appetizers:1. Eggplant Napoleon: Haven't been here in over a year, and this dish is still my favorite! Crispy eggplant layers with hummus and embedded in a pool of tomato salad. All the flavors, the hot crispy eggplant warmed up the hummus, goes perfectly well together, such a great dish! Portion for this dish was so big, not kidding, that it could've filled me up if I ate it all myself.2: Tabouleh: Again, potion so big, we all could't finish. Big bowl of green yummy salad, so lemony and minty. We kept it with us throughout the meal and used it as a side.3. Sujok: Dry sausages sliced and sautéed with garlic and a hot chili pepper sauce. A bit over seasoned, but the complimentary pita puts a cut on it.Entrees:1. Artichoke Beef Stew: Big chunks of artichokes and beef cooked in a yummy stew, but a bit on the salty side. The sauce was very beefy, and artichokes had sorta like a potato texture. 2. Combination Platter: Three different types of meats including chicken, beef, and lamb. We found the dish on the salty side as well. Ordered the meats to be cooked well done, cooked too well that the meats were very dry and tough. Dessert: 1: Mediterranean Ice Cream: The scoops of ice cream that includes pistachio, chocolate, and ashta (sweet cream).

And it wasn't a bad day because I returned on two occasions before writing this review to make sure.So to the food.The dips such as the babas and hummus have not changed so not much to talk about here.The kibbeh no longer had the crispy exterior that I urged to devour, but tasted as if it was sitting in the fryer for too long. The falafel came out the same way as well, too oily with no crispy exterior. Quite a bummer After we got to the mains: from the shish to the chicken kebab they both had a chew and were way over cooked.

"If you have bad service, it doesn't matter how good the food is.Overall the food was good.  We ordered the baba ganoush, fatoosh salad, and mixed grill.  The cracker-like pita and regular pita were the best parts of the meal.  The meats of the mixed grill were over-salted and average.Onto the service.  Don't you hate going into an almost-empty restaurant and the hostess asks if you have reservations?  She then proceeds with a ""ok let me see"" and makes a face as if it's going to be tough to seat us.  I know this restaurant is pretty famous now, but get over yourself.  There were nice 2 seat tables with one sided booth seating, and stand alone 2 seat tables by the window.  The hostess proceeded to seat us at a 2 seat table not by any windows and sandwiched behind a large 6 person party and in back of another 2 seat table.  We decide what we want and close our menus.  The waitress is busy chatting with another server.  5 minutes later she takes our order.  I've never had a waitress or waiter start the interaction with so much attitude.  No hello, just what do you want with an attitude, eye squinting and grabbing the menus from us.Throughout the entire meal, the waitress does not come check up on us.After we are finished, we place our utensils in the plates and sit back to chat.  We chat for 5 minutes, no one comes to take away our food.  We chat for 10 minutes and no one comes by.  Finally after 15 minutes, we hail another waiter who comes and takes our food.  We receive our leftovers to go and have a plastic bag sitting on our table.  The waitress doesn't come by to give us our check.   Finally my girlfriend waves at her and asks her for the check.  She glares at us, doesn't say a word, and points to someone else who is apparently getting us our check.  There are much better mediterranean restaurants around - Cafe Mogador in East Village, and Fatoosh in Brooklyn Heights are both awesome.",1.0

"Outstanding Mediterranean Food!Tanoreen is by far one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've ever dined at. GF and I had 9:15PM reservations on a Saturday night. We took the subway out from lower Manhattan and arrived about 8:40 PM. We were temporarily seated at the bar while our table was being set, where we were greeted with outstanding, fresh made drinks, and (by request) a sampler appetizer plate containing several different dips including fresh made Hummus, Eggplant Salad, Turkish Salad (OMG!) and a Beet Hummus served along with a basket of flat bread with herbs. All were fantastic, we couldn't get enough and the cold appetizers practically spoiled us for the rest of the meal. Once we sat down we ordered a couple more hot appetizers, so we could sample more new flavors. We had the Eggplant Napoleon and Sujok, a dried armenian sausage, sautéed with garlic, olive oil & hot harissa, and the Crispy Halloumi Cheese. Nom! (Note that the Halloumi cheese comes out hot, but is served on cold cucumber and tomato slices, be sure to eat it quickly before it cools).We wanted to try every entree on the menu, but given how full we were from the appetizers we opted to try the highly recommended Leg of Lamb. It was outstanding, with the meat falling off the bone, and all of the veggies soft and moist. For dessert (not that we had any room, but...) we had the Knafeh:A house specialty, Knafeh is crispy layers of fillo doughstuffed with Rawia's homemade sweet cheese, soaked in orangeblossom syrup & topped with crunchy pistachios.Service was outstanding throughout, and the Chef, creator, owner Rawia Bishara came by our table to ensure everything was in order. It was. Clearly all of the food here is made with love and care. We can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Given that I've had middle eastern food from a majority of restaurants in New York, I was truly looking forward to my date night dinner at Tanoreen. However given the hype and price, I was grossly disappointed. First off let's get the positives out of the way. The ambiance is great and works for both a large gprup outing or a more intimate dinner. The walls were adorned with middle eastern decorations. The service was great and the waiters were very attentive at refilling the water and knowledgable about the dishes.Now the negatives. The food is bland for the most part...period. We had the eggplant Napoleon which was overpowered by the baba ganoush. The second appetizer was the Mushkaan which is a pizza topped with chicken flavored by middle Eastern spices...this was truly delicious. The main course was the mixed grill platter which consisted of paltry cubes of chicken and beef and two small lamb sausages served in a sea of rice and salad overpowered with lemon. And that bit costs $21. I've had food at zaytoons and at Istanbul in Brooklyn as well as various restaurants in Astoria. But Tanoreen was by far the worst. If you want a nice ambiance with dry and bland food that will leave your wallet lighter then give Tanoreen a try.",2.0
"Tanoreen is easily my favorite Middle Eastern spot, and also one of my favorite restaurants in all of Brooklyn.The food like others have said is just something you have to experience. Everything I've ever had at Tanoreen has been off the charts. Their hummus and grape leaves, two staples, are always fresh and always on point. They have a great menu from appetizer to dessert. It's really a great place for a quick lunch or a nice sit down dinner with a date or friends.I've never had a problem with the staff, and the owner is almost always visible walking around and talking to her customers making sure everyone is satisfied. All in all it's a great experience.Tip: Leave room for dessert and order the homemade Knafeh. It takes about 15-20 min since they make it fresh, but it's worth it.",5.0
"The restaurant exceeded all my expectations from the appetizer to the dessert.  My girlfriend is Lebanese and her mom or auntie made many of the dishes we had for dinner when she was growing up, and she vouched for the authenticity and they flooded her with warm memories as she ate.The meal started with toasted pita and some pickled veggies and then we ordered the red pepper and walnut dip with pomegranate molasses and the appetizer special which was chicken wrapped and fried in a filo dough.  Both were pure perfection!  For the entree, I had the lamb stuffed eggplant and she had the chicken kibbee.  Both were amazingly delicious and perfectly seasoned.  For dessert we had the wheat encrusted baked cheese with nuts and rosewater and we scrapped our plates clean.Service was polite, friendly, courteous and impeccable.  It felt like every waiter in the place checked in on us to ensure our happiness.  Bravo to the chef, owner and staff!",5.0

On the cold appetizer side, the brussel sprouts and the cauliflower with the pomegranate-yogurt sauce are divine. I think the hummus is delicious, and it comes with a very sharable amount of pita. The falafel is denser than I prefer, and the seasoning is not my favorite, so I usually skip it and binge on vegetables instead.",4.0

"Overall 3/5: Not sure they would be as popular without the Food Network review.Food 4/5: Kudos to the cooks.  Flavorful, large portions, and well cooked (ie. nothing chewy/under or overcooked/over salted, etc.). We had musakahn, fisherman's meal, and something from specials menu with lamb and goat cheese yogurt sauce.  I liked the lamb most...it had a good tang from the sauce and the meat was tender. The fish came with a really tasty sauteed rice with really yummy spices (consider it a Mediterranean fried rice).Drinks 2.5/6: i personally would skip fancy drinks and go for  a vodka soda. If you're into fufu drinks....get the martini with grapefruit.  It reminded me of a slightly citrus-eey red Skittle candy. Really sweet drink, but watered down from over shaking (honestly a sad excuse for a martimi...perhaps don't call it a martini).  They need better specialty drinks (or a better bartender...)Staff 2/5: This is their biggest flaw, and the biggest reason for not more stars. Hostess was not well trained and rude with greeting me at the door. Other than my waiter the staff looked like they didn't want to be at work. This was a Tuesday night...wasn't crazy busy, and there were enough of them working, so there's little reason to look so miserable and angry.Price: More expensive than typical Bklyn restaurant. You can argue that it's a lot of food, but anyone who cooks knows adding a side salad and an extra cup of sauteed rice does not cost that much more and in that case....the experience is what counts and lack luster staff makes me question their pricing model.",3.0
"Outstanding Mediterranean Food!Tanoreen is by far one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've ever dined at. GF and I had 9:15PM reservations on a Saturday night. We took the subway out from lower Manhattan and arrived about 8:40 PM. We were temporarily seated at the bar while our table was being set, where we were greeted with outstanding, fresh made drinks, and (by request) a sampler appetizer plate containing several different dips including fresh made Hummus, Eggplant Salad, Turkish Salad (OMG!) and a Beet Hummus served along with a basket of flat bread with herbs. All were fantastic, we couldn't get enough and the cold appetizers practically spoiled us for the rest of the meal. Once we sat down we ordered a couple more hot appetizers, so we could sample more new flavors. We had the Eggplant Napoleon and Sujok, a dried armenian sausage, sautéed with garlic, olive oil & hot harissa, and the Crispy Halloumi Cheese. Nom! (Note that the Halloumi cheese comes out hot, but is served on cold cucumber and tomato slices, be sure to eat it quickly before it cools).We wanted to try every entree on the menu, but given how full we were from the appetizers we opted to try the highly recommended Leg of Lamb. It was outstanding, with the meat falling off the bone, and all of the veggies soft and moist. For dessert (not that we had any room, but...) we had the Knafeh:A house specialty, Knafeh is crispy layers of fillo doughstuffed with Rawia's homemade sweet cheese, soaked in orangeblossom syrup & topped with crunchy pistachios.Service was outstanding throughout, and the Chef, creator, owner Rawia Bishara came by our table to ensure everything was in order. It was. Clearly all of the food here is made with love and care. We can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Given that I've had middle eastern food from a majority of restaurants in New York, I was truly looking forward to my date night dinner at Tanoreen. However given the hype and price, I was grossly disappointed. First off let's get the positives out of the way. The ambiance is great and works for both a large gprup outing or a more intimate dinner. The walls were adorned with middle eastern decorations. The service was great and the waiters were very attentive at refilling the water and knowledgable about the dishes.Now the negatives. The food is bland for the most part...period. We had the eggplant Napoleon which was overpowered by the baba ganoush. The second appetizer was the Mushkaan which is a pizza topped with chicken flavored by middle Eastern spices...this was truly delicious. The main course was the mixed grill platter which consisted of paltry cubes of chicken and beef and two small lamb sausages served in a sea of rice and salad overpowered with lemon. And that bit costs $21. I've had food at zaytoons and at Istanbul in Brooklyn as well as various restaurants in Astoria. But Tanoreen was by far the worst. If you want a nice ambiance with dry and bland food that will leave your wallet lighter then give Tanoreen a try.",2.0
"Tanoreen is easily my favorite Middle Eastern spot, and also one of my favorite restaurants in all of Brooklyn.The food like others have said is just something you have to experience. Everything I've ever had at Tanoreen has been off the charts. Their hummus and grape leaves, two staples, are always fresh and always on point. They have a great menu from appetizer to dessert. It's really a great place for a quick lunch or a nice sit down dinner with a date or friends.I've never had a problem with the staff, and the owner is almost always visible walking around and talking to her customers making sure everyone is satisfied. All in all it's a great experience.Tip: Leave room for dessert and order the homemade Knafeh. It takes about 15-20 min since they make it fresh, but it's worth it.",5.0
"The restaurant exceeded all my expectations from the appetizer to the dessert.  My girlfriend is Lebanese and her mom or auntie made many of the dishes we had for dinner when she was growing up, and she vouched for the authenticity and they flooded her with warm memories as she ate.The meal started with toasted pita and some pickled veggies and then we ordered the red pepper and walnut dip with pomegranate molasses and the appetizer special which was chicken wrapped and fried in a filo dough.  Both were pure perfection!  For the entree, I had the lamb stuffed eggplant and she had the chicken kibbee.  Both were amazingly delicious and perfectly seasoned.  For dessert we had the wheat encrusted baked cheese with nuts and rosewater and we scrapped our plates clean.Service was polite, friendly, courteous and impeccable.  It felt like every waiter in the place checked in on us to ensure our happiness.  Bravo to the chef, owner and staff!",5.0

"I haven't dined in at Tanoreen yet, but it's become a go-to Seamless destination. The delivery guy usually shows up in a car, so waits have only been about 30 minutes. On the cold appetizer side, the brussel sprouts and the cauliflower with the pomegranate-yogurt sauce are divine. I think the hummus is delicious, and it comes with a very sharable amount of pita. The falafel is denser than I prefer, and the seasoning is not my favorite, so I usually skip it and binge on vegetables instead.",4.0
Excellent. That's all. It's just excellent. I'm trying to figure out a way for the owner to come to our house 3 times a day and cook for us. Maybe if the lottery goes up to a billion dollars again...,5.0
Honestly - Everything I've ever eaten here has been beyond wildest flavor dreams. Been here multiple times and never disappointed. You would be doing yourself a dis-service if you don't eat here. After me and my boyfriend eat here - we usually spend the next day thinking about how good our meal was the previous day! EAT HERE.,5.0
"I don't know what it is about this place but every time I come here with my husband no matter what plate we try it is DELICIOUS, every single time! We love this restaurant!

"My wife and I were visiting NYC from Canada and we found Tanoreen based on previously-written online reviews.  This is a wonderful Middle-Eastern restaurant and indeed it is worthwhile to make the trek down to south-western Brooklyn for this food.  The restaurant has a nice interior decor, and when we were there, on a Saturday late afternoon, it was busy --- always a good sign.  The waitress and staff were polite and helpful.As for the food, well, we had two appetizers and then two main dishes.  The cauliflower salad was amazing.  I admit that I am partial to this vegetable, but it was wonderfully carmelized-fried and the pomegranate molasses was a nice touch of flavour  And then the hot appetizer, Musakhan, a flat-bread with chicken, wonderfully-fragrant (with sumac) and with toasted almonds.  Both my wife and I could have eaten second and third servings of both these appetizers without hesitation, but we still had the main courses coming: my lamb with yellow-rice was very nice and my wife had a generous portion of chicken with potatoes --- all with lots of delicate spices and herbs.  Excellent food and large portions (we had to ask to have some of our food packed to take home).  As I said, if you live in NYC and you want to try first-rate Middle-Eastern food, head to this restaurant; and if you are visiting from out of town, dinner at Tanoreen is well-worth the trek out of Manhattan into an otherwise non-descript part of Brooklyn.  I look forward to eating at Tanoreen on my next NYC trip.",5.0
"Visited this place during the weekend, staff is nice but food was ok. We order a bunch of appetizers and two main courses to share for the table.

"Just tried the well known restaurant. I have ordered a pick up. I got chicken shawarma sandwich- which is not good. I has pickled cucumbers- tastes awful. Pita is not fresh. And extremely citric. Its more lettuce, few tomatoes shreds and a lot of oil. I guess from chicken. Also I got not fresh babaganoush- which has tht much vinegar tht makes it impossible to eat. Plus what u can really taste is oil. Nothing to compare to Pita Pan which serves fresh only!! The most amazing food.",2.0
"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. For me it's a place for special occasions because it's a bit on the pricey side, but worth every penny.

The absolute must eat here is the brussel sprouts. I'd be happy eating them every day. The cauliflower salad and red pepper spread were also memorable. The fatoush salad is the best I've ever had.

The kabob sampler was nice and light with the perfect amount of citrus to chicken and spice to meat. New favorite place, and if you're gluten free, THIS IS A BLESSING.

We started off with mhammara, a red-pepper dip served with both crispy and soft pita breads. It was delicious! The crispy pita bread was like a thin pita chip, and definitely my favorite part of the appetizer, haha. This was followed by schwarma sliders, which came with tomatoes, parsley, red onion, and yogurt sauce on the side for a customizable slider experience. We then had makdous, a cold app consisting of eggplant in olive oil stuffed with walnuts. For our entree, we split the lamb shishbarak, fried lamb dumplings served in a yogurt-based sauce and served with vermicelli rice. So hearty, so filling, and so unlike anything I've ever had.

Granted, they cooked and spiced the chicken kebab harmoniously and deliciously. The Shepherd's Pie was dry.The Short Rib is/was delicious.The restaurant decor and ppl are still nice.

I love prosecco so we each had 2 glasses. It was delicious.  I could have had a lot more. We ended the meal with baklava and harissa, a coconut cake.

For our entree, we split the lamb shishbarak, fried lamb dumplings served in a yogurt-based sauce and served with vermicelli rice. So hearty, so filling, and so unlike anything I've ever had. Left here stuffed and dreaming of crispy pita bread... if you're looking to break away from the usual Thai or farm-to-table cuisine for an evening out, head to this place.",4.0
"Mediterranean food at it best! From crispy and delicious Halloumi to mouth-watering Baby squash stuffed with lamb, it delivers perfect balance of spices and cooked just right.Great selection of drinks, impeccable service and exotic decor - all came together to enjoyable dinner.It does get very busy even at early hours, so reservation is suggested - you can make reservation straight from yelp app if you on OpenTable, very convenient.Did not have room for desert, but will definitely try next time - Knafeh was looking delicious!",4.0
So fabulous. Baked kibbe moist ..perfectBabaganoush the best. One of my favorite restaurants when I am in brooklyn,5.0
"One of my favorite restaurants in all the five boroughs. I don't mind the trek to Bay Ridge from Queens because the food is simply amazing. Try anything on the menu and you'll love it (except perhaps the Mlookhia leaves which is really an acquired taste). The lamb melts in your mouth, the vegetables are tender and full of flavor and the rice is rich with delicious aromas. Service is equally excellent and Chef Rawia always watches with kindness over her customers. GO NOW!",5.0
"I'm saddened to learn they changed the menu and chef. They no longer have the option of making a sampler platter from its appetizers menu. The rice noodle pilaf that accompanies many entrees is now soggy and lacks the flavor that previous chef had achieved. The cucumber tomato parsley salad that is served on every entree lacked flavor. Granted, they cooked and spiced the chicken kebab harmoniously and deliciously. The Shepherd's Pie was dry.The Short Rib is/was delicious.The restaurant decor and ppl are still nice. If you're going there on a Friday or Saturday evening, Call to make a reservation. It's full house.",3.0
My boyfriend and I went here after we walked around to see what we were in the mood for. This was one of few places that actually had people in it. We were pleasantly surprised. Loved the eggplant Napoleon- fried very well. We also had the kippe (so?) that was his favorite. Loved the kebab platter as well. Chicken was seasoned just right but was a little on dry side. The staff couldn't have been lovelier. Would definitely go back!,4.0
"We ordered the feta cheese salad, the hummus,  and, funny enough, fried chicken and french fries. The feta cheese salad was fabulous.  I had asked how good the hummus was and I was told it's the best in the area, however when I tried it I didn't believe it was as good as at least two places that serve them. I love prosecco so we each had 2 glasses. It was delicious.  I could have had a lot more. We ended the meal with baklava and harissa, a coconut cake. Baklava is my favorite dessert of all time if it's done the way I like. So in my opinion the baklava wasn't very good; a little dry. The harissa was superb, however.",3.0
"I've heard good things about this place from my neighbors, so I wanted to give it a try. As I was walking passed it the other day, I decided to pop in and give it a go. Unfortunately I was greeted by the rude gentlmen host. First thing he says is, do you have a reservation; I told him "" No, I didn't know you needed one; can I reserve on through you or eat at the bar""?. He looks me blankly as says "" You need a reservation, come back another day"". Well...that was my experience and I will NEVER step one foot in there again.",1.0
"Been here a few times. Very nice atmosphere. When the owner is there she walks around the tables getting feedback. If youre a vegetarian you may be pressed finding a non meat entree . You need to love lamb, however there's enough non meat appetizers. The best part was the za'atar crackers which is their version of bread. Dips as well.",4.0
"Okay so I love spicy food, I add layers of chili to my foods and I love Thai and Indian cuisines.  So if you are coming here .... it does not contain that.  So if i am literally addicted to chili why am i giving this place 5 stars.  Because Tanoreen is excellent in its own right, and is not about spiciness but about a balance of flavors aka middle eastern spices with lemons and middle eastern herbs and it is the best in the city.  This food is well spiced NOT spicy.  It is so flavorful and delicious and is even worth the pain in the a** parking wait in bay ridge.  So here is what i would recommend.Muhammara - pomegranate infused pepper-walnut dip.  Sweet, cuminy, delicious.Eggplant Napoleon-cool, smoky from the babaganouj, basily, tomatoey, garlicky, and simply delicious.  Turkish salad-lemony and red peppery and oniony, described as very spicy by the staff but trust me it is NOT AT ALL SPICY (then again i have a high tolerance), but i still loved it.  For me it isn't spicy, for others it might be spicy.  Musakhan - OMG, This dish right here is so amazing that it can bring world peace.  No seriously, the toasted pita, delicious succulent sumac-allspice chicken with parsley and almonds might be one of the best things I have EVER eaten. So come to this place expecting authentic food that one could easily find in Lebanon, Palestine, and Israel.  This is not a halal cart stand or a bar so please ignore the reviewers who are basing this place off of those preconceptions.  This place is for the appetizers.  Bon appetite! PS,  I do not eat lamb but my father loves Lamb and thinks the lamb shank special is the best lamb dish of ALL time.",5.0
"After today, I am convinced: Tanoreen is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.  We have tried many of their dishes, all of them divine, incredibly flavorful, balanced, fresh, warming...the eggplant napoleon, the brussels sprouts, the kabob...honestly, I hesitate to suggest any one particularly dish because they are all wonderful.  I will say that the most enjoyable way to eat here is to think of it more as a small plates place: have a bunch of the appetizers and just one main. You'll thank me for it.We'd eat here every week if they'd open a location closer to Park Slope. Thanks for another wonderful meal (which included great service as usual).Tanoreen is a gem!!",5.0

"Good Mediterranean restaurant, they have a lot typical Lebanese dishes and I really like their salads. I went on a Saturday afternoon to have lunch with my bf around 2:00pm and it was half full (Saturday nights its when it gets crowded) the service was implacable but the food took a little long. My boyfriend ordered the lamb dish (sorry I forgot the actual name of the dish lol) and I ordered the Mediterranean grilled chicken which was AMAZING the lean but extremely flavored juicy chicken breast marinated with the basil pesto was extremely tasty, the presentation was nice but the flavor was simply outstanding. I ordered my dish without rice and I asked to trade it for more ""Arabic salad"" that's basically chopped lettuce, mint, parsley, herbs, tomato, cucumbers, onions and a magical lemon seasoning. Unfortunately my bf didn't like his dish a lot, he said it was not that bad but still not good enough. Definitely my advice my advice would be to ordered the chicken :)",3.0
"I've heard so many wonderful things about this place.  My first visit was this past Friday during the 3rd Ave summer stroll.  The food was excellent.  I ordered 2 apps as an entree, the lentil & Brussel sprouts.  Both were very, very tasty.   Considering it was an extremely busy night because of the outside tables, I'm going to give the service a break but it was painfully slow & took forever to get a drink.  I will say prices are a bit high especially for Brooklyn but overall it was a great meal.  I'd definately go back & recommend for something different then the several northern Italian restaurants in Bay Ridge.",4.0

"I've been going to Tanoreen since they occupied a small storefront with very, very few tables. The food is always excellent--not knock-you-out-of-the-park great, but absolutely delicious, especially for Bay Ridge.Highlights/must-have dishes:BRUSSEL SPROUTS. Honestly, I could have about 5 orders of these and be happy. They're fried with a yogurt pomegranate sauce that's simply amazing.Beet salad. Yes, I love beets, Yes, I love salad, Marrying the flavors of mint, almond, and basil? Simply superb.Chicken fetti--I skipped it this time, but always great. The baked eggplant, layered with lamb, was delicious.Two negatives:For a Middle Eastern restaurant, the hummus was really mediocre. Damascus is where I buy my hummus, and there's no comparison. Yemen Cafe's was far better, too.I'm also not sure what the obsession is with putting so much parsley on the edge of the plate that you can't actually see it. NO MORE PARSLEY.

"What i've Had: Appetizer: Brussel Sprouts Dinner: Special Seasonal Pumpkin Lasagna, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Squash Yogurt, Shrimp Dessert: Knafeh - You have to try this!Would I go back?: Most definitely Story: Came here to go on a bit of a Bay Ridge adventure with my friend that lives in the area. Atmosphere and interior is nicely decorated but the star here is really the food. Me and 4 friends shared all of the above. Everything i mean EVERYTHING was delicious here i have had mediterranean quite a bit but not quite so much the middle eastern so i am so glad this was my first true experience with it. The shrimp was my least favorite just because it felt very generic - flavors were not particularly middle eastern specific. My favorite was the seasonal special we ordered - the Pumpkin Sheikh al Mahshi a Pumpkin middle eastern style 'Lasagna' - when i say Lasagna i say it to relay the layering effect happening in this dish - layers of cheese pumpkin, lamb, shallots, onions and spices, baked in a tahini sauce simply amazing a perfect balance of flavors and texture was superb. I also loved the rice noodle side that was a base to most of the dishes. Dessert was amazing as well i had read that the Knafeh was the dessert to get - shredded filo dough coated gooey sweet cheese baked concotion - i've never had anything like it in my life - awesome - would be too sweet but the cheese perfectly offsets it.",5.0

Was so excited to try this place but I guess we were too hyped up about eating here. The ambience is nice and warm. Family-friendly and I had my 14 month there which is no problem. Food is good but not amazing as I expected. I had the lamb Kefti (good) and my husband had the mixed Grill. The chicken in the lamb cubes were good but the beef was a bit dry and lacked salt.The eggplant Napoleon is definitely worth a try. The Kibbie lacked flavor/salt. Don't get me wrong the food was good but just not something I would seek out again. The desert which was part of the TV episode the best thing I ever ate was not so muchThe best thing I ever ate.i'm glad I gave it a try though.The service was good.

"What i've Had: Appetizer: Brussel Sprouts Dinner: Special Seasonal Pumpkin Lasagna, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Squash Yogurt, Shrimp Dessert: Knafeh - You have to try this!Would I go back?: Most definitely Story: Came here to go on a bit of a Bay Ridge adventure with my friend that lives in the area. Atmosphere and interior is nicely decorated but the star here is really the food. Me and 4 friends shared all of the above. Everything i mean EVERYTHING was delicious here i have had mediterranean quite a bit but not quite so much the middle eastern so i am so glad this was my first true experience with it. The shrimp was my least favorite just because it felt very generic - flavors were not particularly middle eastern specific. My favorite was the seasonal special we ordered - the Pumpkin Sheikh al Mahshi a Pumpkin middle eastern style 'Lasagna' - when i say Lasagna i say it to relay the layering effect happening in this dish - layers of cheese pumpkin, lamb, shallots, onions and spices, baked in a tahini sauce simply amazing a perfect balance of flavors and texture was superb. I also loved the rice noodle side that was a base to most of the dishes. Dessert was amazing as well i had read that the Knafeh was the dessert to get - shredded filo dough coated gooey sweet cheese baked concotion - i've never had anything like it in my life - awesome - would be too sweet but the cheese perfectly offsets it.",5.0
The food has amazing flavor! Friendly service. Lively atmosphere. They serve hummus and bread before the meal which was divine! For an entree I had the Baked Mediterranean Eggplant. It wasn't at all what I was expecting but....it was sooooo good!  Decent wine list too! I will definitely return!,5.0
Was so excited to try this place but I guess we were too hyped up about eating here. The ambience is nice and warm. Family-friendly and I had my 14 month there which is no problem. Food is good but not amazing as I expected. I had the lamb Kefti (good) and my husband had the mixed Grill. The chicken in the lamb cubes were good but the beef was a bit dry and lacked salt.The eggplant Napoleon is definitely worth a try. The Kibbie lacked flavor/salt. Don't get me wrong the food was good but just not something I would seek out again. The desert which was part of the TV episode the best thing I ever ate was not so muchThe best thing I ever ate.i'm glad I gave it a try though.The service was good. They probably fill their water class of the 8 times. The noise is perfect because if your child is crankyno one can hear her crying. The prices are a bit high for the quality.,3.0
The eggplant and lamb dish (the first entree) is exquisite! Its magic in your mouth. And the service is impeccable. Worth the trip!,5.0
"One of my all-time favorite restaurants. I know this is kind of morbid, but I had my husband take me here the day before I had surgery, just in case it was my last meal. No joke.  Eggplant napoleon is amazing! So is the humus, brussell sprouts, vegetarian platter, chicken fetti, and basically everything else I have ever had there. Chef Rawia is awesome and almost always comes around to see how everyone is enjoying their meals. You don't see that too often anymore. Her cookbook is awesome too, but nothing compares to getting her to make your food for you.",5.0
"Ridiculously good. I came here on Friday for dinner split 5 ways; I delegated menu ordering to the expert who'd been here before and I helped out by ordering red and white Lebanese wine. The hummus was exceptionally smooth, the breads were varied and delicious, and lamb kibbeh was awesome, and the lamb rice thing was great too. Oh and that best dessert I ever ate thing is for real. Savory, sweet, crunchy, perfect. Tanoreen is the best meal I have had in a long time.",5.0
"I stopped by just to try the Knafeh that was featured on an episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate. I actually ordered from the separate takeout section of the restaurant. The dessert took about 20 minutes to make, but it was worth it!I've had knafeh in the past, but Tanoreen's knafeh was not overly sweetened by the syrup. In addition, it was served nice and warm, and the phyllo dough shreds were nice and crunchy. The pistachio crumbles on top were excellent too! This was an incredibly tasty dessert, and the small size is perfect for two!",5.0
"Love the food here I think in the 4 or so times I've been here the quality has never faltered and I've tried everything on the menu. Appetizers: Eggplant Napolean = hands down the best and its a meal in and of itself!The lamb feti is amazing its my fave from the specials.The entrees are big enough to share.. the apps are all great... the hummus is fresh always, the kibbeh is tasty, the meat pies flavorful, the olive tepanede on point.Simply can't complain and the best part is the owner/chef is still around she checks on everyone speaks to people about the food cares about the feedback and hasn't cut back on the quality of ingredients.",5.0
"I've been here more than once and For me as a lebanese guy I can tell that the Food is good, service is also good but I'm only writing this review and giving 1star only because of the rude answer that I got from the owner; explanation:My friends and I ordered ""kibbi b laban"" and we all noticed that it tasted bad and since the owner was always around and asked us when we first came in to let her know if we need anything or if something is not ok I decided to tell her about the plate; after I asked her about the kind of yogurt that the plate was made with and I told her that we felt the taste was weird (btw I'm sure that this kind of yogurt shouldn't be used for this ""kibbi"") she said in an ironic attitude; well you guys ""licked"" the whole plate and you're saying you didn't like it?!.. Wow! ""Licked""?!!! Are we animals?! What a way to speak to customers; and Lebanese customers also!

"Nothing but crazy good food up in here!The best Middle Eastern food I have ever had... Yet.I am always in search of good Middle eastern food, almost all Middle Eastern restaurants have the common menu item such as Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Eggplant salads, Adana's, Kebab's, etc., but Tanoreen is by far one of my newest and best discoveries of Middle Eastern cuisine in NYC.Located in Bay Ridge Brooklyn, amongst many Middle Eastern restaurants, Tanoreen is a Hidden Gem that stands out among the rest.Tanoreen is quaint with an elegance and vibrant Middle Eastern feel to it, yet casual laid back and relaxing. The staff is lovely and very attentive, the food is incredible.They have an extensive menu with many interesting options to choose from, everything I ordered was delicious! I ordered the Kibbeh which was seasoned , overly stuffed with Pine nuts, seasoned very well and cooked to perfection, the best I've ever had. I also ordered the Mixed cold appetizer Salad platter which came with 6 different cold salad options off their menu like Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, etc., the salad was perfect to dip their yummy fresh Pita in, and I also ordered their Fresh Middle Eastern Pitza which was phenomenal and nothing like an Italian Pizza.... Foggetabout it!I am glad I was born and raised in Brooklyn, it allows me to enjoy and explorer different cultures without leaving my own backyard (although it would be nice to travel to the Middle East and experience their culture).Tanoreen is the taste of the Middle East in Brooklyn.",5.0
Great food with great staff. Every dish I have tried has been amazing and I have nothing bad to say about it. The place is usually packed and parking in Bay Ridge can be quite difficult.,5.0
I recently had to get an event catered for work and used Tanoreen. The catering process was effortless and delivery was only $25. The food was a hit and all the guests were middle eastern so I think it goes without saying that their quality and authenticity are remarkable. I'm a big fan.,5.0
"It is important to note that I made the trip from Midtown West thinking that this was well worth the trip. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The hummus was below average with lack of flavor, and their musakhan was okay. I did try their kabsah and would say that it was good. Overall the restaurant is not worth making out a trip to eat (I've had better food in Patterson, NJ) but if I ever was in the area I might stop by and have a bite",2.0

"One of the best restaurants I've eaten at in NYC. Took my girlfriend here for our 1 year anniversary, and here's what I think.Pros* Excellent service. To me, a mark of a good server (as a former server) is not just attentiveness and good service, but being honest when asked about certain dishes and being able to not recommend something. Some servers recommend EVERYTHING, which is simply impossible. Our server was attentive, provided great service, asked what we were leaning towards, and wasn't hesitant about telling us not to try certain dishes while offering alternatives.* Food. The food was delicious. Aside from one minor bit (which I'll mention in the con section), it was well prepared, spicy enough without being too overwhelming, and...did I mention delicious??* Drinks. We had two glasses of wine and two cocktails. The wine was spot on! The cocktails were a good balance of taste and alcohol: not overbearing in terms of the amount of alcohol, and not a wimpy drink where absence of alcohol was masked by various fruity flavors. Cons* The shepherd's pie was a bit dry. That was the only 'blemish' out of the entire meal.* The atmosphere was a bit noisy, and the restaurant wasn't even half-full.Summary. Great service, wonderful food and drinks. The two minor cons were not enough to take any stars away from the 5 star rating. Well done Tanoreen!",5.0

Even if you're not familiar with Arabic food, the food here will still remind you of your mothers or grandmothers cooking because Bishara and her daughter put so much love into everything they make. Its also a great place for anyone who is a vegan or vegetarian. My personal favorites from here are the Eggplant Neapolitan and the brussels sprouts which are out of this world.

"Tanoreen is a small, modern decor restaurant. This was my first time here, I came with a group of 5 in total. From the beginning, I liked that they offered valet parking, very convenient. The staff was extremely welcoming and polite, I really enjoyed their service. I also liked that the owner of the location walked out to check on us. The cocktail that I ordered was to DIE for! I forgot the name, I believe it was the tanoreeni (martini), it was pink, the color of pomegranate. Absolutely amazingly prepared cocktail, so props to the bartender. The food was good, but in my opinion, too fried, at least what we ordered. We didn't make it to the main courses as we ordered so many things from the appetizer menu (so perhaps the main meals are amazing, I don't doubt it). We ordered the kibbie (Kipes in-case there is a Dominican reading this), hummus, eggplant dish, fita and spinach pies, and falafel. Honestly speaking, I felt the appetizers could of been a wee bit better, fresher! Dessert was the house cake, Knufe and these little empanada looking things. I will be honest, I enjoyed neither. I will give this spot another try one day, for its main meals, as I feel that it will shine more in that aspect. We shall see! But overall, the experience was nice :)",3.0
"Never ceases to disappoint.  They are constantly updating their specials and manage to create a unique gourmet spin on traditional mediterranean/middle eastern dishes.  Tanoreen is a must if you are craving middle eastern food in huge portions with a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and normal prices.  Stop what you're doing and go now",5.0
"Exotic and tasty! From start to finish we thoroughly enjoyed this experience. Located right near subway and ambience takes you in and gets you comfortable. We started with mint tea and a Lebanese lager but honestly the water served was so refreshing we drained our glasses repeatedly. The meat grape leaves were bite size and perfectly seasoned, and the baba ganoush perfectly prepared. A bread plate with assorted pita came out complemented with a pickled vegetable and olive tray. We ordered the lamb fetti and the lemon chicken dish. I can not decide which we enjoyed more. Both were strong flavors and put together in complimentary ways. We had the dessert ""raved"" by the food network with rose water and it was unique and perfect. We probably shouldn't have eaten it all but we arrived starving and left OVERFULL but happy...$90.",5.0

I kept returning over the years since the move and trying to convince myself that the food hasn't changed but it has and not for the better.

"I'll keep this brief: **Best Middle-Eastern food in Brooklyn/Manhattan**Period. That's all you need to know (this coming from a girl who's mamma's arabic cooking is practically famous in our hometown)Not your typical arabic restaurant- this isn't just mezze and kababs. This is home-cooked food, the stuff families eat for lunch back home- or serve for their dinner parties. Doesn't get more authentic than this.Warning, if you don't like parsley you WILL have a problem. Everything is plated with parsley. Oh and forget all that ""no carbs"" business- because their homemade rice (with vermicelli) is PERFECT. What my parents order, because these are hard to come by or too work-intensive:- Makdous (stuffed eggplant)- Sujuk (spicy dried beef sausage, very pungent. you've been forewarned)- Mhammara (red-pepper and walnut spread)- Kibbe Nayeh (raw kibbe, available only on weekends)- Musakhan (sumac, onions and chicken atop olive-oil soaked pita, it's my fav)- Sayadiyyeh (famous in lebanon and a favourite amongst people from the levant)- Any of their Whole Fish (fried or grilled, it's all good)What I order, because i'm craving my mamma's food (it's kinda ridiculous these things are in a restaurant on a menu, but whatever...  i can't cook)All of the above, Plus:- Okra- bean stew- Fetteh (chicken, chickpeas...whatever any fetteh)- Shulbato- Mjaddara- Stuffed Squash & Grape Leaves or Stuffed Cabage rolls- Maklobeh- Lamb ShankEssential stuff you should try, esp if you're a newbie to arabic food:- Salads: Tabbouleh or Fattoush. I'd go with the fattoush personally- Hummos +/- meat and baba ghanoush- mini pies meat spinach and feta- Falafel- Kibbie (not the raw one)- grape leaves- kafta- go ahead, order the mixed grilled combo. you know you want to.- knafeh for dessertArabic Breakfast:- Labaneh- Fried Halloumi- Hummos- foul mdammas- zaatar and cheese pastries",5.0

What my parents order, because these are hard to come by or too work-intensive:- Makdous (stuffed eggplant)- Sujuk (spicy dried beef sausage, very pungent. you've been forewarned)- Mhammara (red-pepper and walnut spread)- Kibbe Nayeh (raw kibbe, available only on weekends)- Musakhan (sumac, onions and chicken atop olive-oil soaked pita, it's my fav)- Sayadiyyeh (famous in lebanon and a favourite amongst people from the levant)- Any of their Whole Fish (fried or grilled, it's all good)What I order, because i'm craving my mamma's food (it's kinda ridiculous these things are in a restaurant on a menu, but whatever...  i can't cook)All of the above, Plus:- Okra- bean stew- Fetteh (chicken, chickpeas...whatever any fetteh)- Shulbato- Mjaddara- Stuffed Squash & Grape Leaves or Stuffed Cabage rolls- Maklobeh- Lamb ShankEssential stuff you should try, esp if you're a newbie to arabic food:- Salads: Tabbouleh or Fattoush. I'd go with the fattoush personally- Hummos +/- meat and baba ghanoush- mini pies meat spinach and feta- Falafel- Kibbie (not the raw one)- grape leaves- kafta- go ahead, order the mixed grilled combo. you know you want to.- knafeh for dessertArabic Breakfast:- Labaneh- Fried Halloumi- Hummos- foul mdammas- zaatar and cheese pastries",5.0
"I hesitate to write a review because I am worried that it will be even more crowded but..My Daughter suggested we go since it is one of her favorites.  We started with figtinis, a fig martini with a splash of proseco, don't miss out and hummus and the crispy brussel sprouts.  All delicious.  I asked our server what she would suggest and I ordered one of the specials which was layers of lamb, eggplant, rice, crispy pita chips and veggies, it was enough for 3 people and I was sorry I couldn't finish because it was so delicious I wanted to keep going.  I sampled everyone elses dishes and they were all wonderful, stuffed cabbage, and I can't even remember the rest but all good.  The service was exceptional!!  The Chef came over to our table twice and I even purchased her cookbook which she signed for me.  We had such a wonderful experience, it was warm, inviting, noisy, fun, delicious.  I could go on and on.  I can't wait to go back and sample more.  I would suggest you make a reservation, we went around 9 on a Sunday night and we were accommodated but it was packed.",5.0
I've been going here way before they relocated. The owner/chef really cares and would go around the table to ask everyone how the food was. I will definitely recommend to go here if your looking for a great ambiance and delicious Mediterranean food.,5.0
"You'd think with all the hype, the annoying parking, and its remote location that it'd be better than what I'd expected. Maybe I set my expectations too high with all the plaques of awards covering their entrance wall. I also think you need to love lamb to enjoy it, or just order the 2 things that are outstanding on the menu. The best things were the brussels sprouts, eggplant napoleon (best), and the knafeh desert (you have to love cheese). Everything else we had was average (listed in descending order), including the crispy halumoi cheese, shwarma sliders, the shrimp, musakhan (over powering cumin), chicken fetti, kibbie (almost the same as chicken fetti- just order one or the other).I kept looking over and wanting to eat other people's falafel, that must be a positive sign. I also enjoyed the ambiance, everyone that dined here were very casual local neighbors and families. It made you feel like you were in the suburbs again. Surprisingly, the pinot noir was pretty good, which is usually not the case for its price point.",3.0

"Delicious. Authentic. Great menu. Taking off one star because the servers weren't on their A game. It all worked out at the end but we were a bit confused when our entree showed up before our appetizers....then the side came after we were almost done with our meals. So yes, they could work on the order of when the dishes come out...Aside from that, the food was very flavorful and wonderfully presented. We tried:Fatoush - too much cilantro for my taste, should have asked for it without.Eggplant Napoleon - LOVED it and never had anything like it before. Brussel Sprouts - Couldn't get enough of these. Perfectly charred, came with a creamy sauce.Baked Mediterranean Eggplant - yes, we love eggplant. don't really like lamb, but my friend wanted it and i was happy to try it. Very good. I'd say its worth a trip to Bay Ridge if you love Mediteeranean food. The owner came out to greet us and was very sweet! Also, the raspberry mojito is a solid 5 stars.",4.0
"My cousin and I took our 84 year old aunt here for a belated birthday celebration. From the friendly greeting I received from Beesan at the entrance, to the service we received from Paco our server and Ivan, his assistant, we felt very welcomed at Tanoreen. Also the fact that Chef/Owner Rawia Bishara walks around the dining room to be  sure things are going as they should reflects a restaurant that knows how to get from average to excellent!The decor is very Middle Eastern and even included the attention to detail in the restrooms. The dining room is not big but we had a great table by a window that let the sun in...which after the weather this winter, was like being on vacation! But the star of the show was the food. It is fabulous! We ordered a flavorful baba ganoush to begin. You also are given a basket with thin fresh pita bread imported from New Jersey I believe, a huge pita chip flavored with Zartar - a delicious Middle Eastern spice mixture and a small plate with delicious olives, spiced beets and cauliflower. I ordered a vegetarian stuffed squash which was made with  freekeh (wheat) and some other cool things that I can't remember but loved. My cousin ordered two appetizers as her entree - a tomato salad and lentil squash stew and my aunt that the fish kibbie. We all agreed that our dishes were exceptionally well made and perfectly spiced. With only two very minor glitches, we were only given two food menus but three drink menus and they forgot to bring my cousin her lentil squash stew with the other dishes, everything about our experience at Tanoreen was exceptional.

"Amazing when a restaurant you already love, just keeps re-confirming your feelings time and time again. I love, LOVE Tanoreen's consistency. Even the best places can have a day off, when you order your all time favorite dish, but it's just a little off. I have not yet experienced that here. The food is always slap-in-your-face amazing, and you fall more and more in love with every bite.Yumm, can't wait to go again!",5.0
Time Out says this is one of the best 100 restaurants in NYC and I agree.  I have been a fan since Rawia owned the smaller location...and it was easier to get in there!  Try the Brussel Sprouts and Mhammara (forgive the spelling) for appy.  Any entree will do- they're all great.  Do order the special dessert...Knafeh- it's worth the wait!,5.0

"One of my favorite arab restaurants in America. It's closed on Mondays which is a bummer but the service and the food quality here are top notch. I recommend the lamb mansaf which is served traditional Palestinian style and full of meat. The bread is great as are the appetizers. Unfortunately NYC does not seem to have any really good and authentic arabic restaurants but this is an exception and is for sure the best Arab restaurant in NYC.  Make sure to get a lot of appetizers the hummos, tabbouleh, and kibbeh are amazing.

"I walked away from this restaurant with two impressions:1. The staff is extremely attentive, friendly, helpful. Glasses of water were always refilled. Baskets of pita bread were always replenished. The owner walked to each table and had a conversation with almost every patron. 2. They love lemon juice. Everything had a heavy, acidic flavor. The hummus, the entrees, the salads - lemon juice galore. I hate to write a poor review on a restaurant that has gathered so many greats ones ...

"3.5Most of the food is excellent, especially the appetizers (tried meat grape leaves, fried haloumi, curried cauliflower and sujok).  The lamb kafta entree was tasty too, if a little heavy and salty.  You should probably order something with lamb, though.I could probably do without the high class aspirations and the accompanying 25% mark up in all honesty.  I'm sure some people are excited by the availability of espresso martinis, waitstaff fussing over everything and the tastefully selected techno soundtrack, but I object to having to pay $20 an entree for the privilege. I probably won't be back - I'll be on the look out for somewhere similar, but more reasonably priced.",3.0

"What can I say except that I'm lucky to have lived near this place since it was just an infant and have watched as it's blossomed into the beautiful and esteemed restaurant that it is today. Just walking by it is enough to render my senses rapt and inspire insuppressible cravings. I have even popped into the take away/catering store attached and ordered the shawarma sandwich to satisfy my desire for Tanoreen spices.I love taking vegetarian, vegan and gluten-intolerant friends here. They're in heaven! And I like a place where I can be a carnivore and my friends can be veg-heads and we can all roll out with huge smiles. I once had a stuffed red pepper here as an appetizer that put all other stuffed vegetables to shame, permanently. It was a special but I wish they would put it on the regular menu so I could eat it all the time. The lamb, rice and amazing red sauce that adorned this perfect pepper were unforgettable. The beet salad, labaneh, fatoush, fried haloumi, mini pies, sambosek, and Mhammara (the most unreal combination of bell peppers, walnuts, pomegranate molasses and spices) are some of my favorite appetizers, plus you can make a whole meal out of just those and still walk out stuffed.

"Amazing amazing middle eastern food. And the dishes are nothing like other middle eastern ones I've had - it's like classic dishes with a modern twist, and of course the freshest ingredients available.A note on the service: our server was really friendly and fine. The host gave us a little bit of an attitude that we didn't have reservations (but it was only 3 of us and we came early, 6pm on a Saturday, and we squeezed around a high to). And my friend asked for a ginger ale refill halfway through the meal that he never got.Overall it was a really good deal.. three of us got 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, a dessert, and a couple of drinks. It came out to only $37 a person! (WITH tip)There were so many dishes I saw on other tables that I regretted not ordering, as good as our tables dishes were! I'm definitely coming back.Appetizers:- Pita/Lavash (free) - WOW the lavash (crispy flatbread) was SO GOOD! Tons of amazing seasoning on it, and sesame seeds. I've never been so impressed by flatbread.- Hummus - a must have. Everyone at my table raved this was probably the best hummus they've had in nyc. Incredibly fresh, great seasoning.- Kibbie - really good. Ground lamb w/ great seasoning, and nuts.- Meat pies - pretty good, sampler of 3 small pies, but I think there were way better appetizers on the menu.- Brussels sprouts - we didnt' get this but the table next to us did. It looked absolutely delicious, tossed with plenty of seasoning and flavors. I'm definitely getting this next time.- Kibbie - our waitress said this other dish the table next to us got - two juicy looking slabs of meat with nuts on top - was kibbie, and was goat meat. I can't find this looking back on the menu but I'll definitely ask next time I'm there..Entrees:- Shish kabob sandwich - good lamb. Can't really go wrong with a wrap.. and this is an amazing deal. We mainly got it so we would have something besides just ground lamb.- Baked Mediterranean eggplant - delicious. Like an eggplant-lamb-lasagna kind of thing but so much better. The rice pilaf was a mixture of rice & vermicelli noodles, and neutralized the strong flavors in the baked eggplant really well.- Sayadiyya (tilapia - one of the specials) - really really good. Fried pieces of tilapia mixed with rice, and cucumber/tomato salad on the side. Flavored so well. Just wish there was slightly more meat to this dish.Dessert:- Knafeh - sooo good! And cheesy. I had a friend who made rose water soaked bread with pistachio - this really reminded me of that, I kind of got the rose water flavor in the knafeh. And it's really sweet but a very subtle kind of sweet. You also get a GIANT wheel of this.. plenty for the table!Cocktails:- Pistachio martini - delicious. The pistachios seemed to infuse the drink with its flavor even more as time went on. A light sweet drink, great pairing with dinner.Everything was delicious but we all kept seeing dishes other tables ordered that looked just as good and even better.

Gin & Tonic that my BF ordered was so watered down, that you could not detect the gin.  When we politely told the waiter that the drink was not good, he said when you order another drink, he will ask the bartender to make it stronger, we insisted on a change of the drink, to which the waiter obliged.

Roasted cauliflower with tahini sauce and pomegranate molasses. ORDER IT PLEASE.Yogurt lamb dish - this was a special, so I don't remember the exact name, but it was also delicious. Two types of lamb dumplings in a tangy yogurt sauce.Knafeh: I had never had it, but it's phyllo dough with sweet cheese, drizzled with rosewater syrup and sprinkled with pistachios. Or, heaven. Don't be deterred by the note on the menu that it takes an extra 15 minutes...it's definitely worth it. So delicious.We left completely stuffed, and I already can't wait to go back.",5.0

Best:Muhamurra: tangy. heavy on pomegranate molasses.Eggplant Napoleon: Layered, good eggplant parm. textures, better flavors.Cauliflower salad: As described.

Acidic and delicious.Hummus: More masbacha than Greek.Kibbe main: Plain kibbe, great crust, delicious raw or cooked.Pickles at beginningGood:Chicken zaatar rollsShrimpJew's Mallow: Somewhere between italian wedding soup and southern collared greens.

Gin & Tonic that my BF ordered was so watered down, that you could not detect the gin.  When we politely told the waiter that the drink was not good, he said when you order another drink, he will ask the bartender to make it stronger, we insisted on a change of the drink, to which the waiter obliged. The service was less then mediocre, our waiter seemed annoyed, not something a guest of the restaurant should feel. The food was OK. I enjoyed the sliders.",2.0
"Omg the best food ever! Fresh tasting and delicious! I order delivery from them a lot, they are so nice, and even better-very fast! Always get the order right! I love the Mediterranean Grilled Chicken, soooo good! The rice pilaf with mushrooms is so yummy. Their Fatoosh salad is delicious, I get it as a side, or sometimes as a meal with grilled chicken. Also love their hummus and baba ganoush! Grape leaves are excellent too! The flavors are so good, and I feel healthy after I eat this, so you know they're using good ingredients. Definitely recommend!",5.0
"Really good. Hummus with meat, Schwarma sliders, kibbeh, the pies...the Brussels sprouts are amazing!!!! Been frequenting more often. Most recently had the chicken tangine, off the hook good!",5.0
"Tanoreen is an absolute gem. I will be going back many times after a spectacular dinner on Friday evening. Make sure to make a reservation...this place is popular!We had:Hummus: amazing, creamy, smooth. Not too tahini-y. Served with pita and hard crackers.Eggplant Napoleon: crispy eggplant battered and layered with baba ghanoush and topped with a delicious Mediterranean pesto.Cauliflower salad: This BLEW my mind.. Roasted cauliflower with tahini sauce and pomegranate molasses. ORDER IT PLEASE.Yogurt lamb dish - this was a special, so I don't remember the exact name, but it was also delicious. Two types of lamb dumplings in a tangy yogurt sauce.Knafeh: I had never had it, but it's phyllo dough with sweet cheese, drizzled with rosewater syrup and sprinkled with pistachios. Or, heaven. Don't be deterred by the note on the menu that it takes an extra 15 minutes...it's definitely worth it. So delicious.We left completely stuffed, and I already can't wait to go back.",5.0
"My water was never empty. Service was professional, casual and friendly. Best:Muhamurra: tangy. heavy on pomegranate molasses.Eggplant Napoleon: Layered, good eggplant parm. textures, better flavors.Cauliflower salad: As described. Cauliflower saturated with pomegranate molasses and a few other mellowing flavors. Acidic and delicious.Hummus: More masbacha than Greek.Kibbe main: Plain kibbe, great crust, delicious raw or cooked.Pickles at beginningGood:Chicken zaatar rollsShrimpJew's Mallow: Somewhere between italian wedding soup and southern collared greens. Delicious.Pie samplerOk:Nothing was just okay. Bare minimum here is good.",5.0
"I can not say enough good things about this place, and now I can order them from home on seamless when I cant take the time to get there and enjoy eating at the restaurant. Fresh food, you can taste the quality. I loved the Falafel and the Chicken Fetti. Kabobs are next. Tried the Shepherd's Pie, interesting, but too much potatoes, not enough lamb and  was rather bland. With all of the fresh ingredients and spices, that one dish was the only let down I have had. I want to eat through their whole menu, but not going to give them a bad rating about one dish when everything else I have had here was sooooooo goood!",5.0
"My girl and I decided to be spontaneous and tried Middle Eastern food for the first time. Service was excellent (I'm talking to you Phillip!) and very friendly. The eggplant appetizer blew us away, can't forget to mention that bread they gave us. I had a glass of red wine that cost me around $13 and must say it was worth it because I got a little drunk off of it and had a great taste. I want to give you guys 4 stars but that lamb and the spicy chicken specials need to be toned down a bit. Both specials had a lot of parsley, many spices, and pretty expensive for what seemed like a stew of dripping lamb and dry chicken for my girl. We'll give it another shot one day because perhaps we jumped the gun.",3.0
"I've been here twice and both times were very enjoyable. The hostess and waiters were very nice and attentive. The Brussels sprouts were a bit too tangy for my taste, but was still delicious!

"Tanoreen might be my favorite restaurant in all of New York. It's not an everyday/go-to place (I'd probably pick a sushi or pizza joint for that), but when I'm in the mood for unique flavors and sick of everything else, I head here. The spices, the preparation...they separate Tanoreen from the already high level of Middle-Eastern restaurants dotting the map of NYC.I'm really glad to see their growing success since all the write-ups a few years ago--they deserve it. And now they're in a larger space and have a liquor license, so there's absolutely nothing to gripe about.Everything here is good, but first and foremost, if I come to Tanoreen, I come for the hot appetizers. The ""mezes"" you should try:  mini-pies, sambosek (yum) kibbie, and sujok. Of course, all the cold dishes are great as well. I haven't explore the entrees very much, but everything so far has stood up to the challenge. Can't wait to return!",5.0
"What can I say about Tanoreen that hasn't already been said? It's the best Arabic food in NYC. I'm half Palestinian and half Lebanese, born in NYC, and was raised on Arabic food. I've been to the Middle East 12 times in my life, and have eaten everything along the way. Rawia's food is as good as the best of the best, anywhere in the world. Everything is great, but a few of my must-have favorite dishes: the brussel sprouts with tahini, the eggplant Napoleon, the fattoush salad, and the garlicky shrimp with rice.  OH - and the KENAFEH. It's incredible.  Get the large size- you won't be able to stop eating it once you start! It's worth the extra 15 minute wait to get it! (And the calories too)",5.0
"If you live in bay ridge, you know there are a lot of restaurants to choose from, but if you want good food, I suggest going to Tanoreen. Even though they are a little pricy, its worth trying Tanoreen food. The decor is beautiful and seating comfortable. The service is excellent.Even if you are the last one in the restaurant, they will let you take your time. My friends and I went there last month and we were the last one's there and no one rushed us to get out of the restaurant.Definitely worth a try!",5.0
"What's harder to find in Bay Ridge than a parking spot?  Because of this, I was so happy to find that they offer free valet service.  Headache and frustration of circling for a spot while starving avoided...yes!The service here is ridiculously good.  It seemed like every time I took a sip of water, there was someone till my glass back up to the top.  And our server cleared our table of crumbs between each course with one of those crumb swipers you see in fancy restaurants :)On to the food - if you like, actually if you love lemon and parsley, you will love every dish on the menu!  This was my first time here.  We tried 3 apps and 2 entrees and there seemed to be a strong presence of lemon and parsley on all of them.  I mean intense lemon and large amounts of chopped parsley and not just a sprig on the side just for color.  They most go through tons of parsley a week!  It's not something I loved nor hated.  But those 2 ingredients def add a pop of freshness.I went with the other yelp suggestions and tried the eggplant napoleon and was so happy.  If you love eggplant you'll love this.  It's a tower of fried eggplant with babaganoush in between each layer.  We also ordered the olive tapenade with pita and that was really good too.  It was not salty at all like traditional tapenades.  The 3 meat pie sampler was a surprise, I was expecting empanada type pies, but they were actually more of tiny pizza pies.  Wasn't super impressed.For entrees we had the stuffed cabbage and the lemon shrimp with rice pilaf.  Hello lemon in both dishes!  Whoa!",4.0

The wine surprised me- must try more wines from Lebanon. The entree was heavenly- it was layers of eggplant stuffed w/ lamb, spices, and pine nuts. The nuts definitely elevated it to heavenly status. My friends had the eggplant napoleon and the grilled medi chicken- those looked very good as well. The last time we were here, we got the grilled kabob platter and it's enough for two people. We had so much food, I thought I was having a baby.Cocktails: The tanoreentini (or whatever that was) was fun and refreshing. La H. didn't like it so it was up to me and Chu Bear to finish it. Just remember- the arakh is an acquired taste. The more water you put in it, the less bitterness in your mouth. Desserts: Knafeh- if you miss your mom's kunafa, this will definitely satiate your craving. The sahlab was okay, I've had better but that knafeh more than made up for it.Tip: You need reservations on the weekend. If you come without, prepare to wait at least an hour and a half.

The standard Middle Eastern standards are fantastic: hummus and baba ghanouj. Highly recommended to get the fattoush. Try slathering some fattoush and baba on some of their spiced flatbbread (which is SPIRITUAL), and you will think you died and went to heaven.

Not just the dishes, but they would do a full wipe of the table and even provide new silverware.  This is not typical of service in Brooklyn or even in most Manhattan restaurants, so this was quite exceptional!Tanoreen's setting is warm and inviting, with nice Earth tones inside with artifacts on the wall representing the area where the cuisine originates.  It's a lovely setting that is elegant yet not pretentious.Okay, let's get into the food breakdown shall we?Basket o' BreadMy name, not theirs.  Before your food is even brought out, you are given a basket with various breads, including nice, soft (and warm) pita as well as crispy breads with and without herbs.   Each item in here was delicious and made for a wonderful base for the hummus we ordered.HummusThe hummus was easily one of the smoothest, creamiest and tastiest restaurant hummus dishes I've ever had.  The hummus was infused nicely with garlic with a layer of olive oil drizzled on top.  It was heavenly.  At first my girlfriend and I thought we wouldn't finish it, but boy were we wrong!  We polished that bowl off so well you'd think they wouldn't need to wash it!Meat Grape LeavesAll the stuffed grape leaves I've had before were generally cold and from a salad bar.  These were the real deal however.  Warm, succulent, full of flavor and surprisingly bright, these were one of the highlights of the meal.Vegetarian CombinationThis plate is a combination of shulbato, lentils, vegetarian grape leaves, sauteed greens and salad.  Everything on it was delicious, flavorful and moist, but the shulbato took the cake.  I've never had it before, and it was so bright, comforting and tasty that there was not one spot of it left on the plate!Grilled CombinationConsisting of chicken, kabob and shish kabob, we really enjoyed the meats.  They were really delicious and full of flavor.  This however is where the ""other"" .5 stars went to: the chicken was a bit dry for my tastes, but that's it.  Other than that everything else in the dish was perfectly cooked, and even if a bit dry, the chicken still had a ton of flavor!Knafeh dessertI confess, the Knafeh was the primary reason I came here after seeing it on Food Network's ""The Best thing I ever ate..."" program.  I needed to see this beautiful thing for myself.  My girlfriend and I were overjoyed to find out they had a smaller version of the dessert that is good enough for two people.  It was amazing.  The crispiness on the outside blends in with the smooth cheese on the inside.  It reminds me of a baklava a bit, but with cheese inside and less of an overwhelming sugar flavor.  The rose water added a wonderful touch to the dessert and I was very happy with it.Overall, my experience at Tanoreen was *stellar*.  I enjoyed the food, the service and the setting.  This place is now on my personal list of places I know to go to if I'm fiending for some fantastic Middle Eastern cuisine!",4.0

"Just got back from eating at this wonderful restaurant, and all I can say is WOW! I had the chicken kabob and it was amazing! The chicken was juicy and had that nice grill flavor. The rice with the vermicelli was a  great combination. My boy friend had the shepherds pie, and he really enjoyed it. The mash potato was his favorite part. I definitely will be coming back.",5.0

"Food was so-so. I tried a ground lamb dish, and I ended up not eating some of it because it had a significant aftertaste that I just did not enjoy. I love all lamb dishes, so I was a bit surprised.

"Been here now a few times and every time has been excellent. They have an extensive, but actually quite inventive menu of Lebanese/Mediterranean cuisine.

I adore fatoush and this one was tasty but a bit too light on pita. But truly everything was fresh and quite aromatic as it should be.For the main I shared a lovely shrimp dish and a chicken shish kebab that was wonderfull grilled.

"Finally made the trip out to Tanoreen -- and coming from Inwood, an evening in Bay Ridge makes for a very long trip.  There are some things about Tanoreen that are a bit confusing; for starters, there are a lot of menus (there's the regular menu, the wine menu, the cocktail menu, and the specials menu) and yet the menu, at least when we were there, was a starting point for negotiation as there were a number of items they didn't have (we arrived at 7:30 and they didn't have the chicken tagine, the bottom four desserts on the dessert menu, and a number of other entrees on the specials list had a small X next to them).  What's not confusing about Tanoreen is the food. Just about everything we had was tasty.  We started with a bunch of appetizers: falafel, grape leaves, and two spreads - the spreads were absolutely divine, the grape leaves were good, and the falafel was standard.  For the main course, I had requested the chicken tagine, but they didn't have it, so I instead ended up with another chicken dish - a rich mishmash of shredded chicken, rice, almonds, yogurt, and tahini - delicious, unbelievably dense, and very rich.  Others with us had the baked eggplant (I thought this was the best dish of the night), the kebab plate (standard kebabs; certainly tasty and moist but the not the most sensational kebabs I've ever had); and the much-raved-about lamb shank which apparently was so sublime that my friend practically licked the meet off the bone.  The dessert selection was fairly limited (again, much of the dessert menu was unavailable), but we had the baklava (very different than baklava I've had before; this wasn't at all sticky and it wasn't particularly sweet, but it was delicious). I had also ordered the cookie plate, but they were out of it, so they brought us something else -- it was cookie-ish, but the cookies were stuffed with maybe dates? or figs? and spices? Again, not at all sweet; instead, these had a complex nutty and almost bitter taste.Tanoreen is definitely not a super refined place in terms of service -- while the staff is pleasant (as is the owner who goes from table to table to check in), it doesn't feel like you're supposed to linger. In fact, our waiter pounced on us to take our order, and seemed eager to move us along.  I also found the general lack of information about what was and wasn't available a bit frustrating - I wish the waiter had announced at the beginning of the meal ""sorry, we're out of the following ten items"" (also, my friend ordered the lamb, and the waiter said ""it's not ready yet!"" My friend said ""But it's 7:50, when's it going to be ready?!"")  But clumsy service notwithstanding, Tanoreen is definitely good, reasonably priced food.  Whether we'll travel from Inwood to Bay Ridge again for it, I'm not sure, but it was definitely worth the trip.",4.0
"I hate to be yet another person to say ""I preferred the early version,"" but the new, bigger, shinier Tanoreen does not make me love Brooklyn the same way the old one did.  I preferred the BYOB policy, the intimate seating, the more frequent interaction with the lady who makes all of the delicious appetizers, and the sense that you were being well taken care of.All of that said, this is still an extremely excellent restaurant.  Yes, it's crowded (we were 20 minutes late for our 7 pm reservation and couldn't be seated until 8:20) and yes the food is very sour, but oh is it delicious.  We ordered only vegetarian dishes (and no alcohol) and just about everything off the special menu was standout-- especially the cauliflower tagine and the red-pepper-walnut spread.  It will never be the same as it once was, but it might still be worth the trip to Bay Ridge.",4.0

In fact, our waiter pounced on us to take our order, and seemed eager to move us along.  I also found the general lack of information about what was and wasn't available a bit frustrating - I wish the waiter had announced at the beginning of the meal ""sorry, we're out of the following ten items"" (also, my friend ordered the lamb, and the waiter said ""it's not ready yet!"" My friend said ""But it's 7:50, when's it going to be ready?!"")  But clumsy service notwithstanding, Tanoreen is definitely good, reasonably priced food.  Whether we'll travel from Inwood to Bay Ridge again for it, I'm not sure, but it was definitely worth the trip.",4.0
"I hate to be yet another person to say ""I preferred the early version,"" but the new, bigger, shinier Tanoreen does not make me love Brooklyn the same way the old one did.  I preferred the BYOB policy, the intimate seating, the more frequent interaction with the lady who makes all of the delicious appetizers, and the sense that you were being well taken care of.All of that said, this is still an extremely excellent restaurant.  Yes, it's crowded (we were 20 minutes late for our 7 pm reservation and couldn't be seated until 8:20) and yes the food is very sour, but oh is it delicious.  We ordered only vegetarian dishes (and no alcohol) and just about everything off the special menu was standout-- especially the cauliflower tagine and the red-pepper-walnut spread.  It will never be the same as it once was, but it might still be worth the trip to Bay Ridge.",4.0

"The last time I recalled having sayaddiyeh was back in 1998 when I was only twelve years old. With a budding palette that had not been equipped to treasure the intricate particulars of Arabic cuisine, I enjoyed the rice and fish dish instituted by the fishermen of Palestine and the surrounding Levant. My father, a lamb and chicken sort of man, never cared for sayaddiyeh, and consequently it was not something my mother often made. But recently at Tanoreen in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge, the dish transcended from distant memory to a splendid congregation of tilapia, rice, and salad. The spices were running rampant, not as a superfluous culinary theatric employed by many-a-trendy restaurant, but with measure, technique, and reason. Variations of sayaddiyeh exist, but Tanoreen's brought forth a uniquely delicious rendition with almond rice that was intensely purple and brown. Stained by caramelized onions, fish oil, and stock, the dish was served the way many Palestinians eat their lunch or dinner: with a shepherd's salad on the very same plate. Fresh parsley topped the sayaddiyeh, along with a wedge of lemon and an oily, spicy dressing suggested for zing.Recipes like sayaddiyeh are the cherished dark horses of Levantine Arabic food. The presence of this particular fish dish on the Tanoreen menu, along with irrefutable Palestinian eats like m'ssakhan (open-faced pita, layered with onion, sumac, pine nuts and chicken); kindle a sense of nostalgia and curiosity not experienced at other Arabic establishments.Rawia Bishara is the doyenne behind Tanoreen. A hospitable woman with a strapping presence, she considers her environment astutely when translating Palestinian cuisine to the American palette. She is Arabic in many ways. She dons glaring gold jewelry and wears full maquillage that's representative of a Jordanian auntie, but Ms. Bishara is also sensibly American. A mussaka'a is prepared on her stovetop with eggplant and chickpeas, the way a grandmother may prepare it at an extinct Palestinian village. But note that the ingredients used designate a sense of locale integration. Kale, tilapia, and Brussels sprouts find a place on the menu, the sprouts laced with tasty lashings of tahini and lemon juice. Other stars that shine come from the appetizer section. There is of course, the quotidian hummus. At Tanoreen it is rendered silky and tangy, with olive oil in centre and whole chickpeas to punctuate. The cauliflower salad is a fine specimen of Ms. Bishara's point of view. The browned vegetable is dressed alluringly with tahini and pomegranate molasses.The thrills of human experience can easily be witnessed when gathered around good food that is shared, appreciated, and devoured. At Tanoreen this is ritual. A dip of ground walnuts, red pepper, and pomegranate molasses, known as muhammara is to be slathered on just about anything you can imagine. It is divine. The kibbe, torpedoes of hot, freshly fried bulgur, stuffed with ground lamb and pine nuts, are just begging to be split open and devoured. To which I must attest are totally worth the tongue burn.As a cuisine that struggles to retain its integrity with labels like Middle Eastern or Israeli, Tanoreen is an important, cultural vehicle contributing to the Palestinian narrative as it is stands to be perceived. This is truly a favorable establishment to add to that ever-growing New York restaurant list.",4.0
"My family and I have been going to Tanoreen for years and each and every meal experience was simply delicious.  Their menu selections have increased through the years which only makes the dining experience that much more wonderful and tasty.  The standard items that have given Tanoreen its stellar reputation are always present on the menu and in addition they always have a delectable selection of daily specials.I should note that I have traveled and lived in the Levant area of the Middle East, and enjoyed homemade food giving me an appreciation for authentic cuisine from that region.  I can only say that Tanoreen is the real mccoy, and in my opinion elevates the Levantine cuisine to a new level.  There are no other Middle Eastern restaurant establishments in NYC that offers the Levantine regional specialities that Tanoreen does.  We are lucky indeed to have a restaurant establishment of this caliber in the area.  If you have the opportunity to dine here, DO SO, you will not be disappointed!.  The only bad choice you can make is to order too much food, something easy to do given the selection of appetizers and main courses and the generous portions.  Each and every dish is prepared with attention to detail and so very delicious.  To note also is that the main course platters and some of the salads offered are meals in and of themselves so sharing with your table companions is a great way to have the full Tanoreen experience and taste a variety of foods.My very favorite items on their menu are the following:  Appetizers:Eggplant Napolean  (it melts in your mouth, heavenly)Kibbie (a staple in Syria, Lebanon. Palestine & Jordan but sadly hard to find in the U.S.)Fattoush Salad (refreshing, healthy, delicious, a must-order for the table, your dinner won't be complete without it)Turkish Salad (another home-prepared staple on dinner tables throughout the Levant...wonderful paired with grilled meats)Makdous (again, only at Tanoreen....tiny oil-cured eggplants stuffed with walnuts, red pepper & garlic...what a treat!)And of course, you can't go wrong in ordering Tanoreen's Meat Pies, Hummous, Tabouleh, Baba Ghanouge, Labaneh.  These items are easily found at average Middle Eastern restaurant establishments but Tanoreen's version are delicious because the ingredients are top-notch and prepared in their authentic way.  Main Courses (note, some of these that I selected are part of their daily specials):Stuffed Zucchini with Lemon-Yogurt Sauce (simply put, exquisite, unparalleled!)Lamb Stew (hearty and delicious)Baked Mediterranean Eggplant (again, unparalleled, the chef is a wizard with eggplants)Okra Stew  (if you are a fan of okra you will love this dish)If you are lucky enough to go on a night when the Chicken Musakhan is offered, don't hesitate to order it.  It is simply divine.  And I love that they pair their main courses with their rice pilaf & vermicelli noodles!As they say in Arabic, Sahtein (""Eat in good health!"")",5.0
"This food is fantastic.  Whenever I have guests visit me in New York this is one long haul I drag them all on.  Every appetizer on their menu is delicious, I would especially recommend the Makdous, Sujok and Kibbie.  If you call in advance you can often get Kibbeh Nayyeh (raw lamb with delicious spices).  Having a glass of Arak isn't cheap ($10), but definitely adds to the experience, as it serves as a nice palate cleanser. To give you an idea of how addictive it is, I have a coworker who rides the subway 70 minutes each way - for take out.",5.0
"This place is a classic. I have been here numerous times and the deliciousness of the food never ceases. Lamb dishes are definitely the go to for me. last night i had kibbie, and sambousek, both amazing appetizers.

Their dessert, kenafe, is also very amazing so definitely leave room for that at the end. Also, weekends, you definitely need reservations and it doesnt hurt to have one on weeknights too.

"Came here a few times because it is one of the few restaurants my bf and I will drive out of the way to in order to have our usual order:Brussels sprouts - believe the hype!  We ordered two plates. We usually don't eat brussels sprouts outside of this restaruant.Hummus - as fresh as it gets, simple.  Simply delicious.Lentil pilaf - a good substitute to 'just rice'.  Salad - any of their salads from their cold appetizer menu serve as a refreshing side with anything you order. Kibi - flavorful ground lamb. The pine nuts in the recipe stand out.Cocktails - you feel like their bartender put a lot of love into those unique flavors. So far a favorite is the Nazareth sunrise.  Forgot what was in it, but not knowing what a sunrise taste like, you will now.Knafeh - a very interesting and unique experience. It's cheese, it's crispy, it's light (ish?).  Shredded fillo dough, stuffed with two kinds of sweet cheeses.  At first the texture of the cheese makes you ask the question ""is this dessert or an appetizer?"".  Then you taste the rosewater syrup and how it compliments the dish perfectly - then that's the moment when your brain registers ""Yup, this is dessert"".  Finally, you experience the perfectly crispy shredded fillo dough (kinda like eating Wheaties, but better) and continue thinking ""this is good"".  Then, you look down and your plate is empty :).Eggplant napoleon - very good, but we ordered this only once.  Although we enjoyed it, we like the other menu items better.Staff - hit or miss. Some are serious, some are super friendly and accommodating.Ambiance - I like it. I don't need to get dressed up, but if I did, it would suite with the atmosphere just as well.Nothing tastes over-salted (they season with fresh herbs and lemon), you don't leave feeling so heavy (probably bc there are bunch of flavorful veggie dishes to choose from).Still have to try all the other things on the menu, which means we'll be coming back soon.  Great menu choices for vegetarians and non-vegetarians.",5.0
The new location is terrific! It was a Sunday night at 8pm and every table was full but we were still seated in 5 minutes.  The service was great.  The atmosphere is very nice (although I wish they'd turn the lights down a little to make it a little more intimate). The food is really wonderful.  It's classic Middle East but with the owners own flavoring on most of the foods.  Appetizers are priced in the $5.50 - $6.50 range and meals run from $12 to $18 with some higher priced specials.  The owner still goes from table to table to check on everyone. The crowd was everything but Middle Eastern.  I sensed that most of the patrons weren't even from Bay Ridge...I know the Slopers love this place and I agree...it's great!,4.0

I have been wanting to try Tanoreen forever! It definitely met my expectations. Started with the Eggplant Napoleon and Grape Leaves. Eggplant Napoleon was cooked really well. I loved the flavors of the dish. The Grape Leaves were amazing! It was my first time trying Grape Leaves w/ lamb stuffing rather than the veggies stuffing and now I don't think I can go back to just the veggie kind. Had the Grilled Combination Platter for an entree. The lamb was the highlight. It was so tender and juicy. The beef was a bit tough and the chicken a bit too sour. The rice was delicious and everything was fresh.The restaurant itself is beautiful. It's casual but you wouldn't feel out of place if you dressed up. The staff is so friendly and helpful and you get a homey feeling when eating here. Loved my entire dining experience.,4.0
"Came here one Saturday evening.  The décor is tasteful and inviting--warm, yellow lighting, hints of brass, mahogany, maroon.  We were seated and served crispy breads and some pickled items.  I found myself wishing we had some spread or oil or something to eat with the bread as it was a bit dry.  We looked over the menu to order our dinner.  As someone who doesn't eat lamb, it was probably not the best place for me, as lamb is the main element in many of the dishes.  For an appetizer, we ordered the musakhan, which is a flatbread topped with chicken, onions and almonds.  This was delicious.  I enjoyed the brightly flavored chicken and the crunch of the almonds.  It was a nice way to whet the appetite.  My date ordered some sort of mixed grill which came with different preparations of lamb (so I didn't try any), and I ordered the baked Mediterranean eggplant.  The portions are quite large.  Each dish is garnished, a little too generously, with parsley all around the edge of the plate.  Hence, presentation isn't anything to applaud, but if you're hungry, you'll be satisfied.  My eggplant dish was heavily spiced.  I don't mean that it was spicy, but it was teeming with flavor, so much so, that I could have used some plain rice or some neutral item to temper it a bit.  The eggplant was served with rice, but the rice was seasoned and mixed with vermicelli, and could have been a dish on its own.  I wasn't able to finish my dinner and took most of it home (in fact, I mixed the leftovers with plain rice and was able to share it with two other people and we were all satisfied).  My date enjoyed his grilled meats, but wasn't amazed or jumping out of his seat.  In toto, a nice dinner, great portions and bold flavors.  I would visit again, but after I try some of the other Mediterranean joints in the area.",3.0

"With so many of our friends on Yelp giving it 4 and 5 stars that we respect we had to revisit as our first visit was before were were Yelping. We figured they must have had a bad day when we went the first  time. Both times  we were not able to take pictures because we got a super small table with no room for a camera we were rushed  and just did not have time. The second time we went  we had Arabic Tomato Salad chopped tomatoes, cucumbers onions in olive oil and lemon   with feta Cheese,  Red Snapper entree , Kibbie  appetizer  and Kafta entree.We are just not in love with  this restaurant. Here are the reasons. 1) It is super  crowded2)service was sloppy and rude both times  and both  times  we went years apart3)the  food though authentic was not any different  than anywhere else that serves similar food.4)way over priced for what you get!The fish  was dry, the salad was too acidic , I grew up eating Kibbie (spelled different ways,  here they spell it Kibbie)   not sure why people like it here.  Mine tasted deep fried but I couldn't taste much else but the fry taste It should be balanced  and have many nuances of flavor. All Kibbie is deep fried but usually you can taste the food here I just tasted something that had a fried taste,  For us (me and my hubby) there are too many restaurants serving  similar food that are  better to go back here. Some of the Yelp friends who rated it highly have experienced taste buds so maybe  we went on  2 off days but they were days years apart. If it is hit and miss it's not worth the price in my opinion at least for us.",3.0
"It's hard to say what I had to eat here because I went with a regular who grabbed the menu and asked the waiter to bring him a list of things, and some specials that I'm not sure were on the regular menu. That said, everything was fantastic. I advise the whole fish, which was huge and amazing. All the typical middle eastern accoutrements were above average. Definitely go with a big group, ask what the specials are, and order as much as you can possibly stomach. You will not be disappointed!",5.0
"This place had been on my list since before moving to NYC, since I had heard great reviews and am a huge fan of middle eastern food. I finally made it down the Bay Ridge (the ONLY drawback is trekking down) and dropped in for a few appetizers. They bring you out a delicious complementary bowl of olives, pickles, and pickled beets, as well as a basket of mixed breads. The herbed lavash (crispy flatbread) was amazing!We ordered the eggplant napoleon, mini pies (one spinach, one meat, and one cheese), and the vegetarian stuffed grape leaves. Hand's down, the eggplant was the winner. Personally, I'd skip the pies next time and order the meaty grape leaves. Don't get me wrong, however -- everything was delicious. Icing on the cake? Yep. The owner makes her rounds through the dining room to ensure everyone was satisfied. Love it.",4.0
"This place was great! Everything people write about certain dishes here are spot on. The Eggplant Napoleon, The Fried Cauliflower, The Brussel Sprouts were all perfect. These were the appetizers that we ordered. The waiter talked me out of ordering the Hummus. He said it was great but if I really wanted to try new things then this was the way to go. My wife and I also ordered a couple of drinks which was great as well coming from the full bar and a very nice wine list. The entrees were Fried Tilapia and Grilled Tilapia Rice and The Mixed Grill with an assortment of meats, lamb and chicken all perfectly seasoned. For dessert we had the famous Knafeh which was featured in ""Best Thing I ever Ate"" on the Food Network. This took about 15 minutes to make but it was easily the best, and most different dessert I ever had. The service was also great and everyone was very friendly and it felt like you were right at home. I can't wait to get back here.",5.0
"I visited Brooklyn from California with a friend in August 2009. Let's say we planned our trip around what to eat instead of what to see. Of the 16 different places we got food, this was my favorite. It's middle eastern cuisine. It's a small hole in the wall restaurant in Brooklyn. On this day, because we got up late, we had lunch at about 3-4pm. By 6ish, we were here and I wasn't even very hungry. But the food was so good, I finished my plate. Before your meal comes, you are given flat bread and pickles. The pickles are delicious!What we had:MEDITERRANEAN GRILLED CHICKEN ($15) Boneless chicken breast, basil pesto sauce with sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms, served with rice pilaf. *****This was the meal I ordered. The food comes visually appealing and doesn't look greasy. The chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful. My rating is an absolute 5!*****CHICKEN KABOB ($15):Tender chicken breast cubed and bathed in our special marinade. ****This is what my friend ordered and I had a taste. The chicken was marinated well and not dry. It too was delicious. I give this a 4.****If I ever make it to NYC again, this place is definitely on my list to visit again.

I have been wanting to try Tanoreen forever! It definitely met my expectations. Started with the Eggplant Napoleon and Grape Leaves. Eggplant Napoleon was cooked really well. I loved the flavors of the dish. The Grape Leaves were amazing! It was my first time trying Grape Leaves w/ lamb stuffing rather than the veggies stuffing and now I don't think I can go back to just the veggie kind. Had the Grilled Combination Platter for an entree. The lamb was the highlight. It was so tender and juicy. The beef was a bit tough and the chicken a bit too sour. The rice was delicious and everything was fresh.The restaurant itself is beautiful. It's casual but you wouldn't feel out of place if you dressed up. The staff is so friendly and helpful and you get a homey feeling when eating here. Loved my entire dining experience.,4.0
"Came here one Saturday evening.  The décor is tasteful and inviting--warm, yellow lighting, hints of brass, mahogany, maroon.  We were seated and served crispy breads and some pickled items.  I found myself wishing we had some spread or oil or something to eat with the bread as it was a bit dry.  We looked over the menu to order our dinner.  As someone who doesn't eat lamb, it was probably not the best place for me, as lamb is the main element in many of the dishes.  For an appetizer, we ordered the musakhan, which is a flatbread topped with chicken, onions and almonds.  This was delicious.  I enjoyed the brightly flavored chicken and the crunch of the almonds.  It was a nice way to whet the appetite.  My date ordered some sort of mixed grill which came with different preparations of lamb (so I didn't try any), and I ordered the baked Mediterranean eggplant.  The portions are quite large.  Each dish is garnished, a little too generously, with parsley all around the edge of the plate.  Hence, presentation isn't anything to applaud, but if you're hungry, you'll be satisfied.  My eggplant dish was heavily spiced.  I don't mean that it was spicy, but it was teeming with flavor, so much so, that I could have used some plain rice or some neutral item to temper it a bit.  The eggplant was served with rice, but the rice was seasoned and mixed with vermicelli, and could have been a dish on its own.  I wasn't able to finish my dinner and took most of it home (in fact, I mixed the leftovers with plain rice and was able to share it with two other people and we were all satisfied).  My date enjoyed his grilled meats, but wasn't amazed or jumping out of his seat.  In toto, a nice dinner, great portions and bold flavors.  I would visit again, but after I try some of the other Mediterranean joints in the area.",3.0
"I have been meaning to come here forever.  Twice I made dinner reservations but had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances.    MY LOSS! Yummy!  I just left and can't wait to go back!  The place is very pretty, the service outstanding and the food delicious! My companion and I shared a bunch of appetizers because they all looked so appetizing.  I couldn't decide and wanted to try them all.  Well as many as my greedy little eyes, hands and mouth could take!Meat grape leaves: warm and filled with rice, lamb and Delicious spicesKibbie:  A fried roll of goodness stuffed with lamb, pine nuts, onion and of course the Tanoreen spicesHummus:  Of course!  a well of olive oil and fresh chick peas in the center just wished the pita in the basket was warm.  Sliders:  lamb in little pita pockets with red onion, parsley, tomato and hummus.Pizza:  OK it wasn't called pizza but looked like one topped with shredded chicken.No room for dessert :( The cocktail menu looked amazing, with wonderful ingredients like Orange Blossom, Rose Water, Cardamon and Pistachio in their drinks but unfortunately this girl is on antibiotics.  Maybe I will just go back for desserts and cocktails!  YAY!",5.0

"With so many of our friends on Yelp giving it 4 and 5 stars that we respect we had to revisit as our first visit was before were were Yelping. We figured they must have had a bad day when we went the first  time. Both times  we were not able to take pictures because we got a super small table with no room for a camera we were rushed  and just did not have time. The second time we went  we had Arabic Tomato Salad chopped tomatoes, cucumbers onions in olive oil and lemon   with feta Cheese,  Red Snapper entree , Kibbie  appetizer  and Kafta entree.We are just not in love with  this restaurant. Here are the reasons. 1) It is super  crowded2)service was sloppy and rude both times  and both  times  we went years apart3)the  food though authentic was not any different  than anywhere else that serves similar food.4)way over priced for what you get!The fish  was dry, the salad was too acidic , I grew up eating Kibbie (spelled different ways,  here they spell it Kibbie)   not sure why people like it here.  Mine tasted deep fried but I couldn't taste much else but the fry taste It should be balanced  and have many nuances of flavor. All Kibbie is deep fried but usually you can taste the food here I just tasted something that had a fried taste,  For us (me and my hubby) there are too many restaurants serving  similar food that are  better to go back here. Some of the Yelp friends who rated it highly have experienced taste buds so maybe  we went on  2 off days but they were days years apart. If it is hit and miss it's not worth the price in my opinion at least for us.",3.0
"It's hard to say what I had to eat here because I went with a regular who grabbed the menu and asked the waiter to bring him a list of things, and some specials that I'm not sure were on the regular menu. That said, everything was fantastic. I advise the whole fish, which was huge and amazing. All the typical middle eastern accoutrements were above average. Definitely go with a big group, ask what the specials are, and order as much as you can possibly stomach. You will not be disappointed!",5.0
"This place had been on my list since before moving to NYC, since I had heard great reviews and am a huge fan of middle eastern food. I finally made it down the Bay Ridge (the ONLY drawback is trekking down) and dropped in for a few appetizers. They bring you out a delicious complementary bowl of olives, pickles, and pickled beets, as well as a basket of mixed breads. The herbed lavash (crispy flatbread) was amazing!We ordered the eggplant napoleon, mini pies (one spinach, one meat, and one cheese), and the vegetarian stuffed grape leaves. Hand's down, the eggplant was the winner. Personally, I'd skip the pies next time and order the meaty grape leaves. Don't get me wrong, however -- everything was delicious. Icing on the cake? Yep. The owner makes her rounds through the dining room to ensure everyone was satisfied. Love it.",4.0
"This place was great! Everything people write about certain dishes here are spot on. The Eggplant Napoleon, The Fried Cauliflower, The Brussel Sprouts were all perfect. These were the appetizers that we ordered. The waiter talked me out of ordering the Hummus. He said it was great but if I really wanted to try new things then this was the way to go. My wife and I also ordered a couple of drinks which was great as well coming from the full bar and a very nice wine list. The entrees were Fried Tilapia and Grilled Tilapia Rice and The Mixed Grill with an assortment of meats, lamb and chicken all perfectly seasoned. For dessert we had the famous Knafeh which was featured in ""Best Thing I ever Ate"" on the Food Network. This took about 15 minutes to make but it was easily the best, and most different dessert I ever had. The service was also great and everyone was very friendly and it felt like you were right at home. I can't wait to get back here.",5.0
"I visited Brooklyn from California with a friend in August 2009. Let's say we planned our trip around what to eat instead of what to see. Of the 16 different places we got food, this was my favorite. It's middle eastern cuisine. It's a small hole in the wall restaurant in Brooklyn. On this day, because we got up late, we had lunch at about 3-4pm. By 6ish, we were here and I wasn't even very hungry. But the food was so good, I finished my plate. Before your meal comes, you are given flat bread and pickles. The pickles are delicious!What we had:MEDITERRANEAN GRILLED CHICKEN ($15) Boneless chicken breast, basil pesto sauce with sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms, served with rice pilaf. *****This was the meal I ordered. The food comes visually appealing and doesn't look greasy. The chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful. My rating is an absolute 5!*****CHICKEN KABOB ($15):Tender chicken breast cubed and bathed in our special marinade. ****This is what my friend ordered and I had a taste. The chicken was marinated well and not dry. It too was delicious. I give this a 4.****If I ever make it to NYC again, this place is definitely on my list to visit again. There was so much I wanted to try as everything everyone else ordered looked fabulous.",5.0
"Tanoreen was the closest thing I can think of as being a Middle Eastern institution, in a neighborhood with many Middle Eastern establishments.  I enjoyed dining at the original location, a very small space that did very brisk business; the food was excellent.  Recently,  I made my first visit to Tanoreen's new location.I'm immediately struck by the difference.  The original location was very casual; Tanoreen now has the look and feel of a bonafide restaurant, and plenty of staff.  It is spacious, welcoming, and warmly lit.  Service is friendly and adequate.  There is a bar.The menu has expanded, but continues the same style.  Plenty of cold and hot appetizers, entrees, grilled entrees, and seafood.  Most seem to be classics but many have a twist on the traditional versions.  A page-long specials menu is also available.  Many choices on their small wine menu hail from the Mediterranean.Everything was ordered from the specials menu that night, and since it was a few weeks ago, I've regrettably forgotten some of the details.  For appetizers, the flatbread topped with spices, herbs, and chicken was absolutely delicious, an amazing mix of flavors and very bold.  The grilled brussel sprouts were, in contrast, rather mild in flavor and a bit too oily.  They were nicely grilled and cooked appropriately, but not memorable.For the two entrees, first was the fisherman's special, with a whole fried red snapper on a bed of salad and rice pilaf.  This was the most disappointing order for the night, and may deter another try at seafood here.  The salad and rice were fine, in fact the rice pilaf was richly flavored, brimming with ingredients, and I happily took that home.  The fish was overcooked, very dry, and tasteless.  I hardly ate it.  The other entree made up for it: lamb with yogurt sauce served atop rice and vermicelli.  The lamb was tender and tasty, nicely complemented by the sauce.  I enjoyed this very much.All in all, the new Tanoreen location lives up to its reputation, and has gained much in moving to the new space.  While not everything was a hit, the highlights were excellent and there is definitely something exciting about their food.  I look forward to trying other foods there.  Very importantly, reservations are HIGHLY recommended; their new location is constantly booked solid.  On the Tuesday night I went, by 8 PM, it was packed.",4.0
"Since we were in the area, my boyfriend and I stopped here to get some hummus to go. He raved about it from coming several years back, and was surprised to see a restaurant along with the carry-out deli connected. I perused the menu and the Yelp reviews and wanted to dine in but we had just gotten back from lunch. So instead we ordered a large serving of hummus to go (kind of expensive at $13/order) which came with some pita bread. I can't say I've ever had bad hummus so my review of the hummus may not be saying a lot -- Tanoreen's is yummy but I've never had un-yummy hummus! From the reviews, would definitely come back to dine in.",4.0
"I deserve to be flogged for living in the neighborhood and never having been to Tanoreen! I knew they had a Michelin star and that people traveled from Manhattan to eat here but for some crazy reason, I never bothered to eat here until I saw it on ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate."" Tanoreen is by far one of the top 5 restaurants I have ever been to - and trust me, I am VERY picky about my food (this causes for very high grocery bills too!) The atmosphere of the restaurant is great for both first dates and large groups of friends. Having gone on a packed Saturday night, the rooms are big enough that the noise level is moderate enough that you can still hear yourself think. What I liked about the clientele is it was a mix of people - a few tables of Middle Eastern people (that's a good sign that the food is good!) and a table of 35-year old Park Slope yuppies all pregnant with their first child. Word of advice - don't go crazy when ordering because you will not finish anything you eat - the portions are massive and we made this mistake and ended up taking home both of our entrees! The pita bread was basic pita bread but the crunchy seasoned flat bread was awesome and easy to fill up on. We ordered for an appetizer the Musakhan (not on the menu but usually a nightly special). This Middle Eastern ""pizza' was pita bread baked with chicken, onions, slivered almonds and wonderful spices like sumac and saffron and was out of this world. I could have eaten 5 platters of this if they let me! The chicken was very moist and high quality (I hate getting gross bits of any meat!) and the sweetness of the onions balanced out the powerful spices. The almonds polished off the dish with a smooth, crunchy, nutty flavor. Lentils are a favorite dish of mine - simple, healthy and flavorful if done right so we also ordered the lentil appetizer which was delicious!! Our mothers would kill us if we said it was better than theirs but my boyfriend and I inhaled it in seconds. First I put it on the pita bread but it was so tasty that it was great just eaten from the spoon - again the Middle Eastern flavors are bold and delicious and some caramelized onions mixed in compliment the lentils very well. After our entrees were brought out and we were barely touching them, one of the bus boys came over worried and asked if everything was ok. The fact that we hadn't eaten our main courses raised an alarm and the restaurant wanted to make sure everything was perfect. We explained how full we were and he said ""First time, right? People always order heavy on the appetizers!"" My boyfriend had the chicken kabob and really enjoyed it the next day, with a large side salad of mixed vegetables. I had ordered the grilled chicken dish marinated in pesto and olive oil with sun-dried tomato pieces and big pieces of fresh mushrooms and it was delicious!! You'd think that grilled chicken is boring and bland but it was awesome and again, very well cooked and flavorful! The side of vermicelli and rice was a tasty starch as well. We never made it to the knafeh dessert which brought us there in the first place but every single table around us had it and it looked great! The drinks were delicious too as we enjoyed quite a few Tanoreentinis and Pomereens! I'm not one to go cheap when eating out and I'll pay just about anything for an great meal but I was pleasantly pleased with how affordable our meal was at the end of the night - even with two appetizers and two meals and 3 martinis, the total bill came to $86. The drinks are the only thing that made it expensive ($30 for 3 drinks) and that's the norm for martinis anyway. I have had more expensive meals in Bay Ridge that weren't nearly as good as Tanoreen. The owner takes pride in her restaurant and checks in on all the guests throughout the night. We can't wait to go back soon! Oh and they have takeout so we can have Tanoreen any time we want, WOOHOO!",5.0
"I am Arab. Arabs love meeting new Arabs. Arabs love Arabic food. Arabs love Arabs who serve good Arabic food. SO when I planned my trip to New York for the first time I was stoked to find out that there's an entire neighborhood in Brooklyn crawling with Arabs, Arabic restaurants, Arabic bakeries and Arabic Hookah Spots. I must say, Bay Ridge you did NOT disappoint. There were a ton of options for Arabic dining and entertainment and naturally I Yelped the highest rated Arabic Restaurant in the area. Tanoreen was the first thing that came up. I was excited to try it because I heard about it through a fellow Californian who was impressed by their food while on his Arabic-Food exploration trip in New York. This review will be lengthy, because I am Arab..and Arabs love to complain about other Arabs. So here's my opinion of Tanoreen: Overrated in every way. First of all, when we walked in as a group of 5 the seating host said they could not seat us because all the tables were reserved and frankly he looked ""offended"" that we'd think we can just walk in without a reservation. Looking through the small restaurant I noticed 3 large empty tables right away. My initial thought was ""okay, is this the club that has a long line outside just to seem ""busy"" when really there's 20 people inside? However, it was Friday night (and it so happened that it was the first day of Eid, the Muslim holiday) and we did walk in at 7:30 pm so I gave them the benefit of doubt and figured the tables are just awaiting their reservations. My group and I stood outside for a few minutes trying to figure out our next move. Soon after the seating host came out again and said they have an open table for ONE hour only so if we can get in and out in one hour they can make it happen. He literally repeated ""you have to promise, one hour?"" OK so you have an open table that's open for an hour that you've claimed is reserved but now you're willing to fill with hurried customers? Now I am annoyed. But since the host seemed to think that we should be HONORED to be given this rare opportunity to ""quickly"" dine for an hour I just went along with it especially because we were already there and if this host thinks their restaurant is THIS special then maybe the food really is. It wasn't. I got stuffed artichokes in red tomato sauce, a classic Lebanese/Syrian dish, and it was very OKAY. Oh wait, let me rewind so I can rephrase: I didn't really GET this order I was basically FORCED to have it. When I sat down to look at the menu the waiter/host came by 2 minutes after to take our ""quick"" orders because you know, we had to be ""quick"". I asked for the Shawerma because ever since moving to the states at the age of 10 I have been on a search for a good shawerma sandwich (I have not been able to fulfill my mission unfortunately, but that's another separate review). The waiter/host looked at me, offended and said ""you come here to get shawerma?"" Um YES. It's on the menu. I assumed it was OKAY to order. But apparently I am stupid. And apparently I am good at offending this guy. Now I am really annoyed. He continued by saying ""you know what I'll get you something good, you'll LOVE me."" Now I am creeped out and annoyed. ""Then he corrected himself and said, you'll just LOVE it."" He then took my menu and left. Okay, I guess there goes my order. Soon after, the appetizer came out, an Eggplant Napoleon which is basically a crispy eggplant baba gannouch salad. This was truly delicious. I loved it. Up until my friend, also our New York guide, found hair in it. We got the dish replaced with another one. Yes, believe it or not, at this point, I am very annoyed. The food came out about 30 minutes later (okay, so they don't seem to be in THAT big of a hurry since we're not 45 minutes into our dinner and we have 15 minutes left on our clock to eat, get dessert and pay). We had three orders of the Grilled Combo which is basically a mixture of chicken and lamb kabobs with rice and salad and one order of the Vegi kabobs. My order, which was not on the menu, came out afterwards. Excepting amazing, because so far service has not been and this place seems to think that they have a divine right to that, the food was NOT. The kabobs were dry, my classic arabic artichoke dish was bland and the rice was the most flavorful item on the table. This was definitely a disappointment. To be fair though, the kenafa was fantastic. It better be. They are lebanese. They're suppose to have amazing kenafa. And they did. But that's the only thing that they did have. We left an hour and a half after our arrival and no one came to claim our table. They get 3 stars only because the Eggplant appetizer was innovative and the kenafa was yummy. On a side note, the place is nicely decorated, dimly lit, romantic and elegant so it gives a nice ambiance. This was definitely one of the nicer restaurants in Bay Ridge..Oh, I forgot to add, one of the 3 empty tables never got filled.",3.0
This place varies in its fusions but never ever deviates from its roots. A harmonious blend of classical Middle Eastern/Mediterranean homestyle cooking. The restaurant aims to promote and expose Middle Eastern gastronomic culture and claim it as a source of pride,4.0
"Without a doubt the best. The very, very best.Their appetizers are so good that it's pretty much the norm to fill up on a mezze platter and assorted other goodies - so I can't even really speak on the entrees.Get the brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Don't like either vegetable? Get them anyway - you're about to be converted.And do not even think about skipping the eggplant napolean. I dream about his dish and talk about it incessantly during my waking hours. Layers of the smokiest baba ganouj sandwiched between the crispiest, most amazing rings of fried eggplant.Was worried about the quality of the food once they moved to their bigger location - but it's still as wonderful. Service is still as good and you even can expect the table visit from Rawia, the most congenial of restaurant owners.",5.0

I guess Tanoreen doesn't need another amazing review but I have to give it one. We ordered a bunch of small plates and a bigger entree and everything was so delicious! I went with my boyfriend and another friend who have both spent time in the Middle East and they said this was the best hummus they've had since they were over there. It was definitely the best I've ever had. Highly recommend:Eggplant NapoleanPickled EggplantHummusTabouleh (mostly parsley! yess),5.0
This is a wonderful restaurant. The appetizers are particularly delicious and good value. My feeling is that the best meals here are composed of many of them and perhaps only one entree. The cauliflower with tahini is particularly tasty as is the fried brussels sprouts.,4.0
"This place is fabulous. The owner is so proud of her food and you can tell she cooks because it makes people happy. Her passion is the secret recipe- not the Tanoreen spices everyone mentions. It comes from her. You can either eat in the restaurant or take out from the side store. One of my favorite dishes is the kale. I am not sure what is in their other than onions and spices, but I can seriously eat an entire dish of this. All the products used are fresh and the finest. I love the kibbeh and  yogurt. The spinach pies, dolmas. All so delicious. This is the best lebanese place in all of Brooklyn if you ask me. I love coming here when I visit.",5.0

Soon after, the appetizer came out, an Eggplant Napoleon which is basically a crispy eggplant baba gannouch salad. This was truly delicious. I loved it. Up until my friend, also our New York guide, found hair in it. We got the dish replaced with another one. Yes, believe it or not, at this point, I am very annoyed. The food came out about 30 minutes later (okay, so they don't seem to be in THAT big of a hurry since we're not 45 minutes into our dinner and we have 15 minutes left on our clock to eat, get dessert and pay). We had three orders of the Grilled Combo which is basically a mixture of chicken and lamb kabobs with rice and salad and one order of the Vegi kabobs. My order, which was not on the menu, came out afterwards. Excepting amazing, because so far service has not been and this place seems to think that they have a divine right to that, the food was NOT. The kabobs were dry, my classic arabic artichoke dish was bland and the rice was the most flavorful item on the table. This was definitely a disappointment. To be fair though, the kenafa was fantastic. It better be. They are lebanese. They're suppose to have amazing kenafa. And they did. But that's the only thing that they did have. We left an hour and a half after our arrival and no one came to claim our table. They get 3 stars only because the Eggplant appetizer was innovative and the kenafa was yummy. On a side note, the place is nicely decorated, dimly lit, romantic and elegant so it gives a nice ambiance. This was definitely one of the nicer restaurants in Bay Ridge..Oh, I forgot to add, one of the 3 empty tables never got filled.",3.0
This place varies in its fusions but never ever deviates from its roots. A harmonious blend of classical Middle Eastern/Mediterranean homestyle cooking. The restaurant aims to promote and expose Middle Eastern gastronomic culture and claim it as a source of pride,4.0
"Without a doubt the best. The very, very best.Their appetizers are so good that it's pretty much the norm to fill up on a mezze platter and assorted other goodies - so I can't even really speak on the entrees.Get the brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Don't like either vegetable? Get them anyway - you're about to be converted.And do not even think about skipping the eggplant napolean. I dream about his dish and talk about it incessantly during my waking hours. Layers of the smokiest baba ganouj sandwiched between the crispiest, most amazing rings of fried eggplant.Was worried about the quality of the food once they moved to their bigger location - but it's still as wonderful. Service is still as good and you even can expect the table visit from Rawia, the most congenial of restaurant owners.",5.0

I guess Tanoreen doesn't need another amazing review but I have to give it one. We ordered a bunch of small plates and a bigger entree and everything was so delicious! I went with my boyfriend and another friend who have both spent time in the Middle East and they said this was the best hummus they've had since they were over there. It was definitely the best I've ever had. Highly recommend:Eggplant NapoleanPickled EggplantHummusTabouleh (mostly parsley! yess),5.0
This is a wonderful restaurant. The appetizers are particularly delicious and good value. My feeling is that the best meals here are composed of many of them and perhaps only one entree. The cauliflower with tahini is particularly tasty as is the fried brussels sprouts.,4.0
"This place is fabulous. The owner is so proud of her food and you can tell she cooks because it makes people happy. Her passion is the secret recipe- not the Tanoreen spices everyone mentions. It comes from her. You can either eat in the restaurant or take out from the side store. One of my favorite dishes is the kale. I am not sure what is in their other than onions and spices, but I can seriously eat an entire dish of this. All the products used are fresh and the finest. I love the kibbeh and  yogurt. The spinach pies, dolmas. All so delicious. This is the best lebanese place in all of Brooklyn if you ask me. I love coming here when I visit.",5.0
"My friends told me I ""must"" dine here and that they have great Middle Eastern food.I walked in with very high expectations... I ordered the mixed grill platter. My food came out burnt and I was suddenly disappointed. The rice was good though...Another thing that kind of bothered me is that my plate had a lot of parsley all over it for decoration purposes.

"The company made the meal great. I was a little disappointed though, and I think my enjoyment of the meal was tainted because of a night out at ililil earlier in the week. The pita was flat and sad, a bad match for the hummus, which was very good. The brussels sprouts were OK, but they came out room temperature/cold - they would have been much better if they were hot! The schwarma sliders were cute and tasty and the chicken kabob was the best part of the meal; very savory. But for the love of God Tanoreen, please simmer down now with the parsley decor on the plate! Less is more. I got a cucumber drink that was way too sweet and syrupy and the glass was sticky. The pace of the meal was also kind of odd. The hummus and brussels sprouts came out almost immediately after ordering, and then we waited forever for the chicken to come out. Inside is very nice and the waiters are good. Tanoreen just wasn't what I had come to hope for.",3.0

Been here several times even before they moved to the new location (preferred the food when they were smaller).  I had the falafel the other night and it was crunchy and overdone.  Disappointed.

I could not get over the fact that every single part of that entree just tasted like a really dry, texturally-bland lemon. It was hot on the outside, cold on the inside. I can't get over the fact that I could have just baked a couple of potatoes, squeezed lemon juice over it, and throw a bucket of diced tomatoes on top, and have it taste exactly the same as the shepherd's pie they served to me.

"Ta-ta, greenOk, I have to knock this place off its high horse.  I ordered lamb chops for $24 thinking they would be amazing, and they were terrible.  I asked for rare, they came med-well to medium.  The had 1-2 oz. of meat on each bone, not including the fat that was left along the length of the bone.  They tasted good, but were gone in an instant.  No sign that they were from some local organic grass-fed farm, or Elysian Fields-grade.  The chops came with a small portion of rice with vermicelli noodles, a tini tomato/cucumber/onion chopped salad, some small roasted potatoes, and three generous handfuls of chopped parsley (no exaggeration) spread throughout the perimeter of the over-sized rectangular plate.  This is NOT worth $24, its worth about $5-6 at cost, which I feel can be 3x upped to $15-18 at MOST.  Also, my wife and I chose a modest app (Turkish salad, more of a red spicy spread, very tasty) and I the chops, and asked the server to choose a second app and entree for us.  He chose the first entree on the list, a $24 braised lamb with almonds, yogurt, pomegranate (I'm forgetting the name, it is absent from the online menu currently).  ""If you don't like it, you can send it back, no problem.""  Not a convincing way to talk up the dish, but Ok, a second lamb dish, its different, not grilled, and a break from the usually ordered things (this is our 4th time at Tanoreen).So he says ""I'll surprise you"" for the 2nd app, and when it comes, its filet mignon sliders.  Ok, a 3rd red meat dish?  Sure, beef is good, lets have at it.  The steak is overcooked and dry.  The buns are stale and/or are over toasted and completely dry.  The dish is paired with tahini has the sauce (read sesame seed butter) and is not exactly mouth watering, but very dry.  To boot, its a $12 app, twice the price of the amazing Turkish salad.  Am I going to argue and say ""take this back, we want something else?""

"Had an early dinner with friends at the infamous Tanoreen. Arrived at 6:30pm and was seated promptly. Nice decor and ambiance. The lighting was perfect-not overly bright or so dark that you can't read the menu. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.We started off with the hummus, eggplant napoleon and falafel. The hummus was fresh and smooth. It went perfectly with the basket of pita bread and pita chips. The eggplant napoleon was excellent! Lightly breaded, fried and stacked between layers of hummus. Falafel was good too but might be a bit dry for some people.My friend and I shared the Grilled Combo. It was spot on. The grilled chicken, lamb and beef were seasoned to perfection. The rice was soft and fluffy. Another friend had the chicken kebob with sauteed spinach and salad. She loved it! The one fail was the Kafta. My sister thought Kafta meant grilled lamb. But at Tanoreen they formed the lamb meat into a burger style and served it with white sauce, rice and salad. The way the Kafta was preped or seasoned made it very 'gamey'. A taste my sister cannot tolerate. She ended up sharing in on our combo platter.We eneded the meal on a sweet floral note. The Kanafe is a must have! Be advised that there is a 15 minute wait for this dessert as it is made to order. The crunchiness of this dessert was excellent with the Orange Blossom syrup and a hint of Rosewater. It's not a heavy rich, creamy dessert but absolutely delightful with a cup of coffee. Aside from the one bad dish (Kafta), we all had an enjoyable evening with good food and company. ;)",4.0
"I hate to say it, but I found this place to be a little overrated. I came here during an early evening with a friend. It was relatively busy for the time it was then. The decor is pretty nice and the staff is friendly. I was ready to enjoy my first meal at Tanoreen.Prior to this, I've heard many compliments about this restaurant, so in effect, it has caused much hype. I ordered what I believe to be a lamb stuffed grape leaves dish, and I'm sad to say that I was sorely disappointment. It was kind of bland and one note. We also ordered a chickpea based appetizer, but I wasn't too fond of that either. I really wanted to like this joint, but it didn't come off as anything too special to me. Maybe they we're having an off day. I shall give Tanoreen another try in the near future.",3.0
"Probably one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I am not sure if the chef decided to take a night off and handed the kitchen off to one of his busboys or if we were magically transported to a different restaurant than the one that everyone here has raved about.After spending a long time researching for a place that would be in a convenient location for my large family I finally settled on Tanoreen, being assured that the food would be spectacular as Zagat and Yelp so claim.My party of 16 was seated in the back of the restaurant right next to the heater. We quickly decided to switch the knob to the off position only to realize in a few minutes that for the rest of the night we would be either scorching hot or freezing cold. Once everyone arrived we waited about 15 minutes for the waiter to make his way over. When his honor finally arrived, we ordered a couple of bottles of wine , a few cocktails and our food. The restaurant was somewhat full and yet all night we only saw two waiters along with several busboys serve the whole place.It took them an hour to bring our drinks over. I would think that it would be in their own interest to get the table tipsy so that more alcohol and food would be ordered - this however was not the case. Not only was it a birthday party but there was nothing to drink for over an hour. I still had high hopes for the food to save the night and boy was I disappointed.Upon the waiter's recommendation we ordered three plates of mix appetizers (at $40 a pop) in addition to the eggplant napoleon and a few other choices. The problem with the mix plate is that it comes on one large plate, with no separation between the dishes. So once you take a few spoons of each dish, the whole plate becomes a disgusting and mushy mess. They might have been somewhat tasty, but after a few spoons no one had any desire to try such a messy plate. The eggplant napoleon which everyone here raved about came out as hard as a brick with no flavor to it whatsoever.The entrees were even worse. My lamb chops which I ordered medium rare came out with a burned outside and were not salted nor had any pepper on them. Just no flavor at all. I tried my neighbors plates which most people barely touched and they were just as bland and unsatisfying. I have never seen a restaurant so highly rated where 16 people barely touched their plates.The best part of the meal was the tea and the coffee as they actually tasted like tea and coffee. The dessert was disgusting and two of the dishes had a soapy aftertaste. By 11 pm all the chairs on the neighboring tables were picked up and we were getting nasty looks from the remaining waiter and busboys. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this disaster.",1.0
"I LOVE TANOREEN.After the first bite from the ""Maklobe"" i ran to the kitchen to check if my mom was back there cooking. Best middle eastern restaurant in NY, I am eating there again next week.",5.0
"Regardless the few things that I didn't really enjoy, there is no question that Tanoreen fairly deserves recognition from the Michelin Guide*, The New Yorker, Time Out NY and Yelp. Tanoreen is formerly known as a Middle Eastern cuisine restaurant located at Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and frequented by neighborhood patrons but also for food travelers as we were that are able to spent almost the same time in a train or a car to get there as the time that the dinner will last.I have to confess that I thought about a 3.5 star rating because I didn't like the Eggplant Napoleon, the Tabbouleh was too ""lemony"" to my taste, the meat that I tried, goat and lamb, as well as the special dish that night, tilapia, was a bit dry to me.. overcook? and I didn't liked the knafeh, one of their stellar dishes, because it was too sweet.  But thinking about it, I barely can enjoy battered and fried things as the flavor is usually hide because the cooking method, and the Eggplant Napoleon was no other than large eggplant slices battered, deep fried and stuffed with eggplant puree and presented as if it was lasagna. Even so its fried, I have to say the texture was crunchy, it wasn't greasy at all and the puree was full of flavor. In addition to this what I describe as too lemony for the Tabbouleh seems like is actually because the correct? use of sumac, an essential component in Middle Eastern cuisine commonly used as spicy in marinades and dressings as well as in the spice mix za'atar. And I figure .. is that the Tabbouleh that I tasted before happen not to be authentic at all? I really think so. The Sujok or Armenian aged sausages I loved it. The taste, surprising, strong, tangy and ... addicted to eat. It barely reminds me to cook Spanish chorizo but this one's taste is much more intense and the genuine meat flavor disappear behind the characteristic mix of spices used on it, already a sign of Tanoreen. To get me to love a cured meat in this way deserve alone an extra star. I also realized that the Hummus was one of the best in texture and flavor that I have try. Creamy, smooth as any, super tasty but without the overwhelming garlic flavor that many others have. The bread basket, Pita and Lavash is what was served, I loved it as well. Lavash was the new thing to me to try. A very thin and crusty flatbread that reminds to Roti Canai but with a totally different range of flavors where many seeds are embedded. Regarding the meat and the tilapia, dry or not, the overall flavor was delicious. The characteristic mix of spices are imprinted in each dish but I also loved how Tanoreen covers a large spectrum of flavors with a common background taste among all the dishes, but without being repetitive. The spiciness level is just right. I loved that aftertaste feeling that lightly burn your mouth, although this spices combination can be hard to assume for some palates. The knafeh was the dessert, a signature sweet in Palestinian cuisine. The one at Tanoreen was also recently highlighted as one of ""The best things I ever ate .. nutty"", a Food Channel show that I may watch way too often, but regardless, it was describe here because it's a pistachio festival crushed and sprinkled on top as a final lusciousness. This cake is made with shredded phyllo paste soaked in a thick honey syrup that contains rose water and plentifully spread  with cheese. The texture, a enjoyment, crunchy in two ways, the shredded paste and the pistachios but also the softness of the thick cheese layer. The syrup however was too sweet to me and hid some of the flavors that I'd have love to be more intense ... ironically the nuttiness, and the phyllo paste itself. All the dishes are beautifully presented although using the same sources in all of them that I found a bit boring ... chopped greens and natural tomato arranged in concentric circles all around the plate and alternated, when both were used, creating a bicolor image . The wine list is impressive. I have to confess that was secretly craving for a cocktail after reading about them and there when I saw what it was served in other's tables.. so beautiful glasses and appetizing.. but I'm very happy I didn't attend my internal desire this time as our wine was exceptional.  And I really have to say this. I also like how this is a business started by a woman chef, Palestinian-born, completely conducted by her and now her daughter as well, and how she is still behind and leave the kitchen to welcome her patrons. She did it with us too. Not only she is that lovely but also all the servers that we had the pleasure to be attended for. Efficient, answering all the questions and always with an eye in all the tables checking that everything is perfect. And it was $40 for an exceptional meal. Regardless the few things that I didn't enjoy, I would be really wrong if I don't gave her a least 4 stars. In fact, you should really consider this more than that. * 2010 NYC Top Eats under $40",4.0
"This was delicious. I'm not a motivated person, so I don't really Yelp about things unless I truly love them or truly hate them, and I must say that Tanoreen falls into the former category. Super tasty food, FAN-freaking-TASTIC service, and excellent ambiance! I have to say that I was left wishing that I had ordered my husband's dish, which was the lamb kabob. So good!!!!Can't wait to go back - probably gonna move next door so I can eat there everyday.",5.0
"I drove past this restaurant many times and really had no idea from looking at it outside, what type of cuisine was served. I thought it was a vegetarian place or something...mistook the outside sign to read ""Tangreen"". Okay, so now that I finally got that all straightened out in my head, I want to say that, overall, I am glad I finally tried this restaurant, but my experience was a mixed bag. My favorite part of the meal were the appetizers! Yum...the baba ganoush was just heavenly, especially when paired with the crisp, pita bread. I ordered a layered chicken dish and it was moderately tasty, but somewhat chalky dry in texture. The salad I ordered was very enjoyable, though...a savory and herbal mix of diced tomatoes, cucumbers, etc... The other dishes my fellow diners ate seemed to be a little better than mine, especially the shrimp dish. I also ordered dessert, a custard in rose water. At first, the taste was unusual to my unaccustomed palate, but after a few spoonfuls, I began to enjoy it. My companions, on the other hand, did not like it at all, comparing it to the taste of medicine or something like it. The wine also was very interesting, not at all like anything I have ever tasted before, and I have had wines from all over the world. It was an acquired taste. Even though the food was mixed for me, I still give Tanoreen 4 stars and I plan to return to try other dishes. The decor was rich, clean and not overly ornate, the service was excellent, and the owner was very welcoming. We were never rushed and were able to enjoy a most pleasant evening.",4.0

"Tanoreen ranks as one of my top dining experiences in New York. It's not because Middle Eastern is my favorite cuisine, but rather, because Tanoreen showcases the region's local flavors so well.I have had Tanoreen on my food wishlist for the longest time, and when a group of Yelp celebs invited me to a family-style dinner, I immediately voiced the suggestion to host the event there. They agreed! The best part of going with the Yelp group -- aside from being able to meet a lot of great personalities with vibrant opinions -- was sampling a large number of dishes on Tanoreen's menu. Everything was served family-style, and each dish had its own unique flavor. I can't stress this last point more. My biggest concern before coming to Tanoreen was that all of the dishes would have the same garlic, tahini and lemon flavoring as many fast-food Middle Eastern places do. Tanoreen is different. One dish was doused in sumac and lemon, another had fragrant spices of allspice and pine nuts, others were layered with garlic and olive oil. If you are not convinced that Palestinian food is a rich cuisine with a wide palette of flavors, then you haven't been to Tanoreen.We ordered (*denotes my favorites):Falafel - fried chickpea patties, which came with a nice amount of salt, garlic and spice, fried dark brown on the outside and bright green on the inside. The contrasting colors made Tanoreen's falafel extra special.*Sujok - Armenian dried sausage, with a killer sour slow-cooked taste, that offset the salty-cured flavor of the meat. This was among my favorite dishes.Hummus - chickpea puree with bright lemon and tahini. Extra creamy, not from yogurt, but from high quality tahini.*Tabbouleh - What seemed like your standard mix of chopped lettuce, tomatoes, and parsley had an extra bright kick from the mint and sumac in it. This rendition was extra special.*Musakhan - chicken baked with onions, sumac, allspice, saffron, and fried pine nuts served atop crisp bread was by far my favorite dish. Its spices had a sweet taste, while the pignoli and bread gave it a more nutty flavor. This was a daily special, so if you are aiming to try it, call ahead.Kibbie - ground lamb, wheat germ, and spices rolled into a ball and pan fried. The lamb and wheat germ gave this dish an extra earthy flavor. While I thought this would have been my favorite dish, the large family-style version of this dish came out as a dry-ish flat rectangle as opposed to a juicy circular patty. Tanoreen veterans complained that this version was less juicy than the normal serving, and I would agree. I still liked the taste.Eggplant Napoleon - fried slices of eggplant stuffed with creamy and smokey eggplant puree. It tasted as good as it sounds.Goat with yogurt sauce - came as a stew of slow cooked goat, served with rice and topped with an intensely sour yogurt sauce. It tasted like a rustic dish that one would share at the home of a desert herdsmen. Or maybe it's just me -- cooked-yogurt-anything reminds me of desert herdsmen.Tilapia - grilled and served with salad and (tahini?) dipping sauce. It was simple and not too fishy.Grilled combo - chicken kebob and shish kebob, had a nice grilled flavor to it. The meat, particularly the shish kebobs, could have been juicier; and the overall flavors were surprisingly simple. I guess this is the art of kebobs -- simple. grilled meats. *Knafeh - house specialty of sweet cheese, stuffed into stringy phyllo dough, topped with pistachios and rosewater syrup. This was pure indulgence -- even for someone like me who doesn't go for sweets.Did Tanoreen live up to all my expectations? Yes. The food is way better than Miriam's in Park Slope, which always took the gold crown for sit-down Israeli/Palestinian in my book. And while I admit that some of the dishes were new reinterpretations of traditional dishes, the classic flavors were well honored. To best experience Tanoreen, you must sample a wide array of dishes. If you are going to make the trek to Bay Ridge, better do it right.",5.0
Gotcha !We drove all the way from the 'Brooklyn Bridge' to this Bay Ridge area.Just to be 'Taken for a second ride' on the hidden clause of 'Market price' for a mostly bones Red Snapper .( small print all 4 of us failed to notice.)The waiter knew all about that fish except that the price is 220% HIGHER than the heavy menu listing of $17..... We ended up paying $38 for the Snapper.The restaurant is trying to catch two fat fish in one sitting......One : The read Snapper...Two : The naive customer who has no clue of 'the market' price.We felt 'Hoodwinked' and the bad taste it had left in our mouth will be remembered LONG after we will forget the name of this establishment !,1.0
"Had an early dinner with friends at the infamous Tanoreen. Arrived at 6:30pm and was seated promptly. Nice decor and ambiance. The lighting was perfect-not overly bright or so dark that you can't read the menu. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive.We started off with the hummus, eggplant napoleon and falafel. The hummus was fresh and smooth. It went perfectly with the basket of pita bread and pita chips. The eggplant napoleon was excellent! Lightly breaded, fried and stacked between layers of hummus. Falafel was good too but might be a bit dry for some people.My friend and I shared the Grilled Combo. It was spot on. The grilled chicken, lamb and beef were seasoned to perfection. The rice was soft and fluffy. Another friend had the chicken kebob with sauteed spinach and salad. She loved it! The one fail was the Kafta. My sister thought Kafta meant grilled lamb. But at Tanoreen they formed the lamb meat into a burger style and served it with white sauce, rice and salad. The way the Kafta was preped or seasoned made it very 'gamey'. A taste my sister cannot tolerate. She ended up sharing in on our combo platter.We eneded the meal on a sweet floral note. The Kanafe is a must have! Be advised that there is a 15 minute wait for this dessert as it is made to order. The crunchiness of this dessert was excellent with the Orange Blossom syrup and a hint of Rosewater. It's not a heavy rich, creamy dessert but absolutely delightful with a cup of coffee. Aside from the one bad dish (Kafta), we all had an enjoyable evening with good food and company. ;)",4.0
"I hate to say it, but I found this place to be a little overrated. I came here during an early evening with a friend. It was relatively busy for the time it was then. The decor is pretty nice and the staff is friendly. I was ready to enjoy my first meal at Tanoreen.Prior to this, I've heard many compliments about this restaurant, so in effect, it has caused much hype. I ordered what I believe to be a lamb stuffed grape leaves dish, and I'm sad to say that I was sorely disappointment. It was kind of bland and one note. We also ordered a chickpea based appetizer, but I wasn't too fond of that either. I really wanted to like this joint, but it didn't come off as anything too special to me. Maybe they we're having an off day. I shall give Tanoreen another try in the near future.",3.0
"Probably one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I am not sure if the chef decided to take a night off and handed the kitchen off to one of his busboys or if we were magically transported to a different restaurant than the one that everyone here has raved about.After spending a long time researching for a place that would be in a convenient location for my large family I finally settled on Tanoreen, being assured that the food would be spectacular as Zagat and Yelp so claim.My party of 16 was seated in the back of the restaurant right next to the heater. We quickly decided to switch the knob to the off position only to realize in a few minutes that for the rest of the night we would be either scorching hot or freezing cold. Once everyone arrived we waited about 15 minutes for the waiter to make his way over. When his honor finally arrived, we ordered a couple of bottles of wine , a few cocktails and our food. The restaurant was somewhat full and yet all night we only saw two waiters along with several busboys serve the whole place.It took them an hour to bring our drinks over. I would think that it would be in their own interest to get the table tipsy so that more alcohol and food would be ordered - this however was not the case. Not only was it a birthday party but there was nothing to drink for over an hour. I still had high hopes for the food to save the night and boy was I disappointed.Upon the waiter's recommendation we ordered three plates of mix appetizers (at $40 a pop) in addition to the eggplant napoleon and a few other choices. The problem with the mix plate is that it comes on one large plate, with no separation between the dishes. So once you take a few spoons of each dish, the whole plate becomes a disgusting and mushy mess. They might have been somewhat tasty, but after a few spoons no one had any desire to try such a messy plate. The eggplant napoleon which everyone here raved about came out as hard as a brick with no flavor to it whatsoever.The entrees were even worse. My lamb chops which I ordered medium rare came out with a burned outside and were not salted nor had any pepper on them. Just no flavor at all. I tried my neighbors plates which most people barely touched and they were just as bland and unsatisfying. I have never seen a restaurant so highly rated where 16 people barely touched their plates.The best part of the meal was the tea and the coffee as they actually tasted like tea and coffee. The dessert was disgusting and two of the dishes had a soapy aftertaste. By 11 pm all the chairs on the neighboring tables were picked up and we were getting nasty looks from the remaining waiter and busboys. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this disaster.",1.0

"Regardless the few things that I didn't really enjoy, there is no question that Tanoreen fairly deserves recognition from the Michelin Guide*, The New Yorker, Time Out NY and Yelp. Tanoreen is formerly known as a Middle Eastern cuisine restaurant located at Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and frequented by neighborhood patrons but also for food travelers as we were that are able to spent almost the same time in a train or a car to get there as the time that the dinner will last.I have to confess that I thought about a 3.5 star rating because I didn't like the Eggplant Napoleon, the Tabbouleh was too ""lemony"" to my taste, the meat that I tried, goat and lamb, as well as the special dish that night, tilapia, was a bit dry to me.. overcook? and I didn't liked the knafeh, one of their stellar dishes, because it was too sweet.  But thinking about it, I barely can enjoy battered and fried things as the flavor is usually hide because the cooking method, and the Eggplant Napoleon was no other than large eggplant slices battered, deep fried and stuffed with eggplant puree and presented as if it was lasagna. Even so its fried, I have to say the texture was crunchy, it wasn't greasy at all and the puree was full of flavor. In addition to this what I describe as too lemony for the Tabbouleh seems like is actually because the correct? use of sumac, an essential component in Middle Eastern cuisine commonly used as spicy in marinades and dressings as well as in the spice mix za'atar. And I figure .. is that the Tabbouleh that I tasted before happen not to be authentic at all? I really think so. The Sujok or Armenian aged sausages I loved it. The taste, surprising, strong, tangy and ... addicted to eat. It barely reminds me to cook Spanish chorizo but this one's taste is much more intense and the genuine meat flavor disappear behind the characteristic mix of spices used on it, already a sign of Tanoreen. To get me to love a cured meat in this way deserve alone an extra star. I also realized that the Hummus was one of the best in texture and flavor that I have try. Creamy, smooth as any, super tasty but without the overwhelming garlic flavor that many others have. The bread basket, Pita and Lavash is what was served, I loved it as well. Lavash was the new thing to me to try. A very thin and crusty flatbread that reminds to Roti Canai but with a totally different range of flavors where many seeds are embedded. Regarding the meat and the tilapia, dry or not, the overall flavor was delicious. The characteristic mix of spices are imprinted in each dish but I also loved how Tanoreen covers a large spectrum of flavors with a common background taste among all the dishes, but without being repetitive. The spiciness level is just right. I loved that aftertaste feeling that lightly burn your mouth, although this spices combination can be hard to assume for some palates.

Try the fish kibbe--also incredible. Chicken Feti was delicious, and the fatoush and halloumi were classic. Even the zatar on the bread was perfect--as were the pickled turnips.

"I've been planning to go to Tanoreen for a long time. Too long of a time.  I meant to back when I lived on 4th Avenue, and across the street from the R train, so the prospect of hopping on and traveling 60 blocks wasn't that big of a deal.  But I never did, and then I moved further away from Bay Ridge and the R train and another year went by.  Well all of that was resolved when yesterday I made the trek, and honestly it wasn't that bad - about a 30 min ride for me.  First impressions, even before we got to the restaurant, Bay Ridge is CUTE!Now, on to the food.  DELICIOUS.  Fortunately we were there as a group of four so we were able to order lots. We had:APPSHummus - delicious, creamy, yummy.Labenah - Yogurty, lemony, nom, nom.Eggplant Napoleon - a tower of fried eggplant with baba ghanouge in the middle with a chopped tomato/basil salad. Amazing. You MUST get this.Sambosek - a pastry shell filled with lamb.  Sort of like an empanada. Amazing. The pastry was delicious.Sujok - Armenian dried meat in a garlic red pepper sauce.  This was ok - I thought the sauce was too vinegary and overpowering... I didn't care for it, but the men liked it.ENTREESBaked Mediterranean Eggplant - kind of like a lasagna.  Very good, seasoned with nutmeg and cinnamon.  Kafta - ground lamb in a burger-like patty with potatoes on top and a tahini sauce.Grilled meat combo - perfectly cookedBaked Jerusalem Artichokes with ground lamb - this was a bit bland... it was our least favorite entrée.With the exception of the two dishes I didn't totally love, everything was AMAZING.  The rice that accompanies all the dishes is, in itself, fantastic.Oh, and the lemonade!  The lemonade!  It's made with rosewater and is so, so , so good. I am now on a search for rosewater so I can make it at home.  GET IT.Of course we couldn't leave without dessert, even though we didn't have any room left. Especially when we saw on the menu that the Knafef (shredded phyllo dough stuffed with cheese, baked and topped with rosewater syrup and pistachios) was on the show ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"".  Well duh, we're getting it. We also got the Harissa cake - a coconut cake soaked in syrup and topped with pistachios.  Truth be told, both desserts were INCREDIBLY sweet.  Kind of too sweet.  We actually liked the Harissa better than the Knafeh, and we all left most of the Knafeh on our plates unfinished.  It was good, it was just too sweet to eat more than a bite of.Diners take note, though, both of these desserts were really sizable and I can't imagine ANYONE eating a full serving themselves. We couldn't even finish a quarter of the Knafeh each.I definitely enjoyed our meal, and there's much on the menu I still want, so we will be back.",4.0
"One of the best middle eastern restaurants in NY!  The lamb fetti is outstanding, so is the chicken fetti.  Also the musakhan is a palestinian specialty that is absolutely delicious.  The knafeh dessert is to die for.  And for that personal touch, the owner always comes out of the kitchen to greet diners.",5.0

"Ordered the following:- Baba Ghanouge - Good but a bit on the bland side.- Cauliflower Salad - The best cauliflower I've ever had. I think it's deep fried, chilled, then doused with tahini sauce and pomegranate syrup.- Meat Grape Leaves - We didn't even finish this. It tasted a bit too meaty for me. Again, on the bland side.- Kibbie - Deep fried stuffed ground lamb meat. Bland.- Falafel - Good but wouldn't be able to differentiate it from any other middle eastern restaurant's. I'm a big fan of big flavors. I have a problem with french food and other subtly flavored foods. I know that there is a complexity and nuance to subtly flavored foods but there's just too much caveman in me to appreciate all that. I found every one of these dishes to be too bland for my taste buds. I wanted to put ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, A1, or anything on everything to taste something. After the meal, I was full but not satisfied. It wasn't the amount of food, but something just didn't click. Maybe instead of trying a wide variety of things, I will get an entree next time. As for the wait, we went on a Saturday night and waited 20 minutes for a table. Service was good and the food came out very quickly.

"Go here.  I never tell anyone to go to Bay Ridge because parking is a nightmare and so is the local R train, but the food here is so good, you forget that part.  The owner comes out and chats with you, asks you how you enjoyed the food.  They try (and sometimes succeed) to make unique cocktails and I've never been disappointed with an entree.   The deserts?  I'm not a fan of perfumey rosewater type confections, so I save desert for another venue, but you'll eat like a tick and have left overs for two days...the portions are THAT huge so take it home, piggy...no need to gorge yourself.",4.0
"Came to Tanoreen twice in one weekend--Friday dinner and Sunday Brunch.Tanoreen tastes just like home. After trying many Mediterranean/Turkish restaurants all over the place, Tanoreen is top dog, by FAR. The best thing we tried was the eggplant salad--one of the most amazing things I've ever put in my  mouth. The meat grape leaves were fantastic and super authentic. Try the fish kibbe--also incredible. Chicken Feti was delicious, and the fatoush and halloumi were classic. Even the zatar on the bread was perfect--as were the pickled turnips. Can't wait to come back. We will visit every time we come to Brooklyn. Bravo!",5.0
"Honestly, although I really wanted to like this place, it's just not anything special.",3.0
"I've been planning to go to Tanoreen for a long time. Too long of a time.  I meant to back when I lived on 4th Avenue, and across the street from the R train, so the prospect of hopping on and traveling 60 blocks wasn't that big of a deal.  But I never did, and then I moved further away from Bay Ridge and the R train and another year went by.  Well all of that was resolved when yesterday I made the trek, and honestly it wasn't that bad - about a 30 min ride for me.  First impressions, even before we got to the restaurant, Bay Ridge is CUTE!Now, on to the food.  DELICIOUS.  Fortunately we were there as a group of four so we were able to order lots. We had:APPSHummus - delicious, creamy, yummy.Labenah - Yogurty, lemony, nom, nom.Eggplant Napoleon - a tower of fried eggplant with baba ghanouge in the middle with a chopped tomato/basil salad. Amazing. You MUST get this.Sambosek - a pastry shell filled with lamb.  Sort of like an empanada. Amazing. The pastry was delicious.Sujok - Armenian dried meat in a garlic red pepper sauce.  This was ok - I thought the sauce was too vinegary and overpowering... I didn't care for it, but the men liked it.ENTREESBaked Mediterranean Eggplant - kind of like a lasagna.  Very good, seasoned with nutmeg and cinnamon.  Kafta - ground lamb in a burger-like patty with potatoes on top and a tahini sauce.Grilled meat combo - perfectly cookedBaked Jerusalem Artichokes with ground lamb - this was a bit bland... it was our least favorite entrée.With the exception of the two dishes I didn't totally love, everything was AMAZING.  The rice that accompanies all the dishes is, in itself, fantastic.Oh, and the lemonade!  The lemonade!  It's made with rosewater and is so, so , so good. I am now on a search for rosewater so I can make it at home.  GET IT.Of course we couldn't leave without dessert, even though we didn't have any room left. Especially when we saw on the menu that the Knafef (shredded phyllo dough stuffed with cheese, baked and topped with rosewater syrup and pistachios) was on the show ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"".  Well duh, we're getting it. We also got the Harissa cake - a coconut cake soaked in syrup and topped with pistachios.  Truth be told, both desserts were INCREDIBLY sweet.  Kind of too sweet.  We actually liked the Harissa better than the Knafeh, and we all left most of the Knafeh on our plates unfinished.  It was good, it was just too sweet to eat more than a bite of.Diners take note, though, both of these desserts were really sizable and I can't imagine ANYONE eating a full serving themselves. We couldn't even finish a quarter of the Knafeh each.I definitely enjoyed our meal, and there's much on the menu I still want, so we will be back.",4.0
"One of the best middle eastern restaurants in NY!  The lamb fetti is outstanding, so is the chicken fetti.  Also the musakhan is a palestinian specialty that is absolutely delicious.  The knafeh dessert is to die for.  And for that personal touch, the owner always comes out of the kitchen to greet diners.",5.0
"Okay so this is as good as it gets for the price and quality of food. Just like everyone says the food is fantastic. My boyfriend and I came here with another couple since we've heard so much about it. Our waiter could not be more helpful, he recommended some of the most popular dishes and they were amazing.If its your first time here i'd recommend sticking to the appetizers - they are all amazing and will fill you up. We had the eggplant napolean, the musakah (sp?), and a mixed plater of hummus, Turkish salad, feta, and brussel sprouts. We practically licked our plates! I'll definitely go back. Thank you Tanoreen. Please open a place in Prospect Heights!",4.0
"Ordered the following:- Baba Ghanouge - Good but a bit on the bland side.- Cauliflower Salad - The best cauliflower I've ever had. I think it's deep fried, chilled, then doused with tahini sauce and pomegranate syrup.- Meat Grape Leaves - We didn't even finish this. It tasted a bit too meaty for me. Again, on the bland side.- Kibbie - Deep fried stuffed ground lamb meat. Bland.- Falafel - Good but wouldn't be able to differentiate it from any other middle eastern restaurant's. I'm a big fan of big flavors. I have a problem with french food and other subtly flavored foods. I know that there is a complexity and nuance to subtly flavored foods but there's just too much caveman in me to appreciate all that. I found every one of these dishes to be too bland for my taste buds. I wanted to put ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, A1, or anything on everything to taste something. After the meal, I was full but not satisfied. It wasn't the amount of food, but something just didn't click. Maybe instead of trying a wide variety of things, I will get an entree next time. As for the wait, we went on a Saturday night and waited 20 minutes for a table. Service was good and the food came out very quickly. I would recommend this place to people who think ketchup is spicy.",3.0

"Dude, this place is far off the beaten path. I live near SUNY Downstate and it was far - for me, let alone people in other boroughs. However, every bite was worth the trek.

The food presentation, again, was fabulous and the food runners know how to make a show of presenting. Desert: I ordered the kanafe. Uh, it was not my cup of tea - the cheese inside was savory with stringy texture. I was assuming it would be marscapone or ricotta: a sweet, loose  and airy creamed cheese. But, I won't dock a star because I think it's probably perfect for what it is. And, I actually can't wait to go back and try something else on the very exciting dessert menu.

"Back in the day this was one of our regular spots in the neighborhood. Back then it was small location, owner Rawia was in the kitchen, BYOB, and the food was always excellent.Haven't been to Tanoreen since it moved to larger place and obtained a liquor license - we just happen to be in nearby yesterday and was craving it.The place is much bigger now with the typical Mediterranean decor - orange paint, ceramic tiles, tin sconce lamps, etc. The place packed full of 20 year olds (I guess they saw it on TV) - make sure you make reservations. The staff is now dressed up in all black instead of the casual t-shirt and jeans prior. They have a full bar now, but the wine list is CRAP - I miss the BYOB days. Also the owner is no longer in the kitchen - her daughter runs the show nowadays. However Rawia still touches the tables- albeit dressed up and hair done instead of coming out in her kitchen outfit.We ordered all our old favorites to share: Mousaka (sp), Raw Kibbie, and Baked Eggplant. The dishes arrived one after the other:The Mousaka (sp), which is a shredded chicken flatbread, was smaller than before, the meat was dry, and was no longer served on a bed of parsley (I guess customers no longer like parsley?). Disappointing.The Raw Kibbie, if you never had, is like a Middle Eastern Steak Tartare. When I ordered it, I requested when they mixed it make it extra spicy. The waitress said they don't serve it mixed and the extra hot sauce (a harissa I think) is on the side - WTF that's not how it was made back in the day. The dish arrived and now I know why: the meat was made preformed earlier on a dish. The onions were sprinkled on top, dab of hot sauce on the corner, with the extra hot sauce on the side. Also the portion was smaller that used to be. After mixing everything including all the extra hot sauce, it tasted good - like a spicy tartare. Good - but being pre-made and having to mix it a downside.  Btw make sure to get the extra hot sauce.The baked eggplant was simply underwhelming. It was flavorless and a smaller portion than before. The rice was cooked well, but lacked butter and salt - plus smaller portion...I'm sensing a pattern here. Disappointing.Wife wanted mint tea and dessert so we ordered a small Knafeh (I was never a fan and my wife didn't remember if she liked it). The Knafeh was ok, but nothing special - tastes baked ricotta cheese topped with honey. But that is how it is supposed to taste like. Portion is still the same. Average.Was it an off night?With smaller portions, crappy wine, and new chef, I have to say I am very disappointed in Tanoreen. I guess if you never ate here before it moved, it would still be ok...but I remember the great place was it used to be when Rawia ran the kitchen, before the liquor license and Food Network. Now it is another guidebook, foodie-wannabe tourist trap living off former glory.Is it fair to say it has become the Jackson Diner (which used to be great 15 years ago till it got famous, moved to a bigger place, chef left before move, and now is super-crap) of Lebanese food?",2.0
"My bff and I decided to try this place after walking by it for years. We decided one night to give it a shot. The service was very good. Waiters checked on us and answered all our questions since it was our first visit. The hostess or maybe it was the owner came by to check on us as well during our meal to be sure everything was ok so that was nice.Now the food, we both enjoyed our meals but we were pretty surprised there was so much green garnish around all the dishes, including the appetizers. We weren't sure if we were suppose to mix it with the food too. We did but it didn't enhance the dishes.My gf had the Mediterranean Eggplant and I had the Okra. She liked her dish. I liked the lamb more than the okra but it was still good. too much for one sitting though cause it is rich.We had the hummus and the lentil soup for appetizers which was tasty so that's probably why we were unable to eat all our dinner.THEN we had to try the Knafeh since it was noted on the menu it was on the Food Network. It was way too sweet for me. I loved the crunchies that surrounded it though. I ate all that.  We even ordered the smaller plate. It's pretty rich because of the sweet cheese. still tasty but 1-2 bites was enough for me.Overall it was a nice dining experience and the food was tasty. I would go back.",3.0

"I have this theory that appetizers are always better than the entrees. If i were just rating the appetizers, then this would be 5 stars. Further proof that you should always just order 5 appetizers for dinner. Unfortunately, the entree was bad. Appetizers: absolutely delicious: we ordered the eggplant napoleon (very nice, a little heavy on the frying, but good), a dip made with pomagranate molasses, red pepper, almonds that was addictive, and the fried hamaouli cheese. Very satisfying and tasty dishes. They also provide you with a wonderful bread basket with a variety of different types of bread. Some pita, some crispy thin bread, a crispy thin one covered in that amazing spice zataar. Entrees: we had a dish of ground lamb, spices, wrapped in dough. There was a dough layer on top and a dough layer on bottom and it was sliced into square sections. Problem 1: the dough had a very unpleasant aftertaste and a really unfortunate texture: it was neither crisp, nor chewy, just sort of limp. Problem 2: the lamb was heavily oversalted and had no real lamb flavor to it. Problem 3: the two things didn't remotely complement one another. I honestly didn't want to eat more than 4 bites of it, it was that bad. In sum, I would highly recommend this place to come for some wine and some appetizers, but don't worry about getting entrees, you'll be full because the portion sizes are large.",3.0
"Okay, this is by far the best Middle Eastern restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life.  I almost wanted to weep that I had to return to my home in Manhattan because I know how far I am from my dear love Tanoreen.  I've tried so many Middle Eastern restaurants in my life (In the US only), and it's one of my favorite cuisines in the world, and this one is a cut above the rest.  Someone told me on yelp that the chef/owner is Palestinian if you want to know from what region in the Middle East.  Not only is everything moderately priced, but everything is also PLENTIFUL and tastes outstanding.I kinda had a hunch that this place would be great, but the moment I tried one of the appetizer specials, the hunch became reality.  I selected the mhammara appetizer which is not on the menu but was on the daily specials.  It looked like a heterogenous concoction of love.  I'm not exactly sure of all the constituents of this God-like substance, but I do know at least that it had red bell peppers, lemon, tanoreen spices, walnuts, and corn.  I was having the time of my life spreading this thing all over soft and crunchy pitas that they brought us.  For the entree, I had what I consider a quintessential barometer of the quality of a Middle Eastern establishment: the kafta platter.  When it came, I was nonplussed to tell you the truth because they were very generous on portion size.  The plate looked like a masterpiece.  The middle had the ground lamb, the rice, and the veggies, and the plate was surrounded on the perimeter by tabouleh.  The whole combination of side dishes and main entree hit the spot in a way no Manhattan restaurant has done to me yet.  I'm sick of walking around Manhattan and seeing such pretentious, elegant, and flamboyant foods.  When I came here, I felt like I wasn't being cheated at all--that I was just getting quality food that's all synchronized into a beautiful symphony, and at honest prices.  Also, the service is above reproach.  It was perfect, actually.  I called ahead to make reservations and when I arrived, they greeted me by name and continued to greet me by name until I left.  I really have no complaints.  It's my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant of all time and I can't wait to make visitors from out of town jealous :)  Now, I'm sharing my experience with all of you!",5.0

"I almost missed out on the Tanoreen experience. I was very close to walking out before we even sat down. And the reason was the host. Here's my story.I made a reservation (for 12) two days prior for a Saturday @ 6:30 pm. They said, sure we've got room for you and I say, Great, see you soon. The host calls me on Saturday morning and says, ""We are booked solid, make sure you arrive on time and don't be late..."" I was weird out by it because that never really happened to me before and certainly not with the tone of voice he used. I told him I'll do my best. Half of us arrived at 6:38 with the rest of the party running late due to lack of parking in Bay Ridge (a huge problem in that neighborhood and desperation has driven many restaurants to allow double-parking as valet parking. You guessed it, a complete traffic nightmare on 3rd Avenue) He starts reprimanding me at the door, ""Where's the rest of the party? Didn't I tell you not to be late? I look at him in disbelief. No hello. No welcome. I continue staring back at him. He stared back and says, ""I'll give you two hours to finish dinner, you have until 8:45"" The rest of the party arrives shortly at 6:50 with screaming babies in tow. The main reason for the tardiness. So thumbs down for family-friendly service. Double thumbs down for attitude problem of host. To be fair, we were late, yes but most restaurants give a 15-minute window for arrival. However, I really don't think our lateness warranted that kind of response. I'll let you all decide on the degree of inappropriateness, rudeness, and unprofessionalism.To make up for the unpleasant host experience, the rest of the restaurant was civil and very accommodating, especially our server and waiter. The owner of the restaurant, she was ever most warm and friendly to us! The food was fresh, tasty and just as good as everyone recommends. However, even the great food will not be enough to bring me back to Tanoreen. There are a lot of great Mediterranean places in NYC especially in Queens.",3.0
"I absolutely loved this place. I found out about it through a Yelp search because me and my boyfriend wanted to try a new place to eat - afterwards we both agreed this was definitely and good choice! We came here two days ago, on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't packed at all which made for a nice, quiet lunch. The waiters were nice and attentive and the food was delicious! For appetizers, we shared the kibbie, which is  deep-fried shells stuffed with lamb and pine nuts on the side they gave us pesto to dip it in. I personally had it plain and it was just as yummy without the extra topping, the lamb was so tender and not too hot, but nice and warm and yummy and just perfect! For lunch, I had the shrimp dish and my boyfriend had the Chicken Fetti. I had a bit of my boyfriend's as he couldn't finish it (he filled up too much on the pitas and appetizer and the serving they gave him was a bit big!). Both meals were yummy and, as the lamb, the chicken and shrimp were so tender and chewy. I loved the rice dish that came with both too! And, lastly, as if I didn't already sound like a fatty we finished off with dessert, the sahleb which is basically a custard served with rosewater syrup on top. I personally liked it, it was very creamy and the rosewater gave it quite a unique taste.Also, during the middle of our meal, the owner herself walked by our table and asked how everything was, which I thought was very sweet! We will definitely be returning here again, next time I hope to try the much raved about knafeh! Can't wait (=",5.0

Also the portion was smaller that used to be. After mixing everything including all the extra hot sauce, it tasted good - like a spicy tartare. Good - but being pre-made and having to mix it a downside.  Btw make sure to get the extra hot sauce.The baked eggplant was simply underwhelming. It was flavorless and a smaller portion than before. The rice was cooked well, but lacked butter and salt - plus smaller portion...I'm sensing a pattern here. Disappointing.Wife wanted mint tea and dessert so we ordered a small Knafeh (I was never a fan and my wife didn't remember if she liked it). The Knafeh was ok, but nothing special - tastes baked ricotta cheese topped with honey. But that is how it is supposed to taste like. Portion is still the same. Average.Was it an off night?With smaller portions, crappy wine, and new chef, I have to say I am very disappointed in Tanoreen. I guess if you never ate here before it moved, it would still be ok...but I remember the great place was it used to be when Rawia ran the kitchen, before the liquor license and Food Network. Now it is another guidebook, foodie-wannabe tourist trap living off former glory.Is it fair to say it has become the Jackson Diner (which used to be great 15 years ago till it got famous, moved to a bigger place, chef left before move, and now is super-crap) of Lebanese food?",2.0
"My bff and I decided to try this place after walking by it for years. We decided one night to give it a shot. The service was very good. Waiters checked on us and answered all our questions since it was our first visit. The hostess or maybe it was the owner came by to check on us as well during our meal to be sure everything was ok so that was nice.Now the food, we both enjoyed our meals but we were pretty surprised there was so much green garnish around all the dishes, including the appetizers. We weren't sure if we were suppose to mix it with the food too. We did but it didn't enhance the dishes.My gf had the Mediterranean Eggplant and I had the Okra. She liked her dish. I liked the lamb more than the okra but it was still good. too much for one sitting though cause it is rich.We had the hummus and the lentil soup for appetizers which was tasty so that's probably why we were unable to eat all our dinner.THEN we had to try the Knafeh since it was noted on the menu it was on the Food Network. It was way too sweet for me. I loved the crunchies that surrounded it though. I ate all that.  We even ordered the smaller plate. It's pretty rich because of the sweet cheese. still tasty but 1-2 bites was enough for me.Overall it was a nice dining experience and the food was tasty. I would go back.",3.0
"Great food and good service.  They have a huge menu selection and it's very vegetarian friendly.  My husband and I like ordering the Hummus and then a few appetizers to split.It can get a bit loud, but only because it's so popular.",5.0
"I have this theory that appetizers are always better than the entrees. If i were just rating the appetizers, then this would be 5 stars. Further proof that you should always just order 5 appetizers for dinner. Unfortunately, the entree was bad. Appetizers: absolutely delicious: we ordered the eggplant napoleon (very nice, a little heavy on the frying, but good), a dip made with pomagranate molasses, red pepper, almonds that was addictive, and the fried hamaouli cheese. Very satisfying and tasty dishes. They also provide you with a wonderful bread basket with a variety of different types of bread. Some pita, some crispy thin bread, a crispy thin one covered in that amazing spice zataar. Entrees: we had a dish of ground lamb, spices, wrapped in dough. There was a dough layer on top and a dough layer on bottom and it was sliced into square sections. Problem 1: the dough had a very unpleasant aftertaste and a really unfortunate texture: it was neither crisp, nor chewy, just sort of limp. Problem 2: the lamb was heavily oversalted and had no real lamb flavor to it. Problem 3: the two things didn't remotely complement one another. I honestly didn't want to eat more than 4 bites of it, it was that bad. In sum, I would highly recommend this place to come for some wine and some appetizers, but don't worry about getting entrees, you'll be full because the portion sizes are large.",3.0
"Okay, this is by far the best Middle Eastern restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life.  I almost wanted to weep that I had to return to my home in Manhattan because I know how far I am from my dear love Tanoreen.  I've tried so many Middle Eastern restaurants in my life (In the US only), and it's one of my favorite cuisines in the world, and this one is a cut above the rest.  Someone told me on yelp that the chef/owner is Palestinian if you want to know from what region in the Middle East.  Not only is everything moderately priced, but everything is also PLENTIFUL and tastes outstanding.I kinda had a hunch that this place would be great, but the moment I tried one of the appetizer specials, the hunch became reality.  I selected the mhammara appetizer which is not on the menu but was on the daily specials.  It looked like a heterogenous concoction of love.  I'm not exactly sure of all the constituents of this God-like substance, but I do know at least that it had red bell peppers, lemon, tanoreen spices, walnuts, and corn.  I was having the time of my life spreading this thing all over soft and crunchy pitas that they brought us.  For the entree, I had what I consider a quintessential barometer of the quality of a Middle Eastern establishment: the kafta platter.  When it came, I was nonplussed to tell you the truth because they were very generous on portion size.  The plate looked like a masterpiece.  The middle had the ground lamb, the rice, and the veggies, and the plate was surrounded on the perimeter by tabouleh.  The whole combination of side dishes and main entree hit the spot in a way no Manhattan restaurant has done to me yet.  I'm sick of walking around Manhattan and seeing such pretentious, elegant, and flamboyant foods.  When I came here, I felt like I wasn't being cheated at all--that I was just getting quality food that's all synchronized into a beautiful symphony, and at honest prices.  Also, the service is above reproach.  It was perfect, actually.  I called ahead to make reservations and when I arrived, they greeted me by name and continued to greet me by name until I left.  I really have no complaints.  It's my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant of all time and I can't wait to make visitors from out of town jealous :)  Now, I'm sharing my experience with all of you!",5.0

"I almost missed out on the Tanoreen experience. I was very close to walking out before we even sat down. And the reason was the host. Here's my story.I made a reservation (for 12) two days prior for a Saturday @ 6:30 pm. They said, sure we've got room for you and I say, Great, see you soon. The host calls me on Saturday morning and says, ""We are booked solid, make sure you arrive on time and don't be late..."" I was weird out by it because that never really happened to me before and certainly not with the tone of voice he used. I told him I'll do my best. Half of us arrived at 6:38 with the rest of the party running late due to lack of parking in Bay Ridge (a huge problem in that neighborhood and desperation has driven many restaurants to allow double-parking as valet parking. You guessed it, a complete traffic nightmare on 3rd Avenue) He starts reprimanding me at the door, ""Where's the rest of the party? Didn't I tell you not to be late? I look at him in disbelief. No hello. No welcome. I continue staring back at him. He stared back and says, ""I'll give you two hours to finish dinner, you have until 8:45"" The rest of the party arrives shortly at 6:50 with screaming babies in tow. The main reason for the tardiness. So thumbs down for family-friendly service. Double thumbs down for attitude problem of host. To be fair, we were late, yes but most restaurants give a 15-minute window for arrival. However, I really don't think our lateness warranted that kind of response. I'll let you all decide on the degree of inappropriateness, rudeness, and unprofessionalism.To make up for the unpleasant host experience, the rest of the restaurant was civil and very accommodating, especially our server and waiter. The owner of the restaurant, she was ever most warm and friendly to us! The food was fresh, tasty and just as good as everyone recommends. However, even the great food will not be enough to bring me back to Tanoreen. There are a lot of great Mediterranean places in NYC especially in Queens.",3.0
"I absolutely loved this place. I found out about it through a Yelp search because me and my boyfriend wanted to try a new place to eat - afterwards we both agreed this was definitely and good choice! We came here two days ago, on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't packed at all which made for a nice, quiet lunch. The waiters were nice and attentive and the food was delicious! For appetizers, we shared the kibbie, which is  deep-fried shells stuffed with lamb and pine nuts on the side they gave us pesto to dip it in. I personally had it plain and it was just as yummy without the extra topping, the lamb was so tender and not too hot, but nice and warm and yummy and just perfect! For lunch, I had the shrimp dish and my boyfriend had the Chicken Fetti. I had a bit of my boyfriend's as he couldn't finish it (he filled up too much on the pitas and appetizer and the serving they gave him was a bit big!). Both meals were yummy and, as the lamb, the chicken and shrimp were so tender and chewy. I loved the rice dish that came with both too! And, lastly, as if I didn't already sound like a fatty we finished off with dessert, the sahleb which is basically a custard served with rosewater syrup on top. I personally liked it, it was very creamy and the rosewater gave it quite a unique taste.Also, during the middle of our meal, the owner herself walked by our table and asked how everything was, which I thought was very sweet! We will definitely be returning here again, next time I hope to try the much raved about knafeh! Can't wait (=",5.0

Lots of flavor.The 'kibbie' reminded me of a dish I had in Sao Paolo, Brazil, that at the time was credited as 'African', but surely this was a nuanced version...savory ground lamb with a seasoning I had never tried before. It was called 'Tanoreen spice' on the menu. Secretive!I also shared the grilled combo and the kabobs were perfectly cooked, not dry at all.

To accompany our mint tea (with actual mint leaves) we ordered feta and tomato salad, hummus with chopped lamb, friend haloumi, roasted cauliflower, chicken kabob, an eggplant tour, and a chicken special with yogurt.

A friend decided to meet up for dinner at this quaint spot.  He had tried Tanoreen at the previous location and wanted to see how the move turned out.  As we walked in, we were promptly seated, even without a reservation (though one is an absolute must on weekends as the restaurant is small but popular and thus fills up quickly).  The restaurant is rustic with a modern look, without any gaudy decorations.  By far the best seats in the house (all the seating areas are great) were by the glass enclosure.  Even though the view was of the side street looking at cars and houses, one doesn't really realize that and is just simply engulfed by the expansive feeling of the place.  The wait staff properly introduced himself and was very personable.  He was quick in getting our drink order and just as fast in bringing them to us.  He even recommended a few dishes to us, which were his favorites.  He was absolutely right!  Everything we ordered was golden and tasted fresh and full of flavor.  The kafka, kibbe, grape leaves, baba ghanouge, tabbouleh, kabobs, and lamb shank were delicious.  They also have daily specials so there is always variety.  Since the first time, I have gone back again and again, always trying something different.  This restaurant has brought my neighborhood in my eyes as culinary adventure.  Thank you Tanoreen.  See you again very soon.",5.0
"I enjoyed it, but was surprised to see how high it was rated in Zagat and how others gushed on and on. Don't get me wrong, it was a very nice place in a nice setting and solid food, but I would expect a little more for the prices.The servings were enormous, though, so I had plenty of chicken pita left over for the next day's lunch. Maybe if I was a fan of lamb this place would have hit a home run, but alas, I'm not.",3.0

"Great service! We phoned from the road to make reservations (recommended) for Sun evening. Manager was very attentive, seating us by the bar while we waited for our table. At the bar we've discovered excellent cocktails -- try Pistachio Martini, Cucumber Gin Gimlet, Pomareen, while velvety Arabica is best saved for post-meal consumption.At some point one of the waiters spilled some water on our table and four of his colleagues rushed from every side to help clean up, prompting friendly jokes and smiles from everyone. Great food! Appetizers come in small highly sharable portions, so don't be afraid to order ""that one extra."" Try brussels sprouts from the ""specials"" menu -- incredible! Sujok (spicy chunks of Armenian sausage) reminded me of Buffalo wings minus bones. I love eggplant and there are plenty to choose from (get makdous, stuffed baby eggplant) since it's featured in every category on the menu. Entries come with mountains of mouthwatering rice pilaf and some greens (pickled red cabbage, salad) and are easily shared.  Grilled Combo is a bit on a small side, so if you like meat, don't rely solely on it. I am thinking of bringing my parents here, and that's probably the highest compliment I can give to a restaurant.",5.0
"Food is delicious...the variety and exotic tastes really got me excited to go here. The portions were generous. It was just so interesting to taste the spices that are used in the cuisine. Though it isn't my favorite of Middle Eastern cuisines, it was still very good. I loved the decorations- artifacts from the Middle East.I would go back and order more appetizers just to taste all the variety. If you're looking for something different to try, this is a great option.",4.0

May as well give it a try - everyone says you MUST try Tanoreen. Okee dokee. I didn't think it was anything spectacular and it was quite expensive. Wine was really good though. I did enjoy everything we had. I had the zucchini stuffed with lamb with was a hefty portion and really filling. The service was fine. Will probably go back but will be a while because of the $$ I've had better at lower prices.,3.0
"I've followed the reviews for this place for a couple years, and I finally made my first visit on Tuesday.  For me, Tanoreen lived up to the hype; the service, setting, and food were impeccable.  My mom and I spent a couple hours there, relaxing and eating.  The presentation, seasoning, temperature, and quality of the food was spot on.  The new location was comfortable, tastefully decorated, and most of all, clean!  Every aspect of this restaurant was professional in my eyes, really well done.If there are people who think this place deserves one star, I would love to visit what they believe is a five star restaurant, because Tanoreen met or exceeded all of my expectations.",5.0
"Tonight Tanoreen was the destination of my friends' ""drive to dinner"" in the new car - I, the ever faithful companion without a car, was happy to join. And what a destination...this food was fantastic. Strangely, we had all been to Egypt and spent time in other middle east locations - thus, comparing dinner to previous experiences in far away lands. To accompany our mint tea (with actual mint leaves) we ordered feta and tomato salad, hummus with chopped lamb, friend haloumi, roasted cauliflower, chicken kabob, an eggplant tour, and a chicken special with yogurt. Oh my. Far away lands you have competition....My one comment would be that hard floors, tables, walls, and ceilings equal noisy.",5.0
"As good as it gets for quality middle eastern cuisine. I happen to live around the corner and its my ""go to"" for last minute dinner plans. Everything is fresh and homemade.

"Incredible place - we ate there 11/14 and it was the best meal I've had in ages.  Full disclosure - we live a couple of blocks away so kind of take it for granted.  But now I know we're really lucky to have it nearby.  You really can't go wrong.  I also love that the owner stops at our table (and every table I bet) each time we're there to ask how the food is.  (Prior review 2011 or so) I'm hovering between 4 and 5 stars here, it's just an amazing place with amazing food and the owners are just so nice and good at what they do.  Just came from dinner there and wow; brunch is similar and the new location at 76th and 3rd has such a great dining room.  The zatter bread is phenomenal, the meats are great, the veggies are good (it's vegetarian friendly and thus kosher friendly), the breads are great, the spreads - you get the idea.  You can't go wrong here.  I've lived a block from the place for a few years and feel so lucky that it's a 5 minute walk away, since people come from miles around to eat here.  Enjoy!",5.0
"I'm sorry to feel the need to give Tanoreen such a low rating. This place used to be one of my favorites. Fantastic food, and really nice service from the owner, who walked from table to table checking on her guests. But my visit last night makes me not want to go back to this place. My friend had wanted to drive our to Bayridge to go to Tanoreen for an early dinner (with her 1 year old daughter), and she had called a few days before to ask if we needed a reservation for a 6pm dinner. She was told no - not necessary. So we show up (admittedly at 6:15) to a restaurant that was probably 1/3 full and ask the host for a table for 4. He says without a reservation we'll need to wait 45 minutes. I explain about the call we had made, and he says (very rudely) ""that is impossible; no one would have ever said that; you are not telling the truth."" My friend comes in from the car, confirms the story I've shared with him and he says the same thing and is also very rude to her - ""you have to wait!"" Keep in mind, there are at least 15 empty tables, and we have a one year old with us, and would have been out of there within an hour. I'm not sure how a 45 minute wait would have been necessary, but maybe there were a bunch of 6:30 reservations?But the real point is that the host - a man who has seated me and my friends plenty of times in the past - was so incredibly nasty to both of us. I understand if he really needed to make us wait, but why not show a little more empathy? Maybe say he's sorry that we got misinformation? Or knowing that we have a baby, maybe suggest that he pack up some takeout for us? I don't think that it's customary in a service business to call your customers liars. But I can see that he doesn't think we matter. In this case, I guess I won't continue to give them my money.In any event, we left Tanoreen and drove to Pacificana in Borough Park, which was delicious - and gave us great service! And the moral of the story for all of you - always make a reservation at this place, even if you or they don't think you'll need one!",1.0
"Authenticity with tons of flavor and spice is the best way to describe Tanoreen. This middle-eastern shop makes some of the best home-style Mediterranean food i've ever had in a restaurant. Each dish is hand-crafted by the amazing female owner who is always there in the kitchen making sure everything runs smoothly. I've been coming here for years and never once felt like they slighted on their dishes. Everything is tasty and made with heart. The wait staff is warm and inviting. They just moved into a bigger space on 76th street, but the food hasn't changed a bit. The babaganoosh is excellent, as well as their hummus. They make an amazing tabouli and their falafel sandwich is superb. You can't go wrong here when seeking middle-eastern fare in Bay Ridge.",5.0
"Looking for something new (new to us, anyway) in the neighborhood the other night, Yelp's reviewers steered me to Tanoreen.  YESSSSS!!!We got our meal to go:  the Mediterranean grilled chicken, the chicken fetti, and side orders of cauliflower salad and the fried vegetable dumplings (sorry, I don't remember what they're called - starts with an ""S,"" ends I think with a ""K""). OMG!!!   The only quibble was with the cauliflower salad, battered fried cauliflower florets with tahini and pomegranate sauce.  Sounds great, right?  Well, I'm sure it would have been if the cauliflower was cooked to order and this dish were served hot, but evidently, it's supposed to be served at room temperature (what do I know, I'm not Middle Eastern).  Still tasty, but I detected the seed of a truly great dish in there if served hot, crisp and fresh.End of quibble!  The rest of the meal was EXTRAORDINARY!  The veggie pockets were SOOOOO good, crisp, fresh, so AMAZINGLY well- spiced and seasoned.  (Not at all like typical Chinese take-out veggie dumplings, if that's what you're thinking - those can be good too, but this is a very different dish.)  Filled with peas, potatoes, other stuff - I want some right now!  (I wish they came more than 3 to the order, though.)Grilled chicken - sounds boring, right?  Not here!  Beautifully marinated thin chicken breast, scallopini style, grilled in olive oil and spices, with sundried tomato pieces and thick slices of fresh mushroom over perfect rice pilaf, again beautifully seasoned - really, I can't describe how good this was, but this was NOT the same-old-same-old grilled chicken!  Chicken fetti - another unbelievably good dish.  A sort of casserole of boneless chicken chunks and shreds, with rice (differently spiced than the rice accompanying the grilled chicken), tahini, and small strips of fried pita layered in.  Spicing here was of the warm, sweetish, ""brown spice"" variety, which worked very well.  Filling, too - we had leftovers for lunch the next day (heat this up in an oiled frying pan, don't you DARE put this even NEAR a microwave!).Spicing / seasoning is the thing here: they do it very, very well.  Not cheap: all this was about $54, more than we usually spend for a take-out meal, but very much worth it.  Looking forward to trying some more of their items (wonder how their falafel is!).",5.0
"Just ate here last night again - forgot how wonderful this place is. The best Mediterranean food in bay Ridge. Everything is very well seasoned.

This place is ridiculously amazing.  It is a blessing in disguise that it is so far away from me because I would be there every day of my life!  Customer service was excellent.Food was to die for.I honestly don't have enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe how good the food tasted.  The best way to enjoy this menu is to order a bunch of appetizers and only one or two entrees and share it family style.  The portions are enormous so sharing is totally do-able.  This is my new favorite place in the city.

"I have been here in the past and thought it was much better or maybe it was because I had more drinks during my past visits.

"I don't know anyway to say this, but long before they were 'on the map' we've been enjoying Rawia's dishes.  From simple hummus to some of the most complex sauces and stuffings you can imagine, she comes through on every single note to create culinary symphony.  We've literally taken more than 100 different people here over the years.  People from all sorts of backgrounds and cultures.  Never has a single person ordered even one thing that they didn't love.  What more can I say.Now that they are in their new space the place has only gotten better.  Full service bar, ample seating, beautiful bathrooms and the food is still 100% spot on.The appetizers are all great, but if you're looking for suggestions try the brussel sprouts (you'll be amazed), muhammara, eggplant napolean, fatoosh salad and fava bean s (in season).  All are simply divine.  For entree's,  always, always, always study the special's menu.  Often there are dishes simply based on the freshest ingredients available that day.  For tired and true items, try the lamb fetti, lamb shank, or ANYTHING she is doing with fish.",5.0
"I came here from Queens on a Sunday afternoon armed with a $25 restaurant.com certificate (for only $3!) and high expectations.  The restaurant is located near a very charming residential area of Bay Ridge that has tall trees and beautiful houses.  Inside, the decor is very clean and new, with a relaxed and slightly upscale vibe.  I don't see what the fuss is all about.  The mint tea was just okay.  The Chicken Tagine was tasty, with lots of vegetables and spices, but the chicken was clearly roasted, instead having been slow-cooked in a tagine along with the vegetables.  Also, the tagine was served with rice - not authentic.  The real disappointment in the meal came with my dining partner's lamb dish, a special, which the server recommended because they were out of the lamb shank.  I don't remember the name of the dish, but it consisted of a gigantic plate of over-cooked lamb pieces swimming in a sea of white sauce.  If I was in Bay Ridge again, I would come back, and try the eggplant and the hummus, as many other have suggested.",3.0
"When I first arrived at the Tanoreen it was a Friday night and the place was packed. I was told there would be a 45 minute wait, which made me want to skip it. My bf convinced me to stay, and boy am I gratful! We sat at the bar with a very nice bartender who gave us some great suggestions on what to order.  We were seated about 15-20 minutes later which was great.  This was my first time eating middle eastern food but I found it to be very delicious!  Im sorry I cant remember our waiters name because he was so nice and very attentive. The place looks alittle plain at first but is beautiful once you get to the back. I had the lamb kebab which came with a huge portion of rice and salad, it was so tasty I was thrilled to have it for lunch the next day!

"Incredible place - we ate there 11/14 and it was the best meal I've had in ages.  Full disclosure - we live a couple of blocks away so kind of take it for granted.  But now I know we're really lucky to have it nearby.  You really can't go wrong.  I also love that the owner stops at our table (and every table I bet) each time we're there to ask how the food is.  (Prior review 2011 or so) I'm hovering between 4 and 5 stars here, it's just an amazing place with amazing food and the owners are just so nice and good at what they do.  Just came from dinner there and wow; brunch is similar and the new location at 76th and 3rd has such a great dining room.  The zatter bread is phenomenal, the meats are great, the veggies are good (it's vegetarian friendly and thus kosher friendly), the breads are great, the spreads - you get the idea.  You can't go wrong here.  I've lived a block from the place for a few years and feel so lucky that it's a 5 minute walk away, since people come from miles around to eat here.  Enjoy!",5.0
"I'm sorry to feel the need to give Tanoreen such a low rating. This place used to be one of my favorites. Fantastic food, and really nice service from the owner, who walked from table to table checking on her guests. But my visit last night makes me not want to go back to this place. My friend had wanted to drive our to Bayridge to go to Tanoreen for an early dinner (with her 1 year old daughter), and she had called a few days before to ask if we needed a reservation for a 6pm dinner. She was told no - not necessary. So we show up (admittedly at 6:15) to a restaurant that was probably 1/3 full and ask the host for a table for 4. He says without a reservation we'll need to wait 45 minutes. I explain about the call we had made, and he says (very rudely) ""that is impossible; no one would have ever said that; you are not telling the truth."" My friend comes in from the car, confirms the story I've shared with him and he says the same thing and is also very rude to her - ""you have to wait!"" Keep in mind, there are at least 15 empty tables, and we have a one year old with us, and would have been out of there within an hour. I'm not sure how a 45 minute wait would have been necessary, but maybe there were a bunch of 6:30 reservations?But the real point is that the host - a man who has seated me and my friends plenty of times in the past - was so incredibly nasty to both of us. I understand if he really needed to make us wait, but why not show a little more empathy? Maybe say he's sorry that we got misinformation? Or knowing that we have a baby, maybe suggest that he pack up some takeout for us? I don't think that it's customary in a service business to call your customers liars. But I can see that he doesn't think we matter. In this case, I guess I won't continue to give them my money.In any event, we left Tanoreen and drove to Pacificana in Borough Park, which was delicious - and gave us great service! And the moral of the story for all of you - always make a reservation at this place, even if you or they don't think you'll need one!",1.0
"Authenticity with tons of flavor and spice is the best way to describe Tanoreen. This middle-eastern shop makes some of the best home-style Mediterranean food i've ever had in a restaurant. Each dish is hand-crafted by the amazing female owner who is always there in the kitchen making sure everything runs smoothly. I've been coming here for years and never once felt like they slighted on their dishes. Everything is tasty and made with heart. The wait staff is warm and inviting. They just moved into a bigger space on 76th street, but the food hasn't changed a bit. The babaganoosh is excellent, as well as their hummus. They make an amazing tabouli and their falafel sandwich is superb. You can't go wrong here when seeking middle-eastern fare in Bay Ridge.",5.0
"Looking for something new (new to us, anyway) in the neighborhood the other night, Yelp's reviewers steered me to Tanoreen.  YESSSSS!!!We got our meal to go:  the Mediterranean grilled chicken, the chicken fetti, and side orders of cauliflower salad and the fried vegetable dumplings (sorry, I don't remember what they're called - starts with an ""S,"" ends I think with a ""K""). OMG!!!   The only quibble was with the cauliflower salad, battered fried cauliflower florets with tahini and pomegranate sauce.  Sounds great, right?  Well, I'm sure it would have been if the cauliflower was cooked to order and this dish were served hot, but evidently, it's supposed to be served at room temperature (what do I know, I'm not Middle Eastern).  Still tasty, but I detected the seed of a truly great dish in there if served hot, crisp and fresh.End of quibble!  The rest of the meal was EXTRAORDINARY!  The veggie pockets were SOOOOO good, crisp, fresh, so AMAZINGLY well- spiced and seasoned.  (Not at all like typical Chinese take-out veggie dumplings, if that's what you're thinking - those can be good too, but this is a very different dish.)  Filled with peas, potatoes, other stuff - I want some right now!  (I wish they came more than 3 to the order, though.)Grilled chicken - sounds boring, right?  Not here!  Beautifully marinated thin chicken breast, scallopini style, grilled in olive oil and spices, with sundried tomato pieces and thick slices of fresh mushroom over perfect rice pilaf, again beautifully seasoned - really, I can't describe how good this was, but this was NOT the same-old-same-old grilled chicken!  Chicken fetti - another unbelievably good dish.  A sort of casserole of boneless chicken chunks and shreds, with rice (differently spiced than the rice accompanying the grilled chicken), tahini, and small strips of fried pita layered in.  Spicing here was of the warm, sweetish, ""brown spice"" variety, which worked very well.  Filling, too - we had leftovers for lunch the next day (heat this up in an oiled frying pan, don't you DARE put this even NEAR a microwave!).Spicing / seasoning is the thing here: they do it very, very well.  Not cheap: all this was about $54, more than we usually spend for a take-out meal, but very much worth it.  Looking forward to trying some more of their items (wonder how their falafel is!).",5.0

"Let me be frank. My father and I used to gorge on kefta and fattoush in the old 3rd avenue shop when it was completely dead. I'm talking we were the only table in the house, on a thursday or friday night. This went on for about a year, and all of a sudden, BOOMYuppies.

The food is very good. Baked eggplant, with ground lamb, pignoli nuts and spicy tomato sauce, is a personal favorite. The only thing I've had that ecclipsed the nostalgia factor was the M'nuzli at Tripoli. THAT was f*ckin weird man, it tasted exactly like my grandmothers'. Anyway. Hummus, Baba, Muhamara, kababs, grilled fish, fattoush are all good.

I honestly thought after the dozens of Turkish and middle-eastern places I have been to in the city I would not get a good authentic middle-eastern meal until I went back to D.C. or Chicago. I was just getting sick of these fancy restaraunts, with boring bland menus of the same old kabobs and baba ghanoush, served in humongous plates but with teeny tiny portions so you would be forced to order a bunch of crappy appetizers just to ensure you leave feeling full. And then I discovered Tanoreen. This place gets 5 stars first off just for their menu. It goes beyond the typical kabobs, and actually serves the real authentic platters comfort foods such as Musakhan, Makloubeh, Makdous, Kibbeh, and Mansaf. The dishes that are actually complex enough and truly representative of Levantine cuisine, that you really couldnt replicate at home unless you happen to know a friends Palestinian grandmother who could cook for you. What I really loved about Tanoreen is it feels like owners really explored the region and came out with the best dishes from each area, then they have kinda fused the dishes, and honestly I think their chef is a creative genius. Its like homemade food...but with a chefs expertise and creativity added to it. For example the makloubeh is amazing, but its different then regular makloubeh because it has the fried onions (borrowed from the Egyptian dish Mujjadara), some pomengranate accents, and served with a big juicy tender lamb shank so its even more amazing then any makloubeh you have ever had. The base of each dish is something that takes you back to real good homemade food, but with a unique flar that makes it even more enjoyable and well worth the price. The Musakahan was delicous, loved it though it was more pizzalike then the typical messy whole chicken musakhan, however the flavors were spot on. I loved the Mansaf as well, the meat was tender, the yogurt sauce was perfectly tart. Honestly everything we ordered was superb, down to the perfectly diced refreshing salata, I had no complaints at all. I will never drop a star for service, because I think its just uptight and obnoxious to do it unless its truly terrible service. However fortunatley the server we had was great at Tanoreen, he was helpful, right on top of refills, making sure we were taken care of, and knew the menu very well.

"I'm not much of a Yelper, but I decided to report my experience and corroborate what a few others have already said. The truth is (at least from my perspective) that parts of your dining experience will be awesome, and parts might not be, depending on your ability to navigate the rough people and patches of the menu that might get in the way of an otherwise enjoyable dining experience. Primarily, service - the main reason I'm penning this now. We had a reservation. I arrived five minutes prior. They kicked me out, as a large party was leaving. I waited outside. It was 12 degrees out. I had a reservation for four, and my other table-mates were en route. The restaurant was empty (I cannot emphasize this enough - there were literally no seats taken). I walked back in. The man in the front ignored me for 5 minutes. Another group walked in. He seated them. He did not acknowledge my presence (side note - since the restaurant itself is kind of tiny with no immediately discernible waiting area [or places to sit] there is nowhere to wait without looking creepy, awkward, and uncomfortable). I interrupted his doing nothing to kindly inform him I had a reservation. He asked when my party was to arrive. I indicated they were mere minutes away. He said that I had to be gone by 8 o' clock. He said this rudely. He walked away. Another hostess walked up. She asked if I had been helped. I informed him that the other host had not acknowledged my presence, although when I interrupted his doing nothing, he informed me that I had to leave before 8 pm. She asked when my party was to arrive. I told her they were less than five minutes away. She did not offer me a seat. The restaurant was empty. I stood uncomfortably next to her waiting for a minute. My party arrived approximately 1 minute after this conversation. We were seated. So far, terrible experience. If some of my guests weren't going to be inconvenienced by this debacle, I would have definitively walked out. Isn't it basic human decency to offer someone a seat in your empty restaurant? Isn't it weird that instead of a 'hello, how can I help you?' you get ignored completely and then rudely told when you have to leave? I honestly don't know what I'm missing.Anyway, the waiter was awesome (most of them are!). I've had him before and he is very kind, courteous, and helpful. Leave him a big tip. Also, at the end of our meal, the same douche canoe of a host came over and kicked us out, douchiley inferring that we had overstayed our welcome (we had not). Food: As someone who has been there many times before, in addition to frequenting many Middle Eastern establishments across New York, I can easily say that the menu here is quite hit or miss. If I were you, I would take the advice of the NYT and save the entrees for another day - the appetizers are really where it's at. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that some, if not many of their main courses, are fairly pedestrian. Both times I've got the grilled platter, for instance, I've left disappointed (dried out meat will do that to you) - another reviewer made an apt comment in saying that the rice was the most flavorful part of the meal. Sad, but true. Their appetizers on the other hand tend to be a bit creative, more fairly priced, and quite substantial - so much so that you'll probably be filled up by the time those entrees roll around anyway. Most of the traditional Middle Eastern dips/sauces are quite good, and their vegetable appetizers are well (if not overly) seasoned and flavorful. If I were you, skip out on the main courses, interact with the douchey hosts as little as possible, and you're in line to have an enjoyable time.",2.0

Very satisfying.My lady companion had chicken fetti, a dish that consisted of shredded white and dark meat, on a bed of vermicelli-pilaf and draped with a tahini sauce. Filling and flavorful. The gentleman friend had stuffed squash, which was hollowed and filled with minced meat. The dish was covered with yogurt sauce. Light and delicious.She and I had Arabic coffee, decidedly different from Turkish coffee. It's flavored with cardomom, with no sugar.

"As I get ready to move out of this neighborhood, I'm starting to miss Tanoreen already. Here's my tribute to the place. Plenty of reviewers here have already mentioned the incredible food. The  transporting sides of vegetables (nowhere else have I even thought those words about restaurant vegetable sides). The pomegranate revelations. The sujok...ah, the sujok. And the food, of course, is the main reason to go here.  I like to order a selection of appetizers/salads/sides for the table, and then one or two entrees, max, all to share. (The entrees come with huge sides of rice that are uninspiring compared with all the other incredible flavors, as well as comparatively expensive.) Let the dishes come to the table one by one, let everyone dig in, and watch the eyes roll in ecstacy. But the thing that just kicks this place up even higher, into the very small category of my possibly-favorite-restaurant-ever, is the service. I've never felt so seamlessly and graciously waited on in a restaurant, with a minimum of fuss or pretension. All the service seems to derive not from a set a etiquette rules to follow, but from a basic intention to enhance the experience of eating the food, and to express welcome, consideration, and comfort. It doesn't matter if the restaurant is busy or slow, if I'm with one other person, or a large party -- I always get the same warm and careful treatment. This is not a simple task, and the staff at Tanoreen are just incredible pros.",5.0
"This friendly, elegant dining oasis is worth the trip.  The musaka, massive bread basket and scrumptious filet mignon sliders are crazy.  Portions are HUGE and everything is fresh, you can't go wrong, no matter what you order.  The chicken kebabs (an old guard standby) are succulent and juicy.  Loved the rice with vermicilli and fresh mediterranean salad they came with.  Daily specials make for no-repeat-dining.  Five people: appetizers (3), wine (1 bottle), entrees (5), soda, coffee (2) and dessert (1) came to $229 without tax.  A deal IMHO.",5.0

"My favorite place to eat in the neighborhood.  There are lots of awesome vegetarian choices, which makes it a perfect place to bring friends, family and picky eaters.  The staff is friendly and the chef/owner is always in view and comes table side to check how your doing.  The Zagat rating is totally appropriate...... I have never had anything like the browned cold cauliflower with pomegranate syrup.  It is really amazing.  I hear the lamb is out of this world, but all i know is that the vegetarian stuffed artichoke hearts and eggplant are perfect every time.  The new space is beautiful with a full bar.  I'd pass on the pistachio martini.",5.0
"I'm a huge fan and try to come here once every week or two. The service is charming & great, the drinks are great (unique) cocktails, and the food is amazing. I'll just list some of my favorites here for folks:Appetizers: Brussel Sprouts (amazing even if ya don't like Brussel Sprouts), Musakhan (sp?), Eggplant Napolean, and Muhammara are great and a different selection than most Middle Eastern restaurants... then the Tabbouli, Fattoush, Hummus, and Baba Ghannoush are all great. Friends of mine love the Cauliflower and Fried Haloumi Cheese, among others.Entrees: Chicken or Lamb Fetti (my favorite!), the Maklooba (""Upside Down""), the Lamb(? or other meat) balls in yogurt is great, and the stuffed eggplant/zuchinni-type stuff is great!Drinks (my favorite part!): My friends and I love the ""Nazareth Sunrise"", ""Basil-Blueberry Lemonade"" spiked (if they have it), the Cafe Arabica or Creme du Arak (both sweet so listed on Dessert drinks but these are my favorite during-dinner cocktails), and more...FYI you are served some things to snack on shortly after sitting down and are given a bread basket that includes toasted Arabic (Pita) bread with Zaatar on it (yummm!)Last but not least, do NOT leave without trying the Knafeh!!! They serve one of the best I've ever had for dessert!Hope these things help!",5.0
"The food is very good and the pirces are great.  We shared a grill combo and the eggplant with lamb.  Everything was flavorful and juicy.  I also think the ""pita chips"" that they serve with the hummus has crack spread all over it.  They were addicting and we literally scraped the hummus dry.",5.0
"I'll be honest, I'm picky as hell in anything I eat. I rarely venture out into other culture's foods unless almost dragged into it by friends. With that said, I loved the food tonight. It's tasty and it's not greasy. The prices are reasonable. My total share of the bill with tip was about 25 bucks which isn't too bad. This is including juice, shared appetizers and the meal itself. I usually spend about 20-23 on average in your average chain place so 2 bucks more for better food was fine by me.I loved the cozy feeling too. It's a small place with comforting decor and they really do keep the place spotless. And the owner goes around at the end of the meal asking if everything was fine. It's nice to know that there are places who still do this and I do believe interactions like this is important for good business which is very much displayed from the place.",5.0
"Last night, as part of my Christmas present, my partner treated me to Tanoreen, supposedly the best Middle Eastern restaurant in New York City...And I must say that Tanoreen certainly lives up to its reputation! It was well worth the LONG R train ride from Astoria to Bayridge! The atmosphere is relaxed and the service professional and hospitable. The chef-owner, Rawia Bishara, took the time to visit each table and greet each patron. For starters, I ordered the delicious, creamy and smooth hummus, which was accompanied by a basket of pita and amazing pieces of zatar. My partner ordered the chicken soup, which was prepared with lots of fresh parsley. Both were excellent. For my main course, I ordered the perfectly prepared lamb kabobs, which came with pasta-like rice, and cucumber and tomato salad. My partner ordered kibbe, the sautéed spinach, and homemade lemonade. The kibbe was served in a square and scored into little boxes making it resemble a piece of just baked brownie. We are used to kibbe served in an oval. I must say that although it looked a bit different it was the best tasting kibbe I have ever eaten and the star food of the evening! According to our waiter, all food is infused with Tanoreen's mix of secret spices, including the ancient spice sumac. How cool! For dessert, we ordered the mint tea and the house special melt in your mouth fig-filled cookies. I am a lover of Middle Eastern cooking and I must say that Tanoreen WOWED me. It was certainly worth the ride out to Bayridge.",5.0
"Food:  Excellent seasoning.  Meats are a bit on the dry side, but the flavor profiles make up for it in a big way.Service:  Professional and attentive.Ambience:  Considering it's Bay Ridge, I was not expecting Oneida flatware and Reidel glassware, but, everything was polished and the room was well kept.  Good for groups and dates.",4.0
"As I get ready to move out of this neighborhood, I'm starting to miss Tanoreen already. Here's my tribute to the place. Plenty of reviewers here have already mentioned the incredible food. The  transporting sides of vegetables (nowhere else have I even thought those words about restaurant vegetable sides). The pomegranate revelations. The sujok...ah, the sujok. And the food, of course, is the main reason to go here.  I like to order a selection of appetizers/salads/sides for the table, and then one or two entrees, max, all to share. (The entrees come with huge sides of rice that are uninspiring compared with all the other incredible flavors, as well as comparatively expensive.) Let the dishes come to the table one by one, let everyone dig in, and watch the eyes roll in ecstacy. But the thing that just kicks this place up even higher, into the very small category of my possibly-favorite-restaurant-ever, is the service. I've never felt so seamlessly and graciously waited on in a restaurant, with a minimum of fuss or pretension. All the service seems to derive not from a set a etiquette rules to follow, but from a basic intention to enhance the experience of eating the food, and to express welcome, consideration, and comfort. It doesn't matter if the restaurant is busy or slow, if I'm with one other person, or a large party -- I always get the same warm and careful treatment. This is not a simple task, and the staff at Tanoreen are just incredible pros.",5.0
"This friendly, elegant dining oasis is worth the trip.  The musaka, massive bread basket and scrumptious filet mignon sliders are crazy.  Portions are HUGE and everything is fresh, you can't go wrong, no matter what you order.  The chicken kebabs (an old guard standby) are succulent and juicy.  Loved the rice with vermicilli and fresh mediterranean salad they came with.  Daily specials make for no-repeat-dining.  Five people: appetizers (3), wine (1 bottle), entrees (5), soda, coffee (2) and dessert (1) came to $229 without tax.  A deal IMHO.",5.0

"I'll preface this review with the fact that I have very little experience with this type of cuisine. However, there are few times in my life when I've had a restaurant bring out every course and each one be absolutely delicious. Tanoreen did this. I have eaten here a number of times and each time I am more and more impressed. Every course is impressive, and I suggest sharing a main entree because they are so large. The star of the show though is the special dessert called Knafeh (hope I spelled it right) you have to order it like a souffle, ahead of time. As a former pastry chef I have to say very little surprises me when it comes to dessert, but this dish does the trick. It is superb!! Disregard people saying it's too sweet, that's the way dessert should be!!!!!!! This thing is like nothing you have ever had, a definite must try!!!

"Ate here 4 days after eating at José Andrés DC restaurant Zaytinya, and I have to say this place was just as good - but mellower, slower and more personal. Rawia Bishara still comes out and personally greets all of her customers and pauses to listen and respond to your opinions. Did the eggplant Napoleon (amazing) and the Schwarma Sliders were something I could eat daily! But the Brussels sprouts were the  real go-to item. Wow, were they really deep fried? Also about half as much $ as Zatinya. Been wanting to eat here for over a year, and glad it finally happened.",5.0
"I've been here only twice, but think it serves up some of the tastiest morsels around! I discovered the second time around that it is best to order a bunch of appetizers, as the main courses aren't quite as impressive. They are expensive and often you are getting a lot of rice. But the cauliflower salad is a dream. I wanted to take it in the next room and be alone with it! Caramelized, with a smokey flavor and the smooth tahini on top and a slight sweetness from the pomegranate molasses. You will love it. Also, the fava beans were heavenly and so is the eggplant. All the spreads we all know and love in the Middle Eastern cuisine are also exceptional here, so don't skip them just because you think they are ordinary. They are very special here. And one of my absolute favorite things is when the owner/chef stops by and talks to you. She is so intense and slightly intimidating, but in a fun way. It completes the experience.",4.0

"Tanoreen is meze heaven. And the massive deli case separating the dining room from the kitchen shows off the meze, in bright, appealing colors and textures, for all in the dining room to enjoy.I found myself gazing deeply at each platter, piled high with delicious, fresh, meze (those small plates for which the Middle East is known) the way a kid in a candy shop would look at the dozens of varieties of gummies and chocolates. ""Ohhhhh..."" I'd gape at the selection, and the like-minded diner standing next to me, drawn by the light and color and eye-appeal of the food in the case, would echo me. And make some comment about the deliciousness the babaganouj, the hummos, the mhamarra, the salads, the cauliflower, the lentil pilaf, the bulghur tomato pilaf, or some other dish.How to choose just a few plates?Because most of the meze is in the $5-$6 range, there's no need to limit the selections. We piled up our table with the dishes we could agree on and felt we could actually eat in a reasonable amount of time. No leftovers would be allowed. We avoided the large dishes, not by design but because the meze were so appealing - and so numerous. And were not disappointed. Everything was very good. Not the best I've had, but very very good. Even dessert was fun - a light custard not dissimilar to a panna cotta, flavored with rosewater, mastic, and pistachio. Mmmm.I would most definitely go back. One note: we went on a Tuesday night at 7:30 pm and snagged the last table before the dining room turned at about 8 pm. I've been told by the very helpful person answering the phone that the rush is between 6:30 and 8 pm. If your party is less than 4 people, you CANNOT get a reservation.

The lemonade is out of this world, definitely order a glass of that. I've never had lemonade like it anywhere else.

"Tanoreen is a really great place. I went with a group of people, including Lauriann K. and Pearl K. to celebrate Lauriann K.'s birthday. Everyone got something different and everyone loved their meal. My friend got the combo meal and I would recommend getting it because then you can try 3 different kinds of meat. I believe it was chicken, lamb, and a type of sausage. I got the special that night which was lamb shank. They cook their lamb really well there, it was really tender and magical. The rice is awesome, it's hard to describe because it's a mix of regular rice  with a pilaf. The best part was when the owner came out to greet us. We told her it was Lauriann K.'s birthday and she asked the birthday girl her name. After we were done with our meal, we saw waiters approaching with 6 baklavas  with a candle on top of one of them. They sang happy birthday with the birthday girl's name (hence why the owner asked for her name). I thought that was really wonderful of them.The baklavas were delicious!  It was on the sweeter side but still great.  I would have eaten the whole plate but it wasn't my birthday and that kind of behavior is not appreciated.",4.0
"Update for new location:Very surprised at the downhill slide this place has taken in its new location, although it's pretty predictable.  The positive: the larger space is definitely more restaurant-ey.  More tables, better atmosphere for sitting and enjoying the food. Alcohol is served (pricey though).Here's the problem: they aren't equipped to deal with the 5x volume of customers they get now. This place is packed packed packed.#1) they lost our reservation (wrote down the wrong time) and we were made to feel at fault.  #2) there's like one waiter for a solid 50-60 diners.  #3) that waiter is a total jerk, who will ignore your table the whole time you're eating and then pour on the schmaltz when you get the check.  #4) they recycle the bread (which you may have to remind your waiter to bring you).  #5) the menu is WAY less creative and interesting now (e.g. almost everything on the menu is full of ""tanoreen spices."").  #6) the food is bland and lacks flavor, and seems to have been sitting around in large portions for days waiting to be served.  #7) That waiter from before actually berates you multiple times for not stopping him mid-run to tell him the food isn't good (now that you don't want to take it home with you) and thinks doing an extra good job brushing the crumbs off your table will make up for an evening of ignoring you. #8) When the owner catches wind that you didn't like your dry and crusty shepherd's pie (yeah, shepherd's pie...see what I mean about the menu?) she now makes a big show of talking to every table BUT YOURS.Save yourself a trip from wherever you are.  You can get the same quality food almost anywhere, and why would you want to travel for crappy service?  Even with excellent service, the food is too overpriced, and the owner is no longer the charming hostess she used to be.

"I have walked past this restaurant over and over again - never paying notice.  The ugly green awning never invited me to even look inside.  When I read that the best Middle Eastern food in NYC was just down my street - I was floored.  I said, ""What?  Where?  No, there is no restaurant there.""  I am sooo happy that I read the review -it is such a lovely gem.  I definitely will be going back there again and again - I just hope it doesnt become TOO popular to get a seat.",4.0
"Had just about the best damn meal I've ever had at a restaurant here at Tanoreen. The food was plated so beautifully I was even reluctant to start eating, but it was just heaven once I did. At least one of the menu items my friend and I had intended on ordering (after reading all of the reviews and magazine articles about Tanoreen on the outside of the restaurant) was out, but our waiter had made some amazing suggestions, and we were both very happy with them. The lemonade is out of this world, definitely order a glass of that. I've never had lemonade like it anywhere else. The only downside to this place is that it's tiny, and there's a long wait (if you happen to go on a weekend night during dinner time), but that's only because this place is so so good, they know what they're doin at Tanoreen.",5.0
"One of the better meals I've had in the city.  We got the brussell sprouts, eggplant napoleon, falafel and lamb samosas.  Everything was better than I was expecting, phenomenal really.  The service was prompt and cordial, and the owner came out to check on the patrons twice.  For dessert we had the rosewater-infused custard and a rolled date cake.  The decor is nothing to write home about, but who the hell cares?  What matters is on the plate and Tanoreen delivered, big time.  I'd go there again, and again, and then some more, and then once more for good measure.  Also, there's a bike rack right outside the bar next door: convenient.",5.0
"Everything was OVERLY Lemony & garlicy for my taste.  Drinks were good and not too sweet.  We ordered a lot of different apps, humus, taboleh, lamb kibeh..and others.   Some things were good, or had hints of interesting flavors.The brussel sprouts were good but there was a huge hunk of GLASS in the dish.  I showed it to the matried and he said a pan was chipped and that was what it was from.The woman chef who owns the place has a michelin star rating so im told.  Place was very busy with many many non lebanese people from what appeared to be park slope and Manhattan.  This area of Bay Ridge used to be known for its outstanding places to eat, just not so anymore.  You may like it more then me, and you will really like it if your a vegetarian with all the selection, but im a die hard carnivore and there just wasnt that much that i would like to eat again.  The baklava for dessert was great.  Not Michelin star worthy though.Parking is near impossible on the streets on weekends.",3.0
"I was so excited to finally go to Tanoreen.  Intimidated by the trek to Bay Ridge, it took me a while to get there.  Sadly, it wasn't everything I imagined it would be.  There was nothing I didn't enjoy, but I wasn't all that impressed.  I was expecting the best middle eastern food I'd ever had.  The grape leaves were grape leaves.  The babaganoush was babaganoush.  I had tilapia with a spicy tomato based sauce and it was really good.  But I wasn't blown away.  Though I tasted the baked mediterranean eggplant and it was pretty fantastic.  The portions were huge and nothing disappointed.  I just had high expectations.  The staff was wonderful and accommodating.  And the harissa dessert was excellent.  I'll go back.  But I'm not going to rush.",4.0
"Tanoreen is a really great place. I went with a group of people, including Lauriann K. and Pearl K. to celebrate Lauriann K.'s birthday. Everyone got something different and everyone loved their meal. My friend got the combo meal and I would recommend getting it because then you can try 3 different kinds of meat. I believe it was chicken, lamb, and a type of sausage. I got the special that night which was lamb shank. They cook their lamb really well there, it was really tender and magical. The rice is awesome, it's hard to describe because it's a mix of regular rice  with a pilaf. The best part was when the owner came out to greet us. We told her it was Lauriann K.'s birthday and she asked the birthday girl her name. After we were done with our meal, we saw waiters approaching with 6 baklavas  with a candle on top of one of them. They sang happy birthday with the birthday girl's name (hence why the owner asked for her name). I thought that was really wonderful of them.The baklavas were delicious!  It was on the sweeter side but still great.  I would have eaten the whole plate but it wasn't my birthday and that kind of behavior is not appreciated.",4.0
"Update for new location:Very surprised at the downhill slide this place has taken in its new location, although it's pretty predictable.  The positive: the larger space is definitely more restaurant-ey.  More tables, better atmosphere for sitting and enjoying the food. Alcohol is served (pricey though).Here's the problem: they aren't equipped to deal with the 5x volume of customers they get now. This place is packed packed packed.#1) they lost our reservation (wrote down the wrong time) and we were made to feel at fault.  #2) there's like one waiter for a solid 50-60 diners.  #3) that waiter is a total jerk, who will ignore your table the whole time you're eating and then pour on the schmaltz when you get the check.  #4) they recycle the bread (which you may have to remind your waiter to bring you).  #5) the menu is WAY less creative and interesting now (e.g. almost everything on the menu is full of ""tanoreen spices."").  #6) the food is bland and lacks flavor, and seems to have been sitting around in large portions for days waiting to be served.  #7) That waiter from before actually berates you multiple times for not stopping him mid-run to tell him the food isn't good (now that you don't want to take it home with you) and thinks doing an extra good job brushing the crumbs off your table will make up for an evening of ignoring you. #8) When the owner catches wind that you didn't like your dry and crusty shepherd's pie (yeah, shepherd's pie...see what I mean about the menu?) she now makes a big show of talking to every table BUT YOURS.Save yourself a trip from wherever you are.  You can get the same quality food almost anywhere, and why would you want to travel for crappy service?  Even with excellent service, the food is too overpriced, and the owner is no longer the charming hostess she used to be. Fail.(also weirdly fishy that 6 minutes after I posted this review, a ""new user"" posted his first/only review giving it 5 stars, knocking the sticky 5 star top review down a notch...those are chosen by owners, btw)",2.0

The kebobs, I hate to say it, were a bit dry. The knafe is a must for dessert, as well as the ice cream. The prices are very reasonable, and a gluttoneous dinner for four set us back just over $200.

A grilled haloumi and fried other cheese (name escapes me) with cucumber and tomato was also delicious. We topped of the meal with fresh, crunch baklava.",5.0

And as for the presentation, just think of each dish as an edible Richard Serra sculpture: discretely elegant, and yet as large as a Walmart on human growth hormone.

"Tanoreen is solid middle-eastern/palestinian fare. The mezze plate was good, as everyone here says, but my favorite was the baba ganouj - just the right blend of smokiness, eggplantiness, and tahini. Good consistency too. I had the kibbeh entree which was great - I always worry that kibbeh will be dried out but this was great. The salad it came with was good too. Hubby had the lamb kabab, which was cooked just right and came with rice that i wasn't a big fan of (had semolina in it which made it a bit sweet). It is far from the city, but we took the N and saved some time.

I eat a lot, and always either finish my entree at restaurants, or pack it to bring home, but this meal was so unappetizing I only had three bites, and pushed it aside.  The decor was pretty though, and the cook/owner ( either one or both, not entirely sure- definitely someone who has a vested interest in the restaurant) came and chatted with us for a minute, which I thought was extremely polite.

The humus at any one of the ""hummus place"" in the city is much better (as is the falafel).

"Everyone should find time to go to Bay Ridge for Tanoreen.My family ate here for our holiday dinner, all six of us loved the food. We had baba ganoush, grape leaves, and tabula for appetizers served with a crispy bead seasoned with parsley and other Mediterranean spices. I could have made a meal with the baba ganoush. My dad got the sorloin and my mom got some chicken special, but the rest of us being vegan, the four kids split two Vegetarian Baked Eggplants (Special) and two Vegetarian Cobo Platter. The eggplant dish was absolutely my favorite, layers of thin eggplants stacked with potatoes, zucchini, peppers, onions and spices, it was similar to ratatatue but more smoky and seasoned more lightly The combo platter was also great, it was a large plate of cracked wheat, greens (my favorite), eggplant, and some other goodies. I also had some of there fresh lemonade, which was the best I've ever had. This meal was one of the best, if not the best, I've had in New York... One of my favorite parts was the cute cook walking around talking with the customers. It was more homey and mom like then a french chef checking on the customers, it felt so welcoming and liek she actually cared how we liked the meal.As soon as I can, I'll be heading down to Tanoreen again.",5.0
"Started to eat here before it started getting the hype.  Lamb when I had it last was quite good, as well as the hummus, and other accoutraments.  Can't say anything for the atmosphere, since there really isn't any, but the service was freindly, and the food was good and served fast, very casual, not for any dates though.  There are plenty of other places though that serve middle eastern food in the area that deserve the same number of accolades, so don't really understand the major hype though.",3.0
"The hummus is actually as mindblowing as everyone says.  We ended up here on a random adventure and couldn't have been happier we did.  Everything we ordered was stellar, and the restaurant itself has a real home-cookin' charm.  There was the lamb shank, which was like the best pot roast your mom never made; or the artichoke hearts, veritable chunks of heaven; the chicken dish my girlfriend ordered, which was like the insides of an awesome shwarma on a plate.  Even the free flatbread that came with the hummus was retarded good.  All in all, some sweet-ass Middle Eastern.Also notable, since the place is BYOB, is the Sam Adams selection at the bodega next door.",5.0
"This was seriously the worst food that I have ever consumed or allowed to enter my mouth. I'm sorry, but I had such high hopes and expectations for the restaurant after seeing it being listed as one of ""the best turkish restaurants"" in the city. It is far from it. My friend and I took about 45 minutes to get here, extremely psyched to try everything,but we were severely disappointed.  I had ordered Kafta, expecting a great symphony of flavors and spices in my mouth, but instead, I got cold, tasteless chunks of poorly butchered and flavored lamb in my mouth ( which severely contrasted from the ""finely ground lamb"" that I was expecting). I eat a lot, and always either finish my entree at restaurants, or pack it to bring home, but this meal was so unappetizing I only had three bites, and pushed it aside.  The decor was pretty though, and the cook/owner ( either one or both, not entirely sure- definitely someone who has a vested interest in the restaurant) came and chatted with us for a minute, which I thought was extremely polite. If you are going to take a huge chunk of time and energy to get there ( i.e take 3 trains to get there), I highly advise against it.",1.0

"I have to agree with the positive reviews on this site. I am always looking for good Middle Eastern food, and Tanoreen remains my favorite in the New York/New Jersey area.

For starters, if you see mousakhan on the specials menu, go for it. The shredded chicken stewed onions, sumac and olive oil over flat bread appetizer is enough for two or three to split. Last Saturday, I instead started with the kibbie, finely ground lamb, wheat germ and spices stuffed with lamb, onions and ""Tanoreen spices,"" baked.I cannot remember the name of the entree I had Saturday (it was from the specials menu), but the flavors are unforgettable: pieces of Middle Eastern bread, topped with Egyptian rice, shredded lamb (or chicken) and a tahini yogurt sauce. All dishes at Tanoreen are well presented. Mine came with a garnish of mint leaves in the center and chopped parsley around the rim of the plate. The portion was huge (which means a lot coming from me). I ate until I was full and still had enough to take home for a filling lunch during the week.For dessert, I skipped the baklava, which I always order, and instead opted for something different: Sahlab, a custard flavored with mastic, a Middle Eastern sweet spice, topped with pistachio nuts and syrup.

"Well... My wife is Lebanese and though Tanoreen is Palestinian, the cuisines are similar. The tabooleh (my wife is very particular) is great, and the owner, on being complimented, said ""Yes, we try to make this the Lebanese way.""

We just made our third or fourth visit; the first one or two were to the previous location. They haven't slipped. We came with 3 friends whom we have told about the place but who had not been. They loved it. Everything was delicious. Even my wife was impressed. Though they were full on a Saturday night, we were seated promptly at our reservation time and were served by a lovely young waitress who was very accommodating. We lingered a bit; ordered our entrees after we were mostly done with the meze, etc. I do wish you could get the entrees middle-Eastern style: just kebobs or whatever you ordered for sharing on a platter, instead of on individual plates with rice and salad. But the entrees themselves were delicious. The only reason we don't go more often is that it's a shlep from Manhattan. But tonight reminded me again why I make the journey.",5.0

"Made the trek out to Bay Ridge and went for lunch on a Saturday with my boyfriend and my cousin, who had just returned from several months in Palestine. The place was nicer than we had expected, and would be a good date location. We ordered the hummus as an appetizer, and it was very good. My boyfriend got the kabob sandwich and I got the chicken sandwich (like schwarma), because we wanted something lighter than the entrees. Both were fine, but really nothing special - in fact, I didn't like the chicken all that much and was happy when my boyfriend wanted to switch halfway through (he liked it better than the kabob). His was good, but again nothing great. My cousin got the vegetarian platter, with extra shulbato instead of salad. It was great, and I would highly recommend it. Overall, a fine experience, but I probably wouldn't go back (or I'd at least order differently).",3.0
"We recently visited this Palestinian restaurant identified to us by restaurant.com.  We found the food to be quite remarkable in both flavor and quality.  The cauliflower appetizer was terrific.  The portions were above average, prices reasonable and the service was very well coordinated and efficient.  We were greeted at the door very warmly by the person who turned out to be our waiter who was also very knowledgable about the food and its preparation.  We also noted that the owner visited every table while we were there to assure that everyone was completely satisfied.  The only drawback is that there is no acoustical ceiling and, with a packed restaurant, it was overly noisy.  We will definitely be back.",5.0

I wont say its bad but its nothing to go spend over 15bux a plate over... they barely give u any meat and its not tasty and the rice sucks... overall me and my mom paid 60 dollars for two entrees and one appetizer and barely got any meat and what we did get didnt taste that great. The place is nice and clean but thats all i'll give them... Im definitely not going again and would recommend to keep looking for a better middle eastern restaurant!",2.0
"Tanoreen serves pretty standard Middle Easter food.  I was expecting something ethereal and did not get anything close.  Everything was fine and the restaurant was an enjoyable casual dinner but there is no reason to trek this far to get decent food. From the kibbe to the kebabs, from the hummus to the grape leaves, nothing stood out.  The meat pies and a few of their specials were also ok but nothing special.  That eggplant with lamb everyone raves about was probably the worst of the entrees I tasted.  I recently returned from the Middle East and was expecting something with such rave reviews to come close to what I experienced.  No such luck.  I will continue my quest to find amazing Middle Eastern in this city.",3.0
"Really nice place! A nice cozy place with good music and amazing food. The staff is very friendly, the food tastes great and on the non-crowdy evenings its the best place to take your date. As per all the other reviews, hummus, baklava  and baba ghanoush are to die for.",4.0
GREAT great great great great.  very creative and yummy and great.  I can't see how anyone would be disappointed.,5.0
This is really the best Middle Eastern food I've had since I left Detroit.  It makes me very happy. Save room for some knafe for dessert.  You'll be happy you did.  Nummy!,5.0
"Made the trek out to Bay Ridge and went for lunch on a Saturday with my boyfriend and my cousin, who had just returned from several months in Palestine. The place was nicer than we had expected, and would be a good date location. We ordered the hummus as an appetizer, and it was very good. My boyfriend got the kabob sandwich and I got the chicken sandwich (like schwarma), because we wanted something lighter than the entrees. Both were fine, but really nothing special - in fact, I didn't like the chicken all that much and was happy when my boyfriend wanted to switch halfway through (he liked it better than the kabob). His was good, but again nothing great. My cousin got the vegetarian platter, with extra shulbato instead of salad. It was great, and I would highly recommend it. Overall, a fine experience, but I probably wouldn't go back (or I'd at least order differently).",3.0
"We recently visited this Palestinian restaurant identified to us by restaurant.com.  We found the food to be quite remarkable in both flavor and quality.  The cauliflower appetizer was terrific.  The portions were above average, prices reasonable and the service was very well coordinated and efficient.  We were greeted at the door very warmly by the person who turned out to be our waiter who was also very knowledgable about the food and its preparation.  We also noted that the owner visited every table while we were there to assure that everyone was completely satisfied.  The only drawback is that there is no acoustical ceiling and, with a packed restaurant, it was overly noisy.  We will definitely be back.",5.0
"If you want to have a great, laid back, Brooklyn style meal, this is the place. Whenever we go there, we spend hours at the table ordering more food and drink without feeling rushed.  Some great things to try are the stuffed eggplant, hummus, broccoli salad with pomegranate dressing. Definitely save room for the Baklava.The prices have gone up a bit recently. Hopefully they don't go up too fast...",5.0
"You have got to be kidding me!  I went to this place based on a Zagat review.  I don't know how this place gets away with a 27 food rating.  Makes you wonder if someone is stuffing the ballot box like they do back home!  Nothing seemed fresh and everything was camouflaged in parsley.  What a terrible experience after I was expecting so much.  It looked like half a luncheonette and a butcher shop at the same time.  I'm writing this review, because I would hate to see someone who is visiting NYC make the long trek into Brooklyn to be disappointed based on a Zagat review.  There are several wonderful restaurants in Bay Ridge, such as Sally & George's that I would recommend before this one.",1.0

"My boyfriend and I had heard of Tanoreen before and decided to include it in our restaurant week plans.  They took my reservation even though they really aren't supposed for only two people.  We were seated immediately (rare these days even with a reservation).Our server was very hospitable.  He explained that everything on the menu was part of restaurant week , including the specials.  The appetizer we decided on, a warm flat pita pie, deliciously seasoned chopped chicken, garlicky magenta cabbage and just enough warm olive oil, was plenty for two people.  It was delicious.My entree was a very soft artichoke stuffed with lamb and pine nuts next to a huge bed of rice off the specials menu.  My boyfriend had the Kibbie, finely ground lamb, wheat germ and spices stuffed with lamb, onions and Tanoreen spices, baked and served with salad.  The lamb meatloaf was very savory and the salad was crisp and fresh.Again, our server indicated the dessert we chose should be split as well.  We had the Knafeh, the  house specialty composed of shredded filo dough stuffed with two kinds of sweet cheese, baked and topped with homemade syrup and pistachio nuts.  It was outstanding.  My boyfriend said it was like a sweet grilled cheese and I don't know what could be better than that.I also had their house lemonade which was laced with rosewater, very refreshing and helped clear my palette.  Our check was $54 and we left an $11 tip because the server was so friendly and gave us advice on reheating the dessert we took home.  The owner also made the rounds greeting guests.We saved about $5 due to restaurant week, however I would've paid more for this inventive and satisfying meal.",5.0
"This is one of the best Middle-Eastern restaurants ever.  It is basically Lebanese but they do some dishes from other countries in the region.  The food is always delicious, totally fresh, well-prepared, and a joy to eat.  Two of the people I'm closest to rate this as their favorite restaurant in the country.  But I have to tell you, Lebanese food is not my favorite cuisine and I still love this place.What should you have?  The vegetarian sampler platter is a good place to start.  Your server takes you up to the take-out counter and your pick out four dishes: try the hummus, it's always great.  But the other dishes range from the familiar baba ganoush (eggplant) to more exotic fare.  Also you have have a range of entrees, some very meaty, some not.  According to one of my experts, their falafels are world class.The atmosphere is very mellow.  It's a small restaurant but the servers work hard and pay attention to you.  The woman who owns it often appears and is very nice.Yes, this place is in the wilds of Bay Ridge and requires a long ride on the ""R"" local to reach but it is certainly worth the trip.",5.0
I have eaten here twice once at the old location and once at the new one. FOOD IS FANTASTIC. One of the better middle eastern places for the city and the prices are very reasonable which makes it nice to live down the block from them. The only drawback was that it was BYOB at the old location and now they have a fully stocked bar making my dinner's a little pricier.....Damn my Irish heritage.,5.0
"Awesome! If u like middle eastern food I recommend going. Service family charm, decor romantic, prices are not cheap but worth it. Hummus with pita is fresh, creamy and perfectly done. They offer a tahini free version. I had the chicken kabobs with make and crispy onions, feta cucumber and tomato salad. Pickled veggies are great and free. Chicken with yogurt, pita, and some cool middle/rice thing comes in a awesome silver serving bowl. Lamb meatloaf, beef kabobs were phenomenal. We all left with doggy bags portions are generous. We didn't have room for dessert but the menu was insane ... I wanted everything. Food network has featured a dessert from here on ""the best thing I ever ate"". I saw it because every table in the restaurant ordered it (wells seemed like it) and I must admit it probably would have been the best thing I ever ate. Strongly suggest this place especially for a hot date!!! Very accommodating for celiacs & gluten free, just talk to your server. BEWARE everything has wheat & other non friendly ingredients, but they will make you a special order.",5.0
"Wow...this was absolutely the best meal I've had in a long time. Two amazing appetizers to start...an olive spread and a wonderful spread made of walnuts, pomegranate, red peppers, magical spices and olive oil.  These were served with a basket of pita and I swear I could have ordered another serving of each appetizer skipped the rest of the meal I was already in heaven.  Eventually I weaned myself off the olive and walnut spreads to make room for the entree. My chicken dish was so flavorful, I literally savored each and every bite.  When I hit food coma, I asked for a box to take home the leftovers.  The waiter was gracious enough to give me extra pita bread to go as well since we had pretty much gone through the entire basket.  I'm not sure if they have a liquor license, so we came with our own bottle of wine which they were happy to serve.  Service and food was exceptional!  I just realized they deliver and I already want another order of that yummy olive spread.",5.0
I've read the reviews that said it was worth traveling from  afar to get here and I agree; of course I live only a half a block away. The BabaG. was the best I ever had but everything else was very good; very reasonable prices and fine service.,4.0
"Well, I am unhappy to write a poor review for I had been twice to the previous incarnation of Tanoreen. In the old location the atmosphere was more homey and culturally defined. The present location strikes one as Bay Ridge glitz, middle eastern style. But in the end that means little for the purpose of going to a restaurant is to eat the food, and the food at Tanoreen was really, really good in the previous two visits. This time around, however, it was extremely disappointing. I went with a special recommended by the waiter and it tasted like leftovers: a bunch of stuff piled into the same dish with little distinguishing flavors or subtlety. Okay, so maybe one was bad. Alas, my wife's vegetarian dish wasn't much better. Just blah. I could do as well around the corner on MacDougal St. at Mamoun's for a couple of bucks. Just not up to what we had enjoyed before. On top of that, with the new location came higher prices (to be expected and we were prepared for that fact) and no longer are you able to bring in your own wine (again, that's okay, it's unusual to be able to do that). In the end, I am very disappointed to have to say that I would think twice about going back to the new location. Maybe it was a bad night?",2.0
"I'm taking back a star and rewriting my review of this place. I went a couple of weeks ago and the food is starting to go downhill. My baked mediteranean eggplant was cold and was hardly still held together. It made me wonder how long it had been sitting in the back of the kitchen. Also, every time I seem to go the prices get raised. It's too expensive for Arabic food. Also, the service is mediocre. I went a few weeks ago and there were only two tables being occupied and the servers/waiters hardly came by to see how everything was and I had to flag them down just for the check! If you've seen this place before it's really small, so there's no reason that I should be having to ask for more water or waiting 15 minutes just to get the check.  I was ranting/raving about this place for a long time and have been bringing friends here frequently when they come to visit, but Tanoreen, keep this up and you're going to lose business. Also, don't get the shawarma, it's not good.",3.0
"the kafta baked lamb with tahini sauce might be in the top three dishes i've ever eaten. another one of the three was the peach pie that my mother baked when we went down to pennsylvania to visit my grandmother when she was on her deathbed. honestly, a lot of people would probably live longer if they stopped nestling into the covers of their deathbeds. yeah, yeah - i know it's comfortable being coiled up in the blankets of pathos and crisply-ironed sheets of memento mori. but if you want to live, i recommend sleeping in a lifebed.",5.0
