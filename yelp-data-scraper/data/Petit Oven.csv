"Put it this way. For the last 8 years, every time me and my wife want to celebrate something, we come here.Put it another way. I'm from the south of France, and I come from a famliy of chefs. French American bistros are usually sources of huge disappointment for me. Not Petit Oven. It's been a source of inspiration for me. A Kimchee and Brussel Sprout bed for a Duck Breast? Genius, and something I would have never thought of.This isn't a joint that's trying to turn your table as fast as possible, and you'll want a reservation. It's a small kitchen, a small room and the chef & the staff care. The 'By The Glass' selection isn't an afterthought, it's actually filled with gems.Right now, there's a Bone Marrow on the menu, and it was one of the best I've *ever* had.Also, if there's any poultry on the menu (Duck or Chicken), order it. I've had great steaks at Petit Oven, but I swear, the chef is a poultry master, you won't regret it.",5.0
"I called last minute to change my reservation to half an hour earlier and they were quick to accommodate me. The two waitresses Serena and Nicole were attentive all night, constantly refilling our water and checking if everything was good. We ordered an escargot in garlic parsley butter, beef cheek over creamy polenta, duck confit over crispy cabbage and potato and a southern fried chicken I think over polenta, followed by coconut pana cota.My boyfriend and I never had escargot before, I must say at first it's a little weird but it catches on and gets better and tasty, especially in the delicious sauce. The beef cheek was extremely tender, it came apart so easily, a spoonful of that with creamy polenta was heaven in my mouth.To the main entrees, the skin of the southern fried chicken was extremely crispy, a little too salty for my taste. The chicken was surprisingly very moist still. The duck confit was also a little too salty but the meat was very tender even though it was explained that it is usually more well done than the duck breast. The dessert would've sufficed with just the coconut pana cota. It sat in a citrusy sauce with grapefruit/blood orange slices on top which I think was too sour for me. Would definitely recommend this place if you've never had French food before. The place is very homely feeling, really small, so don't go expecting you'd be able to bring more than 6 people in your party.",4.0
"Ok we've walked in to Petit Oven 15 minutes before they're scheduled to close.  Have to see if the chef is ""still here"". I apologize but no problem, the waitress asks us to sit down. The place is indeed petit but everyone is so genuinely nice.I order a glass of red languedoc.   Really special I notice the menu is limited to a tasting menu and a few a la carte selections.  The duck immediately grabs me so we order it tout de suite! We are served pretty quickly.  The duck is delicious on a bed of spicy turnips which are just wonderful !  Ok the prices are manhattan level but the food is really tremendous. A real plus is the waitress and the chef, who comes out to chat and tells us how she makes the spicy turnips. What a gem of a place in Bay Ridge!   Really a surprise !  A nice one...we'll definitely come back.",4.0
"I came here 2 times on my birthday, back to back and I am likely to return.Petit Oven my local French restaurant located in Bay Ridge. I'd suggest you call and make your reservations before coming. I've seen people get turned away because they did not have a reservation. Food & service are awesome. It's intimate and great for a special occasion for a 2 or a small party. I came here with my fiancé and went with 1 tasting menu, 1 entree, and 2 Ala Cartes.3 Course Tasting Menu $40 - Price jumped a bit from last year but for the quality of food, it's worth it in my opinion. 1st Course - Wild Mine Mussels, Serrano, Chili, Garlic, Cream - The mussels were delicious and fairly large. The chili added a bold and tasty spice. We cleared the bowl and broth. 2nd Course - Scottish Salmon, Creamy Cabbage, Beans (recommended medium rare) - Fresh, with the slightest hint of the ocean. The salmon was cooked and seared to perfection. It melted in my mouth with every bite. If you want something light and tasty, this is the dish to get.3rd Course - Famous Bread Pudding, Salty Caramel, Walnuts, Cream - Highly recommended for the sweet lovers out there. I can probably eat 5-6 orders in 1 sitting. The bread (hot) sits in a pool of caramel and cream. Definitely choose this dish as your dessert. Escargot Classic Parsley Butter $12 - Small portion with a few pieces to share. Loved it. Recommended.Roasted Marrow Bones, Onion Jam, Crostini $16 - lots of beefy, tender, and buttery meat. These things are hot so beware. Highly recommended!Korean BBQ Duck Breast $31 - My fiancé had this dish and didn't really enjoy the wild rice, but the duck was sooo good. Once again, cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth. Every bite was moist and savory.Bring your date here for a memorable night!",5.0
"I absolutely love Petit Oven.  It's as petit as it gets, with two waitresses and one cook - all of who are super great at their jobs, honestly.  It's very small, as I said and service can be a little slow, but the food is great.It's also super packed during dinner (considering there are maybe max. 10 tables).  However, you're super close to all the nice decor!  For October, we tried to tasting menu and started out with the mussels.  It was a fairly large portion of mussels for an appetizer, but it was delicious.  Then we had chicken over kale and I think it was fennel.  Also super delicious.  The portion looked small, but honestly, come dessert - their bread pudding was to die for.  The caramel turned the bread pudding into a soupy, warm, hearty dessert which was delicious.  The menu is $40/person, which is pricey but great for a birthday.I am definitely coming back!",5.0
"I've been trying to come here for years and finally was able to last week for my wife's birthday.  The two waitresses are on point with everything.  They deserve all the praise for their hard work along with the chefs in the back.  The food here is so fresh and amazing.  From the raw oysters to the salmon tartare on potato latkes to the mussels, the food was great.  I had the duck breast which was the best duck I ever ate.  My wife had the fried chicken which was breaded and fried to perfection.  The bread pudding was hyped up in previous reviews and it's true, it is the best dessert to finish the night.  If you need a go to spot for a date, do come to Petit Oven.",5.0
"I don't really have any issue with food, it tastes good but it's not like any dish is great. If you ever had duck breast at home or anywhere else that's exactly what it taste like. Honestly i love duck, had it in many places, their duck breast is pretty much the same my duck breast at home tastes like, regular supermarket variety duck breast.Same goes for every dish, escargot taste the same as it tastes in any bottom of the barrel place that serves escargot. Side dishes are again, they are solid, you can eat them, but you can get a better product at Cheesecake Factory.Now if the prices were reasonable i could give them a pass, but the ABSURD prices they charge leads me to give them ONE star. This has to be one of the worst places i have been at Dollar for Dollar. The quality and taste of food is honestly diner quality, it just looks way better and sounds better and presented in a more fashionable way.Again, service is good, food is solid, but the quality of food is honestly no different than any chain like Outback or Cheesecake Factory or something like that. There are far better places on 3rd avenue to eat in than this place.Also, i have been to France, Italy, Norway, Germany, Morrocco, Thailand, i have eaten good food all over the world, Petit Oven to French cuisine is like comparing a Pizza joint to fine Italian Food.Save your money, don't go there.This place is truly one of those modern hip places where service is great, everyone looks smart and successful, but when you actually get down to the food....................average.",1.0
"You'd never think Bay Ridge is much of a culinary destination. In fact, it's really not. It's got some nightlife, some decent restaurants, but nothing really that makes it an attraction for the dining experience outside of the bordering neighborhoods. Well, that used to be the case. Petit Oven is the catalyst to change that perception. It's a tremendously great restaurant, and is a must-visit. Bay Ridge residents can thank the owners for bringing this awesome operation their way. I first heard about this place from a stranger in a Russian sauna who overheard me and my friend talking about Yelp. We didn't think much of it. Drunk Russians say lots of things. But the name of this restaurant stuck. But what stuck more is that he said 'You'll never believe where this place is'. He was as shocked about this gem being in Bay Ridge as we were. Had a party of 4 come here for a birthday dinner. Reservations were a breeze. Even though I had to change the number of people from 3-4 once and change the time on another call, they remained patient (and I am very grateful for that, I know it was annoying). Menu rotates, so be prepared to be surprised if you come visit more than once. Here's a breakdown of what we had on the last visit -Salmon tartare - I enjoyed it, overall good but a little too heavy on the mayo which was a surprise. Still, good.Skirt steak - had it a perfect medium, it was excellently juicy w/ pommes frites and fois gras (honestly more of a splash of reduction that was certainly kind of there but didn't contribute or take away in a significant way)Lastly, the escargot. What texture. Seriously, this must be the best escargot I've had in the states.You won't regret a visit here.Tip : Don't drive if you can help it. Parking is a pain in the tuchus.",4.0
"We took my wife here on her birthday. It was a great experience.  The food is all very flavorful and fresh.  The service is expert and attentive.  We really had no complaints.  I would highly recommend the restaurant.  The chef herself was there working in the kitchen and everything tasted perfect.  Expect smaller portions but the food is very rich and filling.  We ordered the fried chicken, crispy and delicious, the beef cheeks that were melt-in-your-mouth wonderful, and I had the duck breast that was perfectly cooked tender and exquisite.  We started with the salmon tartare, that came out plated a little clumsily but pack a punch with the fresh  horseradish.  Don't miss this restaurant it's really excellent.",5.0
"I've been dying to try this place and we went this past February. The Restaraunt is very small so reservations are a must. Walk-ins were turned away. Great for date night! The food here is excellent!!! I had the duck breast which was prepared perfectly (i told the server to have it prepared as per the chef's recommendation.). It was succulent, juicy - delicious and the portion size was just right.  My husband had the fettuccine and loved every bite!  I was very impressed by a delicious plate of pate (with the diacritical mark over the e) of very generous portion that was placed on the table when we were seated. They could have easily put that on the menu and charged for it.  It was outstanding!!  The bread pudding w/ salty caramel sauce & walnuts is also outstanding! I also enjoyed their music playlist: blues, jazz, contemporary and the server was very friendly and personable.  Be aware that their menu is seasonal so what you see on line might not be on the menu that evening.",5.0
"We had been talking about going to this place for my birthday or our anniversary for years. We went not too long ago and I forgot to write about it so I will now. Yes, you should make reservations because as small and pricey as it can be, the place can get very crowded. (I had to roll my eyes at the person who apparently thinks reservations are unheard of in Brooklyn. I guess you can crawl back in your hole.) Also, service is slow but in a good way---if I'm paying good money for a meal, I like not feeling rushed.We both decided on the three course tasting menu. Remember that it changes seasonally/regularly so what they have one season you might not care for whereas another will have everything you'd like. We both started off with the escargot. Good but very different from escargot that we've had before---and I could see it being salty to some people.I cannot remember what my partner-in-crime had but I had the mushroom gnocchi, which was very good. At the end, we tried each of the desserts---Mexican spiced creme brulee, which has a bit of a kick to it and the bread pudding, which was delicious.",4.0
Food and service is top notch every time! The beef appetizer is so delicious I could have eaten another serving of it.. The duck is always delicious & I love the bread pudding. My husband LOVES the salmon tar tar.. Overall everything we ever get is delicious. I'm hoping some of the reviews here are a joke like the one who found it funny that you need a reservation at a restaurant in Brooklyn? lol In bayridge you will have a hard time getting a seat at any good restaurant on the weekend without a reservation... Yes even in Brooklyn.,5.0
"Didn't get to eat - was looking forward to it. It is small,  but looked comfy. We were waiting on one and wanted to sit and order an appetizer, but couldn't. Understand rules and appreciate an explanation but presume something else could've been done.  We left and ate elsewhere.",1.0
"I was very excited to head over to Petit Oven this week with my wife for a nice dinner. We've lived in Bay Ridge for a while but have never made it to dinner there. One time we came in and we didn't realize it was restaurant week, we wanted the full menu so decided to come back.The place itself is very charming, cute, small and everyone was very nice. However, the issue that we had was the very small choice of dishes overall. There was the $40 Prix Fixe, but the only other options off that were Cod and a $46 Ribeye.The Prix Fixe options also left something to be desired.The three options were Southern Fried Chicken, Salmon with a soy reduction and gnocchi with caccio pepe. We were really excited to try something that was distinctly their own, but the options on the menu just seemed very... cookie cutter?Neither one of us were interested in the cod or steak so we both ended up getting the fried chicken. While the fried chicken was prepared very well and was tasty, there just wasn't anything unique about it, no sauce or gravy, just fried chicken with collards and polenta.We both went with the escargot as an appetizer, which were again, well prepared, but very simple.Lastly, the dessert was very good. We had the Bread pudding which has been reviewed here many times and deserves it's praise as well as an excellent coconut panna cotta with passionfruit.Overall, the meal was good, nice and solid, but for the price, it left us wanting a little more.",3.0
"Heard so many good things about this place - was so excited to go with my husband. The food was average. It was not extraordinary but not bad. I recommend the duck if you go. But expect to pay Manhattan prices for okay food. My opinion - if you're going to offer a limited menu, make sure every option is on point. On just food, I'd give Petit a 3/3.5. One star purely on service. Again, if you want to come off as a fine dining experience, get servers who know how to serve. For one, ask them to dress in appropriate attire - our waitress wore sweats, hair tied up like she just came from running. For another, have them leave your menu. Ours couldn't answer  any of our questions. Worst part - only one waitress, thus you waited for awful service. Huge disappointment...",1.0

"I have recently begun trying to explore Bay Ridge more as it is close to my parents' in Bensonhurst, and I came here last night to celebrate defending my dissertation (woo!).  I was not at all disappointed, as the food was fresh, delicious, and attractively plated.  All of us got the prix fix and at 35.00/person, not a bad deal at all.  We pretty much got to try everything on that menu, which included (i apologize for the lack of detail for some dishes as those were the ones that my parents ordered and that I just stole nibbles off of):Appetizers:Watermelon, tomato, melon, some sort of strong cheese nommalicious saladEscargot (delicious garlicky sauce..my dad essentially sopped it all up using the bread on the table)Entrees:Fried chicken with bitter greens and mashed potatoes (tender and crispy chicken, with mashed potatoes that were surprisingly spicy)Salmon - yummy and tenderFettucine in tomato sauce - tasty pasta, though this was probably the dish that stood out the leastDessert:Bread pudding with caramel sauce - heavy and dense, but quite goodSome kind of lighter cheesecake like thing with fresh cream and a fresh berry sauce (really really delicious!!)Everyone left the meal with nothing but good to say, which is often not the case with my parents.  Decor/ambience-wise, it is cute and quite small, with music that is surprisingly loud.  We made reservations on a Sunday night around 7, but it didn't seem like we needed it.  The restaurant felt busy but not overly crowded.  Our server was pleasant and friendly, but as she was the sole person taking care of the entire restaurant, was not always the most attentive.  Not a big deal though, as it was nice to be able to sit and enjoy the meal.  The menu appears to rotate depending on the season/week, and the website does not appear to be updated with the most recent info; probably don't rely on that too much.  I also had to call a couple of times in order to actually reach someone to make the reservation..given all of this, I assume that this is one of those small places that is often a little understaffed.  Despite this, I am excited to come again, as the actual dining experience was wonderful.",4.0

Kat also does several variations on duck, which are always excellent.  Her pasta dishes are also always wonderful.The restaurant is small and I would definitely recommend a reservation, more-so the later in the evening you go.  I have seen many times they have to turn away walk-ins because they are fully booked for the evening (with good reason).  Prices are moderate, and always worth it.",5.0

"Surprisingly, the food is pretty cheap considering the quality of it. For $35 you can get a 3 course tasting which is very filling & trust me when I am say filling I mean you will be STUFFED. I also think that this deal beats restaurant week's currently priced $38 (dinner) since many of such restaurants give you small portions and just... a rather insatiable appetite. I came here for the duck confit because I love duck confit. Sadly, they did not have it since their menu is based on what ever is fresh on the market that week (which can be good or bad depending on whether or not you like the element of surprise :p). Instead, I ordered the fried pork chop which was mmm mmm good and very filling for an entree and escargot that was a tad bit salty for an appetizer. For the dessert, PLEASE trust me on this, order the bread pudding! Never have I ever tasted such a delicious, harmonious, and satisfying bread pudding. Never. I seriously enjoyed this place, but as a warning this place's menu differs from what they have online. If you see a dish you want and petit oven claims they make it, call them to just double check!",4.0
Excellent farm to table restaurant in Bay Ridge. The food and service is always spot on. The only downside is that they're a bit slow to serve the courses. I always enjoy their homemade pasta dish. The menu is small but it changes seasonally which is how it should be. They've accommodated us as walk-ins before but best to make a reservation.,5.0

It wasn't taste fresh!Our server was very careless. She dropped a used fork on my top then spilled water on me afterward. When my husband realized something dirty in his glass. He told her there is something dirty in the glass. The waitress was like ""what do you mean something dirty in it?"" Why didn't she take a look and just say sorry instead of giving such attitude.The desserts were the highlight. It was above average. That's why I give 1 star. The waitress was standing at the counter when we leave. Didn't even bother to say thank you or anything to us. I think service is more important than the food quality sometimes. I paid $170/4 people and I ended up eating chips at home now. Definitely NOT going back or recommend this place to ANYONE! I'll go back to Lucien in the city instead!",1.0

Sadly, they did not have it since their menu is based on what ever is fresh on the market that week (which can be good or bad depending on whether or not you like the element of surprise :p). Instead, I ordered the fried pork chop which was mmm mmm good and very filling for an entree and escargot that was a tad bit salty for an appetizer. For the dessert, PLEASE trust me on this, order the bread pudding! Never have I ever tasted such a delicious, harmonious, and satisfying bread pudding. Never. I seriously enjoyed this place, but as a warning this place's menu differs from what they have online. If you see a dish you want and petit oven claims they make it, call them to just double check!",4.0
Excellent farm to table restaurant in Bay Ridge. The food and service is always spot on. The only downside is that they're a bit slow to serve the courses. I always enjoy their homemade pasta dish. The menu is small but it changes seasonally which is how it should be. They've accommodated us as walk-ins before but best to make a reservation.,5.0

"I found this place thru Yelp a month ago. They closed for 2 weeks in the summer. I went there tonight and what a disappointment!Everything was too salty tonight. The french fries were SOFT. It wasn't taste fresh!Our server was very careless. She dropped a used fork on my top then spilled water on me afterward. When my husband realized something dirty in his glass. He told her there is something dirty in the glass. The waitress was like ""what do you mean something dirty in it?"" Why didn't she take a look and just say sorry instead of giving such attitude.The desserts were the highlight. It was above average. That's why I give 1 star. The waitress was standing at the counter when we leave. Didn't even bother to say thank you or anything to us. I think service is more important than the food quality sometimes. I paid $170/4 people and I ended up eating chips at home now. Definitely NOT going back or recommend this place to ANYONE! I'll go back to Lucien in the city instead!",1.0
"After a 45 minute argument (I could have just gotten onto the train and arrived) with a friend, he finally convinced me to hang out with him for a few hours in Bay Ridge.""I didn't move to Manhattan so I could spend an hour on the train to eat at a restaurant in Bay RIdge"" is what I told him.  Without that argument, and someone with a lesser power of persuasion, I would never have found this place.  The food and service were absolutely on par with some of the better places I have been to.  The Bouillabaise is as good as I've had anywhere.Service was polite, quick and easy.  Ambiance was clean, simple and rusticOutstanding find.Minus 1 star for being in Bay Ridge.

"To start, we were excited on a Friday night not to have to drive to the city to get a great meal. We called and felt lucky to get a reservation at 9pm. When we arrived they gave us our seat selection and we were happy to see the owner and the same waitress as we've been coming to petit oven over several times. The new waitress sucked, and then it started to go downhill. The tempo seamed off. As we sat patiently and watched other tables get served their food in a timely fashion I think it took over 30 minutes to Shuck 6 oysters, they were from the west coast and very tasty. The salads took another 25 minutes to come out, which was ok and my pasta was alright as well. Still feeling starved for food, And seeing everyone who was in the restaurant before us depart, I began to wonder why was this taking so long to get a steak and Some chicken? That's when the trouble began...This used to be a great restaurant. I ordered a steak which took over and hour and a half to make it to my table only after I asked "" could you check on our order please"". Then they plated me a RAW steak without flavor, broccoli  without florets (2pieces) Over some tasteless sauce. I asked to have it heated and it was brought back undercooked again... We skipped dessert and left, feeling awkward. I left wondering if they wanted to give me a f-u for asking for my food in an almost empty restaurant. But what reputable chef would send out a product that isn't their best work? The steak had zero flavor and the French sauce had zero flavor as well. The best thing about the steak was the fries. The wine wasn't so bad either. So when I rate restaurants it's based on the triple threat philosophy. Atmosphere, food quality, and service. All three were lacking tonight.

"My girlfriends and I came here for dinner last night, it was the 1st time for most of us save for 1 friend who raved about the place for months on end. She was not wrong. I loved EVERY SINGLE THING about this restaurant. The ambience, the décor, the owners, the music (shout out to Nicole's Pandora stations!!) the wine, & the FOOD - oh the glorious food. The Prix Fixe deal on Wednesdays is unbelievable, 3 full courses for $28 - can't beat it. It's normally $35 which is also excellent. I ordered the Brussels Slaw, Homemade Fettuccini with Bacon, & Mexican Spiced Chocolate Crème Brule. The slaw consisted of brussel sprouts, cranberries, feta, olives & lemon. An interesting spin on cole slaw but without the mayo & the addition of crunchy sprouts instead. It had just the right amount of lemon flavor so as not to overpower the dish. I'm a HUGE fan of feta & Kalamata olives too so that was a plus. The homemade fettuccini was cooked to perfection in a rich & creamy cheese white sauce & the thick cut pieces of bacon on top were out of this world. A friend's exact words for them were  ""how do you even describe the taste of this?"" There are no words, but a few descriptions come to mind - smoky, salty, chewy yet crunchy, baconey goodness. Yep I just made 'baconey' a word. Trademark it. Send my royalties to Petit Oven - it's THAT good. Lastly came the dessert - I was significantly torn between the Famous Bread Pudding & Crème Brule - but given how full I was from my first 2 courses I went with the latter & I was not disappointed. The rich crispy top & the gooey spiced chocolate below was the perfect end to a fabulous meal. The owners - Kat the chef & Nicole our waitress - are so down to Earth & personable.

The options were fantastic and I was pleasantly surprised when we received our first course, which was a brussels sprout slaw that rocked my world. For the entree, my friend ordered the salmon, which melted in her mouth, and I ordered the rib that came served over the most heavenly mashed potatoes accompanied by delicious carrots and potatoes in a brothy stew.

"Well there is nothing small about this place. What a wonderful culinary experience, I was hoping they had duck on the menu but that was not gonna happen.It was my friends birthday on this wonderful evening and she said ""she was paying for the dinner"" Woohoo!So we both ordered the appetizer of - Berkshire Pork Belly, Grilled Spanish Octopus with Bean Cassoulet. This was very good the beans matched well and the flavorful sauce made this a wonderful appetizer. Then for the main we both ordered - Free Range Rack of Lamb, Eggplant, Roasted Peppers and Garlic. Wow the rack was cooked to perfection medium rare, so succulent that I was chewing the bone. Yummy!! I did have to ask for salt and pepper cause there are none on the tables. I felt awkward like someone would yell at me if I asked. But I did and the waitress was polite enough to grind some salt and white pepper all over this wonderful Rack of Lamb.For dessert I had the - Fallen Chocolate Souffle with Ice Cream. This was deliciously served with the ice cream melting into the souffle. It was spot on!!Service was attentive but not overly patronizing and that was a plus. This is one of the best kept secrets in Bay Ridge a fantastically amazing French American Bistro!",5.0
"My new favorite restaurant in Bay Ridge. We usually end up outside the neighborhood, but after dinner here last week, I am recommending Petit Oven to my friends in Park Slope! The food,wine and service were excellent. Three of us ordered a different entrée from the prix fixe menu so that we could each have a taste. The mussels appetizer was perfectly prepared with basil and jalapeño. I really enjoyed my entrée of homemade orrechiete with pork ragu, as well as sampling the cod and chicken entrées. I have seen the chef at our local farmers' market and the fresh ingredients are apparent in her cuisine and the seasonal menu. The wine list is reasonable and the waitress was knowledgeable about each selection. Desserts were another triumph-freshly made crepe with berries and bread pudding with caramel sauce.

"A gem of a discovery in Bay Ridge!This is the kind of French Food-faire you'd expect in some hoighty-toighty (sp?) location in the city but nope, it's safely tucked away in neighborly mom n'pop Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and I am A-OK with that.  I hope Petit Oven is here to stay!This is the perfect place for a grown adult (child) to:1) Partake in a romantic date with your significant other.2) Get treated to a fancy-pants drunkie dinner with your middle-aged parents who will most certainly foot the bill.  (I picked this one!)The restaurant recommends you make a reservation ahead of time and from my guess it's because it operates true to its name -- it's a small establishment that fills up quick in its peak hours.  I came at 6:30 to an empty restaurant and left when it was filling up.  They also have Happy Hour $1 oysters until 7 so we (my grown-ass self and my parents who footed the bill, yay!) took full advantage of that.I'm under the impression that the restaurant offerings are seasonal and that's cool if you like variety and if you don't, go to McDonald's, you philistine!  Our server was knowledgable with her wine recommendations and giving us the lowdown on what goes down on the daily (chef goes to the market during the day, picks out some cool ingredients and really just improvises a fantastic flavorful menu), I can't complain about talent like that and you get what you pay for...culinary GENIUS.Menu items worth writing home about:1) Escargot = Holy shit, when you're done eating the snails, sop up the leftover HERBY GARLIC OIL SAUCE, with more bread.2) Proteins (Duck and Steak) = Cooked to perfection.  Duck had crispy skin, Steak was moist and delish.3) Bread Pudding = Because. Bread. Pudding.A bit on the pricier side but we had an undeniably great time.  Great service, great food -- Would definitely come back with my folks or the bf if we felt like splurging and enjoying a relaxing night out without the fuss of heading into the city.",5.0

"What a fantastic little restaurant, a true gem in BayRidge.  The food is absolutely remarkable,  My husband and I enjoyed the tasting menu, each taking something different for more to try.  OK, can we talk about that Kale Salad w/ spiced pumpkin?  Really?  If I could only have 10 meals in my life that would be included.  (and Im not a Kale fan outside of in juices) The bouilliabaise was really flavorful as well.  I normally don't go for a fish soup but was very impressed.  The mushroom pasta was earthy and rich. The beer is served in the appropriate beer glass for each type of beer, how cool is that?  The desserts..... um, Mexican Chili Chocolate brulee.  HOLY CRAP-- rich, spicy, the perfect consistency. ( I can't remember the other dessert but remember that was also great. )So yeah, generally speaking the food is really well thought out, super fresh, flavorful, A++++Also, The waitstaff was super friendly, the music perfect.  A great friendly vibe.  I do wish they put some effort into creating a cool decor as the space is very sparse and lacks personality except clean, but hey, that won't keep me from coming back--- again and again.",5.0
"I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but there are idiots out there in the world. People that are completely unreasonable and utterly unbearable...and guess what? You're going to have to deal with them. But things have a way of balancing out. Sometimes after a particularly long day, a parking space in notoriously awful-for-parking Bay Ridge will magically appear directly in front of a cute, quaint little place like Petit Oven. The lovely waitress will sweetly lend you a quarter out of her own pocket to feed the meter, and go on to serve you ever so well. You'll start with a nice bread served alongside soft, salted butter (the importance of spreadable butter is often overlooked). Perhaps you'll opt for the crab fritters as an appetizer which will be exceedingly crabby, wonderfully crispy, and well worth the price tag (the accompanying celery root purée will be particularly memorable).Her fettucini might be excellent, but your duck will be perfect. A beautiful medium rare (the chef will not serve it past medium, and I don't blame her), and the crispy, salty, fatty skin will leave you in love. Atop a bed of curried lentils, crispy potatoes and caramelized onions, this is what satisfaction tastes like. You'll clean your plates against your better judgment and linger over your wine, reflecting on the fact that, occasionally, everything works out.",4.0

"Tiny place. Although we didn't make any reservations, we had a late dinner so we were able to be seated after 15 mins of waiting outside the restaurant. The portions are small but flavorful. Loved the mussels. The crab popper is not worth the price. Would not recommend the gnocchi either. The gnocchi were made too large. Even though the mushroom sauce was delicious, it was like eating large chunky pieces of dough. Will give it another try.",3.0
"Well there is nothing small about this place. What a wonderful culinary experience, I was hoping they had duck on the menu but that was not gonna happen.It was my friends birthday on this wonderful evening and she said ""she was paying for the dinner"" Woohoo!So we both ordered the appetizer of - Berkshire Pork Belly, Grilled Spanish Octopus with Bean Cassoulet. This was very good the beans matched well and the flavorful sauce made this a wonderful appetizer. Then for the main we both ordered - Free Range Rack of Lamb, Eggplant, Roasted Peppers and Garlic. Wow the rack was cooked to perfection medium rare, so succulent that I was chewing the bone. Yummy!! I did have to ask for salt and pepper cause there are none on the tables. I felt awkward like someone would yell at me if I asked. But I did and the waitress was polite enough to grind some salt and white pepper all over this wonderful Rack of Lamb.For dessert I had the - Fallen Chocolate Souffle with Ice Cream. This was deliciously served with the ice cream melting into the souffle. It was spot on!!Service was attentive but not overly patronizing and that was a plus. This is one of the best kept secrets in Bay Ridge a fantastically amazing French American Bistro!",5.0
"My new favorite restaurant in Bay Ridge. We usually end up outside the neighborhood, but after dinner here last week, I am recommending Petit Oven to my friends in Park Slope! The food,wine and service were excellent. Three of us ordered a different entrée from the prix fixe menu so that we could each have a taste. The mussels appetizer was perfectly prepared with basil and jalapeño. I really enjoyed my entrée of homemade orrechiete with pork ragu, as well as sampling the cod and chicken entrées. I have seen the chef at our local farmers' market and the fresh ingredients are apparent in her cuisine and the seasonal menu. The wine list is reasonable and the waitress was knowledgeable about each selection. Desserts were another triumph-freshly made crepe with berries and bread pudding with caramel sauce. Just overall high-quality!",5.0
"A gem of a discovery in Bay Ridge!This is the kind of French Food-faire you'd expect in some hoighty-toighty (sp?) location in the city but nope, it's safely tucked away in neighborly mom n'pop Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and I am A-OK with that.  I hope Petit Oven is here to stay!This is the perfect place for a grown adult (child) to:1) Partake in a romantic date with your significant other.2) Get treated to a fancy-pants drunkie dinner with your middle-aged parents who will most certainly foot the bill.  (I picked this one!)The restaurant recommends you make a reservation ahead of time and from my guess it's because it operates true to its name -- it's a small establishment that fills up quick in its peak hours.  I came at 6:30 to an empty restaurant and left when it was filling up.  They also have Happy Hour $1 oysters until 7 so we (my grown-ass self and my parents who footed the bill, yay!) took full advantage of that.I'm under the impression that the restaurant offerings are seasonal and that's cool if you like variety and if you don't, go to McDonald's, you philistine!  Our server was knowledgable with her wine recommendations and giving us the lowdown on what goes down on the daily (chef goes to the market during the day, picks out some cool ingredients and really just improvises a fantastic flavorful menu), I can't complain about talent like that and you get what you pay for...culinary GENIUS.Menu items worth writing home about:1) Escargot = Holy shit, when you're done eating the snails, sop up the leftover HERBY GARLIC OIL SAUCE, with more bread.2) Proteins (Duck and Steak) = Cooked to perfection.  Duck had crispy skin, Steak was moist and delish.3) Bread Pudding = Because. Bread. Pudding.A bit on the pricier side but we had an undeniably great time.  Great service, great food -- Would definitely come back with my folks or the bf if we felt like splurging and enjoying a relaxing night out without the fuss of heading into the city.",5.0
"I liked everything about the place, which is unusual, I think I would complain of mot enough seating on weekends and late dinner",5.0
Absolutely love this place.  The food is ridiculously fresh and flavors are so comforting and fulfilling.  My mom and I had both the pre-fix with an additional escargot which came with this yummy garlic sauce that I kept finding myself dunking bread into.  The service was friendly they sang happy birthday to my mom which I know she was happy and all and all a great experience.  Second time there and both times have been good.  Will be back!!!,5.0
So delicious!!!!!,4.0
"What a fantastic little restaurant, a true gem in BayRidge.  The food is absolutely remarkable,  My husband and I enjoyed the tasting menu, each taking something different for more to try.  OK, can we talk about that Kale Salad w/ spiced pumpkin?  Really?  If I could only have 10 meals in my life that would be included.  (and Im not a Kale fan outside of in juices) The bouilliabaise was really flavorful as well.  I normally don't go for a fish soup but was very impressed.  The mushroom pasta was earthy and rich. The beer is served in the appropriate beer glass for each type of beer, how cool is that?  The desserts..... um, Mexican Chili Chocolate brulee.  HOLY CRAP-- rich, spicy, the perfect consistency. ( I can't remember the other dessert but remember that was also great. )So yeah, generally speaking the food is really well thought out, super fresh, flavorful, A++++Also, The waitstaff was super friendly, the music perfect.  A great friendly vibe.  I do wish they put some effort into creating a cool decor as the space is very sparse and lacks personality except clean, but hey, that won't keep me from coming back--- again and again.",5.0
"I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but there are idiots out there in the world. People that are completely unreasonable and utterly unbearable...and guess what? You're going to have to deal with them. But things have a way of balancing out. Sometimes after a particularly long day, a parking space in notoriously awful-for-parking Bay Ridge will magically appear directly in front of a cute, quaint little place like Petit Oven. The lovely waitress will sweetly lend you a quarter out of her own pocket to feed the meter, and go on to serve you ever so well. You'll start with a nice bread served alongside soft, salted butter (the importance of spreadable butter is often overlooked). Perhaps you'll opt for the crab fritters as an appetizer which will be exceedingly crabby, wonderfully crispy, and well worth the price tag (the accompanying celery root purée will be particularly memorable).Her fettucini might be excellent, but your duck will be perfect.

"I can't decide if this is truly a 'hidden gem' - while stuck on otherwise commercial Bay Ridge Ave, every time I walk by it, it's packed! So much for the better, though -- it's one of the few truly 'upscale' places in the area. The atmosphere inside is cozy and intimate (verging on uncomfortably crowded, but not quite). Service is leisurely but very friendly. We both went for the 3 course tasting menu, which looks to change weekly. Unfortunately the week we went the duck entree` wasn't on the menu, which is what I was looking forward to. The mussels appetizer was one of the better ones I've had (and I LOVE mussels) -- the broth was pefectly lush and garlicky. The roasted chicken was a bit on the salty side but not in an unappealing way, and the brussel sprouts on the side were perfect (I'd happily eat a plate of them alone). Dessert was homemade bread pudding -- you can't go wrong with that :)The open kitchen was fun to observe, and this place is truly a labor of love, so it pleases me to see it busy all the time. It's also one of the only places in the area that puts a focus on local, seasonal foods which is fantastic. I'm not sure if I'd travel from another borough to come here, but if you're a local you MUST try it. Looking forward to going back in the spring :)",4.0

"Petit Oven's restaurant space is simple. No Brooklyn-hip exposed brick or Edison light bulbs and no gimmicks. It's a small but comfortable space, with the two owners both running the front of the house and the kitchen. They let the food speak for itself - every dish I have tried there has been very good.

They have this price fixe that was super cheap for the quality of the food. The waitstaff is very friendly, the place is extremely romantic but it's tiny.

"Ready for this? Petit Oven is steadily becoming my MOST favorite restaurant in Bay Ridge. It's small, cozy, and comfortable. The kitchen is truly petit. But goodness... the FOOD that comes out of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We try to come here at least once a month, because the specials and pre-fixed menu is always an evolving, exotic french-style combinaton of the most delicious appetizers and entrees. For example, on last night's menu,  they had a MOST amazing fried eggplant cake with ricotta filling, and our entrees were a soft-as-butter braised pork in gravy and Medium-rare grilled crispy salmon with Russian Kale... the salmon was prbly the best piece I've had in a long, long time. Dessert? gosh. My baked banana crepe was on a bed of dark, cocoa chocolate cream and across from that was a bread pudding in a salted caramel to die for. Sometimes I wanna go back there into that Petit Oven and just give the Chef a big hug.",5.0
"Intimate, delicious, absolutely friendly: love this place! Petit Oven brings Manhattan-style quality to the urban 'burbs of Bay Ridge.

"Waited for about an hour for appetizers then another hour for the main course.The waitress didn't even apologize .The appetizers were pretty good, but the main course just okay. Looks cozy from the outside but, tends to get very loud because the place is so small. I would not . come back",3.0
"Stopped in for a light meal.  Since I am already in love with the prefix menu, we went a la carte.  We started with the fromage plate of French cows milk cream, butter Brie, and homemade ricotta with honey and toasted almonds.  We chased that with the tomatoes done 4 ways:  spicy gazpacho, tomato confit, fried heirloom tomato, and a blt like you've never had.   We conserved some room by splitting a light but tasty entree of crispy fried wild stripped bass over spinach stuffed ravioli.Finally, we indulged in their caramel bread pudding.  This dish is all about the sauce. They should bottle it, make it illegal and sell it on the corner.  This caramel sauce can put an end to the world's drug problem.  There would be peace in the streets of Mexico.  This place is just great.",5.0
"Petit Oven's restaurant space is simple. No Brooklyn-hip exposed brick or Edison light bulbs and no gimmicks. It's a small but comfortable space, with the two owners both running the front of the house and the kitchen. They let the food speak for itself - every dish I have tried there has been very good. I have never left Petit Oven wondering whether or not I just paid for a restaurant's hip decor rather than the quality of food when I pay my check. It feels like the owners started their restaurant for the right reasons which always results in the type of dining experience I really value.",5.0
"What a lovely little spot!  I really like small restaurants where you can see the care and attention paid to each customer and each plate of food.  This place is like that.  The food was fabulous.  My husband and I each got the three course tasting menu.  I had the tomato, watermelon, goat cheese salad;  He had the chilled corn bisque.  The salad was perfect.  It was simple so all of the flavors were allowed to shine.  And the tomatoes were so fresh!  The corn bisque was smooth and creamy.  For the main course we each had the homemade linguini with tomatoes and olives.  I LOVE fresh pasta and this pasta was done perfectly.  A little bite; just the perfect vehicle for that delicious, salty, sauce.  YUM!  Finally, for dessert, I had the bread pudding and my husband had the chocolate creme brule.  Both exceptional.The waitress was attentive and helpful, and from my seat I could watch the kitchen:  The chef was smiling.  I love that!  I know that I left smiling too!  Can't wait to come back and bring some friends.",4.0

"What a great, cute, charming little place. My wife and I live a couple of blocks away and were meaning to try it out when it first opened. It looked so cozy inside especially on a cold night.

"Overall, this is my favorite restaurant in Bay Ridge. Definitely top 5 for anywhere. This is based on eating at lots of restaurants in Manhattan, DC and Boston, MANY of which were MORE expensive than Petit Oven.The food is FRESH. The ingredients are seasonal, local and FRESH. The preparation is clean (not overdone with lots of extra ingredients), creative and done to order. No pots sitting around getting old in that kitchen!And the dishes themselves are delicious! Everything is seasonal, so the menu changes all the time. My favorite was probably a sole that literally melted in my mouth. It was so tender but not because it was drowned in sauce - you could absolutely taste the fish itself and it was perfect. And their roasted or braised chicken... chicken sounds so boring, but you don't realize how good and flavorful the meat itself can be when it is raised right and sourced locally! They ask you how you want the salmon done because it is fresh enough to be cooked medium rare and taste AMAZING. I also had a cassoulet once that was delicious and hearty - perfect for cold weather.I haven't even mentioned appetizers and dessert. The eggplant napoleon is CRAZY good and the bread pudding is probably the best I've had anywhere. I always get the prix-fixe tasting menu, which is a steal at $35. It's downright absurd on Wednesdays for $25. The a la carte entrees may be bigger (and are still very reasonably priced for what you are getting), but the tasting menu entrees are just slightly less than you would expect if you were having one course. With three courses, I always leave FULL (but not unhealthy/sick feeling).Great wine list. Awesome music in the background. Intimate feel. Locally owned. It really just doesn't get better.",5.0
"Until February 2011, I had always had good experiences at the Petit Oven-- sure the food takes a while, and it's pricey, but the food is excellent and I've always enjoyed it. That's why I chose it for a special occasion, my Valentine's gift to my boyfriend. We are on a budget, so it was a highly-anticipated night. I won't ever go back. Here's why: The owner/waitress called to confirm our reservation that day, I confirmed it. We drove around the area for 30 minutes looking for parking-- I am from Bay Ridge, I know parking isn't great, but since the Petit Oven is not usually open on Mondays but made an exception for Valentine's Day I thought maybe they'd have valet, and we left with enough time to park anyway. No matter, once we were ten minutes late I called the number that had called me to confirm the reservation just to let them know. I got no answer. Our reservation was at 8, we rolled in at 8:15. We were seated while a second waitress told the owner/waitress that we arrived. She came over at 8:17 (I had just checked my phone and noted the time) and said ""Hey guys, what time was your reservation?"" I told her 8. She looked at me very hard and said, ""It's 8:20."" I was taken aback by her tone and wasn't going to split hairs, so I apologized and said ""I am really sorry, we were looking for parking for a half hour."" She continued.  ""Well, you should have left earlier."" I was kind of shocked- and just stared at her, then found myself apologizing profusely. I mean-- she was so pissed, and though now I see that she was out of line at that moment I just found myself practically groveling. I get her point, it's a small place, but really-- it's not like we were an hour late and if staying on schedule on Valentine's Day means that 15 minutes is a deal breaker, maybe consider hiring a valet for the night. Just one night. But then she said ""You should have planned better, I mean, are you familiar with parking in Bay Ridge? Did you think about the fact that you'd have to park? You could have called us.""  I started to get angry. I didn't need to be reprimanded like a child, not over something like this. I stared her right in the eye and said ""In fact I am familiar, and in fact we did call you, there was no answer."" She challenged me and said ""What number did you call?"" Feeling like a criminal, I rattled off the first six numbers and told her there was no answer. She said ""That's my cell."" I said ""Well, I called you from whatever number you called me from today.""She persisted, and said we should have planned better. I was really angry, and said ""Should we leave?"" She said ""Oh, no, not at all!"" changing her attitude quickly. Against my better judgment, realizing we'd never get a table anywhere on Valentine's Day and knowing how much we had looked forward to this meal, we sat down, and I tried to move past it.We waited more than a 25-min/ half hour between courses which, while excessive, I understood given the size of the place, the fact that there is one cook and it's Valentine's Day. We didn't linger over the food but I noticed that as soon as our last bite was in our mouths the plates were immediately taken away, even though we found ourselves waiting for the next course for a while. Once, during my entree, before I'd even put my fork down they had taken my plate away. It was the bum's rush.Other diners lingered, and no tables turned over during the time we were there, but it seemed like we were being rushed-- the only ones being rushed. I tried to not feel paranoid, but it got pretty obvious, maybe it was our lateness, maybe it was my standing up for myself, but though she had told us we should stay, the owner/waitress' actions showed otherwise. No other diners moved. We don't drink, but they lingered over their meals and wine without there seeming to be a problem at all. Without asking us, our check was dropped-- no ""can I get you anything else,"" nothing. I felt for sure then as I had felt all along: that being 15 minutes late had in some way taken away our right to courteous service. It was over $100 for the two of us, no alcohol. Not a cheap meal. I laid out the cash and as I stood up, the owner/waitress came over, took the check, and as I stood there putting on my coat cleared our table. I was still at it.  She didn't acknowledge me in any way, no ""Thanks guys"" as she grabbed the money or ""Have a good night"" or even an ""Excuse me"" as she edged me out of the way to lay out the new settings. I was so disappointed. I've hesitated about posting this review because I know it's a small place and I hadn't had an issue there before, but it was that kind of awful experience that ruins a place for you. A night we had been looking forward to was ruined-- because of 15 minutes-- or, more likely, because the owner/waitress was having a bad day, and we bore the brunt of it. Petit Oven, you've lost a customer, and when asked for my opinion of your place, sadly, this is the memory you've left me with.",1.0

"What a fantastic little gem!  Katarzyna, the exec chef is fantastic. She's very well trained in French cuisine and sticks to amazingly prepared classics. The portions are great and the quality of ingredients... simply fantastic. The menu is very small, but changes seasonally. Every item is worth having and I heard they do mussels on Thursdays. It's not a good place for dessert, so skip the sweets. Order extra wine and cheese and enjoy!The exec chef is friendly and visible. She often comes out to talk to guests and takes requests herself. The server is a VERY friendly and knowledgeable young lady who makes everyone feel right at home. The space itself is very tiny and well decorated. A GREAT spot for a romantic dinner. It's quiet and cozy. The prices are more than reasonable, bordering on inexpensive. The beer/wine list is sufficient for a small bistro, though wouldn't cut it in Manhattan. However, it's so not in Manhattan. It's fantastic! It's completely off the main street (3rd Ave) and very private.Definitely worth a visit or two or five.

"After losing our favorite French restaurant (sorry you had to close Village), my wife and I finally decided to venture out and explore the world (well, city) for another French restaurant that we can form new memories from.  Mind you, we are just a couple of low key people so we weren't looking for a place with panache to make our ""every month"" staple.  Low and behold we hear of this wonderful place, which is coincidentally right around the corner from us.  When we walked into the restaurant, we knew the place had potential to be our next.  Even though the place was not expansive, combined with the light illumination from candles, Petit Oven exuded a feel of closeness and romanticism that we yearned for these past months for our date nights. The pictures placed around were simple and added to the feel of the place.  The chef was readily available to converse with the guests, allowing for a personal touch not found in many restaurants.  The menu was not terribly large, but that ensures that each item on it would be treated with the utmost respect and prepared deliciously, which they were.  For starters, we shared the special of the day, which was lobster and very tasty combined with the corn.  My wife ordered the duck and I ordered the wild bass.  The duck was crusted beautifully and cooked just right.  My bass was cooked slightly too long but still very delicious, as was the spinach ravioli.  As for the dessert, the very nice waitress suggested the bread pudding, which was the perfect end to the meal.Though the prices are not typical for the area, Petit Oven is one of the best restaurants you can go to.  We will definitely go again some time soon and create new experiences that we will both remember.",4.0
"Delicious food, excellent choices by the chef. She really knows her way around the American and French palette and serves up French food for the American tastebuds. Wine was excellent, fromage was paired with elegant garnishes, duck was cooked perfectly. Turnip had an amazing kick, kale was earthy and yummy, smashed potatoes had a olive oil taste. A really great meal.Only one suggestion - they probably should give the place a little makeover. Food that good she be in a prettier place. Just a little more attention to the chairs/table/overall look of the place would allow me to give it a 5 star rating. It's not awful, but the interior did not knock my socks off. Waitstaff is wonderful. Friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Will def go back.",4.0

Yes.   Does it take a while (sometimes a long while) to be served?  Yes.   But, but...   Honestly, that's everything I look for.  I like attentive service, but hate to be rushed.   If you need something, the waitress or owner is there to respond (since the space is small she really can't go too far).    It is a cozy, intimate, even bohemian, spot where you can bring a date, a spouse, the family or just goof around with friends.  With all that, it is the food that keeps you coming back.  The food is top-notch.   It is The Grocery-style dining right in Bay Ridge.    On offer is a seasonal menu done just right and comparable to anything in Manhattan or the brownstone Brooklyn nabes.",5.0
"I love this place.  In Bay Ridge, I can't say there are many high cuisine... and this place is IT.  Don't go in expecting large portion sizes.  This little place has high quality food, cooked perfectly.  I've had many main courses from pasta dishes to duck, to pork belly (Divine) - and am impressed. love that it's in our neighborhood and don't need to trek elsewhere.",4.0
the duck is okayy..but the fish so salt ...maybe that day we came so late and they almost close... thats why the food it not as good as what i see on yelp !!,3.0
"After losing our favorite French restaurant (sorry you had to close Village), my wife and I finally decided to venture out and explore the world (well, city) for another French restaurant that we can form new memories from.  Mind you, we are just a couple of low key people so we weren't looking for a place with panache to make our ""every month"" staple.  Low and behold we hear of this wonderful place, which is coincidentally right around the corner from us.  When we walked into the restaurant, we knew the place had potential to be our next.  Even though the place was not expansive, combined with the light illumination from candles, Petit Oven exuded a feel of closeness and romanticism that we yearned for these past months for our date nights. The pictures placed around were simple and added to the feel of the place.  The chef was readily available to converse with the guests, allowing for a personal touch not found in many restaurants.  The menu was not terribly large, but that ensures that each item on it would be treated with the utmost respect and prepared deliciously, which they were.  For starters, we shared the special of the day, which was lobster and very tasty combined with the corn.  My wife ordered the duck and I ordered the wild bass.  The duck was crusted beautifully and cooked just right.  My bass was cooked slightly too long but still very delicious, as was the spinach ravioli.  As for the dessert, the very nice waitress suggested the bread pudding, which was the perfect end to the meal.Though the prices are not typical for the area, Petit Oven is one of the best restaurants you can go to.  We will definitely go again some time soon and create new experiences that we will both remember.",4.0
"Delicious food, excellent choices by the chef. She really knows her way around the American and French palette and serves up French food for the American tastebuds. Wine was excellent, fromage was paired with elegant garnishes, duck was cooked perfectly. Turnip had an amazing kick, kale was earthy and yummy, smashed potatoes had a olive oil taste. A really great meal.Only one suggestion - they probably should give the place a little makeover. Food that good she be in a prettier place. Just a little more attention to the chairs/table/overall look of the place would allow me to give it a 5 star rating. It's not awful, but the interior did not knock my socks off. Waitstaff is wonderful. Friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Will def go back.",4.0

"One of a handful, if not the only, restaurant that is focusing on organic, hormone & antibiotic-free, farm -to-table fare. Our party enjoyed the free-range oven roasted chicken, prime rib and homemade fettuccine - all of which were exquisite!The also have an amazing wine selection and excellent service in a great cozy atmosphere. We'll definitely be back.",5.0
This is a hidden treasure. A small and quaint french restaurant in Bayridge. The jalapeno ceviche and truffle fettucini were out of this world. A truly delicious meal and great service.,4.0
"Seriously Amazing. Honestly it seems as if people just don't get it these days - food is just not as good as it should be - but here, here THEY JUST GET IT. the chef is AMAZING - she cooked everything made to order herself and you can taste the goodness. Each day the menu evolves as each day she would get new food from the farmers market and create the menu based on the fresh order. Its a small personal place and the waitress is friendly and very great with helping you order. I love to go in and try EVERYTHING that is how AMAZING this place is. We frequent it often just because it doesn't get any better than this. I love Petit Oven.",5.0

"Petit Oven is not for you if you're looking for a quick bite in the neighborhood.Very cozy little place with a lot of delicate features.  Service was good and friendly, yet not pestering.  Like fellow yelpers mentioned, the place is very chilled and slow-paced.  I spent more than two hours dining there, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We both had the three-course tasting menu.  I personally enjoyed the appetizers more than the entrees.  Had the bruschetta and the gnocchi, both were excellent.  I had the duck confit, which was a little dry, and my date had the slow roasted pork.  For dessert, we had the chocolate cake and the bread pudding.  Both were very good, I was more partial to the chocolate cake, as the ice cream that came with the bread pudding was a little too nutty for my likings.Overall it was a great dining experience, loved the laid-back atmosphere with the soft relaxing music.",4.0
After coming to this place many times they have never disappointed me. The serves is wonderful and the food is delicious. It's a bit expensive but well worth the money I will be coming here again hungry for more!,5.0
"Bay Ridge's best kept secret, should not be a secret any longer. Petit Oven, a French/American Restaurant on Bay Ridge Avenue near 3rd Ave (in Brooklyn) may very well be the dining experience you've been waiting for. Kat (the owner and chef) is an artist in her open-air kitchen! Do not question it. Just sit back, relax and allow her to take your taste buds on a mouth-watering journey. Soft music, including some French tunes, will be the background to your conversation. Nicole, co-owner and maître d', will make your dining experience a pleasurable one. The courses are elegantly paced out and you have plenty of time in between them to enjoy your conversation and savor the tastes. The menu is not vast and changes monthly, but a quality peak! I would also like to add, that this wonderful little eatery will not please finicky eaters but will absolutely tantalize my fellow foodies who do not like to be bombarded with a ton of ""Can I get you anything else's"" and ""Are you doing okay's"". You will have the time to relax and slowly enjoy - much like in France. You will not feel chased out and pressured, as I often tend to feel in restaurants.I urge you to check out this wonderful, reasonably priced, restaurant that celebrated its One Year Anniversary this week. You will not regret or forget it. I will definitely be coming back in no time.I strongly recommend reservations and please check out their website, petit-oven.com .",5.0
"This is a great place to go when you want to enjoy your food and your company. It can definitely be a very romantic place.

"Food is ok, but takes FOREVER to be served. Waited an hour and a half and only had bread and an appetizer before almost walking out when the entrees finally arrived. My wife really didn't enjoy her meal, and after waiting an hour and a half to get to the entree, it was a bit hard to enjoy mine as well. The dessert took another 20 minutes and was just ok. So all in all, two hours of my life I'm never getting back and I will not be going back Petit Oven. Well, I tried.",2.0

"Delicious!! We ordered Mussels, cheese dish and potato latke for Appetzers. It was all good but the potato Latke with salmon tartar was a real standout. The duck breast we got was also yammi, it melted in your mouth. I really wanted to try their bread pudding since I heard it was also good, but didn't have enough space in my belly. Highly recommend this place, also very romantic.",4.0

"When I first moved to Bay Ridge a year ago all I saw as dining options was a crap load of menus that magically ended up under my door and little rinky-dinky joints that specialized in drunk smokers lingering by the front door. But my neighbor introduced me to Petite Oven .... and can I just say .... ""Thank you Jesus!"" A lovely little farm to table nook is just what I wanted as a house warming present. The bread has a great rustic taste to it .... and yes the butter is salty smooth. And yes it's all gone before we get to order our drinks. The wine menu is wisely selected and moderate in price ... you can order a bottle or two without sacrificing the rest of your menu options. The salmon tartar on potato pancakes is suburb. The duck is oh so good and even the steak is cooked to a nice medium rare (as I requested ... Merci). The only issue I had was on Valentine's Day I dined their and half my order of mussels were either closed shut or barely open, to avoid possible food poisoning I reluctantly pushed more than half of my mussels to the side. And the seafood dish I ordered, the clams were closed and the mussels were barely open. Right beside me an elderly gentleman was trying to pry his clam open with a butter knife (I really wanted to shriek and warn him of the dangers of eating it but more of a ""please do not cut your hand off"")!  As I set aside half my dinner .... I settled into a wonderful dessert. The staff is warm and knowledgeable of the menu, I take their recommendations as genuine. I frequent here often but I personally lay off of the shellfish, I have had food poisoning before (NOT HERE!) and I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies. But do not be shy, come and see what this yummy nook has in store for you.",4.0
"My husband is French and since we moved to Bay Ridge 9 years ago we gave up looking for French food in the area for sometimes now, then came Petit Oven. It has the best French fusion around.

We have been to many because we are foodies but I have to say the level of the food and service at Petit is a great value compare to many.

"I am so happy to have found this little gem! We ate here last night and were so impressed with our service, meal and the special vibe the restaurant had to offer. We made 8:45pm reservations, luckily found parking very easily at that time, and stepped into an intimate restaurant that smelled like heaven. The decor is super cute, not kitschy, very clean and giving off a very Parisian theme.  Our waitress was great, very knowledgeable about the menu and steered us in the right direction. The menu is perfection...anything you might want from duck to to steak to sweet potato gnocchi and different types of fish. The salads were divine, perfectly thought out and dressed very nicely. The wine menu is, again, fabulous, a great Pinot Noir and Bordeaux...our waitress was also extremely helpful with descriptions to help us choose a bottle that would compliment our meal. There's a half open kitchen which is fun because you can see how focused the chef's are behind the scenes. There were 2 waitresses working the dining room, both were extremely funny, sweet and attentive. We eat out often and it's always interesting to see how the staff works with (or sometimes against!) each other, and you get the sense that these people enjoy working here. Our dessert was an item listed as a special and was the perfect way to end a perfect meal. Every single item was ordered was cooked to absolute perfection and very delicious. At the end, the very kind chef came out to send us off, which was a treat considering we were witness to how hard she had worked throughout the night.

"There is no restaurant in Park Slope, Bay Ridge or on Smith Street that can compare to this place.  It's around the corner from me and it's like an answered prayer.  For as many restaurants as there are in Bay Ridge, most of them are for the steak and hamburger crowd.  The delicate flavorings and freshness of the food at Petit Oven are an amazing addition to this neighborhood.  (They even make their own butter.)  The service is fine.  I eat there once a week and have never had to try and get the servers attention, and the chef is usually the one to come out and ask you if you're enjoying your food.  Don't ask for pepper or extra cheese in this place!  Cat, the chef, tastes the food 4 times before it gets to your table.    The food here is wholesome and for more refined palates.  If you're looking for the biggest steak you can find, or a big messy chicken or shrimp parmesan (ugh--who invented that dish anyway?)--this is not the place for you.  For $35 the tasting menu of appetizer, entree and dessert leave a normal appetite more than satisfied, and is a bargain when you consider the quality and ingredients.  Great wine list and even the background music is wonderfully unique.",5.0
