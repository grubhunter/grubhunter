It had been a very very very long time since I had had any Thai in NYC 1. Because I am always in Manhattan and let's face it there are tons of Thai restaurants 2. Because I had a terrible experience at song.That being said Joya converted me back. I walked in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with my mom and sister. We were absolutely delighted with the food. I was extremely impressed by the flavored and quality of food. Not to mention how reasonably priced their menu is. Some of my favorites are pad see ew (I wish they made this with shrimp I'll ask next time I'm there) spicy seafood fried rice and of course the pad Thai. The calamari is super fresh and yummy. My mom couldn't stop raving about how fresh it tasted and how you could tell their oil wasn't super old and overused. On another occasion my husband ordered the chicken garlic entree with the jasmine rice... Super scrumptious!! Go to Joya!I can't wait to go back again! Not cash only anymore :),5.0
Typically had great experiences at this Thai Place but the first time I met rude owner Andrew will be the last time I eat here. I was absolutely embarrassed and mortified when he told my children they can't sit at the booth because they would ruin the furniture. This is not a child friendly restaurant. I wonder if this is a store policy for all children?,1.0
"This is one of my close friends favorite places. I am not a huge fan but the food is good for the most part. I think that my biggest grievance here is the service, its OK and that's it. I have been here at least 4 times and that is the general vibe I get. They plaster on smiles and just try and get people in and out. I do think it is partially a language barrier, as most the staff I have interacted with had heavy accents and did not seem to be native English speakers.Again the food is decent and if you are craving Thai and in the neighbor is not the worst stop that you could make.",3.0
"I really enjoyed Joya.To start, the ambiance, tables, lighting, etc. is great. This place is CLEAN and classy - perfect for date night. Or just any kind of nice dinner, I suppose.We ordered a large order of calamari ($12) - the thai chili sauce it came with was delicious and the portion was huge. Unfortunately, the calamari itself wasn't the tastiest. It was a little on the chewy/tasteless side. But nonetheless, it was good for the price. And smothering the calamari in the yummy sauce helped.We shared on thai iced tea - so good. The flavors were on point and it came in a large glass, so it was perfect for sharing. As an entree, I ordered the Kang Masaman - chicken curry with zucchini, peppers, carrots. It came with a good portion of rice. It was spicy and hd a lot of flavors. I've never been a fan of cooked carrots, so I took those out, but everything else was good. I probably would not order this again, but I am happy I tried it. I have leftovers for dinner tomorrow night :)My boyfriend enjoyed his entree as well - something with brown sauce, chili paste and shrimp. Our bill was about $44 with tip. Not bad. I look forward to coming back and trying some noodles.",4.0
"Just came here and was so disappointed. I've been coming here for years and now, they have changed their food's flavor profile to mostly sweet and salty. No spiciness whatsoever when we order something specifically called ""spicy squid noodles."" Thai food is supposed to be spicy. Also, multiple bowls of rice and their fried rice was cooked totally wrong. It was hard and disgusting.",2.0
"Amazing food! I don't live in Brooklyn so I'm not familiar with this place, but my cousin lives around the corner and says the food is always really good.... I shared an appetizer with him and it was fried shrimp with a good sauce on the side. I ordered a dish and it had chicken and I think potatoes, with a coconut curry sauce. It wasn't spicy and it wasn't too sweet. I ate the whole thing, and it was a good sized bowl with rice on a separate plate. There was a lot of the curry sauce and the consistency was like a broth. I just took the spoon and a lot of the sauce on it as well as the chicken and ate it that way. I guess you could put the rice in the bowl and eat it like more of a soup if you wanted. My cousin ordered noodles with beef and some vegetables. The noodles weren't in the classic spaghetti shape. I could've eaten his plate too. If you're going to have wine, you're better off ordering a bottle instead of by the glass if you want a couple glasses. Also, we called to make a reservation and since they were so busy they said we had to come in and put a name on the list and wait there. Very very busy but obviously for a reason. The wait was worth it, but it's just something to keep in mind. Maybe they take reservations over the phone when it's less busy. Definitely looking forward to eating from here again.",4.0
"So very happy we decided to try this place. Just a couple stops away from home so we ventured out into the cold to get our Thai fix. Definitely not disappointed.To start, we had summer rolls. I would skip this. The sauce it comes with seemed ill fitting and there was nothing particularly good about this appetizer..On to the entrees:We ordered two specials: the prawn pad Thai with avocado and the chicken (white meat) panang (I think) curry with flat noodles. SO delicious. Both of them.I wanted to lick the plates and order two more entrees. I really really had to exercise all the self control in me not to order more.Service was decent and interior was nice. Looked fairly clean, though the dishes and silverware were kinda dirty-- expected anywhere you eat out. The space is a sort of long railroad-style resto. I think there are individual bathrooms, but the place isn't that big so I don't think they'd need to have multiple stalls. The bar is in the front and the dining area extends and opens up as you walk further in.Definitely will return and order a different app. Can't wait for the mains, yum!",4.0
"We went here because of soo many friends suggesting it and they were right!Other posted pics are accurate. If your not looking for it you will miss it. Clean, fresh, friendly and great Thai food. We got Calamari, it's a light batter and needs the sauce they give. We also got Shrimp Pad Thai and Spicy Seafood Fried Rice, both were great!Bar is basic, no great deals or great beers. They have outdoor seating in the back and would love to come back when that's open. Bathroom is sharp and clean. Prices for what we got were reasonable. $29 for the 3 dishes and we took a Togo bag. We will go back!",5.0
"I love joya. The food is cheap and the drinks are good. I'm pretty sure they're cash only, though. I wish they had other kinds of red wine by the glass. We ordered mojitos and they were very good, not too sweet. My boyfriend and I ordered the fried calamari. It came with a sweet sauce that had hot pepper flakes, which gave it a bit of a kick. It was delicious. We shared the spicy noodles with chicken and a beef stir fry dish with vegetables in a chili basil sauce. The noodles were amazing! They weren't too spicy. The other beef dish was also delicious. I loved the variety of vegetables and it just had so much flavor. Overall, joya is a great place for dinner with drinks.",4.0
"The decor is industrial-chic with simple, clean lines - we loved Joya the moment we stepped in. I always judge an Asian restaurant by how it executes the pork, and was impressed by the tender, juicy and lean slices in my pad see ew. The BF loved his pad thai, and his chicken was just as tender. The lunch prices are very reasonable, while the portion size is more dinner-like. I had plenty of leftover noodles to take home, but devoured all the yummy pork and leafy greens in one sitting, ha.",4.0
"Let me start with saying I have being spoiled by Somtum Der, which was recently awarded a one Michelin star, and all the other amazing Thai places in Manhattan (Kiin Thai eatery, Pinto, etc.). I have certain standard for Thai - basically just that I don't like bland Thai dishes. SO if my review sounds overly hash, do my a favor, go eat at Somtum Der. After watching a movie nearby, we did our research and decided to give this place a try. We got here around 6:30pm on a Saturday night, it was already pretty busy. Luckily a table was just leaving so we only had to wait for a little over 5min to be seated. We got the Thai spare ribs, spicy noodle with shrimp and pad thai with chicken. Thai spare ribs were very well flavored, meat was juicy and tender and fell right off the bone. Unfortunately, it just went downhill from there. My spicy noodle was a complete failure: (1) it was not spicy AT ALL, (2) it lacked the complex flavors from Thai dishes I'm used to, and (3) shrimp in there was definitely NOT fresh and it had certain ammonia after taste. To be fair, our waiter did ask whether I wanted spicy sauces, so I guess at least they acknowledge that ""spicy noodle"" was not spicy. Pad Thai, in comparison to spicy noodle, was better. Instead of being bland, it was overly vinegary. I've never tasted any Pad Thai being that sour. Once again, not trying to sound like a snob, but this proves my theory that due to lack of competition in BK, I need to discount ratings by at least one star for a restaurant. In this particular case, a four-star Thai place in Cobble Hill is probably equivalent to a 2 star in Manhattan.The positive? Two drinks, one appetizer and two entrees, the total bill with tip was less than $70. THAT is something Manhattan cannot compete with. But I'd rather pay up and enjoy something way better.",2.0
This place is usually a good time. My favorite dish is the drunk noddles with shrimp and I get it with extra egg and no vegetables. The calamari is also pretty good here.

The food is very inexpensive and our bill came out to under $40 for three meals, plus my drink! This place has good food for cheap. My only peeve was that since we sat outside we were greeted by mosquitoes, bees, and flies. Not exactly the most pleasant eating experience.

"I live close to a Thai neighborhood in Queens but I still wish Joya is closer to me.

If it was next to the courtroom, I think I would gone to Joya even more!I went to Joya for lunch one day because we had a really long lunch break during jury duty. It is about a 15 minute brisk walk to Joya from the Brooklyn U.S. District Courthouse at Cadman Plaza East, according to Google Maps, it's .8 miles from the courthouse. I sat down and when the waitress gave me the menu...I didn't see a lunch menu, so I asked if there were lunch specials. She pointed to the menu and used her finger to indicate some of the items have lunch specials but she was not really specific!!!! I think she said the lunch entree includes a soup or salad. When she said this, I couldn't even comprehend what she was saying because she was mumbling. I could not tell if she said soup AND salad or soup OR salad. I found out the entree only comes with one or the other because I got only the soup. There was no other customers around so why is service so bad?!! They really need to print out some lunch special menus. The waitress didn't even mention how much the lunch special is. I didn't even know how much it was until the bill came, $10.02 including tax. Lunch service is haphazard. It's pretty annoying. They are just lucky I love the food or I would never come back! I am not a person who even likes Pad Thai but I like it here. I've had the chicken and the tofu Pad Thai's at Joya and love both. I also had the Tom Ka soup with chicken which I loved. Next time I am going to try the Tom Ka with tofu. I am just not a fan of chicken in general but the chicken really doesn't add anything to the soup...matter of fact I thought it detracted from the soup. The Woon Sen was okay.

"A lot of Brooklyn patrons love coming here for Thai food... And while it's decent Thai food for Brooklyn... Queens still have me spoiled for better Thai cuisine where I'd rather hold off my cravings to troop to Queens. Btw; this is the sister store of Song which is also in Brooklyn and you can also find my review on them there!FRIED CALAMARI - calamari was chewy and rubbery.DUCK CURRY - w/ pad thai noodles and mixed vegetables, the curry flavor was pretty good but the duck was too dry and bland.BEEF MASSAMAN CURRY - again, the beef was extremely dry even more than the duck.. The massaman curry base was average.PAD SEE YUE - just like their sister store Song, their pad see yue is a true dish you can't go wrong from them. People loves it, and yes it was pretty good but the more we are it and got to the bottom of the plate it started to taste sweeter and sweeter.Slow service, nice modern ambience, good portion and inexpensive.",2.0
"I think this might be my favorite Thai place, period. I've been here a couple times in the past, but that was several years ago. I'm glad to see that there hasn't been a decline in food, service or overall ambiance! To start, we shared a small order of calamari. It was a perfect size for us. Though they looked a little light, they were flavorful and the sauce that went along with it was tasty. They were crispy and thankfully, there weren't too many tentacles. He had the massaman curry with jasmine rice and I had a beef pad see yu. This was the first place that I ever ordered this dish, and since then it has become my usual order. It was a large portion, especially for under $10! I definitely had to take some food home. The noodles didn't stick together, the beef was juicy and I didn't mind eating the veggies in it. I regret not ordering a Thai iced tea, but that just means I have a reason to come back. My boyfriend and I came in a little before 6, and there was no wait. Score! We were seated in the outdoor area, which was cozy. Since there weren't too many people around, it felt romantic. Service was good - we were checked up on several times (not that there were many people to look after). Our waters were full and our food came out pretty quickly. Our food was packed up quickly and they dropped off our check in a timely manner so we could get out of there.",5.0

"Joya, you definitely brought me JOY.Came here on a date on a Sunday night, and I have to say, the food led to great conversations and a great evening for me.First off, we started off on two appetizers of fried tofu and curry chicken puffs. I wasn't too keen on the fried tofu, but the curry chicken puffs were another story. I'm usually one for spices, but I didn't taste much curry in this dish, although that was easily forgivable since I'm a big fan of crispy puffs.  Our main course for that evening was chicken pad thai and massaman curry. As an ABC (American Born Chinese), I have had my fair share of Chinese, American- Chinese, Japanese, Thai and even Asian fusion under the sun. For me to say that I can enjoy Asian cuisine usually require a restaurant to amaze me. And Joya, passed the test. Their chicken pad thai was made with great flavors. Mildly sweet, not very oily, or even overtly salty, and they absolutely did not  skimp on their ingredients. They gave a large portion (fitting for two; yay for dates!), that at the end of the night, we have had to brown-bag it home. On the massaman curry with beef, another large portion with great distinctive flavor. Again, I'm big fan of spices, however, this curry can't be judged on its spice. It was smooth and mildly rich, perhaps from the use of coconut milk, and the beef was cooked perfectly so that every bite along with the potatoes made you crave for more.Overall, the ambience was nice. Hanging artsy light-bulbed lights with a touch of that Brooklyn feel that always draws the locals in.  Atmospheric setting that sits between formal and informal. They also have an outside patio for those summer months, however it was closed off that day due to rain.Would I come back? Yes; and that is coming a lot from a Queens girl.",4.0

"We ordered take-out from Joya, so this review is solely based on the food. You should know, if you're ordering take-out, they DO deliver! I have to say, I was really excited to try Joya because the menu looked very authentic and after living in Thailand for some time, I am always craving ""the real stuff"". We ordered multiple dishes: Som Tom: honestly, the worst green papaya salad I have ever had, and I don't say that lightly. I have made som tom at home several times and I honestly don't see how you can miss the flavors so extraordinarily. It was way too coconut sugar heavy and very light on fish sauce and citrus (lime) flavor. AND it was not spicy at all with no authentic dried shrimp. Very, very disappointing. Pad Thai: Also way too sweet! In Thailand you have the option of adding ""condiments"" to your pad thai: chili sauce, fish sauce, bean sprouts and sugar. It tasted like Joya's version of pad thai had sugar all over it. Woon Sen: glass noodles with chicken and egg, the dish was okay, but nothing to write home about. Spicy Noodles i.e Drunken Noodles: not an authentic Thai dish but definitely the best entree that I tried! I would order this dish again, but definitely increase the spice. I was shocked at lacking in the spiciness factor all of our dishes were.",3.0
Oh oh- back to three-star status- and I'm being generous.  They're destroying the consistency of the food at this well-known establishment-Once again the prices of been raised the quality of the food and the portions have gone down.  This used to be an excellent Thai restaurant but now- after this evening's meal I somehow doubt that I'll be back.this was our go to place for the last three years for Thai food.  The quality and the recipes are inconsistent now and it's very sad to see a favorite restaurant go down the drain.,3.0
"I come to this restaurant at least 3-4 times a month and it's been a good experience until today I walk in and was disrespected by the owner himself. I walked in with my friends and sat in a table because that's what I do most of the time since the employees are so busy and can't seat everyone. The owner walks up to me and says ""This is my restaurant, don't walk in here like you own this place."" Excuse me? Then he tells us to sit at another table. I could not believe this is the owner talking me like this. Is this how you treat your customers? Even if he wasn't the owner he has no right to speak to a customer like this. I felt too disrespected to stay there another minute. Not coming back to this restaurant again & if I knew the owner was such an unprofessional A'hole I would have never came. Good luck to this nasty, unhappy man with a disgusting attitude on running his business. You just lost a loyal customer",1.0
"This was a wonderful, reasonable Thai place with good service and quality food.We had a special of roast duck with red curry, which featured some scrumptious and moist duck that was good but not life changing. The noodles and vegetables were also great.The pad see ew was really great though.

It was quick service, but our waitress wasn't very personable. She showed up to take the order, and we didn't see her again until we got the check. The bus boys deserved the tip more.

"A lot of Brooklyn patrons love coming here for Thai food... And while it's decent Thai food for Brooklyn... Queens still have me spoiled for better Thai cuisine where I'd rather hold off my cravings to troop to Queens. Btw; this is the sister store of Song which is also in Brooklyn and you can also find my review on them there!FRIED CALAMARI - calamari was chewy and rubbery.DUCK CURRY - w/ pad thai noodles and mixed vegetables, the curry flavor was pretty good but the duck was too dry and bland.BEEF MASSAMAN CURRY - again, the beef was extremely dry even more than the duck.. The massaman curry base was average.PAD SEE YUE - just like their sister store Song, their pad see yue is a true dish you can't go wrong from them. People loves it, and yes it was pretty good but the more we are it and got to the bottom of the plate it started to taste sweeter and sweeter.Slow service, nice modern ambience, good portion and inexpensive.",2.0
"I think this might be my favorite Thai place, period. I've been here a couple times in the past, but that was several years ago. I'm glad to see that there hasn't been a decline in food, service or overall ambiance! To start, we shared a small order of calamari. It was a perfect size for us. Though they looked a little light, they were flavorful and the sauce that went along with it was tasty. They were crispy and thankfully, there weren't too many tentacles. He had the massaman curry with jasmine rice and I had a beef pad see yu. This was the first place that I ever ordered this dish, and since then it has become my usual order. It was a large portion, especially for under $10! I definitely had to take some food home. The noodles didn't stick together, the beef was juicy and I didn't mind eating the veggies in it. I regret not ordering a Thai iced tea, but that just means I have a reason to come back. My boyfriend and I came in a little before 6, and there was no wait. Score! We were seated in the outdoor area, which was cozy. Since there weren't too many people around, it felt romantic. Service was good - we were checked up on several times (not that there were many people to look after). Our waters were full and our food came out pretty quickly. Our food was packed up quickly and they dropped off our check in a timely manner so we could get out of there.",5.0
Likely my favorite thai restaurant i've been to in the city.The food is great and the ambiance is cool. Usually Im a pad see ew guy but I can't resist their pad thai. All the other food I've tasted has been great as well.,5.0
"Joya, you definitely brought me JOY.Came here on a date on a Sunday night, and I have to say, the food led to great conversations and a great evening for me.First off, we started off on two appetizers of fried tofu and curry chicken puffs. I wasn't too keen on the fried tofu, but the curry chicken puffs were another story. I'm usually one for spices, but I didn't taste much curry in this dish, although that was easily forgivable since I'm a big fan of crispy puffs.  Our main course for that evening was chicken pad thai and massaman curry. As an ABC (American Born Chinese), I have had my fair share of Chinese, American- Chinese, Japanese, Thai and even Asian fusion under the sun. For me to say that I can enjoy Asian cuisine usually require a restaurant to amaze me. And Joya, passed the test. Their chicken pad thai was made with great flavors. Mildly sweet, not very oily, or even overtly salty, and they absolutely did not  skimp on their ingredients. They gave a large portion (fitting for two; yay for dates!), that at the end of the night, we have had to brown-bag it home. On the massaman curry with beef, another large portion with great distinctive flavor. Again, I'm big fan of spices, however, this curry can't be judged on its spice. It was smooth and mildly rich, perhaps from the use of coconut milk, and the beef was cooked perfectly so that every bite along with the potatoes made you crave for more.Overall, the ambience was nice. Hanging artsy light-bulbed lights with a touch of that Brooklyn feel that always draws the locals in.  Atmospheric setting that sits between formal and informal. They also have an outside patio for those summer months, however it was closed off that day due to rain.Would I come back? Yes; and that is coming a lot from a Queens girl.",4.0
"Wow! This place is the best! All the food are so good, and we were just surprised!!Specially, fried calamari and fried rice are amazing! You'll love it! It's worth going from Manhattan! Please try!!!",5.0
"We ordered take-out from Joya, so this review is solely based on the food. You should know, if you're ordering take-out, they DO deliver! I have to say, I was really excited to try Joya because the menu looked very authentic and after living in Thailand for some time, I am always craving ""the real stuff"". We ordered multiple dishes: Som Tom: honestly, the worst green papaya salad I have ever had, and I don't say that lightly. I have made som tom at home several times and I honestly don't see how you can miss the flavors so extraordinarily. It was way too coconut sugar heavy and very light on fish sauce and citrus (lime) flavor. AND it was not spicy at all with no authentic dried shrimp. Very, very disappointing. Pad Thai: Also way too sweet! In Thailand you have the option of adding ""condiments"" to your pad thai: chili sauce, fish sauce, bean sprouts and sugar. It tasted like Joya's version of pad thai had sugar all over it. Woon Sen: glass noodles with chicken and egg, the dish was okay, but nothing to write home about. Spicy Noodles i.e Drunken Noodles: not an authentic Thai dish but definitely the best entree that I tried! I would order this dish again, but definitely increase the spice. I was shocked at lacking in the spiciness factor all of our dishes were.",3.0
Oh oh- back to three-star status- and I'm being generous.  They're destroying the consistency of the food at this well-known establishment-Once again the prices of been raised the quality of the food and the portions have gone down.  This used to be an excellent Thai restaurant but now- after this evening's meal I somehow doubt that I'll be back.this was our go to place for the last three years for Thai food.  The quality and the recipes are inconsistent now and it's very sad to see a favorite restaurant go down the drain.,3.0
"I come to this restaurant at least 3-4 times a month and it's been a good experience until today I walk in and was disrespected by the owner himself. I walked in with my friends and sat in a table because that's what I do most of the time since the employees are so busy and can't seat everyone. The owner walks up to me and says ""This is my restaurant, don't walk in here like you own this place."" Excuse me? Then he tells us to sit at another table. I could not believe this is the owner talking me like this. Is this how you treat your customers? Even if he wasn't the owner he has no right to speak to a customer like this. I felt too disrespected to stay there another minute. Not coming back to this restaurant again & if I knew the owner was such an unprofessional A'hole I would have never came. Good luck to this nasty, unhappy man with a disgusting attitude on running his business. You just lost a loyal customer",1.0
"This was a wonderful, reasonable Thai place with good service and quality food.We had a special of roast duck with red curry, which featured some scrumptious and moist duck that was good but not life changing. The noodles and vegetables were also great.The pad see ew was really great though. The chicken that came with it was nothing to write home about but the noodles and bok choy were amazing and really made my evening. The service was very prompt and this place worked great for a quick dinner before going to an event at Bookcourt down the street",4.0

"This review is strictly on the service. I would first like to mention that I have been coming to this restaurant for approximately ten years. It has always been one of my favorites due to the cheap prices and the quality food. But in my most recent experience, I had a run in with the ""owner/manager"" and he was very unpleasant. I am assuming that management was changed a few years ago. My co-workers reserved a table and I was supposed to meet them soon after work. When I showed up, I sat at the table and asked the waitress for another round of drinks for the table and an appetizer. She hesitated and stated she had to ask the manager because my party had been there already without me, it may be an issue to add something after the fact. After about five minutes she proceeded to take the order. Then I told her I was ready to order my dinner, she told me no and I asked to speak to the manager. The man came to the table, very unprofessional, asking what is the problem? I explained my concern, stated I was with my party, I had already ordered drinks and appetizer and wanted to order my entree. He said I would have to put my name on a list because there were guest waiting to be seated and we had been there for too long. I was confused because I didn't see a timed policy and either way, We were still spending our money on drinks and food. He then stated "" my house my rules, I would not come into your house and tell you what to do, so don't try in my house"". This is a very twisted mindset from a restaurant owner especially because this is a business, not your house, and you aren't doing me a favor, because I am spending my money. Needless to say, I asked him for the check and said cancel my orders, we will not be returning. he then stated ""he does not care"".Before leaving I reminded him that customer service is your best advertisement, but I got the vibe that he was less concerned with me and my guests coming back anyway, hence the way the neighborhood has changed.

The tom kha soup came in a generous portion for $4.50, which didn't matter because it was so unbelievably salty I could barely get through the broth. Veggie spring rolls were dripping oil and the plum sauce was overly sweet and syrupy. The vegetarian pad thai was also too salty though not nearly as bad as the soup. Just overall too much salt and sugar covered up the flavor of all the vegetables and other ingredients. Bummer. Truth be told, Ghang Thai just down the block is a lot better for tom kha, and it looks super similar inside. Service there is super nice, too.",2.0

"Modern and trendy local thai restaurant. Good prices, generous portions and friendly staff. However, their food is hit-and-miss. Overall, Joya offered a very satisfying experience. Adventitious lunch for 2 while we were in the neighborhood. Having reading many good things about Joya, we were not disappointed when we stepped in. The interior is beautifully modern; great place for intimate dinners and casual lunches. Lots of detail in their art hanging around the walls. Joya gives off a feel-good contemporary vibe. Their lunch specials are $10.00: anything on the menu + soup of the day/ house salad. We ordered the Massaman curry and Pad See Yue with a soup and a salad. Massaman Curry -- Probably one of the best Massaman curries I've ever tasted. The coconut and curry medley was perfect -- neither flavor was overpowering the other. The curry was creamy. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The amount of potatoes and chicken in the curry made it difficult to finish with just one bowl of rice. I ended up having to doggie bag the rest for another serving at home.Pad See Yue -- Unimpressed. I have had way better pad see yue dishes in the past. My main qualm with the dish was the beef; the beef was way too overcooked. It was too tough and nearly flavorless. The noodles were also too cooked -- soft and almost soggy -- and too salty. A careless, messy contrast of a dish.Again, wonderful atmosphere -- if I lived in the area, I would not mind coming here every week, if not to eat to just chill out. The food is my only qualm -- consistency is key and personally, I'd prefer not to play russian roulette with my food.

Massaman Curry -- Probably one of the best Massaman curries I've ever tasted. The coconut and curry medley was perfect -- neither flavor was overpowering the other. The curry was creamy. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The amount of potatoes and chicken in the curry made it difficult to finish with just one bowl of rice. I ended up having to doggie bag the rest for another serving at home.Pad See Yue -- Unimpressed. I have had way better pad see yue dishes in the past. My main qualm with the dish was the beef; the beef was way too overcooked. It was too tough and nearly flavorless. The noodles were also too cooked -- soft and almost soggy -- and too salty. A careless, messy contrast of a dish.Again, wonderful atmosphere -- if I lived in the area, I would not mind coming here every week, if not to eat to just chill out. The food is my only qualm -- consistency is key and personally, I'd prefer not to play russian roulette with my food. With that said, Joya's still a winner in my books and I would not mind coming back.",4.0
"This is the first one star review I've ever given.  I'm usually a 3-5 star rater on Yelp and rarely have a horrible experience.Here's what's interesting.  The food was good and we didn't wait long.  The ambience is nice and location is really good.  The bad part:  The owner is a complete jerk who goes out of his way to be rude to paying customers.  I've never experienced such an unearned insulting by a supposed restaurant owner.  I took some solace in the fact that he was insulting a number of paying customers on the way out simply because he was having ""a bad night.""  Our waiter apologized for the owner's behavior on the way out.  I can only imagine what it must be like to actually work for that ingrate.Four star food isn't worth an unnecessary attitude and insults by an arrogant, obtuse operator.   There are plenty of amazing restaurants in Cobble Hill / Carroll Gardens. This is one you should avoid.",1.0
"This place is a hidden gem! My cousin & I decided we wanted Thai and we found Joya. The ambiance is very relaxed with little candles on the table. Our waitress was kind and provided prompt customer service. We ordered the Summer Rolls as an appetizer which were pretty good but needed a little extra something. Then, I ordered shrimp, cabbage, peppers, and a side of white rice in garlic sauce. It was SUPER GOOD and I even added my cousin's sliced chicken curry sauce which made it even more delectable. I firmly believe any individual can find something they really love here even if they are new to the Thai food experience!",5.0
"My family and I went to Joya to celebrate my sisters birthday. We've come here many times, and the food is always excellent, and the prices are so cheap. For appetizers we ordered chicken curry puffs, vegetable spring rolls, and calamari. We ordered two orders of the spring rolls and chicken curry puffs because there is only two per order. SOOO good. The chicken curry puffs are my favorite. For my entree I got the special they had that night, the steak and spicy noodles, but I got my noodles not spicy, it comes with vegetables in it also. I've gotten this special before there, it's so good. The entree is huge, no way to finish it all. The prices at Joya are ridiculous, you really get so much food for the price of everything. I'll definitely be back at Joya soon !",5.0
"Man I just love this place. I could eat here everyday and never get bored or go broke! They have a great regular menu and special menu that has creative dishes. Last time I was here I had special grilled salmon with oyster sauce and some sort of Asian style broccoli. It was great. Very flavorful like soy sauce with hint of spice. My friend had some and enjoyed it too I normally get pad Thai, coconut curry with either chicken or shrimp, fried rice, calamari, springs, ribs and mussels. Great ambiance good for solo dining, dates or groups. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable, understanding and accommodating. One time I had an issue with my curry beef not being as tender as I would like. But staff explained when beef is cooked on a wok its not as tender as pan seared beef. The beef tasted good! I just like it cooked a certain way. I would try it again.They have skirt steak special that is very good and tense FYI. I believe that's grilled.",5.0
"This is my go-to spot for a night out. The prices are cheap and the food is great. I don't think I've ever spent more than $20 including a drink. I LOVE the tom kha tofu soup, the pad Thai, drunken noodles, and several of the curries. I've never had a dish here that I didn't like. I've never waited more than 20 minutes for a table (they have a bar to sit at while you wait). I just love Joya. Yum.",5.0

Don't worry, it hasn't hurt our friendship :)We ordered summer rolls that were inedible due to dry blandness and chewiness.

But the server seemed like I nice guy who but should consider a different line of work. He wouldn't look us in the eye, seemed in a rush, didn't ask if there was a reason we didn't touch the rest of the appetizer, didn't even apologize when I expressed my dissatisfaction with the dish...my friend, a local, said that this kind of service was to be expected in Brooklyn generally.",2.0

After having a craving for Thai I stopped in to try out Joya and realized that the menu looked really familiar.

Went there last night with a group of friends and my son . The food was okay but the service was horrible . It was my first time . The restaurant did not have no music. Some guy come in our table and was very rude . Throwing his 11 grand he spent on his couch . Who cares? Anyway my toddler was standing on the couch . Not convenient when no waiter offered us a high chair . Not a happy place !!! The absence of music is a turn off . Will not go back there !!!,2.0
Let's talk about this! You're downtown BK and you don't know where to eat. Stop thinking get your *** to Joya asap! The curry flavors are tantalizing your palette. All the while you are trying to fight your instinct to pick up the bowl and straight up drink the curried sauce!! Spices must be marinated from the heavens and bought down to earth for this restaurant. My wife and I have frequented this place for years and they have never disappointed. Busy place and rightfully so. Keep in mind for a bit of a wait to be seated. Atmosphere is very chill and friendly in that part of town. Go there with absolute confidence my friends.,5.0
"Went here the other night to branch out from our usual Thai take out joint. I was pleasantly pleased. The back yard is lovely and the food is delicious!

Definitely reccomend and hope they deliver to me so I can go back to enjoying thai on my couch as it's intended.",4.0
Met a girlfriend here for a Friday dinner and had an overall positive experience. The food was good and not very expensive.

The Thai tea isn't too sweet and drinkable!! The food are freshly made and quick service!!! The food is tasty and light!!! The food isn't greasy which make it worth eating!!!

Go here for a good drubken noodle but be ready to pay a little extra for it.

"Joya, Joya, Joya...I swear Joya would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for their hot mess of a hostess. Don't get me wrong, she was super friendly and I'm sure she does her job well when she isn't under pressure. Let me break it down for you. A friend and I headed to Joya after an Ikea trip. We arrived at around 7:40ish pm on a Saturday and the place was popping. There was a 30 minute wait, so I left my name with the hostess and sat my happy butt down for the next 45 mins (I was really digging the food I was seeing..lol.) After the 46th minute, I went to the waitress and asked her about our table (we were pretty much the last ones standing at this point.) She apparently forgot to write my name down, but seated us moments after. Bless her heart...I had difficulty determining what i wanted to wanted to eat because I couldn't keep my eyes off of all the delicious dishes that were coming out the kitchen (that was conveniently located within the dining area.) We ordered the curry puff and thai spare ribs as an appetizer. The ribs were a little tough, but I still got down with them. The curry puff was AH-MAZING! For an entree I ordered the shrimp Pad See Yue. Mannnnnnnnnnnn, I was blown away by how delicious my dish was! CONCLUSION: Joya is delicious, it really is. The whole ""waiting game"" is a little frustrating, and be prepared to be on top of each other if you're sitting in the back of the dining area.",4.0
"We had date night last Friday night at Joya. Appetizers were an avocado, salmon (with some other stuff) roll and spare ribs. It was just ok. The ribs were chewy and dry and not fall off the bone good. The sauce was good with them. The roll was ok but seemed like they were wrapped in a tortilla. Dinner wasn't that good either. I had a chicken dish with garlic sauce with broccoli, cabbage and onions. The chicken was very chewy and it was like frozen chicken or frozen chicken that wasn't completely thawed out and they just cooked it. And the rice was completely undercooked. My husband's spicy chicken noodles were better but still not amazing.They did have a nice looking outdoor area where it would have been nice to sit but we decided not to wait. One saving grace was the waiter. When I only ate the veggies from my dish and left the chicken to the side, I told the waiter that the rice was undercooked and the chicken was terrible and he took the item off our bill.I'm not sure what I expected from a restaurant that I saw a commercial for in a New York City taxi.",2.0

After the 46th minute, I went to the waitress and asked her about our table (we were pretty much the last ones standing at this point.) She apparently forgot to write my name down, but seated us moments after. Bless her heart...I had difficulty determining what i wanted to wanted to eat because I couldn't keep my eyes off of all the delicious dishes that were coming out the kitchen (that was conveniently located within the dining area.) We ordered the curry puff and thai spare ribs as an appetizer. The ribs were a little tough, but I still got down with them. The curry puff was AH-MAZING! For an entree I ordered the shrimp Pad See Yue. Mannnnnnnnnnnn, I was blown away by how delicious my dish was! CONCLUSION: Joya is delicious, it really is. The whole ""waiting game"" is a little frustrating, and be prepared to be on top of each other if you're sitting in the back of the dining area.",4.0
"We had date night last Friday night at Joya. Appetizers were an avocado, salmon (with some other stuff) roll and spare ribs. It was just ok. The ribs were chewy and dry and not fall off the bone good. The sauce was good with them. The roll was ok but seemed like they were wrapped in a tortilla. Dinner wasn't that good either. I had a chicken dish with garlic sauce with broccoli, cabbage and onions. The chicken was very chewy and it was like frozen chicken or frozen chicken that wasn't completely thawed out and they just cooked it. And the rice was completely undercooked. My husband's spicy chicken noodles were better but still not amazing.They did have a nice looking outdoor area where it would have been nice to sit but we decided not to wait. One saving grace was the waiter. When I only ate the veggies from my dish and left the chicken to the side, I told the waiter that the rice was undercooked and the chicken was terrible and he took the item off our bill.I'm not sure what I expected from a restaurant that I saw a commercial for in a New York City taxi.",2.0
"For being a beginner at Thai food, the food is marvelous! I began with vegetable spring roles and the mango salad for appetizers. I don't know what kind of sauce they use for the spring roles, but I am completely in love with it. Though, I do wish they gave me more springs roles. Then for the main dish I had the Chicken Pad Thai. I don't order anything else now. (Be warned! If you don't like bean sprouts, this dish is NOT for you). Tip: You are better off sharing a dish if you know you cannot finish a meal. Their servings are big, but is better to have more food then less. On the other hand, the nights are busy! The music seems to be loud and, since it's crowded, you can hear other's conversations. You're lucky if you wait for a table or pay the check that it won't be crowded between the bar, the register, and the people coming in and out of the place.",4.0
"First time I came here was for dinner, and had a great experience. Place was packed with people, and lighting was dimmed appropriately for dinner. The chicken dish I had was enormously filling and tasted great, I think it was a seasonal menu item though, as I didn't see it the next time I came.As for the 2nd time I came, I wanted to show my boyfriend what a great Thai place I found. We came for lunch on a nice day, and sat outside. Unfortunately, the outdoor seating didn't agree with us, as the mosquitoes would not leave us alone. I was bit a few times and could not enjoy my meal, so I had requested to sit inside instead. The food we ordered tasted no where close to what I had remembered, I barely ate my dish this time. What I'd like to know is, what happened to the place I first enjoyed?? Did the chef get changed, or did they stop caring? The time lapse between the first and 2nd visit was about 8 months apart...",2.0
"Great food. Worst service ever and the owner is really rude. I had the masaman, it was a bit too sweet but i liked it.They didnt know who order what, took 20 minutes to take the food off the table once we were done and another 10 to box and bring back our doggie bags.The owner wouldnt charge our phone because he's been sued. Sounded like bs to me.",2.0
"Not sure yet... But I'm hungry. Well there is nothing Thai about your salad, or soup... Work on that. Are you people from Thailand? The drunken noodle is ok but come on drunken means it has sauce lots of sauce drunk on sauce... Where is the sauce?",2.0
"I know joya and song are under the same management, with that being said I used to love song so much and they've gotten worse over the years. I thought maybe I would give joya a shot to see if they still had that taste I loved from song. I'm so sad and disappointed to say that it was actually worse. I had a beef noodle dish and the whole thing lacked flavor. The beef looked grayish in color and one piece wasn't fully cooked. It was really unappetizing. Also I ordered a soda and it had a very strange after taste. I won't be back",1.0

"My fiance and I came in for lunch during a brief NY vacation and it hit the spot. Large menu includes all the usual Thai fare and it doesn't disappoint, with fresh veggies and not too much grease. Plenty of vegetarian options. There's a small, protected outdoor patio in the back, perfect for a spring or summer day. Nothing extraordinary but if you're in the mood for quality Thai it's worth the trip.",4.0
"Joya is a fantastic Thai restaurant that caters to a dressed up or last minute casual spot to eat.  The atmosphere is chill and warm with the lighting and flames from the kitchen.  The price range is awesome, especially for the portions and quality of fresh dishes.  Check out my full video review here: corey-ashley.squarespace…",4.0
"Reasonable prices, good flavor, quality ingredients, and generous portions. We love the decor, ambience in here, and staff are friendly and refill water a few times during your meal. 4.5/5 - Green curry for $10 comes with chicken, a variety of vegetables, and is accompanied by white rice. Great portion. We really enjoyed this as it came very close to what we've had at this Thai place called Isaan Station in LA.   4/5 - The papaya salad for $5 has crisp texture, sweet, and spicy flavor, but could use some more sour flavor.  You taste the sour in the leftover dressing, but not as much on the shredded papaya. 4/5 - Seafood fried rice. Lots of flavor, well-seasoned. 3/5 - 2 decent size egg rolls for $3.95. A bit pricey for this portion, relative to other appetizer portions on the menu.  Taste was okay; more remnant of Chinese food than Thai food.  The wrapping retained too much of its cooking oil. It should be drained better from the fryer. 3/5 - Chicken Satay. Meat is nicely moist. Peanut sauce was overly sweet/thick, and the vinegary sauce didn't have enough flavor.  Might taste better with some red chili.  I realize it's smart to sell fried appetizers and price them right, even if they aren't Thai foods. People order them!We'll definitely be back. Flavorful food, good prices, and an enjoyable dining experience in NYC. Joya does a great job.",4.0
"I came here on a rainy Saturday night and the place was pretty full. Joya reminded me of the Thai restaurant Song that's not too far away. I think they are related and they are both popular places to dine at. The entrance, interior, and menu all look the same. But I had a better experience at Song and a terrible experience at Joya. I had the mango salad and shrimp pad thai. The mango salad had a lot of mangos, but it was just okay, nothing special. Now the pad thai is the worst I ever had. It was so salty and flavorless, just plain salty. How can a Thai restaurant mess up pad thai. And the shrimp had a fishy taste. The dish was just bad. The only thing I like was the Thai ice tea.",1.0

"It was my first time at Joya and I came on a Saturday night with a few friends. The wait was about 30 - 45 minutes. We started off with appetizers: Chicken curry puffs, Papaya salad, Mussels and Fried Tiger Shrimp Rolls. The appetizers were very good and flavorful. The Chicken curry puff were my less favorite because it seem really basic and did not have much of a curry taste.. For entrees we ordered the chicken Pad Thai, Jumbo Shrimp and avocado Pad Thai, Nuur Kratiam and Salmon over green curry (which I believe was on the  specials menu). The portions of the entrees were good sizes. But because we ordered so much appetizers that I couldn't even make it half way through my entree and had to take it to go. Out of the 4 entrees that we ordered the two unsatisfying dishes we would have to say is the Nuur Kratiam and Salmon over green curry. The Nuur Kratiam's (sauteed sliced beef with broccoli, cabbage, carrots, and onions in a fresh garlic sauce) beef was super chewy and tough and as for the Salmon dish my friend said the salmon was very dry. The waiter was very nice and attentive which is why I gave them an extra star. But overall my friends rate it 3 out of 5 stars.",4.0

We love the special Thai spare ribs (and the dipping sauce), fried calamari, mango salad, green papaya salad, Pla Muk Kraprow, and spicy noodles. The heat from the wok makes everything taste better than other restaurant. If you happened to sit near the kitchen area, you will know what I am talking about.

My heart was thoroughly broken over these $10, flavorless sea creatures. Since we had ours as takeout we were able to add a dash of salt and it made a great difference.Our entrees were good! I enjoyed the tofu pad see yu and hubz had tofu pad khing. My husband isn't much of a tofu eater but if he is able to praise this dish then they did a good job cooking it! I was also pleases with the spring rolls. Now those were good and if they weren't Joya would have received 1 star. The atmosphere is adorable and romantic. We did not have to wait long for our takeout. We even waited outside but the food was ready and one of the employees brought it out to us. So kind!",3.0
"Fun vibe, nice bartender, good prices. I'm glad they're not afraid to make the food spicy, that was a plus.The food lacks some depth though. I got Panang curry. It was good, but didn't give me that umami depth I was looking for.",3.0
"Joya is absolutely amazing. I was told about this establishment a few years back, and I've been hooked since. Where do I start? The food is amazing, the service is good, the decor is beautiful, and the outside patio is a nice addition.

Very mediocre overall. Bland food. Pathetic quantities of shrimp and meat - not even 1 piece for 4 people in the curry.,1.0
"It's been a really long time since I've had good Thai food, but I had it at Joya, and I'm so freaking glad I did.I came here with a friend after a long day of hanging out.  When I looked at the menu, I immediately knew what I wanted - the Kratiam chicken. OMG.  So glad I ordered it.  It was amazing.  I'm very picky about my Kratiam, but this was good.  The garlic and pepper combination was everything, and the white rice was just like Tita used to make.Essentially, it was delicious.  We had Tofu Tod, which wasn't that great, but the sauce was.We got two entrees, an appetizer, two Thai iced teas, and utensils for roughly $45.",5.0

"Joya! We LOVE Joya! This is a very trendy Thai restaurant in Brooklyn. We discovered Joya in summer 2013 and we have been going back ever since. It is a treat for us. We love the special Thai spare ribs (and the dipping sauce), fried calamari, mango salad, green papaya salad, Pla Muk Kraprow, and spicy noodles. The heat from the wok makes everything taste better than other restaurant. If you happened to sit near the kitchen area, you will know what I am talking about. This place has good cocktail drinks too. So do grab one while you are waiting for a table. If you are going between Thursday and Saturday, do go early because it gets crowded quickly.",5.0

"Came here for father's day. The wait staff was excellent.The meal was very reasonably pricedMy masaman curry was way too sweet. I've had many a masaman curry from lots of different thai places in park slope, this was by far the sweetest i've ever had.I generally remove the potatoes, meat and nuts from the curry and add gravy to them + my rice to taste. One spoonful of the gravy was too much. My dad felt his meal was was too salty. It was a stir fry that had peppers, onions and a meat.",4.0

"4 stars 800+ reviews? How?! Really disappointed with this place. I had high expectations judging from the reviews. This is not real thai food. You can tell the food is made from a variety of bottled sauces, not fresh spices. All 4 of the dishes I've tried had tons of unnecessary sugar, which lost the little flavor that was left. Lastly the menu doesn't have some of the proper dishes you should find in an authentic thai restaurant, definitely not for someone who enjoys fish. The only thing I liked about this places were the prices, which were very fair. Overall, wouldn't go back again.",2.0
This place looks attractive from the outside but the overall experience was not as exciting as previously reviewed. We ordered a pad thai that was too greasy and mushy. The salmon and curry was okay. The  place is cozy though. They should get rid of the cheap paper tables cloths.,2.0
"I was here last night for an anniversary dinner with my boy. I don't have too much to say that is different from what other positive reviews reflect, except that I wasn't expecting it to be so packed on a Monday night! I would definitely recommend making reservations, we ended up waiting nearly half an hour for a table.The decor was minimal, and the lighting wad really cute. I liked the ambiance though the music generally what I'd go for. A lot of classic 80s songs. I will admit that ""Your Love"" is a guilty pleasure of mine though, so it wasn't all bad.Leaning vegetarian, I got the Pak Pad Thai, which I got with tofu at no extra cost, and my husband got the Tofu Pad See Yue. We were both happy with our food, generous portions and great prices, though the chunks of tofu were kind of big and spongy. Not really bad, but if they were smaller pieces they would have absorbed more flavor and worked better.Generally a solid choice for Thai food. I can't say it stood out though, and I've definitely had better. I'm also just not a huge Thai connoisseur I guess, so that's why I could only give three stars.",3.0

Great vibe and an ill outdoor patio they use when its warm. The food is great, simple and plain and you won't find a better meal for the price in the borough. My favorite dish is the spicy noodles but I've had everything on the menu and would recommend anything. The fried rice and pad thai are probably the two dishes I would skip. They're not bad but you can get similar elsewhere. All the curries are amazing and the spring rolls are a must add to every meal I order.  The mango salad is epic.

It was good food and we even got in without waiting. Note to groups - they don't split checks. Then we had a rude waitress so that ruined the end of a good meal.

Also we tried the spring rolls and they aren't closed like regular spring rolls at the ends. It was literally just rolled. It was like a taco or something where everything can fall out.

First off, the host has a major attitude.. for tourist not having power on his phone, he wouldn't allow me to charge it in the restaurant, when there is literally an avaliale plug behind him. Secondly, the fried rice was soooooooo salty, you can taste the ocean in there, not the freshness from the seafood, but the salty level as the ocean water, whoever orders it, make sure to see a doctor for angiosclerosis. So was the half-chicken special, the special stands for specially salty.. Anyway the four star review was overrated. Any of you ever come here, it's not some fxxking authentic Thai food, it's some salty greasy cheap take-out places in a fancy plate.. Don't let this restaurant ruin your night like it did to me.",1.0

"I never write reviews.. Unless it's a really awful experience and I feel the need to make a public service announcement. So here goes...I have been going to Joya for years and have always love it. They have recently remodeled the yard which is awesome in the summer.However, I went yesterday and noticed the grade was ""pending"". I went inside anyway because I've had such a great history with the place that I thought it would be fine... WRONG!I ordered the chicken fried rice (my ""usual"") and the chicken had zero taste and was undercooked. How do you undercook tiny slim slices of chicken? It was under-seasoned as well and so I asked for salt and pepper (after waiting for what seems like forever for the waitress to come back and help). She brought soy sauce and salt ...I had to flag her down again for the pepper.That's not even the issue.... My friend (his first time at the restaurant) had the fried snapper special with sautéed vegetables and white rice. The fish had ZERO seasoning. ..but while eating his rice he called my attention to show me a freaking NAPKIN that had been rolled up and STUFFED INTO HIS RICE BOWL at the bottom!!! I freaked out and we were instantly disgusted.It was about 5:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was not very full... So I steered at the group of waiters standing by the food station doing absolutely nothing and no-1 came over. So I got up and explained what happened to our waiter (tall young  Asian man). He came over saw it and said he's brining another bowl-- with no freaking apology. So then I stated we don't want another bowl, we don't want to eat here at all because this is disgusting and insisted that I am NOT PAYING for the meal. He walked away with an attitude (I kid you not) and I yelled at him while he left ""this is how you respond? By walking away?"" He responded and said that he's going to get a manager.For what seemed like an eternity, I watched him go over and speak to a short bearded man. After watching them go back and forth, the manager came over with a  defeated look on his face to explain that the napkin inadvertently dropped into the rice cooker and that someone should have noticed it. He then said it was the servers fault for scooping out the rice with the napkin in it... Whoa! How about the fact that the napkin shouldn't be in the rice in the first place??!He said that the meal was complimentary (as if I would've paid for that terrible experience, anyway).Point of the story-- get your s$&!  together Joya!!!!

"Let me tell you something. Four star is a joke... First off, the host has a major attitude.. for tourist not having power on his phone, he wouldn't allow me to charge it in the restaurant, when there is literally an avaliale plug behind him. Secondly, the fried rice was soooooooo salty, you can taste the ocean in there, not the freshness from the seafood, but the salty level as the ocean water, whoever orders it, make sure to see a doctor for angiosclerosis. So was the half-chicken special, the special stands for specially salty.. Anyway the four star review was overrated. Any of you ever come here, it's not some fxxking authentic Thai food, it's some salty greasy cheap take-out places in a fancy plate.. Don't let this restaurant ruin your night like it did to me.",1.0
Updating from 4 years ago as they still have awesome food and now accept credit cards! I go to Joya more than any other restaurant in NYC because the food is delicious and CHEAP. My go to is woon sen with chicken and shrimp.,5.0
"Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant. I'm not gonna lie, but I've only tried their red curry and pad Thai (what I usually order in any Thai restaurant) and both are delicious! Price is great too!

I'm sure the food would have been fine if I'd been able to eat any of it ... especially since my friend so highly recommended it and said how popular it was. But unfortunately it is one of those Thai restaurants where all their sauces have been pre-made and contain either or both soy sauce and fish sauce. The other dishes that did not already contain these were the entrees but none of the entrees were vegetarian/vegan. This meant a vegan gluten-free person like myself literally could not eat anything on the menu. So we had to leave. I understand that this makes it easy for the kitchen to quickly put together dishes when they are ordered but is not good for serving anyone with food allergies or sensitivities. At least our server was understanding and made the effort to go clarify with the cooking staff. And she understood why we had to leave. And the decor inside seemed pretty nice.,2.0

"FOOD POISONING!! I absolutely loved this restaurant.

Food was delicious as per usual, until, later that night spending the wee hours of the morning on the bowl. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, because it was so horrendous, sharp pains in my stomach and being so sick. It sucks because the food is good.

"Came here during the day on the weekend. Finally a seat since the last time we were there was at night and many of us yelpers know its impossible to get a seat.

"One of the reasons I love Yelp is discovering little gems like this place. I honestly would have never found Joya if I was just walking around, or even consulted a restaurant guide or concierge. It's one of those places that you have to actively search for, since it is a bit off the beaten track. However, I really think it is worth going out of your way to try. When you walk down Court Street to find this place, you may have to do a double take. I had to walk up and down the street a bit and actively look in every building to find this place. The only advertising on the outside is a simple paper sign that says ""Joya"". No banner or anything else, just the basic sign. I actually thought for a moment that Yelp was fooling me, and that it closed and was long gone. But nope, it was there.I went with a friend, and I got the lunch special. It was two fried spring rolls and chicken Pad Thai, all for only 8.95. A very good deal for New York standards. My friend went with another noodle dish that came out to only 7.95, and again, very nice deal. Only problem was that it was a cash-only establishment. So please remember to bring cash, and there are a few ATM's in the neighborhood. The spring rolls were alright, though I felt they didn't contain quite enough roughage inside. Mostly just noodles, and that's it. Luckily no human teeth (like a previous poster mentioned). The Pad Thai, on the other hand, was delicious. The noodles were nice and tender, not too soft and mushy. Chicken was pretty limited, but it was a nice compliment with the dish. Just enough spiciness and flavor too, so it wasn't overwhelming. Service was friendly, and my water glass never went empty. Got our food in less than ten minutes, which is very good for a sit-down restaurant. Everyone there was friendly and helpful. Restrooms were clean and well stocked also, though a bit awkwardly placed (right in the middle of the restaurant, facing the seating area). Overall, I had a great experience here, and would definitely come back. What I like the best is that while coming here, I discovered the neighborhood (which I'd never been to before), and a few other restaurants that looked good. So not only will I come back here, but also to the neighborhood.",4.0
Never disappointed when I go here...I've frequented this place well over 10x's. This was my first dabble in the world of Thai food. The atmosphere is a bit hectic depending on what time you go but the feel is relaxed and with the outdoors it can easily become your next chill spot.The food is absolutely spot on. I've always gotten the drunken(spicy) noodles with chicken and shrimp but I've also tried their various curry dishes and I'm in love with Tom Yum soup and calamari.

"Joya was my Friday night meal after a walk across my favorite bridge.  It was very packed; my friend and I waited about 15-20 minutes before being seated.  We got a table in the narrow section next to the bar; every time the door opened, I felt a cold draft.  You would do best to opt for a table in the larger/inner section of the restaurant.  We ordered the small calamari, which could have passed for a medium-large serving.  Hey, I wasn't complaining after walking 2 miles for food.  We also shared the tiger shrimp kebab appetizer.  I forgot if that was on the specials menu.  The appetizers were deceivingly on point.  Our expectations for our entrees were definitely heightened.My friend ordered spicy fried rice which she didn't much care for.  I had the pork in red massaman curry rice dish.  The rice was uber-hard, like overnight rice you would use to make fried rice.  The heat from the curry was decent; I like to err on the mild side with spicy plates, but this had a manageable 'kick' to it..  The menu was very affordable; you can have a decent meal for $20 and under.  They probably make more money off the alcohol than the food.  A glass of sweet Riesling, not the best either, cost as much as an entree dish.  I would consider returning, but I might just stick with the appetizers.",3.0

"I have been eating here for years and it is still just as affordable and reliable. I love the backyard in the summer, but even in the winter it will be packed.

"A solid 3.5 star place. Lively, fast, loud, cheap, but with food that won't poison you. Definitely a place to meet up with a group of friends to have a quick dinner, and definitely for a younger demographic. The place is loud but you don't have to raise your voice to speak with others at your table. Came here mid week for dinner and it was packed. Turn over was quick, waited only a few minutes for a table. Got the curry puffs and the ribs as apps. Ribs had an outside reminiscent of sandpaper, would never order again. Puffs were really thick and filling, with a hint of curry. I don't think go well as an app in a Thai place, at least not these, because they are too heavy to be followed with some noodles etc. would get it as take out maybe not a sit down meal. For mains tried the masaman, their ""spicy"" noodles and the pork kraprow. Best was the masaman even though the beef was a bit tough, there was a lot of it. There was nothing spicy about the noodles and they were a bit overlooked and mooshy. Kraprow was ok. Also forgettable really. Food was super bland and especially for Thai food. Was really strange they didn't have any hot sauces on the table. I looked around at other tables thinking maybe ours was just missing this, but didn't see any on other tables either. I looked over the reviews for their sister restaurant Song, and noticed they have this there but on request. Maybe it's the same here, I'm not sure. But kind of weird to keep this a secret especially when the food is so bland. Either way, it's a decent solid spot to know about for quick dinner with friends.",3.0

I don't know how they do it, but even with a ton of delivery orders, it didn't take any longer than 10 minutes for our appetizers, and another 5 for our entrees.The menu is basically the same thing at all three locations. I had the grilled salmon and Brussels sprouts special (just because I wanted to see what Thai Brussels sprouts would be like). It was really good. The sauce had a sweetness to it, and the sprouts were tender (and there were a LOT of them).All in all, Joya is a great place when you're short on time or cash. Oh, and it's cash only!",4.0
"Not the most authentic Thai restaurant, but it's hard to find anything authentic in this area - making it good enough to venture into if you're hungry. It's also pretty affordable, but not as affordable as authentic Thai restaurants typically are.",3.0
Good portions and affordable. I always find myself ordering the drunken noodles every time I'm here.Downside: long waits during primetime dinner hours and weekends.and cash only.,4.0
"I've been here many times past but it has been a few years since coming back to this place and I must say that they have not lost their quality of great tasting food. Tonight I took no pics yikes! but, I had a delicious serving of chicken curry puffs as an appetizer and spicy seafood fried rice as my entrée. Everything was so delish and now I'm reminded of why I fell in love with this place years ago. I will be back soon. Oh btw you can get a full meal for under $10 and end up with leftovers :-) awesome!!!!!",4.0
"A solid 3.5 star place. Lively, fast, loud, cheap, but with food that won't poison you. Definitely a place to meet up with a group of friends to have a quick dinner, and definitely for a younger demographic. The place is loud but you don't have to raise your voice to speak with others at your table. Came here mid week for dinner and it was packed. Turn over was quick, waited only a few minutes for a table. Got the curry puffs and the ribs as apps. Ribs had an outside reminiscent of sandpaper, would never order again. Puffs were really thick and filling, with a hint of curry. I don't think go well as an app in a Thai place, at least not these, because they are too heavy to be followed with some noodles etc. would get it as take out maybe not a sit down meal. For mains tried the masaman, their ""spicy"" noodles and the pork kraprow. Best was the masaman even though the beef was a bit tough, there was a lot of it. There was nothing spicy about the noodles and they were a bit overlooked and mooshy. Kraprow was ok. Also forgettable really. Food was super bland and especially for Thai food. Was really strange they didn't have any hot sauces on the table. I looked around at other tables thinking maybe ours was just missing this, but didn't see any on other tables either. I looked over the reviews for their sister restaurant Song, and noticed they have this there but on request. Maybe it's the same here, I'm not sure. But kind of weird to keep this a secret especially when the food is so bland. Either way, it's a decent solid spot to know about for quick dinner with friends.",3.0
"Excellent Thai food! After staying in Thailand, I'm so proud that Brooklyn often offers better meals than one might find in the motherland albiet more pricey. They have a $10 lunch special try the spicy noodle and thom yum soup for an authentic bite.",5.0
"This is by far my favorite Thai spot ever. I've been to some Thai spots in California, and Joya still beats it by far. My favorite dish is the spicy drunken noodles with shrimp. Pure heaven!!!",5.0
"Imagine a restaurant that uses fresh ingredients, not to heavy with the fat content, and cost about what a meal at McD would cost (minus the booze)...now imagine the food was actually good, now open your eyes...you are in Joya!",5.0
Still one of my favorite places to go to eat on Court Street. Went in last night around 6:40 PM and we were seated immediately. We started with drinks. A Thai iced tea for me (seems like the glass was larger than I remembered) and a glass of wine for my friend. Next up were appetizers. We decided on calamari. It came out fast. Lightly fried. Could have had a bit more seasoning but the sweet dipping sauce made up for it. Our entrees were good as well. I had the pad see ew with beef and my friend tofu curry. Both dishes were delicious. By the time we were leaving the place was more crowded with people waiting for tables. As always the music was loud but we managed to make conversation and not disturb the people next to us too much.  All in all an old favorite that I can always come back to!,5.0
"Joya is a neighborhood staple that's always crowded, especially on the weekend. The Court Street restaurant offers out door dining in the backyard and the decor on the inside is modern. The calamari was fried perfectly but needed salt however my entree-Kang Panang Gai (cocunut curry sauce) would be pretty darn good if it offered more chicken. Overall, it's not heavily commercialized like Lemon Grass but decent Thai. Oh and it's CASH ONLY.",3.0
"Delicious cheap Thai food!! Inside is a little bit loud but you will see the kitchen with all the flames -pretty impressive. The outside area is quite and really romantic.I had dinner with a friend at 9:30pm: two big plates of fried rice with shrimp and vegetables, and noodles. Chai teas, and we spent $21!I will definitely go back.",5.0
This is the sister restaurant to Song in Park Slope. Very simple modern Thai restaurant. The food is very good and flavorful. Will definitely go back if in the neighborhood.,4.0

"Very impressed with  their backyard outdoor seating. Super relaxing and cozy with the pillows and umbrellas. Plus you don't get to constantly smell the kitchen inside. Not a huge fan of their Thai ice tea. Came in good portion but a little too ""chemically"" sugary for my taste. Their appetizers are really what stands out. The fresh thai summer rolls tasted sooo refreshing with the cucumber, shrimp in tamarind sauce.  Great presentation as well. Loved the calamari dish!! Never had them come out  so crispy without having being oily. You could basically grab one without needing to wipe your hands. The plum sauce it came with  was the perfect. accoutrement. We ordered a small for 2 and we were starting to feel full by the end of it. For entrees, I ventured out of my comfort zone and ordered the Kang Panang Gaibeef which included sliced beef with peppers crushed kaffier leaves in panang sauce.  My friend had the Kang Kyo Whan Gai with sliced chicken, eggplants, zuchini  in the green curry sauce, Both sauces were more watery than what we were used to but still had taste. Found the Panang to be more flavorful than Green curry. In both dishes, the meats were overcooked and lacked flavor (my beef slices were slightly tough and her chicken slices were white and blend) . Some of the vegetables were kinda old as well (carrots and eggplant were slightly browning). Overall, the entrees we had weren't that great (to say the least), but then again they weren't indigestible. I will still eat my leftover for lunch tomorrow. I think they kinda win with the seasoning on their sauces..cause it made me  forget about the other ingredients in the dish. Or it could be  I'm just a sucker for thai sauces...Haha!I looooove their portion sizes and their price. You can honestly be full and satisfied from the apps, share an  entree and still have enough to take home. For 2 apps, 2 entrees and 3 thai iced teas, our total came out to $38Service was not great.  Our server lack any opinion and seemed more preoccupied with us getting our orders in quick. I can see why people complain of lack of service when this place gets packed. 4 stars for decor3 for food2 for serviceStill look foward to coming back for more lunches.Oh and like everyone says, CASH ONLY",3.0
"Although it can get pretty packed, the food is always amazing. I've been here numerous times and always waited patiently to dine. The staff is really friendly, courteous, and always checks in (and not annoyingly so). The duck, fab. Calamari, cooked perfectly. Pad Thai, yes please. It's all great. And the drink selection is great. I definitely recommend.I gave them four stars because of the wait to be seated and how quickly it can get crowded. And, also because it's cash only. But other than that Joya is joyous.",4.0
Best Thai food ever!  Amazing spring rolls. I always get spicy chicken basil and my wife always gets chicken Penang curry at any Thai restaurant. Neither of us were disappointed. But surprisingly I loved her Penang curry too.  Everyone in our group of 6 agree that this was the best Thai food we've had.,5.0

"I used to work near Joya and currently live not far from Joya. My ex-co-workers and I have probably have gotten food from Joya numerous times for dine-in and take-out during the day and during week nights. I really like the dimmed atmosphere at night and it is quite busy between Friday to Sunday evenings. As compared with other thai restaurants within Smith and Court Streets, I can tell you that Joya dominates as far as the amount of patrons, turnover, and price of food. I love Joya for the convenience, consistency, and the quantity of food for the price lower than all its competitors. Their foods are delicious but on the salty side. The service is hit and miss depending on how busy the place is. Ordering food on the phone is easy but not as helpful when you ask about substitution and other adjustments. The quality is on par but not the best. If you are looking for quality, I would recommend you going to Pok Pok or Kao Soy. SPICE on Smith and Warrent St is ok but I tend to stay away from chain restaurants if I am in South Brooklyn area. I have tried most of the food options on the menu and I like the skewered chickens and pai thai the most. Lastly, remember to bring CASH.",5.0
"Along with the generous portions, the contemporary decor, and the attentive service, what I liked most about Joya was that my food was not too sweet.

"This place is addictive. It's on the cheap side, without a cheap environment. It's got a nicely intimate atmosphere, great for conversation.The food is so tasty! I usually get the drunken noodles and a Thai tea. The Thai tea is really good - a lot of places water it down too much, but if you like the tea sweet and milky and fragrant, like me, you'll like it. I don't live in the neighborhood, but I get Joya cravings often.",4.0
"For ambiance alone, Joya deserves a 4: It's very inviting and romantic both indoors and outdoors in their patio area, but it really messed with our experience that the service delivery was on rabid-high the night we went.  We were constantly pegged to order even though we asked for more time to look at the menu.  Each time we did that, our server would reappear within 30 seconds .into order in to order.  Quite annoying because there wasn't anyone other than us seated outdoors and a few tables indoors so we couldn't understand the rushing.  We started off with the Salmon Spring Roll and the Chicken Massaman Curry special.  The Massaman Curry itself is very tasty, but the sauce was far too runny - so much so that the chicken looked like it was swimming around in a watered down yellow sauce and really took away from the visual appeal of the dish.  The Salmon Spring Roll was very mediocre - salmon wasn't all that fresh and the accompaniments were rather awkward.  We were still a bit hungry so we also ordered the Thai Calamari Salad.  This was my favorite dish of the night - very light, refreshing and they were generous with the calamari.  Joya is a good place to go if you're looking for something extremely quick, but don't want to do McDonald's/Burger King or any of the other fast food joints and the environment provides great romantic potential, but you'll be disturbed many times throughout your meal.",2.0
"If you want a drink, beer will cost you $5-$7. The dinner menu is about $10 max and the amount of food is great. You really don't need the appetizers because you'll be full real quick. Overall this place is great. We got seated quick and served within 10 minutes. I'd defiantly be back here.",5.0
"Great place with AMAZING food at an inexpensive price. The atmosphere is chill, very nice decor and scenery.  They load your plate full of food, LOTS of food.

"I am so disappointed with this place I don't even know where to start. We decided to come here because this place has a lot of reviews and figured we are making the right choice. When we arrived there was no one to greet us. The host or maybe Manager/owner was too busy talking to his friends at the bar to even notice us. When we went in search of someone to take care of us the guy we spoke to  told us to wait for the manager to finish talking to his friends. Really? okay!!So eventually the manager pointed us to a table, didn't even walk us there but we sat down and patiently waited for him to bring the menus to us which took a while since he went back to talking to his friends. My boyfriend wanted to go up to the host desk to get the menus himself since it seemed that the manager was too busy to take care of the customers that pay his bills. As we sat waiting for the menus he finally made it over but instead of being nice to us he attacked us by saying "" Don't push the table against the wall because its new and it will get scratched"" then he proceeds to point his finger at my boyfriend and saying "" that means you"" since my boyfriend was resting his elbow on the table and his arm and shoulder against the wall. We felt so unwanted there but we decided we wont let that ruin our night. As the night kept moving forward the people that came after us get service before us, the crispy duck was so dry we didn't even want to feed it to my dog in fear of it choking and as we are paying the bill the busser is yelling at us that they don't take debit cards. Cash only. Could there have been a note somewhere before we came in? we were lucky we had cash on us.  I worked in the restaurant industry and know that the cash only places lie on their taxes for tax evasion.  I hope IRS audits you guys.

"This place gets an extra star because their portions are GENEROUS and it is inexpensive. It's not supposed to be authentic nor out of this world, but it's pretty damn good and like I said, the portions are crazily huge. Two people can share the steak over noodles, which coincidentally was my favorite, and both of you would be walking away stuffed. You would think Joya would sacrifice taste in lieu of giving you what seemed like an entire cat fish on a bed of crispy green beans for about $15, but you are wrong my friend, because I would order that catfish for dessert even though catfish is my least favorite fish.  I can bear the extremely loud ambiance because the calamari is cooked just the way I like it; lightly breaded and barley salted. One forgives the cash only policy because the dishes are so freaking cheap. You quickly forget the 45 minute wait because one bite of the chive cake and the spicy pork pad thai gets you to do the happy food dance. If you want a good deal and great food, mosey on to Joya and do your belly a favor and order the steak and noodles.",4.0

"A run-of-the-mill mediocre to average at best thai experience.Came here for all the good reviews and left feeling unsatisfied.decor/ambiance 3/5- This place reminds me a lot of Song for some reason. We were seated up front and at a fairly large table. No complaints here, but nothing special either.Service 4/5- We were seated fast and had our water refilled often. Also the staff brought our food fast.Food- 2/5- Chicken Avocado Spring rolls- Not that good at all. The chicken was super dry. The ""roll"" exhibited a complete inability to maintain a circular form and fell apart within one well controlled grasp of chopsticks. Bleh. - Mussels- Although they provided us with a pretty decent amount and most did not contain sand in them, it was disappointing that there were some that indeed had sand. - Salmon Pad Thai- Nothing special.

"Been eating here for about 10 years. Though it is common to find superb food in NYC, it is rare to find superb cuisine at a relatively cheap cost. The best thai food I've had in NYC.The pad thai is a little bit different than how it was about 5 years ago; not as tasty (healthier?).  It is still excellent however the spicy noodle and curry are even better.",5.0
Great restaurant! Reliable and always fast service (except Saturday nights when the weather is nice... the wait can be an hour). Food is quality. I always order the Pad Thai or combination fried rice. Ambiance is great as well for family occasions or birthdays.,4.0
"(Le sigh) Oh boy. Let me set the scene. It was a Saturday night, circa 8 or 9 pm. We were hungry, so we called in an order after seeing it was rated pretty high on Yelp. We got a chicken satay, fresh thai summer roll, thai house salad, red curry with chicken, and a woon sen with chicken. I can only speak to the food I ate, so the rest will be omitted from this review.Chicken Satay: Skip it. The chicken had a chewy bite to it, totally not fresh made. Now, in their defense it was very lean chicken. It could be better...and I've tasted better elsewhere...so skip it. (2/5)Fresh Thai Summer Roll: I've had this type of appetizer at other places, and at Joya it had a really weird taste. My friend told me she saw tofu in it. I've never had it with tofu before. I am not a fan of their version at Joya, but perhaps you will like it. (2/5)Red Curry Chicken: Their red curry chicken was tasty. I prefer a spicier curry, but I understand that Joya caters to clientele with a more ""western tame"" palette. My only true criticism of their curry is that there was not enough chicken. That being said, their red curry with chicken was around $8......and the places I go to usually charge $15. A pleasant surprise in my curry was the eggplant....I loved it. (3/5)As far as the restaurant is concerned, I love the decor and the ambiance. It has a sophisticated look, but a ""low budget"" price point....a wonderful combination. What I don't like, is the actual setup. You need to walk past tables and a bar to check in, or pick up delivery. That setup lends itself to causing a lot of traffic to build up inside. You know, people trying to get a table, running into others picking up, running into people at the bar, running into people trying to go to the bathroom. Ugh! I think it makes sense to have the counter in the front of the restaurant, near the door (Almost all of the restaurants I frequent do that!).Forget service. There was one lady at the desk, who was cashing people out, answering the phone, and dealing with customer pick ups. She handed me the bag of food, but did not even ask me for my cash, or count it. I literally left the money next to the phone where she was taking an order, and left without her even acknowledging that I had paid.

Oye!I still remember the cozy feel of the place. We dined outside and we were seated at these very small wooden tables under an umbrella. What struck me about this experience is the vibe I got from the neighborhood. It was an unusually warm evening and the lights and the people just sparkled. When we received the deep fried calamari, it was perfect! The curry bowl I had had a strong current of coconut and it was tempered with spicy curry. The flavors just kept going and I couldn't believe the best food we had so far, was this little Thai restaurant nestled in Brooklyn. I told the manager/owner, we just don't get food like this in California. I would tell people in California, there really is something magical about NY. My wife liked the flash of Manhattan.

"Service: 1 star - Hostess was nice and let us pick our own table, servers were very friendly.Food: no stars - Yelp let me down this time. I was expecting a food coma by the end of the meal but no such thing happened. I ordered the Moo Kra Prow (pork in chili-basil sauce) and E had the pork in ginger sauce w/ string beans. Couldn't finish my dish and i hardly touched my rice which is a bad sign because I'm Asian and I love my rice. The salmon spring roll appetizer was not bad but the fish sauce drizzle was overwhelming. Maybe I should have ordered a curry-based entree?Space: 1 star - good design, has a backyard for summer nights, and the kitchen is out in the open.Will probably not be back.

Great decor and atmosphere. Food is delicious and super affordable. They also have a cute patio out back and inside you can watch them cook your food. Definitely my favorite thai spot in BK. Been here many times and will continue to come. The only downfall is that the servers aren't very personable but they're attentive and get the job done.,4.0
"Big Thai fan. Frequenter of the Fort Greene location so was expecting this spot to be the same. Lovely outdoor space, attentive waiters, and a hair in your food. My friend and I ordered a curry and noodledish to split. The noodles were tasty as usual (Pad Thai - don't shoot me. I know it's the spaghetti of Thai food, but I love it). My friend was scooping out some more of the curry she was enjoying then BAM! Hair spotted at 2 o'clock in the bowl. Cue loss of appetite. Waiter replaced it but by then appetite had hit the road. I wound up taking home the new order. Thought they'd refresh the rice -nope. Thought they might knock a couple of bucks off the order - haha silly rabbit. Nope. I'll probably stick to my Fort Greene spot but am bummed that my friend was scarred by the case of the hairy curry.",3.0
"I came here for a quick lunch on a sunday afternoon. Ordered the vegetarian pad thai and asked for No eggs.The first time I was served chicken pad thai. Which i returned.

"For a Thai restaurant, this ranks above average for me.Atmosphere:Your neighborhood go to spot where all the cobble hill yuppies frequent. Definitely more modern/trendy than your other Thai spots. Service:Thursday night 730pm no wait. Say the two of us at a 4 person table. 2 minutes after sitting down the waiter asks what we would like to order (I suppose most people order the same things over and over again). Food came out quickly as well.Food:Chicken avocado summer rolls - the roll fell apart easily. Chicken was a bit dry, avocado taste was a bit masked. Did not like the sauce it came with.Mussels: yum! My favorite dish. They were plump, juicy and sandless. Also very affordable. (I think $9)Salmon on pad Thai - disappointed. Salmon was over cooked and pad Thai was much spicier than I had expected.Overall, even though the dishes did not blow my mind, this will be my go to Thai place in the neighborhood.",3.0

"Joya is the anchor of a Brooklyn Thai mini-chain which includes Song (Park Slope) and National (Fort Greene).  All three restaurants have a near-identical menu that is both tasty and shockingly affordable.  The dishes may not all ascend to Andy Ricker's ideal of what authentic Thai food should be, but everything I have had has been delicious and the price tag makes all three of these places regular go-to options.Differentiating Joya from its cousins is a beautiful back garden shaded by sun-washed canvas umbrellas and nestled beside an ivied Cobble Hill wall.  The open kitchen combined with the fast stir-frying and intense flames makes for some pretty good dinner entertainment.Joya offers regular specials, which are usually inventive and quite good.  I most often stick with basics, however, and have never gone wrong.  The noodle dishes are classic, but well prepared and both light and seemingly greaseless.  Salads are fresh and a favorite pairs white mushrooms with a tangy chili vinaigrette that I want to put on everything.",4.0
If you want a good and INEXPENSIVE meal - This is the place - no others come close.If you dine in and it's crowded (and it usually is) - be prepared for some serious noise -you may not be able to chat with your friends - On the other hand - you can yell and nobody would notice!,4.0

"Service: 1 star - Hostess was nice and let us pick our own table, servers were very friendly.Food: no stars - Yelp let me down this time. I was expecting a food coma by the end of the meal but no such thing happened. I ordered the Moo Kra Prow (pork in chili-basil sauce) and E had the pork in ginger sauce w/ string beans. Couldn't finish my dish and i hardly touched my rice which is a bad sign because I'm Asian and I love my rice. The salmon spring roll appetizer was not bad but the fish sauce drizzle was overwhelming. Maybe I should have ordered a curry-based entree?Space: 1 star - good design, has a backyard for summer nights, and the kitchen is out in the open.Will probably not be back. Yelpers, give me a call when a legitimately good Thai restaurant opens up in Brooklyn. 'Til then, Queens is the go-to place for delicious Siam cooking for me.",2.0

Among the appetizers I would recommend tiger shrimp rolls, spare ribs, and the curry puffs.Really like the salmon fillet entree where the actual stand out are the brussel sprouts, carrying a great, roasted garlicky flavor.

"Came here for lunch for the second time, and unfortunately this place has gone way downhill. My mom and I got a seat in the back patio which was quite nice, but service was extremely slow and inattentive. Our water glasses were never refilled, food took forever to come (which was quite inconvenient for a lunch break) and they seemed like it bothered them to have to serve us. Unfortunately food was not much better. We ordered two lunch specials, one with Fresh Summer Roll and the other with the Mango Salad to start. Both lacked flavor and seemed to be sloppily prepared. Our entrees were plentiful but very one note. I like sweet with my savory dishes, but the Pad Thai was just overpowering in sweetness. The fried rice was better but again very sloppy and needed a bit more flavor. Very unfortunate since I had such a good visit the first time I came here. I guess this place is coming out of rotation. I guess I will stick to Lantern in the area for my Thai food cravings.",2.0
"BF ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce and he liked it. Portions are pretty big, very good price.Why the low rating? I ordered a noodle plate with chicken. Smelled pretty good when it arrived, but the chicken was served raw. It was at night in the garden, so it wasn't until the fourth bite that I realized it was raw. It looked cooked outside, but pink. We showed the waitress several uncooked pieces. She did apologize, and it seemed that they would cook a new order. When it arrived a few minutes later, it appeared to be the same entree--but burnt.

"Excellent Thai food in the Cobble Hill area, with generous portions and outstanding service. This place definitely isn't at the same level of authenticity as Pok Pok, but still retains a solid blend of comfort food and cocktails.Our group shared the shrimp summer rolls, and for entrees we tried the spicy pork and pineapple rice, the chicken pad see yue, and the striped bass in massaman curry -- all delicious and at the perfect spice levels we'd requested. The chicken woon sen was probably the only miss of the meal, which lacked flavour and hosting strange proportions of vegetables vs meat. Bonus points for not loading up the dishes with hefty grease puddles. There was a mix-up with one of the orders, which our friendly server and the kitchen fixed in a short amount of time.Joya also has a gorgeous garden in the back, which is really lovely for outdoor dining in the summer -- I wish they could do something about the mosquitoes though, since we were ravaged by those darn bugs multiple times throughout the meal.Cash only.

A fine Thai option in the neighborhood almost identical menu to Song in Park Slope.  Fast service and fair pricing.  Cash only.  The fried calamari was lacking salt and flavor.  A big menu with lots of options and I really like their soups.,3.0
"BEST THAI IN NYC. i am not usually a Thai food lover but this place really turned that around. i had the sweet chicken curry with a side of rice. i found if you poor some of the sauce on to the rice its delicious. The curry is sweet and flavorful and the Thai Iced tea tied the whole meal together. The tea was sweet and refreshing and yummy. The location is a cute little place on court street right near the F and G trains and a few blocks from the 2,3,4,5 and R trains. the Noise level is little to nothing. The bathrooms smell great and are clean. I highly recommend this place if you want great Thai food.",5.0

"Update!  Women on the phone yesterday told me that they don't deliver to my location.  Too far ( about ten blocks from metrotech center) But I told her I have ordered numerous times including the following week. She told me that must have been for lunch. But no it was for dinner. Than she gives me an attitude and says ""ok but it's going to take a long time"". So I hung up and ordered from Lantern.

"They make the best Pad Thai and trust me, I've had my share.When my bf and I don't know what to eat, this is our default. It's tasty AND cheap. I've been coming here for years and it hasn't disappointed.Other great items are the chicken spring rolls and the spare ribs. The spring rolls come in a pair and the ""small"" order of ribs has 4 pieces. Try the thai iced tea as well.They have a sister location in Park Slope, named ""Song"". Same menu from what I gather.Note: (I don't think its changed but this place is) CASH ONLY.",5.0
"So this place LOOKS nice, however the service is quite terrible. The wait is exaggeratedly long. They are not listed on open table, nor do they take phone reservations...... So you're going to wait and continue to wait. THE SERVERS AND STAFF ARE RUDE!!!!!! So if you want to come to some place with a nice ambiance with poor quality service this is the place to go!But the upside is its cheap and the food is pretty good.",1.0
Food is affordable and sooo good I love Thai food and had the spicy noodles which is drunken noodles delicious. They could improve in their drink selections I really wanted a lychee martini . the atmosphere was nice for girls night out or a cute date night. The spring rolls were good but greasy,4.0
"Came here for lunch for the second time, and unfortunately this place has gone way downhill. My mom and I got a seat in the back patio which was quite nice, but service was extremely slow and inattentive. Our water glasses were never refilled, food took forever to come (which was quite inconvenient for a lunch break) and they seemed like it bothered them to have to serve us. Unfortunately food was not much better. We ordered two lunch specials, one with Fresh Summer Roll and the other with the Mango Salad to start. Both lacked flavor and seemed to be sloppily prepared. Our entrees were plentiful but very one note. I like sweet with my savory dishes, but the Pad Thai was just overpowering in sweetness. The fried rice was better but again very sloppy and needed a bit more flavor. Very unfortunate since I had such a good visit the first time I came here. I guess this place is coming out of rotation. I guess I will stick to Lantern in the area for my Thai food cravings.",2.0
"BF ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce and he liked it. Portions are pretty big, very good price.Why the low rating? I ordered a noodle plate with chicken. Smelled pretty good when it arrived, but the chicken was served raw. It was at night in the garden, so it wasn't until the fourth bite that I realized it was raw. It looked cooked outside, but pink. We showed the waitress several uncooked pieces. She did apologize, and it seemed that they would cook a new order. When it arrived a few minutes later, it appeared to be the same entree--but burnt. You could smell and taste that the spices had been burnt after being cooked the second time around.I couldn't finish the plate--felt already weezy thinking about the raw chicken.

The chicken was so flavorful and cooked perfectly.The only two dishes that we didn't love were the Fresh Thai Summer Roll and the Yum Koong salad.

The awesome delight I'm gushing over consists of crispy, deep-fried, spring rolls stuffed with warm, sweet bananas, topped with whipped cream and served with a few scoops of ice-cream. The chef  completes all of this gooey goodness with a chocolate drizzle and a cherry. The food ain't bad either. It really doesn't get much better than that.",3.0

"Just go. Seriously, if you like thai food you are doing yourself a disservice by not going here. Food was awesome, prices were awesome, portion sizes were awesome and the service was awesome. Of course they can get crowded, it's too good to be a secret, but who cares!?",4.0
"Whenever I hang out with my friend Jas in Brooklyn, we tend to end up here!  They love her and we love their food and friendly service!  Let me back up and elaborate:  CHEAP and DELICIOUS food!You really can't go wrong with anything you order.  Their pad thai is as good as any and their curries are on point!  I love that besides their regular menu, they also have a list of specials which all always sound appetizing.  Makes you wanna come here with a big group and just order it all!  Tried the crispy duck curry today to share and love it - the pineapples and peppers really made it special.  Only thing that you should yield to i that they are CASH ONLY so don't forget to stop at the ATM before coming in.  Also, try to come when the weather is nice so you can enjoy their rear patio.  We always get lucky and never need to wait at lunchtime, but always see people chilling at the bar to be seated as we leave.  Drinks are cheap though so no worries - cheers!",4.0
My favorite 1st date spot. Its a little cute place. Only bad thing I always forget (the 50million times I've been) is CASH ONLY. Besides that this is the Best Thai food in NYC in my eyes. I love everything on the menu. I wish the bar was more up to date with the drinks but they have all that you really need.Amazing food for very little price. If you go on a Saturday make reservations or get there after 9pm,5.0
I had tiger shrimp for an App and it came with a nice sweet sauce. I also had shrimp fried rice which was very good.  The restaurant was very dim and calm. Mango Margarita was excellent.,5.0
"Strange my 1 star review I wrote months ago is no longer on here.  Well, I will give it 2 stars now for the following:   nice outdoor patio, fast service, huge portions and low price.  But as for the quality of Thai food- it was lacking in any real flavor and for the both of us a huge disappointment.",2.0
"My go-to for Americanized Thai in a neighborhood with many options for such. Curries are consistently good, and the red and green curries have become somewhat of a comfort food for nights when I don't want to cook. Cash only and often a wait on busy nights.",4.0
"My very first experience eating Thai food was at JOYA.  I've been eating here for years so it's only right that I write a review. The food is standard. Good but they aren't reinventing the wheel here. What JOYA has mastered is a dessert so good it feels like a lustful sin is being committed with each perfect bite. The awesome delight I'm gushing over consists of crispy, deep-fried, spring rolls stuffed with warm, sweet bananas, topped with whipped cream and served with a few scoops of ice-cream. The chef  completes all of this gooey goodness with a chocolate drizzle and a cherry. The food ain't bad either. It really doesn't get much better than that.",3.0

Good Thai food. Been going there for about 4 years now. And they haven't added really anything new to the menu. I always wished they would add new Dishes to their menu. But all in all.

"I have been going here for years and have introduced many family and friends to Joya. It has become a favorite with all my friends.

"This is the perfect case of over relying on Yelp to pick a restaurant. The reviews are made by over-hyped bandwagon riding yuppies that don't know Thai food. This place absolutely sucks and I wish I didn't even step foot in this place. First, I walk into the restaurant with my lady and two little kids to get dinner. Great, a random couple that knows the owner I guess walks in and gets seated right in front of my face after we waited forever. I should've walked out but everyone deserves a second chance. Then the only white guy working there is a complete DOUCHEBAG, oh the irony he's the F____ing owner!!!! I had a what the f___ moment. He sees us sitting there for god knows how long then comes over and doesn't say a word and points at us to order our food. Literally not a word was said and looked at us as if we were peasants. The beef  came out with the basil sauce and tasted like throw up. The 5 pieces of beef were hard as rocks and were bland. The Pad Thai was terrible, chicken was dryer than the owner's personality. Our last entrée, shrimp and noodles, maybe a total of 3 shrimps were on the plate and outright tested like sauteed garbage. On top of that I had to wait an hour for the food to come out and just to eat something terrible. The owner stands by the bar and drinks beer and could give 2 sh__ about your experience. You make me feel like just opening a Thai restaurant right next door so you could see how it's suppose to be done.",1.0
"Great food, great prices, pretty fast service. I like. I had the spicy noodles (vegetarian) and my brother had the pad see yu (sp?) and both were good.

"I love joya and I still plan on going back but last time I went I when they were opening so it was pretty empty and the food was below their usual. I order the vegetable spring rolls which were great as always since hard to mess up. I divided to also get a large calamari for the table. The calamari at Joya is always tasty and never to salty. This time the calamari was soo chewy and hard like they were using stale oil. They took it back and gave us our entrees which was a little greasy and my rice was stale. I ordered the sautéed shrimp with the vegetable medley and the garlic sauce (for anyone who wanted to know). The waitress gave us their usually tasty mussels but when we had it, tasted like it needed to be washed. And it had the butt taste you get with dirty seafood.

"Sometimes, just sometimes I get in the mood for Thai food. In Williamsburg, there are a few places to turn to fix this craving, but nothing that delivers every single time.

I have spent more at diners in NJ at 3am than I did for this large portioned meal at Joya. $28 was spent on one appetizer, one bowl of soup, and two entrees. This is where it's at.Everyone seems to know about Joya. It was busy on a Saturday night with at least a 30 minute wait. I knew this coming in and luckily, Joya has a great bar with decent prices to help you through the wait. A tall Jameson&Ginger was filled 3/4 with liquor for $8. That's really nice. I had one and felt really great when I sat down for dinner. My girlfriends glass of Rosé ($7) was also filled much more than at other restaurants. Like I said before, NOW THAT'S A LOW PRICE.Joya moves people in and out at a quick rate. Once a table is done, someone comes over, wipes everything up, and new people are sitting there within 30 seconds. I'm not kidding about the 30 seconds either. They're fast. The food comes pretty quick too, so don't expect to sit for a nice long dinner. Joya is trying to get as many people to eat that night as possible. Joya is also very loud, but somehow with all the people talking and people in the kitchen banging, I could still hear my girlfriend perfectly. Thai Spare Ribs ($5.50): Not bad, not great. It was worth the try, but I wouldn't order them again.Tom Yum Koong ($3.50): Spicy, but very tasty. It would be great on a winter day.Shrimp Pad Thai ($6.95): It was really, really good. It is a basic and didn't disappoint.Spicy Noodles ($7.50): Had a kick, but my girlfriend thought the kick needed to be harder. Very tasty otherwise.I'm probably not going to mess around with any of those old Thai restaurants around Williamsburg anymore. Instead, a 10 minute drive to Cobble Hill will be perfect with the cheap, delicious eats and large drinks. Great spot, despite the CASH ONLY sticker.",5.0

Ingredients are obviously not fresh.We went around 6pm when it was fairly quiet and people were arriving for dinner. I had the summer rolls; they were bland and refrigerator-cold, and very obviously they had not been made fresh.My pad thai was also bland, and had a very distinct burnt taste, which turned out to be from the eggs, which had lots of black, charcoaly bits; after picking out lots of burned bits of egg, I decided there was no egg left, and the dish tasted burnt, so I told the waiter I would not pay for it. He merely took my plate away without saying nothing, but to their credit he did remove it from the check.My friend's vegetable pad thai was very bland -- the tamarind sauce was hardly present, with none of the classic tartness at all -- and for some reason it was served with broccoli.I observed some other dishes being served to other people, and they did not look particularly inviting.Lastly, while the place looks decent inside, the back garden looks like a cheap tourist destination. Very haphazardly decorated with plastic furniture, and they haven't even bothered to remove the price tags from their plants, which are still in their black plastic pots.",1.0
"Best Thai Restaurant I have eaten, Great food, fast service, and always busy foot traffic. Chicken fried rice, Tiger Shrimp, Mango salad, fried Banana ice cream are all the best. I would recommend being there early to make your reservations, it's always busy and jam packed but it's well worth it. You can also Dine outside if you choose.",5.0
"Nothing but great Thai food here.  I noticed the same special menu as National and later found out that Joya is another location, so you can expect that same high quality of food and service.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, try getting there during lunch hours for great deals.",4.0

I left unfulfilled. I had an overcooked grilled salmon with coconut curry and flat noodles. The curry was very coconutty but not enough spices. The curry puffs are good. Those were good. I wouldn't go back. It didn't feel Thai enough. CASH ONLY.,1.0

I went wanting a quick pad thai after a long day in the library. Not feeling like a full sit down experience I perched at the bar. It took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me. It then took another 30 minutes to get my food. The food itself is decent but the lack of attentiveness was more than off putting.,1.0

"I was craving for Thai food, so my friend drove me here to grab dinner. We had almost missed the place because of a scaffolding outside the restaurant. We entered and the atmosphere felt really warm and yet a cute place to go on a date for. At the front there is a bar area and the dining area and kitchen is towards the back. We were seated promptly by our really friendly server.To start we ordered fried calamari and Gai and Nuur Satay - skewered chicken and beef with peanut sauce. I am a die hard fan of fried calamari, so this dish was a must hehe. The calamari was really good - fried to a golden brown perfection. The skewered chicken and beef appetizer was also very good and the peanut sauce was delicious. Wished I can add peanut sauce to everything I eat...okay maybe not everything...don't think it will go well with my love for sushi and wasabi. Ew. Okay, so where was I? Right. Thai food. So my friend, a soup lover, ordered the Tom Ka Gai - coconut soup with chicken and mushrooms. This soup was good, but not great. Don't get me wrong, I really like...okay I love coconut, chicken and mushrooms, so this soup should have been like heaven for me, but it wasn't. It was just good enough for my palate, maybe if the soup base was slightly thicker? No, not thick like a stew or something, but maybe less runny?When I eat at Thai restaurants, my default entree would be a Pad Thai because I like to do a comparison between other Thai places. But this time around I did not order a Pad Thai, but instead I ordered a Woon Sen - sauteed glass noodles with chicken, mixed vegetables and egg. This dish was fresh and good. It's light and not overly salty. The portion was pretty big too, which I had to bag it to go.My friend ordered Pad See Yue - sauteed fresh flat noodles with chicken, chinese broccoli and egg in brown sauce. He was originally going to order the Pad Thai, but after our server explained to him the differences, he settled for the Pad See Yue. The portion for his entree was pretty big too and he liked his food a lot.I like Thai food in general and was very satisfied this place was not a disappointment.",4.0
I come here or their sister restaurant often for dinner (several times a month) as this is my go to thai spot.  However I came here last night and ordered the spicy noodles with pork- I should have known something was off.  The dish came out and the first thing I tasted was salt- then it all went downhill from there.  Few hours later and all day today and I have the worse case of food posioning I've had in years.  Joya you have lost a loyal customer.,1.0
The one thing that does not change no matter what time of day you go is the place is always loud. Like scream across the table loud.  Also its so basic the food does not stand out. Its thai from a thai place thats it. The sweet chili sauce that comes with the under fried calamari is good. Also the duck and mango roll. Thats it.,2.0
"Really enjoyed Joya. Went with two of my coworkers after work. We shared the calamari, crispy duck entree, and shrimp with Chinese broccoli fried rice.  Everything was wonderful especially the calamari which is a favorite of mine.  I really don't like being bothered every 5 minutes during my meal by the waiter so service was good in that sense. They have a pretty good variety of wines and beers however their drink menu (which an actual menu doesn't exist for) is very limited to margaritas (which taste like screw drivers) and mojitos (my mojito was very good)I think this is a place to bring a date to or come with friends. Will definitely come back for the calamari and fried rice! Wish they were open earlier in the day for lunch to order take outAnd the cash only thing may suck!",4.0
Walked in somewhat late on a Friday night. This place has the decor of an upscale lounge. You could just go for drinks and sit at the bar. There is also plenty of seating and a really cute outdoor patio. We opted for the patio and were seated right away. Service was really fast and food came out really fast too. Food was good and then we had our check. The entire experience probably took 40 min- maybe too fast? We were fine with it because we were looking forward to heading home to bed. No real complaints.

I only eat pad thai when i go to thai places. I was in Brooklyn for a night and this place was walking distance. The pad thai was good. I've never had bad pad thai so it's hard to say that some places are better than others. It seems very simple to make. I usually judge my thai food on price and amount of food. And Joya was cheap and gave me plenty of food. I was with 2 others that got other entrees and apps and they said both of theirs was good as well.The only downside was that it is very loud. The place is very open(including the kitchen) and you can hear everything and everyone.,4.0
I walked in and the place had a ton of energy. I've never been to a thai restaurant with so much energy and such a good vibe. The place was very inviting and the hosts/manager were friendly. I couldnt believe how reasonably priced everything was (probably because it's cash only). I had a curry which was delicious and not too heavy. The mango salad was delicious and they put a good amount of items in the salad.,5.0
"My favorite Thai place in NYC! Great Ambience (loud, trendy, dark). MUST HAVE: chicken pad Thai and curry puffs.",5.0
I liked it. It was ok. They do Thai with their own twist. You can see and hear the food being cooked in front or back of you (depending on where you sit). The food was very quick and tasty.

I only eat pad thai when i go to thai places. I was in Brooklyn for a night and this place was walking distance. The pad thai was good. I've never had bad pad thai so it's hard to say that some places are better than others. It seems very simple to make. I usually judge my thai food on price and amount of food. And Joya was cheap and gave me plenty of food. I was with 2 others that got other entrees and apps and they said both of theirs was good as well.The only downside was that it is very loud. The place is very open(including the kitchen) and you can hear everything and everyone.,4.0
I walked in and the place had a ton of energy. I've never been to a thai restaurant with so much energy and such a good vibe. The place was very inviting and the hosts/manager were friendly. I couldnt believe how reasonably priced everything was (probably because it's cash only). I had a curry which was delicious and not too heavy. The mango salad was delicious and they put a good amount of items in the salad.,5.0
"My favorite Thai place in NYC! Great Ambience (loud, trendy, dark). MUST HAVE: chicken pad Thai and curry puffs.",5.0
I liked it. It was ok. They do Thai with their own twist. You can see and hear the food being cooked in front or back of you (depending on where you sit). The food was very quick and tasty.

"Without a doubt the best Thai food in Brooklyn (and possilby NYC, but I don't want to get ahead of myself because I haven't tried it all yet). I find it hard to stray from the pad thai because everything about it is perfect. If I'm not ordering the pad thai, its always the spicy noodles with chicken. If you're dining at the restaurant, be sure to ask for the hot sauces. They won't automatically bring them unless you ask. The som tum (green papaya salad) is an excellent pair to any entree.

"Like the previous reviewers say, lots of vegetarian options. I usually order pad thai at thai restaurants but at Joya, I prefer the drunken noodle.

"Huge portions! Ugh, but fuck it, it's a cheat day. The atmosphere and dim lighting gave that romantic/friendly vibe to it. Waiters were very nice and attentive.

The kitchen was not confined in a separate room but was a part of the dining area, but big air vents suctioned any smell so no weird odor of food when one enters the restaurant. Ordered the large fried calamari appetizer ($10). The serving was huge even for my sis and I. But the calamari was fresh and the batter was light and crispy (no salt added) and a side of chili sauce to go with it. Definitely a plus. The pad thai entree ($9 each) we ordered (one shrimp and one chicken) came out in a reasonable time. The pad thai was popping with flavor (zesty lemon, tamarind sauce, peanut sauce). Better than the ones I've tried before and trust me I had shitty ones. Chicken was moist inside and shrimp tossed in the pad thai sauce as well.

"After dining here, I have to say Joya lives up to its rating. It's no pretender restaurant with dual Thai and Japanese cuisines. They have a pretty simple but fully Thai array of dishes. I've been warned about NYC food prices but I found the prices rather reasonable here. Tom ka gai comes in a large cup that I wished I had shared as opposed to each getting one. It was tasty, full of ingredients and worth finishing. Sticky rice mango salad with half chicken. I wasn't sure where this one was going but the chicken was damn good. The mangos were not yet ripe. The sticky rice was sticky to the point of being a rock. But the chicken alone made the dish. The chicken and broccoli sautéed in garlic was the worst dish. The garlic favors were muddled in the mess of gravy sauce. I'd have given Joya 5 stars had it not been for the host. He seems to know quite a lot of people, you can tell by his interactions.

"After dining here, I have to say Joya lives up to its rating. It's no pretender restaurant with dual Thai and Japanese cuisines. They have a pretty simple but fully Thai array of dishes. I've been warned about NYC food prices but I found the prices rather reasonable here. Tom ka gai comes in a large cup that I wished I had shared as opposed to each getting one. It was tasty, full of ingredients and worth finishing. Sticky rice mango salad with half chicken. I wasn't sure where this one was going but the chicken was damn good. The mangos were not yet ripe. The sticky rice was sticky to the point of being a rock. But the chicken alone made the dish. The chicken and broccoli sautéed in garlic was the worst dish. The garlic favors were muddled in the mess of gravy sauce. I'd have given Joya 5 stars had it not been for the host. He seems to know quite a lot of people, you can tell by his interactions.

"Joya WAS definitely one of my favorite places‼ When I have family & friends visiting from out of town or just a night out with the girls it's one of our top 5 choices. But today Thursday, 4/17/14.... The OWNER.... ATTITUDE & RACIST‼‼‼‼‼‼We got there (my cousin visiting from out of town & our friend) the place was über crowded the wait was 45 minutes against my better judgment my cousin wanted to stay she was excited about dining there. We sat at the bar while we waited for a table and had glasses of wine. After a while, My cousin went to ask him how much longer for a table - he stated it was 2 tables ahead of us. (Another woman who asked the same question & was disgustingly nasty to the owner, he said nothing). We had our drinks- my cousin went to the bathroom & upon her arrival the owner arrived at the same time & said to my cousin ""you don't need to give me attitude because I am the owner"" we were all like  utterly confused we didn't know what happened... 1st things first as the owner that's not the way you treat paying customers... My cousin said nothing to him upon her arrival... & proceeded to talk to us as if we were his servants... I will never under God's green earth EVER go back there‼ and if you are African American and happen to come across a short Caucasian man with short cropped hair, (THE OWNER) if you're African American I wouldn't suggest you go there either.... In this day & age it's a shame... Thanks but no thanks. If I could give 0 stars I would! Stay away!",1.0
Rly nice place but the food was average. At least what we ordered: summer rolls and papaya salad. The green shrimp curry was ok. The prices are rly low and the ambiance is nice. However it is cash only and you can get out of the place smelling like fried chicken since it is an open kitchen.,3.0
"I've heard only great things about Joya, so my friends & I decided to try it out. It was everthing that we were told it was, plus more. The food was out of this world. My friends & I all ordered a different bunch of things. I had the spring rolls, the tiger shrimp rolls and the Kang Masaman - ok so I went a little overboard but I couldn't help it. My highlight was definitely the curry - Oh my God!! I'm gonna say that it was probably one of the greatest curries that I have ever ordered and eaten out of a Thai restaurant. Joya has such a great vibe to it. Servers are overly happy and friendly. Prices are awesome - crazy cheap. Wish I had tried this place sooner...Might just head back there with the girl tomorrow for dinner.",5.0
"Delicious, cheap, and good quality Thai food. When I dined here, the Pad See Ew was simple and delicious, the calamari extremely fresh. My only complaint was that the calamari seemed a little soggy with oil, and although it was accompanied by a dipping sauce, it desperately needed some salt. Thankfully, the food issues out extremely quickly, resulting in the restaurant's high turnover of tables. So if you want to eat at Joya, but are daunted by the wait, don't let any long lines spook you! That line that you peeped sneaking out the door is actually manageable, because Joya is very efficient in getting its customers seated within a reasonable time frame.",4.0

"CHEAP and TASTY describe this cool Thai restaurant in Cobble Hill. It's a solid 4 star place considering the value.The vibe in this place is dimly lit and bustling indoors, chill and calm on the patio out back. The crowd tonight was mixed- young & old, black & white, neighborhood denizens and those who drove in or got off the F/G @ Bergen St.I've walked past several times before and it always seems busy in the evenings.They had a 15 minute wait for our table for 2, which only turned out to be ten minutes.Service was fast & attentive. We ordered the summer roll appetizer which was on the handwritten specials sheet on the table, and a small fried calamari.The summer roll was awesome- it came with some hot mustard on the side which was a great compliment for the sweet & tart sauce it was served with. The calamari came with a sweet chili dipping sauce, and there was more than enough for two.We stuck with noodles- I went for the spicy noodles with shrimp and my girl got the noodles with beef and sweet basil.Both entrees were really good, with gigantic flat noodles stir-fried with our respective choice of spices, meats and vegetables. We sat at a table near the outdoor patio and we could see everything going on in the open kitchen just steps away. Good entertainment for your evening as the fire leaps from the stove and the kitchen staff whirls around at blazing speed to cook your food.Total for all of the above and a glass of Shiraz- $42 including tip. CASH only.Joya is definitely in the rotation for a cheap and tasty meal in the hood, especially if I ever have a large group to bring out to eat.",4.0

"It must be love.I discovered this place years ago; I liked it then and I still like it now. Hands down one of the best Thai experiences you can have in the city. The food is very good, sizes are generous, and it's cheap! I wonder how they can stay in business but, hey! I'm not complaining!The restaurant has exposed bricks and large pictures, and a full view on the open kitchen, which is something I always like in a restaurant. The main dining area can get noisy, but if you can score a table in the outdoor area, you will have a much quieter atmosphere, perfect for a summer date.The last time I came here I had the spicy squid salad, which was very refreshing and really delicious! My only complain is that it wasn't much spicy at all, but I like my food rather spicy. The spicy noodles (sauteed fresh flat noodles, with mixed vegetables and egg in a chili basil sauce) were also a winner. Finally, VH (god bless her) convinced me to try the mango with sticky rice as dessert, which was fantastic! The mango was delicious, but the rice was amazing: I loved the combination of sweet and slightly salted flavors.Overall for a shared salad, two entrees, and a dessert, our check came to less than $30. That's amazing value for the kind of food you get.I also like to come here just for for drinks at the bar: a modern design that doesn't feel cold, tall glass vases with nice plant arrangements, and $8 pint-size mean mojitos.So, yes, Joya: you get 5 well deserved stars!",5.0

Hardly any sauce to speak of.  The broccoli tasted old/pungent and the meat was like leather.  The rice was complete mush - zero texture to it whatsoever.  The summer roll tasted OLD old - the shrimp tasted funky and nasty. And it had mustard sauce?

"AWESOME.Walked into the place on a Wednesday night and the place was packed!  It was recommended by many people at work so I had to give it a try-so happy I did.I'll sum up my review quickly:App: summer roll-subpar compared to any other's I've hadSoup: Tom Yum Koong was unreal.  Great portion-bold flavor, decent shrimp portion.  One of the best soups I've ever had.Entrees: Gai Kratiam sauteed sliced chicken with broccoli cabbage, carrots and onions in a fresh garlic sauce-awesome!  Huge portion, dish was so fresh, clean, flavorful and well put together.  Spicy Noodles sauteed fresh flat noodles with chicken or shrimp mixed vegetables and egg in a with basil sauce.  I didn't order this-I'm not big into Thai noodle dishes, but got a great review.Service was excellent-although I wish they indicated somewhere they do not take credit cards.  I have to walk 8 blocks to an ATM.Prices-unheard of.  Not sure how they do it.  These prices are lower than what you would pay in a middle class suburb.  $7.50 for an entrée?  Everything I reviewed came to $27.75 with tax-I would normally pay no less than $45 for what we ordered.Great atmosphere and would make a great first date place (and cheap date as well ;) )They lose a star for not accepting credit cards (and not paying 3% credit card fee and maybe Uncle Sam)",4.0

I say yes!We started off with a small order of fried calamari and an order of their special spicy bbq chicken wings.  First of all, the SMALL order was HUGE, which was a pleasant surprise.... the calamari was fried perfectly and the sauce accompanying it was fantastic.  The wings were great as well.  My friend and I were tempted to lick the sauce off the plate it was so good.  For our entrees I ordered the green basil curry and he the red penang curry.  Both were super flavorful.  We couldn't get enough --  we even asked for more rice it was so good.  Needless to say I was in a full food coma less than half an hour after I got home.The only downside was we were seated at the tables near the front by the bar, so it was pretty crowded and people kept bumping into my chair.  Service was a little rushed, but since there was such a long wait after us I can understand.Will I go back?!  YES!  Sure, the wait was long but it was some of the best food I've had in a while -- and cheap too!!",4.0
"Would have given this place 5 stars after our first visit.  Went with my folks and the food was excellent.  We shared the Calamari, 2 Pad Thais, and Green Curry,  Everything was amazing.  The service was decent, and the prices were pretty good.Fast forward a month and we went again.  The Pad Thai was really off.  Couldn't quite place it, but it was way too salty and didn't taste like the first time.  We asked if there was a new chef in the back or what, but apparently everything was normal.  The calamari was under-seasoned this time too, but the curry was still good.  Will come back a 3rd time to see what is the true story but was really disappointed the 2nd time we went back...",3.0

"one of my FAVORITES in the neighborhood... I've been going for 6 years.  The prices are great (though the last time i was there it seemed they were a little higher.) Bottles of wine are pretty cheap.  I take all my out of town visitors here and they love it.Mango salad is the best- its rarely on the menu, but they always have it....",5.0
"AWESOME.Walked into the place on a Wednesday night and the place was packed!  It was recommended by many people at work so I had to give it a try-so happy I did.I'll sum up my review quickly:App: summer roll-subpar compared to any other's I've hadSoup: Tom Yum Koong was unreal.  Great portion-bold flavor, decent shrimp portion.  One of the best soups I've ever had.Entrees: Gai Kratiam sauteed sliced chicken with broccoli cabbage, carrots and onions in a fresh garlic sauce-awesome!  Huge portion, dish was so fresh, clean, flavorful and well put together.  Spicy Noodles sauteed fresh flat noodles with chicken or shrimp mixed vegetables and egg in a with basil sauce.  I didn't order this-I'm not big into Thai noodle dishes, but got a great review.Service was excellent-although I wish they indicated somewhere they do not take credit cards.  I have to walk 8 blocks to an ATM.Prices-unheard of.  Not sure how they do it.  These prices are lower than what you would pay in a middle class suburb.  $7.50 for an entrée?  Everything I reviewed came to $27.75 with tax-I would normally pay no less than $45 for what we ordered.Great atmosphere and would make a great first date place (and cheap date as well ;) )They lose a star for not accepting credit cards (and not paying 3% credit card fee and maybe Uncle Sam)",4.0

"Pretty packed here on a Monday night. Atmosphere is dim and loud, they should have a hostess in the front here to seat people because the crowds at the bar waiting for a table block the waiters from seeing new diners come in.

I ordered the spicy seafood fried rice and it was on point. Mild spice with lots of shrimp, not too much grease. Tom yum soup wasnt memorable, I've definetly had better.The prices are pretty reasonable, but in the end......Sripraphai in Woodside is still #1 in my book.

"Joya is a nice reliable Thai option. They have a pretty cool outdoor area, the food is reasonably priced, has inexpensive wine bottle options, food taste great and has a good overall ambience.

Tonight I was served the wrong dish by mistake. This was quickly fixed and the waiter even offered to wrap up the wrong dish hat I wasn't charged for, so that I could take it home.

I was disappointed, but flexible. I asked the waiter what was vegetarian on the menu- any other curry? Pad Thai? Salad?...Anything?

"This was my second trip to Joya; the first being around 3 years ago.First off the Appetizers.

In this case, it did not disappoint. The noodles were a perfect texture, and cooked properly (if perhaps served a little hot), and the wait staff was great.My only real complaints?1) Like a lot of restaurants in the area, they only take cash.2) Unlike a lot of restaurants, there is virtually ZERO separation between the restrooms and the main dining area.

I started with the spring roll, which had a nice sweet sauce. Then I had the mushroom veggie salad, which I picked clean. Finished with the spicy noodles, which was oily but good. I know this is strange, but the spicy noodles tasted like pizza. I don't know how to explain it, but maybe it is due to the oil on the noodles? Weird. At any rate, everyone left sated and satisfied on a cold and soggy night.",4.0
"Not impressed! Noisy atmosphere ! I went to Joya by recommendation! We shared the calamari that was just okay also had the mussels that where so salty the waiter took them of the bill,which was a good thing but my question is why did they come out of the kitchen like that? I don't think I would go back!",2.0
"4.5 stars for this place.Thanks to all the previous Yelpers, this place didn't disappoint (for the most part).Went outside to the seating area and enjoyed the sun.Waiters and waitress are responsive. Very attentive to customers inside and outside.Wanted fried spring rolls, and the kick? Waiter: Sorry it's not availableMe: Uh... what?Waiter: We don't have oil todayMe: O.o''Anyhoo, ordered the Skewered Chicken, Grilled Steak and Fried Rice, and the Mamasan (I probably mispelled this) curry.Skewered chicken was ok. Had some peanut sauce and light veggie dip.Grilled Steak and rice looked really good. Very large plate. My friend couldn't finish it. Very generous portion of rice.Mamasan Curry was smooth. Light coconut and mild. Comes with rice that should just be tossed into the sauce. It's so tasty. I ordered it with beef and it was pretty tough to chew.Overall, great place for lunch for the prices. Goodness, very affordable. NOTE: bring cash, no credit cards!Hopefully next time I can get the fried spring rolls for the extra 0.5 stars.",4.0
"Whether for lunch or dinner, Joya is an awesome place to eat. I am a fan! The restaurant is clean, the service is quick and the wait staff are very friendly. However Joya can get a little loud and packed so be warned!",4.0
"I ordered the chicken and vegetables in garlic sauce. It just looked like they drowned everything in garlic sauce before they brought it out to me. The chicken looked very sappy (like how fingers look when you've been in a pool/shower for too long) . It tasted ok , slightly salty but i could not finish it. It was TOO wet if that makes any sense lol. The cranberry juice is very sweet, it tasted like cranberry cocktail with loads of sugar packets.

Joya is one of my favorite thai restaurants. You get so much for your money's worth! I love the Pad se ew and the mango salad. They have great drinks as well. The only thing to remember is that is CASH ONLY! You don't want to end up on a first date with credit card only! This is a must for thai lovers! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,4.0
"Joys used to be just that - a joy of a restaurant.  Flavorful Thai food at reasonable prices.  But about a year ago something changed in the kitchen - for the worse.The paad thai was once a staple - the glassine noodles were firm, tasty and infused with flavor.  Now they resemble the typical congealed glop of most Thai takeout joints.The fried calamari was once crisp and light.  Now the fried crust is sodden with oil.The ribs were once tender, chewy and fall off the bone delicious.  Now they are tough and the quality of the meat seems to have dropped off.This used to be a staple for delivery or a quick and cheap meal.  What a  shame to see the quality drop so dramatically.",2.0
"ill start by saying this place is good and really deserves more of a 3.5.everything is good. but maybe thats just it... its just good. certainly great for the price point. you can definitely eat dinner for $8-$15. the wait is always insane, though the service is good.portion size is good for how much you're paying.never had anything i didn't like, minus a questionable calamari appetizer special.this is a good place to go on a weeknight when you don't want to spend a lot of time thinking about what you want to eat. americanized thai food is always a safe bet!",3.0

Okay I went here on a Saturday night with a friend for dinner. The Good: The food was definitely tasty. Although my Woon Sen was overcooked. The dish was great even the day after when I ate the left overs. My friend enjoyed his dish which were the flat noodles with beef and broccoli in brown sauce. The Bad: The resturant was packed but that was to be expected on a saturday night Derr . But we had to damn near trip our waiter to get him to stop. The customer service was not up to par. There were long periods when the waiter was no were to be found...I mean dont chase me down later if you get a poor tip or no tip at all..You have to work for that. It's just that simpleThe Ugly: Back to my friend's food. He later confessed to me that he enjoyed his food however he could not finish it due to a leaky ceiling. It was a rainy saturday so we expected to have a good dinner and some shelter from the rain NOT to be rained on in the damn resturant. When we couldnt take it anymore we moved the table over a few feet and it was all good FOR ABOUT 10 MINS! The ceiling was leaking again. At that point my friend saw a drop fall right into his plate... he was over the whole situation threw his fork down and said that it was time to go. The only thing they brought really quick was the check!I will try Joya again...the atmosphere was busy and trendy however NYC is filled with many better options for Thai food sans the leaky ceilings.,3.0

"The food is undeniably good at Joya. Last time we tried a special appetizer (a curried puff), green curry, and one of the chicken + veggies in garlic sauce dishes. Don't ask me to remember which one, because there are at least a half dozen that have some combination of protein+veggie+garlic sauce.

"Ate here for dinner with my husband.  Arrived at 7:40, had a 20 minute wait.  Service was okay.  Nothing outstanding, but not horrible either.  Food was good, but not great.  Ordered Rad Nah; which is basically starch soup gravy over flat rice noodle.  Also also ordered Nauh Pad Kra Praow; which is beef basil.  Both dishes had beef and had the beef been more tender it would have taste really good.  After a few bites it started hurting my teeth.  So overall, it was okay.  Better than a lot of other Thai places, but I still like Nusara in Queens more.",3.0
"My boyfriend & I finally tried this place last night-- it's long been on our ""list""-- & we both had a great experience. First of all, it's CHEAP!  Most of the entrees are like $8 or $9.  And the portions are BIG!  (Just look at all the people walking out with doggie bags. Go ahead!  LOOK!!)  The food was great too.  I got the pineapple pork fried rice.  The portion was enormous & it was very tasty.  It was a tad on the oily side, but I was still happy with it.  My boyfriend ordered the Kang Gai curry & he absolutely loved it.  He ate every last drop of that stuff!  He was ENAMORED with it!  I was getting jealous!!We ordered the chicken curry puffs (a special, apparently) as an appetizer & the bill still only came to like, $22... TOTAL.  Of course we opted against having drinks that night, but that wouldn't have done much damage.  What's also nice about this place is that it's sleek & clean, with a modern decor.  The bar area is very hip (I hate that word) & seems to pack in a nice crowd at night.  The kitchen is exposed, which is cool.  And it looks like they have DJs spinning regularly, though not the night we were there, which is probably a good thing, as other reviewers say it tends to get a bit loud.  But we had a very nice first experience at Joya.  We will definitely be back next time we want to go out for a quick meal without spending a fortune (which is often!).UPDATE: A few months after writing this review, my bf & I continue to come here A LOT.  And we're always happy with the food, prices, etc.  But here's one word of warning: do not ever call in order to pick up!!!  In fact, don't ever call them, period.  They are like, seriously incompetent when it comes to answering/working their phone.",4.0
"Food is good and reasonably priced. My favorite is Chicken Penang Curry, which can vary in taste slightly time to time. The Pad Thai is also great. The have an awesome outdoor area in back during the summer. These facts earn it four stars. I'm a fan. However, there are some things I'm not a fan of:They should take ""delivery"" off of their menu. It's like winning the lottery if you can get someone on the phone there at night. I guess that's because the food is good and reasonably priced.  Also, the music in the restaurant is often too loud. I don't know who is in charge of bars and restaurants that thinks obscenely loud music is what people want. Generally, I think people would enjoy talking without shouting.",4.0
"I picked this place for delivery based on yelp reviews, and really don't get what the big deal is.  First, I called several times throughout 30 min, and got a busy signal every time.  When it finally rang, I waited for literally about 20 rings before someone finally picked up.When I ordered, she almost hung up twice before I was done ordering - I wanted a drink, and to know the total.The food: the salad was good-sized, but with the dressing were lighter.  Rama peanut sauce doesn't act like a good dressing for greens.  Yummy, but heavy.  I also ordered the Moo Kratiam, pork in a chili basil sauce with veggies.  Generally chili sauces are spicy, and this had absolutely NO spice at all.  Plus, the sauce was really watery.The can of diet coke was delivered warm, and there were no utensils.  I'm staying in a hotel so that was a problem; I'm good with chopsticks, but salad is tough.Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  Maybe I just didn't order the right things.  2 stars = decent food, good value.",2.0

The apps are all good the service is always fast the Pad Thai is very greasy so I would stay away and the bill is always cheap! Very crowded, stay away on the weekends unless you don't mind waiting over an hour to be seated!",3.0
"I have been here about 10 times since moving to Brooklyn 2 years ago. This place is a steal! Great thai food for a great price, with very large portions. It's usually packed, so get there early. They don't take reservations and only deliver to some locations in the area. Appetizers: Calamari is delicious - has a nice kick to it!Entrees: Pad Thai and the Spicy Noodles are delicious and have not been an upset yet!Cash only. But, this place is so good that I get cravings for it. Also has an backdoor patio for dining.",5.0
"Came here for lunch. I ordered the pad thai with chicken and really enjoyed it! Tasty, not too heavy, flavorful and a huge portion! My sister had the spicy vegetable noodles which apparently weren't spicy at all. The veg spring rolls were really greasy. Service was a little spotty but the prices are cheap so it was kind of expected. With that said, I'll come back.",3.0
"Went here last night for some cheap dinner.Our bill came up to $33 for 2 appetizers, 2 drinks and 2 main courses.I had the chicken curry with coconut sauce and peanuts. It wasn't bad at all and the portions were generous.Would come back here again since it's in the neighborhood.I do however prefer the curry in Ghang which is one block away...",3.0
"Ate here for dinner with my husband.  Arrived at 7:40, had a 20 minute wait.  Service was okay.  Nothing outstanding, but not horrible either.  Food was good, but not great.  Ordered Rad Nah; which is basically starch soup gravy over flat rice noodle.  Also also ordered Nauh Pad Kra Praow; which is beef basil.  Both dishes had beef and had the beef been more tender it would have taste really good.  After a few bites it started hurting my teeth.  So overall, it was okay.  Better than a lot of other Thai places, but I still like Nusara in Queens more.",3.0
"My boyfriend & I finally tried this place last night-- it's long been on our ""list""-- & we both had a great experience. First of all, it's CHEAP!  Most of the entrees are like $8 or $9.  And the portions are BIG!  (Just look at all the people walking out with doggie bags. Go ahead!  LOOK!!)  The food was great too.  I got the pineapple pork fried rice.  The portion was enormous & it was very tasty.  It was a tad on the oily side, but I was still happy with it.  My boyfriend ordered the Kang Gai curry & he absolutely loved it.  He ate every last drop of that stuff!  He was ENAMORED with it!  I was getting jealous!!We ordered the chicken curry puffs (a special, apparently) as an appetizer & the bill still only came to like, $22... TOTAL.  Of course we opted against having drinks that night, but that wouldn't have done much damage.  What's also nice about this place is that it's sleek & clean, with a modern decor.  The bar area is very hip (I hate that word) & seems to pack in a nice crowd at night.  The kitchen is exposed, which is cool.  And it looks like they have DJs spinning regularly, though not the night we were there, which is probably a good thing, as other reviewers say it tends to get a bit loud.  But we had a very nice first experience at Joya.  We will definitely be back next time we want to go out for a quick meal without spending a fortune (which is often!).UPDATE: A few months after writing this review, my bf & I continue to come here A LOT.  And we're always happy with the food, prices, etc.  But here's one word of warning: do not ever call in order to pick up!!!  In fact, don't ever call them, period.  They are like, seriously incompetent when it comes to answering/working their phone.",4.0
"Food is good and reasonably priced. My favorite is Chicken Penang Curry, which can vary in taste slightly time to time. The Pad Thai is also great. The have an awesome outdoor area in back during the summer. These facts earn it four stars. I'm a fan. However, there are some things I'm not a fan of:They should take ""delivery"" off of their menu. It's like winning the lottery if you can get someone on the phone there at night. I guess that's because the food is good and reasonably priced.  Also, the music in the restaurant is often too loud. I don't know who is in charge of bars and restaurants that thinks obscenely loud music is what people want. Generally, I think people would enjoy talking without shouting.",4.0
"I picked this place for delivery based on yelp reviews, and really don't get what the big deal is.  First, I called several times throughout 30 min, and got a busy signal every time.  When it finally rang, I waited for literally about 20 rings before someone finally picked up.When I ordered, she almost hung up twice before I was done ordering - I wanted a drink, and to know the total.The food: the salad was good-sized, but with the dressing were lighter.  Rama peanut sauce doesn't act like a good dressing for greens.  Yummy, but heavy.  I also ordered the Moo Kratiam, pork in a chili basil sauce with veggies.  Generally chili sauces are spicy, and this had absolutely NO spice at all.  Plus, the sauce was really watery.The can of diet coke was delivered warm, and there were no utensils.  I'm staying in a hotel so that was a problem; I'm good with chopsticks, but salad is tough.Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  Maybe I just didn't order the right things.  2 stars = decent food, good value.",2.0
"I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, but I've ordered carry-out and delivery plenty of times now.  This is the best Thai restaurant in the area that I've tried, and conveniently, it's also the cheapest!  I love the pad thai and the fried rice and the curries.  Never had anything bad here, and they are super quick (impressive given they are so busy, like, all the time).  And best of all, they deliver to south Brooklyn Heights even though it's quite a hike.",5.0
"My friend and I are from SoCal and were exploring Brooklyn and really craving Thai food so we yelped and found this place. It was pretty good. The customer service was great, the decor lovely, and the food was good. The Thom Yum Koong was delicious! The Pad Thai noodles weren't my fav, too crunchy for my liking, and the third dish we had (name I can't remember) was decent but sort of lacking in flavor. Overall I did enjoy my experience and my friend thought everything was delicious so that's why I'm giving it a 4 star rating. For me the food would be a 3-star the decor 4.5 star and customer service 4.5 star.",4.0
"One of my faves! The food is delish, some of the best noodles I've tried by far. Everything tastes beyond fresh and the prices are very reasonable. Joya is my go to thai joint in Brooklyn.",4.0
"This place is always busy because the food is good, the portions are big and the price is cheap! Totally worth the wait.I haven't found another Thai place I like as much as Joya. I just moved out of Brooklyn, and I crave the food here! If you order wine, you get a huge glass, but otherwise the drinks are just as expensive as the meals, and on the weak side.",4.0
"NOTE: I am NOT an expert in Thai food. I can't tell you if the food is authentic or not, only if it tastes good. I have been to this restaurant many times and I have seen it change over time. The atmosphere is very trendy with music playing and various picture frames on the wall. Everyone from graphic tees to blazers are welcome there. There is a full bar and the bartender can make a decent Gin Tonic and Mojito. There is usually a wait of a half hour after 5pm. The food portions have decreased over the years. Used to have to take food home now it seems to be an average size portion. Despite the change in portion size the food is still delicious. Fried calamari is lightly battered and comes with deliciously sweet dipping sauce. I would even buy extra at the end of dinner to take home. The spring roll is very light and flaky. The entrees are equally delicious. The pineapple fried rice was very tasty with the mixture of walnuts and pineapples made the dish very savory. The curry dishes were delicious as well. WARNING green curry is spicy RED curry is FIRE. The curry was well complimented with the assorted vegetables. All in all a great experience and I will be returning.",4.0
"You'd expect this restaurant to be more expensive because of the location and the large amount of food, but it's exactly opposite.

The staff is also great and attentive.     **Cash only!",4.0
it gets 5 stars because it's the most affordable and NICE and DELICIOUS restaurant out here. (will update if i find more)I ordered the green curry. It was just spicy enough with rich coconut milk and the curry blends with the vegetables and chicken very well! And it's less than 8 dollars + rice :) Love it for my student budget! and ambiance is also pretty trendy-like and fun.Will definitely go back to try all the different dishes that others mentioned!

This is the other great Thai place in Cobble Hill.  The only real down side is it's cash only....  The food is spicy and well-flavored.  There's a decent wine list and the usual lineup of beers.  One standout thing is the specials: you almost can't go wrong.,4.0

"Joya is perfect if you're looking for tasty, cheap Thai food - and quick. I used to live down the street from Joya. I'd call them to place an order for my favorite tofu green curry. By the time I'd bundled up for the cold and walked to the restaurant, my order would be waiting for me. Even in warm weather when I didn't lose time to bundling up, I rarely have had to wait longer than about 5 minutes if I had called in the order and walked over straight away. The green curry is deliciously spicy and flavorful. I'm a bit of a spice wimp, so those of you who love love love spice may not find it spicy enough. The portion seems big as I have a hard time finishing the entire serving of green curry and rice in one meal. It even gets more deliciously spicy upon reheating! Joya seems like quite the scene on weekends. Every time I walk by during a weekend dinner, it's PACKED with people. Love the full bar, but wish they took credit cards.

Just steps away from Smith Street's various attractions, it's the perfect combination of a great bistro atmosphere and an inexpensive Thai kitchen.Joya has a full bar (expensive but strong so it balances out) and good music (DJ but a nice mix, not crazy clubby) and very affordable Thai dishes that run the gamut from classics to fresh new ideas. Great calamari, hand rolls, and other starter temptations. There's also a nice little patio out back. For someone who was never really a big Thai food fan, Joya brought me into the fold.",4.0

But they have a full bar, I couldn't take advantage of that..lol. I had the Tom Yum soup and the basil shrimp. I loved the soup! Just wished it was a little more spicy, and the basil shrimp was really really good. I don't have any complaints and my friend didn't either, he had the basil chicken. We both shared the fried banana and ice cream dessert. That was my first time trying it and its nothing to rave about but there was nothing bad about it either.

"My now husband and I have been regulars at Joya's since 2002 when we first met...   We have always been huge fans of this restaurant/ lounge and regulars (eating there at least once every two weeks.... at times once a week), great food, great drinks, very reasonable price, awesome service and very small wait time. I will say that our last visits have not been the best, the waiters who are usually very pleasant and attending were rushing this time around.  The wait was much longer than usual and the place really didn't have the feel it has for me in the past.  I always noticed the owners at the location, but for the past two or three years it hasn't been that way and it obvious its affecting the great feel i loved about Joya's. However the food still remains to be amazing and my favorites still are the apple martini and the chicken Pad Se Yu.  And ofcourse...no one makes a better calimari in my opinion!  I absolutely love the spice rack (which i have to admit my husband got me into).  I love the place and what i like the most about it is that you can be a couple, a group of friends or a family with children and still each one of these different groups will find the place to be very enjoyable and the food to be amazing!",4.0

"Joya is perfect if you're looking for tasty, cheap Thai food - and quick. I used to live down the street from Joya. I'd call them to place an order for my favorite tofu green curry. By the time I'd bundled up for the cold and walked to the restaurant, my order would be waiting for me. Even in warm weather when I didn't lose time to bundling up, I rarely have had to wait longer than about 5 minutes if I had called in the order and walked over straight away. The green curry is deliciously spicy and flavorful. I'm a bit of a spice wimp, so those of you who love love love spice may not find it spicy enough. The portion seems big as I have a hard time finishing the entire serving of green curry and rice in one meal. It even gets more deliciously spicy upon reheating! Joya seems like quite the scene on weekends. Every time I walk by during a weekend dinner, it's PACKED with people. Love the full bar, but wish they took credit cards. Full bar and cash only don't seem to work well together.",4.0

"I ordered take-out from here tonight after about a year of living in the neighborhood and hearing good things about it. Usually, I get my Thai in Queens or Manhattan, but I had a craving and with so many places in the neighborhood I figured I'd go for the one I'd heard so much about. My friend and I ordered a few things: - Thai Summer rolls (usually my favorite): I would pass entirely on these the next time. They were a bit bland, and rather than rice noodles they were filled with chopped shrimp and small cubes of tofu which I found weird. There weren't enough herbs to give them freshness or kick, although the spicy mustard and peanut sauce served with them was good. Also at $3.50 a roll they were very expensive because they were also a lot smaller than the standard summer rolls you get in Thai and Vietnamese places. - Papaya salad: This was also a bit bland. Although it was a good portion, it needed more contrast in the flavors and more kick. Even the shot or sriracha I added didn't improve it much. - Spicy Squid salad: The squid (mostly rings) was not rubbery, but was also bland. The squid was steamed or boiled but wasn't allowed to drain properly before marinating because it was wet but not flavorful. I also could have done without the cherry tomatoes, which only accentuated the squid's lack of flavor. The portion was good though, so some herbs, lime and chili would make this much better.- Chicken Pad Thai: Good flavor; not too oily or too sweet - balanced; chicken flavorful and juicy; but needs more veggies for color and flavor. I would order this again.  - Shrimp Spicy Noodle: Best dish. This was tasty and had a balanced flavor. There was a good balance of shrimp and veggies and the (wide) noodles were perfectly cooked. Would also order this again.So, although I would probably would order from here again, it's not at the top of my list. My inclination is that summer rolls and papaya salad are to Thai restaurants what Greek salad is to a diner: if the restaurant can't do it well, it's a marker of what's to come.",3.0

I have eaten apps and entrees, had multiple cocktails, two bottles of wine and the bill for 6= $106. Holy shit. The food is fantastic. This is a top Asian cuisine, in a great neighborhood, amazing space, outdoor patio, great bar...for the price of a sandwhich. Each time I come, I am shocked at the quality and low cost.

"This spot is pretty cool. The decor is simple, yet nice. Very casual. The prices were very reasonable. Chill vibe.The food? Awesome! We ordered spring rolls to start, which were very good, although my friend pointed out that the chef was a tad heavy on the pepper.  For our meals, I ordered a vegetarian Pad Thai and my friend had a grilled salmon dish with veggies and white rice. Both of us agreed that the food was superb. However, the service was TERRIBLE. While our appetizer arrived within a fairly decent amount of time, our food took 25-30 minutes to come out. We ordered spring rolls (blindly), assuming there would be more than two. Once we felt that the server redeemed himself because of how delicious the food was, he took even longer to bring us the check. On top of that, he gave the check to a much larger party, before our two-party table. Throughout the entire dining experience, he was not attentive whatsoever. He didn't even look in our direction.

"Amazing flavors, HUGE gigantic portions, and so so dirt cheap! Mmm, I'm craving it right now just writing this... The food for the price makes this place unbeatable.

Good. Fast. Nothing super impressive but a good standby. Curries are good - ESP the green one. Garlic sauce is light and not too thick - also a plus. Veggies are pretty fresh but the beef could have been better. Def try the chicken curry dumplings for an appetizer - those were awesome.,3.0

"The food at this place is amazing! Its very cute and cozy PERFECT for dates. In the summer there is outside seating in the back which is pretty nice as well. The FOOD is made in an exposed kitchen so you can see your food being made from where you sit. At night the trendy little bar at the entrance of the bar is buzzing!The MANGO salad is scrumptious! It has an awesome mix of two types of lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, peanuts, cilantro, fresh sliced mango with a little tang! Topped with a lemony dressing that is refreshing and the entire salad EXPLODES with flavor in your mouth.  The pad thai is amazing with chicken, the noodles are cooked to perfection with fresh bean sprouts its one of the most popular dishes! Soy substitute for you vegetarians out there! Also if you want something spicy try the spicy basil flat noodles!The 5 stars I'm giving this place isn't for fine dining, because its not. The 5 stars is for the cozyness of this restaurant and the food at an affordable price! The perfect place for a intimate dinner and drinks at the bar after",5.0
"My first visit to Joya was very positive.  I was surprised to have to wait 20 minutes for a table for 8 on a Tuesday night at 9pm... no biggie.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen area and I noticed they also have a cute little intimate outdoor patio in the backyard.We ordered a large fried calamari for our table and there were plenty to go around.  The chili dipping sauce was good and had a little spicy kick.  We also ordered mango salads which was refreshing for a warm humid night.  For entree, I had the fried whole sea bass and it was piled with Chinese broccoli on top of brown gravy served with white rice - no complains there.  The size of the dish was generous and very satisfying.  I also tasted the soft shell crab (thought it was a bit salty but overall the crab was big and cooked just right) and Woon Sen (very tasty but the glass noodles broke into little pieces).  For drinks, my friend ordered a lychee martini.. it was strong and not too sweet.For 8 of us, we ordered a large fried calamari, 2 mango salads, a chicken satay, 8 entrees and a drink and the bill only came out to $144 including gratuity.. that's only $18 per person for a lot of food!!  I would definitely go back to this restaurant based on the good food, affordability and decor.  I didn't see any of the service problems some of the reviewers mentioned... sure the check came a little slow but we weren't in a hurry.  Overall, we enjoyed our visit.",4.0

Hard to believe this was my first time eating at Joya in all my years living in the 718. We arrived before 6:30pm and were surprised that the place was packed-okay it was Saturday but I have a theory: Now that it is after daylight savings time it gets dark and people don't know what the hell to do with themselves so they go eat.At the bar we sampled a yummy pinot and were seated int he next 15-20 minutes. My friend ordered some apps from the specials menu-chive cakes (we share an obsession with scallion pancakes and i think the hope was these would be similar) She got green curry I opted for a salad and the pad see yew. I would have expected a salad with less iceberg type lettuce but I ate a  lot of it because I needed some roughage (a-hem) the spicy vinagarette was spicy indeed and there was a bit too much dressing. The pad see yew arrived and I could tell immediately it was a teeny bit burnt and oh so greasy. Burnt is not so good but greasy can be kind of delicious in its own way.The prices are pretty cheap which is an upside. I would go back but not expecting to be blown away,3.0
"I was one of the first customers through the door when Joya opened, and I have continued to be loyal to Andrew and Ariel and their terrific restaurant ever since!My only beef is that they became such a hotspot that it can be really hard to get a table without waiting...and once you are in there, most nights can get really noisy.  It is a very hard place to go for a private meeting or date!  I tend to go there more for carryout these days.  Their prices are phenomenal for the quality of the food and the portions, and the majority of their kitchen staff have remained with them since opening day- so the quality is always consistent.  To this day, it is still the absolute best Pad Thai and best Spicy Noodles I have ever had at any Thai restaurant anywhere- and I have sampled a LOT of Pad Thai...all over the country!",5.0
"I gave it another try, due to Lucali's being booked for the night. NEVER AGAIN!!!OMG! This restaurant needs to fire their SASSY host ASAP!!! He is extremely unpleasant when it comes to dealing with customers, which is PRETTY important for a HOST. My family and I planned on having dinner for my birthday, 11/12. I called 2 hours in advance to make a reservation, to which they replied they don't take reservations on the weekend. Understandable.I arrived for my dinner but we had to wait for the entire party to arrive, Again, understandable.The entire party arrives, and I notify the host. With an attitude, he states that he'll let me know when the first table is available. then he proceeds to ask, ""how many people are in the party?"" I tell him, ""6"".10 minutes later, he calls me and tells me the table is ready. As we walk over he brings us to a table prepped to seat 4!I tell him there's 6 of us, he then exclaims, ""you told me 4, this table cannot seat 6 people!""I let him know that we'll just continue to wait in the entrance. I took it upon myself to walk over to Ghang Thai to see if they had any available tables and they did, THANK GOD!!!When I arrived back at Joya to let my party know that we can leave, I'm hit with the fact that the host offered us a table while I was gone but what they had done was push two tables together that weren't leveled on top and when my sister brought that to the host's attention he said, ""What's the big deal? You're just gonna sit, eat, and leave.""ARE YOU SERIOUS???I would never recommend this place, let alone go back. Ugh...",1.0
"I wanted to see what the big deal was with this place.  It's always mobbed outside, and the decor made the menu look swanky.  So I took my girlfriend here for dinner after a long day at work.  We were both starving and the 30 minute wait didn't make things better.  After being seated we quickly ordered the Fried Tofu which was served quickly and inhaled ever quicker.  Tasty - ok, now where's our veggie Pad Thai?Twenty minutes later it's served and I take the first big bite - right into a piece of chicken.  Thank you Joya for breaking my ten year vegetarian streak.",1.0
"The food at this place is amazing! Its very cute and cozy PERFECT for dates. In the summer there is outside seating in the back which is pretty nice as well. The FOOD is made in an exposed kitchen so you can see your food being made from where you sit. At night the trendy little bar at the entrance of the bar is buzzing!The MANGO salad is scrumptious! It has an awesome mix of two types of lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, peanuts, cilantro, fresh sliced mango with a little tang! Topped with a lemony dressing that is refreshing and the entire salad EXPLODES with flavor in your mouth.  The pad thai is amazing with chicken, the noodles are cooked to perfection with fresh bean sprouts its one of the most popular dishes! Soy substitute for you vegetarians out there! Also if you want something spicy try the spicy basil flat noodles!The 5 stars I'm giving this place isn't for fine dining, because its not. The 5 stars is for the cozyness of this restaurant and the food at an affordable price! The perfect place for a intimate dinner and drinks at the bar after",5.0
"My first visit to Joya was very positive.  I was surprised to have to wait 20 minutes for a table for 8 on a Tuesday night at 9pm... no biggie.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen area and I noticed they also have a cute little intimate outdoor patio in the backyard.We ordered a large fried calamari for our table and there were plenty to go around.  The chili dipping sauce was good and had a little spicy kick.  We also ordered mango salads which was refreshing for a warm humid night.  For entree, I had the fried whole sea bass and it was piled with Chinese broccoli on top of brown gravy served with white rice - no complains there.  The size of the dish was generous and very satisfying.  I also tasted the soft shell crab (thought it was a bit salty but overall the crab was big and cooked just right) and Woon Sen (very tasty but the glass noodles broke into little pieces).  For drinks, my friend ordered a lychee martini.. it was strong and not too sweet.For 8 of us, we ordered a large fried calamari, 2 mango salads, a chicken satay, 8 entrees and a drink and the bill only came out to $144 including gratuity.. that's only $18 per person for a lot of food!!  I would definitely go back to this restaurant based on the good food, affordability and decor.  I didn't see any of the service problems some of the reviewers mentioned... sure the check came a little slow but we weren't in a hurry.  Overall, we enjoyed our visit.",4.0

Great variety in the menu and the place was clean! Loved the relaxed atmosphere mixed with the chaos of the kitchen. My dish was a little salty but it could be my tastebuds. My wife absolutely loved her spicy noodles. Too bad this is a cash only establishment...they could rake in sooooo much more business.  Outdoor seating in the back.,4.0
Hard to believe this was my first time eating at Joya in all my years living in the 718. We arrived before 6:30pm and were surprised that the place was packed-okay it was Saturday but I have a theory: Now that it is after daylight savings time it gets dark and people don't know what the hell to do with themselves so they go eat.At the bar we sampled a yummy pinot and were seated int he next 15-20 minutes. My friend ordered some apps from the specials menu-chive cakes (we share an obsession with scallion pancakes and i think the hope was these would be similar) She got green curry I opted for a salad and the pad see yew. I would have expected a salad with less iceberg type lettuce but I ate a  lot of it because I needed some roughage (a-hem) the spicy vinagarette was spicy indeed and there was a bit too much dressing. The pad see yew arrived and I could tell immediately it was a teeny bit burnt and oh so greasy. Burnt is not so good but greasy can be kind of delicious in its own way.The prices are pretty cheap which is an upside. I would go back but not expecting to be blown away,3.0
"I was one of the first customers through the door when Joya opened, and I have continued to be loyal to Andrew and Ariel and their terrific restaurant ever since!My only beef is that they became such a hotspot that it can be really hard to get a table without waiting...and once you are in there, most nights can get really noisy.  It is a very hard place to go for a private meeting or date!  I tend to go there more for carryout these days.  Their prices are phenomenal for the quality of the food and the portions, and the majority of their kitchen staff have remained with them since opening day- so the quality is always consistent.  To this day, it is still the absolute best Pad Thai and best Spicy Noodles I have ever had at any Thai restaurant anywhere- and I have sampled a LOT of Pad Thai...all over the country!",5.0
"I gave it another try, due to Lucali's being booked for the night. NEVER AGAIN!!!OMG! This restaurant needs to fire their SASSY host ASAP!!! He is extremely unpleasant when it comes to dealing with customers, which is PRETTY important for a HOST. My family and I planned on having dinner for my birthday, 11/12. I called 2 hours in advance to make a reservation, to which they replied they don't take reservations on the weekend. Understandable.I arrived for my dinner but we had to wait for the entire party to arrive, Again, understandable.The entire party arrives, and I notify the host. With an attitude, he states that he'll let me know when the first table is available. then he proceeds to ask, ""how many people are in the party?"" I tell him, ""6"".10 minutes later, he calls me and tells me the table is ready. As we walk over he brings us to a table prepped to seat 4!I tell him there's 6 of us, he then exclaims, ""you told me 4, this table cannot seat 6 people!""I let him know that we'll just continue to wait in the entrance. I took it upon myself to walk over to Ghang Thai to see if they had any available tables and they did, THANK GOD!!!When I arrived back at Joya to let my party know that we can leave, I'm hit with the fact that the host offered us a table while I was gone but what they had done was push two tables together that weren't leveled on top and when my sister brought that to the host's attention he said, ""What's the big deal?

"Put simply, I love Joya. It will always be my favorite Thai restaurant. I've considered moving, just to be close enough to get it delivered.Since many have already given it glowing reviews, I'll just leave my absolute favorite dishes:1) Massaman Curry w/ Chicken. A-ma-zing. It you want something substantial and delicious, this is the menu item for you. I also love peanuts, so finding them in this dish (there are plenty) is always fun.2) Chicken Pad See Ew. My go-to. Simple and delicious. Enough said.Go now. Seriously, don't delay. Expect to wait if you're going in the evening. And they only accept cash. I've always had a good experience with the bartender and even got a free drink for smiling. :)",5.0
"I am absolutely in love with this place. It is surprisingly cheap in comparison to other places ($15 will get you an appetizer, an entree, and cover tip) and, given the portion size, you really are getting the bang for your buck. I usually end up here after a long day at the gym with friends because the food is so wholesome. Also, you will have your meal in about 5 minutes. The service is great.The establishment itself is pretty relaxed. They usually have some calm music playing, low lighting, and nice interior seating. There is also seating in the backyard which is nothing too spectacular but is amazing on a warm breezy day.I highly suggest you try the chicken curry puff appetizer ($4.50) for a delicious start to your meal. I've had their chicken pad thai ($6.95) and you can never go wrong with that choice. I've also had a squid dish whose name escapes me at the moment but it was quite amazing as well.If you're around Brooklyn Heights at all, definitely give this place a try. You won't regret it!",4.0
"So when two besties, need to catch up on their dinner and a movie haunts. U venture to a cool spot to just talk and EAT. So we were both feeling Thai, and kinda lazy on how far to go after an end of the week hang. First off, walked in and didn't realize that the seating situation was towards the back. We stood there for roughly 10 minutes, before staff even asked to assist. When we eventually did realize who the hostess was, he told us a 45 minute wait. So despite a crowded bar, we did order two drinks. We asked for a bar menu, bartender said there wasn't a menu and showed the bottles behind her. So my friend ordered two drinks, after 30 minutes, we did notice there were some tables that opened up. Mind you, we were there roughly 1.5 hours prior to closing. We watched the empty table go unassigned. Two stools, opened up at the bar and starving foodies ordered calamari(based on a hot order pass us by). The calamari was hot, and flaky. I love that it was not heavily breaded and you got quite a hefty serving for two. After waiting so long, and still not a peep from the hostess, we ordered at the bar. WHY? Well we overheard the bartender tell another female duo that the kitchen was closing soon. UMMM??? I guess we did not warrant the same notification. I ordered the spicy pork and pineapple fried rice, and my bestie ordered the spicy seafood rice. I have to say that both had heat, and the portion size, quite large. I have to say that Joya did have a cool Friday night vibe, with music playing in the background. But they lost points for me, for the lack of attention to the patrons.",3.0

I LOVE them because I don't really care about my weight/appearance/self but a friend of mine who is very health conscious felt sick after eating them. So, on the one head - I love the food but can see how it's maybe not the BEST. But also, it's really cheap... most everything is $8. and it also has a fun atmosphere although I usually get delivery.

"Huge portions, great prices, tasty dishes, and great bartender, this is a great place... only draw back is that they're cash only.The food here is thai, but you're not getting Sripraphai thai but hell its still good, especially for the prices and portions you're getting!  The food is fresh and the taste in pretty darn yummy.  Nothing here is ubber spicy so there's nothing to worry about.  The mussels here are a must and the calamari is delicious too.  I've tried almost everything from the curry to the pad thai and they are all really tasty.  I especially like the beef salad and particular noodle dish thats sometimes on their special menu.  Aside from the great food, these portions are seriously BIG.  When I say big I mean like I eat 3 bites after sharing an app with the bf and I have to take the rest home.  And the leftovers make me incredibly full the next day when I have it for lunch or dinner.So I've covered the tasty dishes, huge portions, and great prices, now onto the drinks.  I especially like this location because they have a bartender there who's awesome.  He's totally creative with his drinks and they are sooOooO GOOD.  His mixes are not on the drink menu and you just have to ask him to make some of his specials for you.  He makes this melon colada takes super!  Last time we were there, he said he bar tends there on Tues., Thurs., and Sat. but that may have changed.Also quick thing to note, it gets packed here pretty quickly especially on friday and saturday nights, even the bar gets packed, so if you want to avoid the dreadful wait, come a little earlier and definitely don't come after 7:30 unless you have the patience to wait.",4.0

Super crisp without being greasy somehow, which was great, and they were really stuffed with lots of flavorful pork meat. Most spring rolls aren't so generous with the meat, but this stuff had substance, yet it was balanced flavor wise.- Curry: Kang Panang Gai (chicken panang). Good blend of sweet and spicy, without being too spicy. I liked it. Only complaint would be that the rice accompanying the dish wasn't amazing, maybe a bit dry, but the curry more than made up for that.Overall what I liked most was the appetizer I had, the curry was good but not way beyond other curries I've had... but the spring rolls were fantastic.",4.0

"I've been eating at Joya once a week(min) for almost a year now. Out of all of the Thai restaurants in New York (including sea, spice, & land Thai) this is my favorite place for Thai. All of the other restaurants have been hit or miss but Joya has always been extremely consistent. I love their Pad see ew & my boyfriend loves the pad Thai. For an appetizer I used to get their calamari. It's great but its way too much & I hate wasting food. A small order can easily feed a group of 4. We now get the tiger shrimp rolls & Thai spare ribs. Which is great. I've never had any problem with service & since their service is normally so attentive I sometimes even tip the water/ bus boy also. The restaurant is very nice for dates but I wouldn't recommend it for large groups or children. There isn't much leg/ standing room. I recommend going during the beginning of the week when it's not as crowded. During the end of the week you'll normally experience an hour wait & you'll feel as if you're standing in a packed night club (but it's worth it). I LOVE JOYA! Bill is normally around $30!!! (including to appetizers and 2 entrees!)",5.0
"Joya is my favorite restaurant, hands down.  My go to meal is the Tofu Pad See Ew (without the eggs- my preference).  Amazing.  I have tried this mean at other Thai restaurants and none have compared to Joya.  The prices are great, especially for the quality.  I love how you can see them cooking the food, takes away that little thought in your head about what the kitchen looks like.  I've heard complains about the delivery but every time I've had food delivered I've gotten through on the first call and the delivery was surprisingly very quick.",5.0

"Seriously disappointing. Maitre d' kept talking on his iPhone while he seated us. And was rude when we asked about sitting outside.We order a bottle of wine. Out came a single glass of wine. We explained, but the bottle did not come without another reminder.Vegetable spring rolls were greasy. Mango salad was not ripe and not particularly Thai. Fish curry was decent, not distinctive. Lots of show in the atmosphere, little substance. Large portions of mediocre food and low prices are what this place has going for it.",2.0
I honestly did not really like it. I thought the staff was okay and the food was just not up to par to other restaurants I have been too. The outside patio seating area is nice and the vibe from the dim lights and restaurants were good just don't think I would go back and spend money on there food. I do have to say other people with me liked it but for me it wasn't all so great.,2.0
"Great! There were 5 of us... we all got entrees, plus four appetizers to share, plus drank at least 2 beers each... and our bill was just barely over $100! What? Amazing. Our server was nice, the food came out super fast, and it was delicious. The portion sizes are so generous... we could hardly finish everything (but we did, don't worry).",4.0
"I've been eating at Joya once a week(min) for almost a year now. Out of all of the Thai restaurants in New York (including sea, spice, & land Thai) this is my favorite place for Thai. All of the other restaurants have been hit or miss but Joya has always been extremely consistent. I love their Pad see ew & my boyfriend loves the pad Thai. For an appetizer I used to get their calamari. It's great but its way too much & I hate wasting food. A small order can easily feed a group of 4. We now get the tiger shrimp rolls & Thai spare ribs. Which is great. I've never had any problem with service & since their service is normally so attentive I sometimes even tip the water/ bus boy also. The restaurant is very nice for dates but I wouldn't recommend it for large groups or children. There isn't much leg/ standing room. I recommend going during the beginning of the week when it's not as crowded. During the end of the week you'll normally experience an hour wait & you'll feel as if you're standing in a packed night club (but it's worth it). I LOVE JOYA! Bill is normally around $30!!! (including to appetizers and 2 entrees!)",5.0
"Joya is my favorite restaurant, hands down.  My go to meal is the Tofu Pad See Ew (without the eggs- my preference).  Amazing.  I have tried this mean at other Thai restaurants and none have compared to Joya.  The prices are great, especially for the quality.  I love how you can see them cooking the food, takes away that little thought in your head about what the kitchen looks like.  I've heard complains about the delivery but every time I've had food delivered I've gotten through on the first call and the delivery was surprisingly very quick.",5.0
"Took my teenage nieces for the first time, they enjoyed the food but had to take home most of the food. I come here a lot and I gotta say although most of the time the food is very good , once in a while off of the daily special menu the food can be kinda ehh",3.0

"When I use to live in Cobble Hill, this place opened across the street from me.  Most restaurants in New York open and have loads of people come the first month or so and then it tapers out after everyone has tried it.  Joya has been around for a good 10 years and the crowds have never let up since their opening night and for good reason.  If you want a place that has a nice (low lights) look, it's perfect for a date or friends night out.  They have gone through periods of DJ's and not but regardless the place is always jumping.  Nothing on the menu (and it is a miracle it has remained this way since they opened) costs more than 7.95!  (Almost to find a place this hot in New York with this low prices and great atmosphere is unheard of!)  I've gotten to know the owners over the years and could not meet a nicer bunch of guys.  The food is top rate Thai.  There is nothing on the menu I could complain about.  Personal favorites are the Spicy Noodles with chicken.  Mango salad (and I'm not a salad lover but this one is great!)  And - you will see a one page list of 'specials' that is handed to you when you sit down.  (Note: the 'specials' prices are higher than the menu's nothing more than 7.95 price - but well worth it and mostly in the 13.95 range).  I personally love their Skirt Steak (which always seems to be on their 'specials' page cooked with various Thai style veggies).  If I had to say anything critical it would be that - at times it feels almost 'rushed' to clear your food and have you on your way.  Given the high volume of people each night (Monday nights can be as crowded as Saturday nights) it's understandable why they need to keep the turn over going.  It's not exactly the place where you can sit and talk for a while after dinner (unless you do so at their bar which in itself is a great spot to hang.)  The white wine is cheap and good and after such a fun night of incredibly good food - and dining - you'll feel like you just left a party and can't wait to go back again.  Hence - the crowds - but you'll love being a part of it.  (Note:  if you are not in Cobble Hill and find yourself in Park Slope - go to their sister restaurant called SONG - same owners - same menu policy - same great food - slightly less appealing lighting (florescent strip lighting on walls) but all the same great crowds, fun and fantastically deliciously cheap food!)Update:  They now have a another restaurant in Fort Green called ""National"".  Same as everything above except the space itself is much smaller.  I forgot to mention that all 3 restaurants offer outdoor seating - nice in the warmer months!",5.0
"I enjoy going out to eat as much as anyone.......but last time I checked my surname isn't Rothschild, so I can appreciate an affordable meal without cooking it myself at home.Joya provides tasty Tai food and a decent ambiance at a third of the price you would pay to dine out in  the city. Not to mention that one plate can easily serve two people. Dishes are generally under $10 and I recommend the: Shrimp Fried Rice $6.50 or Pad Tai $6.95 Our bill was under $50 for 4 ppl and I got to let someone else clean the dishes when we were done (sweeeeeet).",4.0

"Okay, my love affair with Joya has cooled a bit. Two things: 1.) They never answer their phone, or you get a busy signal when you call, forcing you to call back repeatedly for about 20 minutes before getting through or giving up, and 2.) The food is hit-or-miss much of the time. Like, one night the woon sen will be light and stir-fried to perfection and overflowing with delicious veggies and meat...and then the next time it will be super heavy and dripping with grease and scanty on the veggies and meat and just generally sort of bad.We still call them when we're up for a night of sodium-induced unquenchable thirst, but there's other comparable Thai in the neighborhood...and most of the other restaurants answer their phone, too.Still pretty okay but not as good as it could be.",3.0
"On my way back from the Westminster Dog Show, I thought it would be nice to fill my tummy with some Thai Food.  Off to Joya in Brooklyn which came highly recommended.This place is very 'Grown and Sexy' with their exposed brick wall, dj booth and recessed lighting.  I felt bad that I left my turtleneck at home - I would've fit right in.Anyway, for food I ordered the chicken wings and the sliced pork in chili sauce. The wings had a nice tangy sauce and the chicken was ok but not too memorable.  The sliced pork was very dry, and had absolutely no spice.  My Baby Mama ordered the spicy noodles which were not spicy but very salty.  Maybe it said salty noodles and she mis read the menu...The best part of the meal was the Blue Moon Beer on tap.  It came with a tiny orange slice.  Deeeelicious.I don't think I'll be back.",2.0

"When I use to live in Cobble Hill, this place opened across the street from me.  Most restaurants in New York open and have loads of people come the first month or so and then it tapers out after everyone has tried it.  Joya has been around for a good 10 years and the crowds have never let up since their opening night and for good reason.  If you want a place that has a nice (low lights) look, it's perfect for a date or friends night out.  They have gone through periods of DJ's and not but regardless the place is always jumping.  Nothing on the menu (and it is a miracle it has remained this way since they opened) costs more than 7.95!  (Almost to find a place this hot in New York with this low prices and great atmosphere is unheard of!)  I've gotten to know the owners over the years and could not meet a nicer bunch of guys.  The food is top rate Thai.  There is nothing on the menu I could complain about.  Personal favorites are the Spicy Noodles with chicken.  Mango salad (and I'm not a salad lover but this one is great!)  And - you will see a one page list of 'specials' that is handed to you when you sit down.  (Note: the 'specials' prices are higher than the menu's nothing more than 7.95 price - but well worth it and mostly in the 13.95 range).  I personally love their Skirt Steak (which always seems to be on their 'specials' page cooked with various Thai style veggies).  If I had to say anything critical it would be that - at times it feels almost 'rushed' to clear your food and have you on your way.  Given the high volume of people each night (Monday nights can be as crowded as Saturday nights) it's understandable why they need to keep the turn over going.  It's not exactly the place where you can sit and talk for a while after dinner (unless you do so at their bar which in itself is a great spot to hang.)  The white wine is cheap and good and after such a fun night of incredibly good food - and dining - you'll feel like you just left a party and can't wait to go back again.  Hence - the crowds - but you'll love being a part of it.  (Note:  if you are not in Cobble Hill and find yourself in Park Slope - go to their sister restaurant called SONG - same owners - same menu policy - same great food - slightly less appealing lighting (florescent strip lighting on walls) but all the same great crowds, fun and fantastically deliciously cheap food!)Update:  They now have a another restaurant in Fort Green called ""National"".  Same as everything above except the space itself is much smaller.  I forgot to mention that all 3 restaurants offer outdoor seating - nice in the warmer months!",5.0
"I enjoy going out to eat as much as anyone.......but last time I checked my surname isn't Rothschild, so I can appreciate an affordable meal without cooking it myself at home.Joya provides tasty Tai food and a decent ambiance at a third of the price you would pay to dine out in  the city. Not to mention that one plate can easily serve two people. Dishes are generally under $10 and I recommend the: Shrimp Fried Rice $6.50 or Pad Tai $6.95 Our bill was under $50 for 4 ppl and I got to let someone else clean the dishes when we were done (sweeeeeet).",4.0
"Great Thai food in cobble hill. Good selection of food. The stand out dish was a special for that day, the fried duck spring rolls. It was a little greasy but was delicious. Good lively atmosphere indoors, the small out door dining area was a little more relax and quiter, perfect date setting on a warm night.",4.0
"Pros:---The pad thai is good---The pad thai is cheap (SEVEN dollars for a dinner?)---Nice decor---Good service---The atmosphere is fun, loud, kinda like a barCons:---The atmosphere is fun, loud, kinda like a bar.  I wouldn't bring my grandmother here, but it'd be good for a big group of friends.---There can be a wait ---If you try to order delivery, prepare to get a busy signal.  If you actually get through, their delivery is very prompt.I like this place quite a lot, all in all.  Sadly, so does everyone else.  :P",4.0
"Okay, my love affair with Joya has cooled a bit. Two things: 1.) They never answer their phone, or you get a busy signal when you call, forcing you to call back repeatedly for about 20 minutes before getting through or giving up, and 2.) The food is hit-or-miss much of the time. Like, one night the woon sen will be light and stir-fried to perfection and overflowing with delicious veggies and meat...and then the next time it will be super heavy and dripping with grease and scanty on the veggies and meat and just generally sort of bad.We still call them when we're up for a night of sodium-induced unquenchable thirst, but there's other comparable Thai in the neighborhood...and most of the other restaurants answer their phone, too.Still pretty okay but not as good as it could be.",3.0
"On my way back from the Westminster Dog Show, I thought it would be nice to fill my tummy with some Thai Food.  Off to Joya in Brooklyn which came highly recommended.This place is very 'Grown and Sexy' with their exposed brick wall, dj booth and recessed lighting.  I felt bad that I left my turtleneck at home - I would've fit right in.Anyway, for food I ordered the chicken wings and the sliced pork in chili sauce. The wings had a nice tangy sauce and the chicken was ok but not too memorable.  The sliced pork was very dry, and had absolutely no spice.  My Baby Mama ordered the spicy noodles which were not spicy but very salty.  Maybe it said salty noodles and she mis read the menu...The best part of the meal was the Blue Moon Beer on tap.  It came with a tiny orange slice.  Deeeelicious.I don't think I'll be back.",2.0
"Was recommended by a local to try Joya to get the best Thai food experience ever.  They did warn me it would be extremely loud and that it was.  I wouldn't recommend going here to catch up with friends but I would recommend it if you're looking to indulge your Thai side.  I was beyond satisfied with my meal!  The atmosphere is very 'swanky' yet casual.  Love the centerpieces at the bar.  On the down side, the waitresses were not attentive and the seating is snug.  Other than that, great food!  Wished I lived closer.",4.0
The selections were great at one point.. Not sure what happened. I think it instantly became a lounge once people realized they had a full bar & loud music. The wait is always overwhelming +  long. I typically order take out which is really quick & well organized despite the restaurant's crowd. I always go with a special- there are better thai places in bk.. ie. manee thai..but this may be one with the better ambiance + decor. Trendy rating - A+,3.0
"I just simply love love love this place. I always order the same thing but just because is soooo good I dont want to try anything else; their pad thai, fried rice, papaya salad and fried calamari are just to die for, I get hungry just thinking about this place! so worth the trip to Brooklyn, yummy yummy yummy. I've must've been to this place more than 15 times since I found out about it. This place is CASH only and gets super packed on the weekends. I always get there early so I dont have to wait... If it is passed 8PM I won't even bother going because smelling all that delicious food while waiting for an hour to get a table would just drive me insane.",4.0
"Foods are decent. Only the reason why i giving 2 star instead of 4 star: manager or owner(?) he was plain rude. I asked for a baby high chair and then with an attitude he said ""???? I'll show you"" i didn't understand what he said exactly. In a while, another staff brought it with a kindness. Lastly,i walked to the counter for a pay, he was giving me an another attitude: i said""give me $10 back please"", he goes count the monies takes a while. I asked one more time ""just give me $10 back"" he said ""I KNOW!, I HAVE ????????? TIP"" i thought he was trying to say "" I KNOW, BUT I HAVE TO CALCULATE MONEY FOR THE TIP FIRST!"". Ok i understood, but he shouldn't said like that. He could be nicer than what he did. He also never said like ""thank you"" or ""how was it?...""no even eye contact'.

"I like this place a lot, but I can't help but notice that they are slipping a bit in their takeout department. The last time I ordered from here, I noticed that their takeout wasn't as fresh as it normally is--the meat in my massaman curry was very tough, and the chicken in my spicy noodles smelled a little off. Maybe it was an off-night. In terms of on-site dining, the price is definitely right--where else can you get a 3 course meal AND drinks all for under 25 dollars a person? Also their outdoor patio is adorable, and their atmosphere is great for both group dining and date nights.",3.0

"Delicious Thai food and incredibly affordable. I haven't had anything on the menu that has not been good. The portions are big and we always go home with a doggy bag.

"My friend wanted to do lunch in Brooklyn rather than Brunch in the city.I figured I shouldn't be so selfish and not ever wanting to go anywhere outside the city or outside a certain area and so I decided I should go out to Brooklyn.I never been to this Bergen Street area.  I have been eating too much Asian food that I wasn't really feeling for any Thai but G really wanted Joya, so I went along with the plan.G decided to get a Mango flavour martini and I declined on any alcohol intake and decided to go with the regular Thai Ice Tea.  I tried G's Mango Martini and I am so glad I didn't get any alcohol because it was really strong...delicious but it had a real kicked to it.G ordered the Short Ribs - G raves about the short ribs here but I wasn't too crazy about eating ribs since I have a ""thing"" about eating things that comes with bones on your plate.But I managed to get the meat off of the bones without much effort and G was right...they are good.G got the Chicken curry and I went with the regular Shrimp Pad Thai and let me tell you, I haven't had this good of Pad Thai for a very long time.The noodles were cooked perfect and the dish weren't too dry and it was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good!The shrimp tasted really fresh and I just love it.Throughout our lunch, G asked me if I thought the guy was cute...I said he's pretty cute for an Asian New Yorker but he's short.  Every time G goes to Joya, he's usually there and so G was curious about his name.  We ended up finding out his name is Gaeng.G kept on calling him over for things since G wanted to see Gaeng's face throughout our lunch.Gaeng's was really nice and he didn't seem as though he was annoyed with us.  So service was really great and attentive!My only complaint is that they don't have a set time on when they open on Sunday.  I had to wait over an hour by myself since G was late as usual.I have been converted...I would definitely come back to Brooklyn for some Joya!",5.0

"I have been coming to Joya for years because their food is good and cheap. However, their service is horrible, particularly from the guy who takes your name for a table.

"This place has decent thai food but  do not expect to get served or have your correct order.  I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night.  We spent 45 minutes waiting for a table, after being seated another 30 minutes before we actually got food.  After all that our entire orders were completely wrong.  My boyfriend ordered pork, got chicken.  I am a vegetarian so I ordered vegetables, got chicken as well.  The waiter was totally unhelpful; when we tried to explain to him that our orders were wrong, he acted like he suddenly didn't understand English.  Needless to say, my bf refuses to go back to this place, and I don't blame him.  The only reason I am not giving this restaurant 1 star is because the food is halfway decent when prepared correctly.",2.0

"My friend wanted to do lunch in Brooklyn rather than Brunch in the city.I figured I shouldn't be so selfish and not ever wanting to go anywhere outside the city or outside a certain area and so I decided I should go out to Brooklyn.I never been to this Bergen Street area.  I have been eating too much Asian food that I wasn't really feeling for any Thai but G really wanted Joya, so I went along with the plan.G decided to get a Mango flavour martini and I declined on any alcohol intake and decided to go with the regular Thai Ice Tea.  I tried G's Mango Martini and I am so glad I didn't get any alcohol because it was really strong...delicious but it had a real kicked to it.G ordered the Short Ribs - G raves about the short ribs here but I wasn't too crazy about eating ribs since I have a ""thing"" about eating things that comes with bones on your plate.But I managed to get the meat off of the bones without much effort and G was right...they are good.G got the Chicken curry and I went with the regular Shrimp Pad Thai and let me tell you, I haven't had this good of Pad Thai for a very long time.The noodles were cooked perfect and the dish weren't too dry and it was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good!The shrimp tasted really fresh and I just love it.Throughout our lunch, G asked me if I thought the guy was cute...I said he's pretty cute for an Asian New Yorker but he's short.  Every time G goes to Joya, he's usually there and so G was curious about his name.  We ended up finding out his name is Gaeng.G kept on calling him over for things since G wanted to see Gaeng's face throughout our lunch.Gaeng's was really nice and he didn't seem as though he was annoyed with us.  So service was really great and attentive!My only complaint is that they don't have a set time on when they open on Sunday.  I had to wait over an hour by myself since G was late as usual.I have been converted...I would definitely come back to Brooklyn for some Joya!",5.0

"This place is HANDS DOWN my favorite thai place in brooklyn! I get the same plate every time I come here or order take out and of course that plate is pad thai! They give you a very large portion and so I always end up making my food last for 2 meals. They deliver fast too! But it might have something to do with me living 6 blocks away, but still very fast. Also the prices are AWESOME!",5.0
"My first thai meal ever was here at Joya a couple weeks ago, and it was phenomenal, I've been craving it ever since. I ordered the fried calamari, spring rolls, gai kra prow and the spicy noodles. While everything was wonderful and cooked to perfection, the highlight of my night was the spicy noodles. I seriously could have had a giant plate of just those! I hope to find something just as good over here on the west coast.",5.0

"I am always astonished when my meal at Joya (or their sister restaurant, Song) is over, and blissfully full of delish Thai goodness, I find how absurdly inexpensive the whole thing was.

"Alright, alright, so I used to think that I really loved JOYA and that they had great food for real cheap, but I went back last night and the food just wasn't as good as I remembered. Their green papaya salad was so weird, it was all sweet instead of spicy.  We also got some appetizer with duck in it and it seemed to be just a large chunk of duck fat with no actual meat (ew).  To top it off, I found a peice of glass in my curry on about the last bite (hope I didn't swallow any) but they did take off the price of my meal from the check.  That being said, I'd go back to Joya because it's just so darn good for being so cheap.  I guess just stick to tried-and-true choices like pad-thai, spicy fried rice, etc.",4.0

"Just went today with my girlfriend to this place. Nice restaurant, reasonably priced, and good size portions. Decor sucks and the place gets packed during evening hours. Not unusual to bump your head on someone's ass while you're eating and  they wait for a seat. My girl and I ordered the large fried calamari for 9.95 and it was big and tasty!

"This place is fantastic.  I really don't understand how you could rate it any lower than 5 stars.  The food is INCREDIBLE and very inexpensive ($6.50-9.00 for entrees).  The atmosphere is really unpretentious and very inviting, with a nice bar, an open seating area, and a rear outdoor patio (like many Brooklyn establishments).  The bartenders are so damn friendly, they always end up buying me a beer when I sit down for dinner.  This is easily my favorite restaurant in Cobble Hill, and is currently my favorite Thai place in New York.  That says a lot, considering how affordable it is.  If this place were in Manhattan, it'd be twice as expensive.  If it were in the Village, it'd be three times the cost.  But then again, that would spoil it.",5.0
We ordered the small  fried calamari and when she came back it was with a huge plate the portions are great. We also ordered the skirt steak with broccoli and it was the best steak i have ever eaten.

"Joya is on the way from the F train stop on Bergen to my boyfriend's digs on Warren Street, strategically placed about 100 paces from the front door. We've been known to leave concerts on the Upper West Side early, drunk dial the Joy(a) and salivate on the train all the way to pick up our food. We've also been known to fiercely defend our menu favorites and try to persuade the other into agreeing that our dish is the best (no mine is!). I'm firmly in the Yellow Curry/Spicy Noodles camp and though he agrees with me about the Spicy Noodles, he's a fan of the Red Curries and most of the other noodle dishes. The prices are amazing (you can feed the both of us for under $20), and the staff is cheerful and helpful.

"Thai food, having recently ousted Japanese food for the king of trendy Asian cuisine, is a delicacy that when prepared adequately can bring limitless pleasure.

As a fat person, generous portions are what I look for in a restaurant, and it's only a bonus that Joya happens to be delicious as well. Try the large fried calamari, it's huge, cheap, and delicious (incidentally, how I like my women). Did I mention it's cheap? 'cause it is.The atmosphere there is fun. I happen to like loud, blaring house music because if there's one thing I hate when eating out, it's being able to hear other people chew. God, I hate that. So, on a weekend, don't worry, Joya's ambiance will drown out your lover's cacophonous chewing. Oh, and the delivery's fantastic, too, 'cause sometimes leaving the house is too dangerous.",5.0

Don't go on a date with a low talker here. I did and I must've said ""what"" while touching my ear about 17 times. That basically sucked. I hope that when I DJ'd regularly I never had such an unknowingly malicious effect on some dude's opinion of some poor young lady. Thanks a lot Joya!J/K this place is fun and cool. But that story is true all the same.",3.0
"Last time here, I was ill the entire next day.  I think there might be a reason why the food is so cheap ( read: low quality.)  Or maybe I was just unlucky, who knows.Definitely not worth the infinitely long (45 minute-hour) wait on a weekday.But thai food always tastes and looks better when you feel like you're eating in a dance club, right?",2.0
"Good, cheap, delicious Thai food!!  I have been on dates here, lunch breaks here, and out with friends here.  The wait has been a bit long on occasion but there was always room at the bar for us to wait.  Whenever I have Thai cravings in Brooklyn, I go here.",5.0
"Recommended by a friend....hands down this is an awesome eatery in downtown Bklyn! The food portions are ridiculous--come to this spot with an empty stomach!! The dollar goes far here between the food/drink specials and combos!! On the weekends you get some music entertainment from the house DJ!! When it warms up, the backyard turns into a candlelit dining area--simply an extension of the main area...Gorgeous!!!! It fills up quickly so get there early!",5.0

"DO NOT GET TAKEOUT, GET DELIVERY! IF YOU GET TAKEOUT THEY WILL FORGET YOU, GUARANTEED, EVEN IF YOU ARE STANDING RIGHT THERE. THEY WILL SET YOUR STUFF DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO YOU THEN STAND AROUND TILL YOU ASK THEM ""UM, EXCUSE ME, IS THAT MY STUFF?""!!!!!!!Okay, now that's out of the way (sorry, it happened exactly the same way twice)! Get delivery, they are mad fast and it's just as good as eating there, particularly as it's kinda stuffy inside. CHEAP! GOOOD! That is what you will think while you are shoveling the massive tupperware of curry with tons of chicken and the equally sized sticky rice into your suddenly voracious craw.Skip the appetizers, they're all honestly a bit greasygross and the curry is gonna be enough food to put down a horse. And it's like $7.50. Wow.",4.0

This is a great spot. Very very affordable thai food with a great ambiance. The portions are big enough or left overs and their drinks are pretty inexpensive. I had the half chicken mango salad for lunch for lunch the first time and the chicken was great. The mango was a little bit unripe but still had flavor.

"I spoke too soon.  I really wanted to like this place.  It's good for the neighborhood but does not match the hype behind it.  I had their mussaman curry recently and was really unimpressed.  It was prepared with steak and the coconut milk was still very watery.  It's supposed to be prepared with stew meat and have a thick coconut milk sauce with coconut cream.  I also had the Pad See Ew recently and quite honestly thought it was kind of bland for Pad See Ew.  I definitely ate it, but I was kind of disappointed.  I also wasn't really impressed with their Tom Kha.  It was really missing the galangal/ginger  flavor.  It tasted like they just used chicken brother and threw in some coconut milk and hoped I wouldn't notice.  So I really have tried to like this place, but I'd rather go somewhere that made better Thai food than myself.",3.0
This place is very good. My bf and I have gone there a couple of times and we always left quite satisfied and pleased with the food.

"So, I went there late one night when visiting a friend in NYC. Awkward trying to get seated, but after that...Wow...talk about huge portions! The food is amazing and the price is cheap for the amount you get! It's like take out prices...about $7-9 per dish. Watch out, though, they don't take off the tails on the shrimps so make sure you don't try munching down too fast. There's a rockin' house DJ that sets up near the bar and the drinks are reasonable in price (about $5 on up). They even have a Brooklyn Brewery beer on tap. The atmosphere is just awesome w/ the decor; it's like urban-chic meets Feng shui. Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, just great all around.

"I've been back to Joya a few times, both dining in and for carry out, and the food just hasn't been up to par. The moo kraprow I had a few weeks ago was overcooked; the pork pieces were tough and dry. And the carry out tofu kraprow (I like what I like, okay?) was in a weaksauce if I've ever seen one. I've still heard that it's the best thai you can get in Cobble Hill, but I'm thinking I probably won't be back for a while.",2.0
"I love this place. Somehow, going there, I have never had to wait more than ten minutes (which was only once, the other times we were seated right away), and the food is always amazing. I'm a huge fan of the spicy noodles, though I don't really like the way they prepare their tofu (I get the one with tofu and veggies.) All the food is always very fresh, but it does not take long at all to come out. Their drink are also nice and strong. The best part about this place is that it is super cheap. You pay $7 for a pretty big portions of food. I recommend it.",4.0

"Thai food has always been my favorite cuisine, but I'm not a snob about it - I've never met Thai food I didn't like...until now. I just had take-out from Joya, and this was definitely the worst Thai food I've ever had. The pad krapow (spicy beef with chili basil) had absolutely no basil in it and zero spiciness. The sauce tasted like a brown gravy my very-Caucasian family would make. Big chunks of carrots, together with the brown gravy - it reminded me more of Thanksgiving dinner than Thai food. I'm actually almost angry that they tried to pass this off as pad krapow when it is clearly NOT - it bore absolutely NO resemblance to any pad krapow I've ever had, either in Thailand or the US. The som tom (papaya salad) was meh - lacking in flavor - needs some fish sauce maybe? And the pad see-ew gai was just ok.I do have to mention that I ate at Joya once before and it was fine that time - not excellent, but quite good. Maybe it was just so bad tonight because it was a crazy-busy Saturday? I don't know. I'll give Joya one more try - but definitely not on a weekend night.",1.0

"So my good friend from high school has been telling me about Joya forever.  Anytime me or one of our other friends would mention Thai food, it was always Joya this and Joya that.  Considering how inexpensive she said the food was, I had very low expectations of the food, place, etc.  Boy, was I wrong!  We went on a Friday night, and had to wait for about 20 minutes or so, not bad at all.  The atmosphere was far better than I had expected, and, while I found it slightly odd that they had a DJ that early and in a restaurant, it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  The wings were out of this world!  The noodle dishes were all about 7 bucks, and GIANT portions.  Our total bill for 5 people, with tip, appetizers, 5 main courses, and a few rounds of drinks came to $85..$17 each.  Best deal in NYC I have had in a loooong time.",5.0

Spring rolls were stuffed with some mushy concoction of noodles with a terrible texture. Pad thai was drenched in some awful sauce that reeked of vinegar and came with massive chunks of tofu that were way too chewy. The kicker was when it came time to pay - they only take cash.",1.0

Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with friends and it was packed. It was a little uncomfortable waiting in the entry as there was only a small waiting area and no room at the bar to sit.

They told us we had a 45 minute wait but it ended up being 30 instead.  The host was really nice.  We got to sit outside on the patio which was good because it was cool out.  For dinner my friend and I started with the chicken spring rolls which were really good.  Then I had the green curry chicken while she had the red curry.  Both were awesome!  The house chardonnay was a very generous pour and not tasting either.  The prices were unbeatable but it is CASH only!  I will absolutely go back to this place when I'm in this area of Brooklyn.  If you are going to go I would go early and but my name on the list then wait at the bar.,4.0

Unless you are a loud talker. My voice is little so I just got drunk and stuffed my face. Great place to hang with friends. We waited about an hour for a table though, that kinda stinks.",4.0
"All this yelping is scaring me... I hope nothing ever changes about Joya.  I don't know how they make a spring roll so exciting.  Maybe it's the fact that you get two of them for $2.95.  Maybe it's the fact that you can identify all the veggies in them and they're FRESH like Will Smith circa 1991.  Maybe it's the sauce that I would drink straight up.  Oh - and nothing gets me like ordering a veggie dish -- ""and can I add tofu please?"" -- and then not seeing that obnoxious little ""+ tofu - $12"" on the bill.  I would wait in that line any day.",5.0

"My friend and ate here on a Sunday evening early, around 5pm. The place was already packed so we hovered around the bar until some bar stools were free and ended up eating at the bar. The food portions are enormous, I was expecting a meal 1/3 the size of the portion that I was served, and it is pretty cheap (especially if you take home leftovers and can get a second meal out of it). I had a tofu veggie dish in a light ginger sauce with rice. Delicious. The only negatives were the lack of available tables and it was kind of noisy.",4.0
"A friend of mine who lives in Chelsea/Manhattan told me that this spot is the best Thai in NYC, so I had to taste it.  We were seated quickly, had great service, and the appetizer, curry, and pad Thai were all excellent.  The truly amazing thing about this place is that they deliver such high quality food with nice ambiance for low prices.  I think my curry was $7.99 for a large portion size.  Even the beer was cheap!  A full bar and outdoor patio seating make this one a true gem...not to be missed.",5.0

This place has great food.   My favorite is the pork and string beans but everything is worth trying.  Always busy (always a good sign) and always tasty (always good to know) this place deserves to be tried.  My only complaint is that it can be very noisy and hard to have a conversation in.,4.0

I've love anything Thai.. So getting a chance to see what another part of Brooklyn has to offer is always great.. So two Elites put us on once again. (See Chocolate room for further details of this night) I had thai before at Green Papaya. I was left feeling a bit cheated. So I ordered the Pad Thai and Thai Iced tea. Same thing as I did when I went to Green Papaya. I was blown way by the fact that it was an open kitchen . So you see the hard work and talent put into every dish. Although it takes a bit for your eyes to get used to the dim lighting. You feel a sense of privacy in a place that filled to the brim with people. An as we chit chated the flare from the 3 ft flare ups of the kitchen give it a certain touch that I'm not sure I can put my hands on. There was an order of Calamari with that spicy plum sauce.. It was a match made in heaven said the fires of hell. When my dish arrived I was greeted with the aroma of mint and peanuts.. Some times it's the small things that places do that make the magic.. My meal was awesome. I must go back.,4.0
"The best thai I have had yet! I live right next to Joya and have eaten thai food all over the world and have yet to find a more flavorful place than this. I first tried the pad see yue and was not that impressed so I didn't come back for a few years. I gave it another try and had the pad thai this time and have been coming back for years ever since. The difference between their pad thai and all others I have had is the flavorful abundant sauce. All other pad thai seems flavorless and dry now. I also highly recommend the veggie pad thai, veggie spring rolls and a thai iced tea! They also have great curry and a nice selection of beers on draft.",5.0

"Nice restaurant with huge portions of well, ok thai food. I like the decor but it is very popular and the atmosphere is noisy :) I think that restaurant would be better if less populated since it is such a small place and always crowded the waiters let you wait...",3.0
"Awesome atmosphere, awesome food, awesome prices.  Even though we had to wait 30 min on a monday night, it was worth it.  It lived up to the hype -- very impressed.",5.0
"Eh, the food isn't anything to write home about, overly sweet and a bit bland. But they do have a lovely outdoor area and a number of reasonably priced wines.",3.0
"Had a friend up to visit and we decide to try this place out.  Great service, and very affordable!  My friend had the chicken pad Thai which had an awesome peanut sauce and noodles.  I forgot what mine was called but it was the beef and vegetables in a garlic sauce, which was great...   Dont forget the calamari either...  So overall the meal was perfect along with the price and the atmosphere was chill with a soft decor that wasnt too much.",4.0
"I feel like I'm commiting sacrilige when I say Joya was not that great.  Fifteen to twenty min wait early on Sunday night didn't deter me, but the food did.  At first, I said the food was better than at sister-restaurant Song; the Tom Yum was great, the tiger prawn rolls just as excellent.  Bu the entrees did Joya in.  The initial bites were good, but as I ate more I realized it was not so awesome.  The pad thai suffers from the same sugar-laced faux pas as Song's, but worse -- all 4 plates were heavily loaded oil.  The flavor was good, but the grease left all of us feeling mehhhhhh....  I eat a lot of Thai food which, yes, requires oil to cook, but this was exceptionally oily.  Same great prices and gargantuan portions here, so I think the only thing Joya had over Song was that the noise volume was lower here and we didn't have to scream as much.  Heck, I'm tempted to dole it a 2.5 star.",3.0

Joya is hands down the best Thai food in South Brooklyn.  (And cheap too) I just wish it wasn't so crowded all the time.,5.0
"We ordered: pad see yu, pad thai, spicy pineapple and pork fried rice, tiger shrimp rolls, masaman curry, mango sticky rice for dessert and all were amazing. Tom yum was okay. We went with kind of a large group, and the vibe was a bit hectic. It was pretty noisy on a Friday night so it was hard to communicate. However, the service was great, the prices just right, and we would go back.",4.0
"Over crowded with the nastiest, most unprofessional staff.  There are too many nice restaurants in that area to be abused by people who do not appreciate their customers.  I walked out because I was so turned off by the nasty, unprofessional staff and I would never go back.

Ugghh.... I don't get this place.  Went there for lunch last weekend so that I could eat outside.  Was NOT impressed.  The food we got was a little burnt and had been doused in too much garlic.  It also tasted like the oil hadn't been changed.  I don't get the high reviews of this place.,3.0
"I must say with the slew of Thai restaurants in the vicinity, its hard to decide which one to go to.  Joya, has done a great job distinguishing itself from the rest by offering great food at excellent prices.  I've been there about 10 times and its been great 8 out of 10 so it gets 4 stars.  I would stick to the curries and noodles.  The fish dishes are so-so.  The one other con is that it's too dark, I guess what you can't see can't hurt you.",4.0
"cool looking/feeling place: industrial gray, DJ spinning, open kitchen. lunch on this pleasant March Saturday was not how I remembered Joya- maybe it changed, more likely my taste buds. The pad thai tasted 'burnt', was wet and sloppy, with too much fish sauce. Really disappointing, even for $7The basic garlic/chili vegetables were uninspired and served with a side lemon wedge. I don't think I saw any limes on any tables actually.Since all of the meat dishes seemed to come with eggplant which is a favorite vegetable of mine, I asked them to do a side of eggplant however they wanted to. Did they soak the eggplant in water first? So spongy, I couldn't bother with more than 3 bites.I really don't know how you can screw up thai food- usually it just gets more creative with every new place in the city that you find. Joya must be preying on the convenience factor to locals of lower Smith St. It's a walk from Joya, but try FAAN instead (on Smith, 2 blocks from Atlantic Ave.).

"I don't know why this place is so popular.  The food is only decent, and is definitely not the best thai in the neighborhood.  AND, in addition to the so-so food, both my husband and I have gotten sick after eating at Joya on separate occasions.  If it happened just once, I would have said it was a fluke, but after getting food poisoning twice, I avoid Joya like the plague. (In case anyone is wondering, we went back because we practically live next door, and we were really hoping the bad experience was a 1-time thing).

"The quality of food is not as good as Lemongrass up the street, but the prices and atmosphere make up for it.  After observing the uber-hip atmosphere, I was scared to see the prices, but damn if they weren't absurdly low (it's an expensive neighborhood).  The food's good in the 'far-better-than-anything-I-could-have-made-at-home' sense, but not in the 'you-HAVE-to-try-this"" sense.  All in all, a great way to enjoy an affordable night out to eat.",4.0

food is just alright at joya. i think its hyped because of the atmosphere rather than the food. if you are hungry and want to eat right away do not go here. anytime after 6pm the wait for 2 people is about 45mins to an hour. i just dont understand how and why people wait. its just ok. the fried calamari is tasteless. lots of vegetarian options which is good and i must say their veggie spring rolls are good. it has some curry spice in it.,3.0

"What a little Thai gem!  Certainly one of the hippest neighborhood Thai food joints around, with it's mod interior and weekend DJ.  There's almost always a wait if you get there after 7pm, even on a Tuesday (45 minutes on a Saturday)!  But the food and the prices make it worth the wait!  Cheap drinks at the bar help pass the time too!  My Thai dad would question the authenticity since they automatically set the table with chopsticks, but my true test of a good Thai restaurant:  the Pad See Ew.  And I'll tell ya, Joya did not disappoint!  Even my dad might forgive them for the chopstick thing!  The massaman curry was tasty too.  One would think that a non-hole-in-the-wall Thai place would mean more expensive food.  Not true at Joya!  4 people who ordered 2 apps, 2 drinks & 4 entrees - with a generous tip - paid a total of $60!!  It's almost like eating in Thailand!!",4.0

But all of these minor inconveniences seem almost endearing given that this place offers one of the most absolutely delicious dishes that I have ever tasted. I never even was a particular fan of pad see ew before I went to this place, but now I fantasize about Joya's chicken pad see ew more often than I would like to admit... the noodles are just the perfect flavor and texture and consistency and taste especially amazing when the dish has just come out from the kitchen and is so hot that you almost burn your mouth.

Other friends have gotten the Pad Thai, spicy noodles, chicken and broccoli, and copious seafood specials and loved them all! The best part?
