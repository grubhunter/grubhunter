"The restaurant turned out to be really great.My girlfriend and me tried:(1) fried noodles with seafood(2) an omelette with oysters as an appetizer (3) curry soymeat with rice (4) mango pudding1 - very tasty and extremely huge portion2 - little fishy for my taste, but really good3 - those who like this type of dishes will appreciate it;4 - omg, just wonderful. No, really. I mean it. It was sooo good.Rose tea - nothing special, but I like it.The waiter was extremely polite and nice.I would say that it's 100% 5 out of five for this level of restaurant.You might probably not find any discoveries here, but food is really, really good.",5.0
"Ate here tonight. First thing I notice is my spoon has what looks like a dried patch of black seaweed stuck to the back of it. I hope the utensils that look clean actually are..We started with the pork belly buns. Small portions, tasty, chewy. Not bad. Next we had a fried noodle with chicken and shrimp. This was good. Tasted like a spicy pad Thai. Next we had the squid in tomato sauce. Squid was so bland and the tomato sauce tasted like ketchup. Very unimpressive. Next we had the soft shelled crab. So fried and soft that I barely knew I was eating crab, I just tasted fried batter. The veggies that came with it were good. Next we had a chicken curry. Decent. The prices are higher than they should be. The staff is fine. The decor is a little tacky. Wouldn't go back.",2.0
"Because of the reviews, I expected this place to be much more than it actually was. Atmosphere: Fairly quiet, with typical top charts radio music playing. The music doesn't really suit the restaurant in my opinion. Food: Curry Laksa was solid, just the right amount of spice. I wish the half-egg that's in the dish wasn't well done. I also tried the seafood casserole with black bean sauce. It doesn't come with rice so you have to order a side of it. ($16 + $2.50 for rice) First off, it wasn't served in a casserole, which it should be if you're selling it as a casserole dish. The sauce was very starchy and although they gave a decent amount of shrimp, the imitation crab meat ruined the dish. Any establishment claiming to be a seafood restaurant should never serve any sort of imitation seafood. It just doesn't make sense. The casserole was also way too salty to be eaten on its own without any rice. A dish like this should always come with a side, as opposed to having diners order rice in addition to the dish. Definitely not worth the price point. Service: Friendly. It was a decent dinner, not the worst I've had. The 4.5 Yelp stars though? Pretty misleading. Will I return? Probably not.",3.0
"More of 3.5 stars for a solid restaurant with some higher than expected pricing. Came into Al Seabu on a Saturday night with the place not so packed, aside from us there was another two tables with customers. Ordered the BKT soup, some Roti and Char Kuay Teow and Beef Rendang, basically the Malay staples. The soup was surprisingly bland and disappointing for its price of $7.00 for a cup. The roti was fresh and cooked well and has substance instead of the airy thin roti other Malaysian places have. The Char Kuay Teow was bland with the flavoring uninspiring while the beef rendang lacked punch but cooked very tender. All in a, a solid place but overpriced for what it is, good service and with the free check in desert makes the price slightly more palatable.",3.0
A group of 6 of us went here last night and everyone raved about it. Particularly note worthy were the roti and pork bun appetizers and the lasi namek. Highly recommended to anyone- great addition to the neighborhood.,5.0
"Really solid Malaysian dishes with good variety and intensities of heat. I've been here a couple times - first ordering the seafood wattan hor. It was tasty and had lots of seafood, but the sauce it comes in is kinda heavy. Hearty meal though! The second time I ordered curry prawns. Very spicy but with great flavor. The potions here are a good value and the food is always super tasty. The staff is super attentive and friendly as well. Definitely recommend as a solid option!",4.0
"An awesome addition to the neighborhood, truly.  Get the laksa or anything else you won't be disappointed.  The service, ambience and cuisine are worth every bit of 5 stars. Had to post a quick review as I've been a few times and it's been a pretty sparse crowd. It's shocking because it's really the best restaurant within 10 blocks IMO.  Brought some foodie-traveling-writing about food and drink folk last weekend and they were equally impressed.Do yourself a favor and pop on over.. Bon appetit!",5.0
A neighborhood gem. The Malaysian specialties are terrific. The red curry was spiced perfectly and the Chad kuai teow (a seafood noodle dish) was awesome. We love this place!!!,5.0

"Came to this South Slope Malaysian restaurant for lunch and greatly enjoyed the food here.  Started off with roti which came hot, soft and flakey accompanied by a curry sauce that packed nice heat.  Ordered the Malaysian red curry which was flavorful and just hot enough.  The Malay noodles with shrimp, crab, squid and scallop was tasty as well.  Finished off with a lite mango pudding.  Service was very good and the lunch special prices are very reasonable.  I will certainly come back.",4.0

Satay mix is a great deal, with 9$ you get 4 skewersNot impressed by the pork belly buns, though I like their ""slider"" version instead pf the classic chinese rice bun we always see.Love the noodles, especially the flat Char Kuay Teow witj seafood. The wattan hor look very similar to a pad thai, they came a bit broken in my delivery box but liked anyway. Maybe a bit dry?Their signature spare and pork ribs herbal soup was delicious, I suggest you order the small version as an appetizer so you can taste it.

"A great new spot in Park Slope! While I'm a bit of newbie to the Malaysian cuisine, I enjoyed my dish- (Seafood Wattan Hor). The dish was flavorful and came with an impressive amount of fresh seafood (scallops, shrimp, squid). Yelp check-in meant a free dessert (Homemade Mango Pudding), a sweet treat to end the meal.

"This was good on the first try - although we mourned the loss of former tenant Chip Shop - and very good a couple months later. Seems they have hit their stride. We had a table of six with a bunch of appetizers and a couple of entrees to share.

We used the leftover sweet dipping sauce with some fresh steamed vegetables that we well done. The fried rice was well above the norm and the omelette was nicely cooked - moister than usual. Food was timely for an early dinner before the crowd. Prices are good if you go family style - and you get to try more, of course. No room for desert this time, but I recall them being good first time. We'll be back.",4.0
"Pretty good Malaysian fusion.  A very nice welcome to the Park Slope community of 5th Ave restaurants, they served up some good Nasi Lemak and Chow Kiew Tiew.  Glass was never empty, and the tiny gesture of giving us some simple shrimp chips was nice.Very casual and would definitely dine here again.",4.0
"Ambiance was cozy and inviting. I loved the blue and brick walls. Perfect setting for groups and dates. Prices are very reasonable and great portions!We ordered their red curry with chicken as well as the flat ""Char Kuay Teow"" noodles. It wasn't as spicy as I hoped it would be, and it ended up being a little too oily for my taste. The red curry was very good, but it didn't have the spicy kick we were hoping for. They only had house wines by the glass which was alright, only because their red ended up being really good. Service was attentive and pleasant which is always much appreciated.",4.0
"Finally made it here for lunch which had been on my to-do list and had a great meal! Started with the pork buns. They were so adorable and a great app. Moved on to the mee goreng with chicken and shrimp. I'm not sure if I've ever had Malaysian and it reminded me of pad Thai. It was great!! The place is also very cute, appeared immaculately clean, and staff was adorable and very sweet. Also, major points for being attentive to my water consumption when housing such spicy food. I'll be back!!",5.0
"Malaysian food in NYC is hard to come by, especially GOOD Malaysian. We had lunch here the other day and the food, value & service were great!! Good happy hour - free roti & $3 beers. This place is a few blocks from home & will be the new 'go-to' restaurant for sure.",5.0
"Al Seabu is a new Malaysian restaurant in Park Slope that has a lot of potential and already has a lot of good things going for it.  It seems authentic, and it would probably benefit from taking ""fusion"" out of its branding considering that people crave authenticity over fusion restaurants these days. We had the fish & shrimp cakes, which I liked a lot (although they were probably not too healthy), the nasi lemak, and the penang asam laksa.  All seemed to be cooked with care.  We also had the rose lemonade which was really interesting and not too sweet. The space is warm, with wood paneling, and this place would certainly do great as a casual date spot once the cocktails get going. The staff were all really nice and attentive too.  They said they will be starting seamless soon, but in the meantime you can call and get delivery.  I am glad Al Seabu is in the neighborhood, and I will certainly be back.

"Was there recently and I was not impressed. They are new, I hope they will take these criticism positively and improved on the dishes mentioned below. I am Malaysian and have been to most 'Malaysian' restaurants there are in NYC. Al Seabu's decor is simple yet welcoming. The seats are ok for comfort. I brought 3 friends with me (all Malaysians)  to try this place out. The menu is filled with some of the more Malaysian 'hawker style' dishes. So, to the review of the dishes ordered ~  1) Satay Chicken ~ My guess is that it's fried and then slightly grilled. Very oily, not the usual authentic taste. The best satays are still at the 'Malay restaurant' in Queens . The peanut dipping sauce is ok. The condiments are miniscule and is not fresh. The marinade can be improved.2) Char Kuey Teow ~ Bland. But, it's the best dish out of the 4 that we ordered. More bean sprouts would not hurt either. 3) Assam Laksa ~ NOT authentic and the broth is just not cooked right. The least favorite for ALL of us. We returned it almost untouched. We did pay for it as it was not the server's fault. The service was good until he splattered the remaining Wat Tan Hor's sauce over my lap onto my jeans. He was quick thought to offer a wet wipe and paper napkins. 4) Wat Tan Hor ~ It's edible and served with the right preserved green chili.5) Nasi Lemak ~ It's mediocre. But, the sambal is good.

"I came here with a group of 10 on a Monday.  Parking was available on the street.  The food and service was great!  The bathroom is very clean!  We had the Nasi Lemak, Nyonya Rendang Curry with Beef and Veggie Meat, Cereal Butter Prawns, Grilled Season Fish on a Banana Leaf, Seafood Wattan Hor w/ Crispy Thin  Noodles, Penang Asam Laksa, Mee Fun Goreng with Shrimp, Satay Tofu and Roti.",5.0
"This place is super dope! Anyone who aHas been to Malaysia knows the awful withdrawal from Roti Chanai and Nasi lemak. Both of these dishes as well as the rendang are out of control good. The people who work here couldn't be nicer, like not I work in the service industry nice, legit kind humans work here. Definitely come in and sit down. Can't recommend the place enough.",5.0
"Ordered crab Rangoon which was so so; mini pork belly bun $8, it was good but wayyy over prices for $8. You can buy those mini buns from any Asian supermarket for like 20 buns with this prices; oyster omelette was pretty good, oyster was fresh and big, should defo order if you are fan of oysters ; last but not least, pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp, was a big portion but taste was little plain for me, and shrimp is lil mini as well. Over all would try this spot again with more malay food.",4.0
"Malaysian food is a mix of Malay, Indian, Chinese, and Indonesian cooking. Most of the Malaysian food in New York City is mostly Chinese.  This place really captures the flavors and ingredients of Malaysia.  The traditional Malaysian and Indonesian dishes like Curry Laksa, Rendang, Mee Goreng and Canai are fantastic.",5.0

I love this little place for so many reasons. The food is excellent. The walls are painted this perfectly calming blue with lovely quotes about the ocean adorning them. The servers are attentive and kind.,5.0

"All good things to say about this place. Food was very good, service was excellent. Very attentive and friendly, they made sure we had everything we needed, and the small dining area made it easy to flag a server if needed.  Ordered the black pepper snow crab (might just be the ""best in the city"") and the shrimp/chicken basil rice, both extremely delicious. The crab is quite messy, but very good.",5.0
"Very happy to have an authentic Asian restaurant in the hood finally. Staff are very nice and friendly, the food was great! Some dishes really reminds me where i from. Will def visit again!",4.0
"I have been here twice since it has opened and it has been amazing each time. The Nasi Lemak is my favorite- yum in the tum tum, and Shrimp & Fish cakes are so good. Also the pork belly skewers with the peanut sauce are awesome. The Bak Kuet Teh tastes like more-the pork ribs just fall off the bone and the broth is sweet and tasty.  All the flavors and spices are very unique, and all the food is delicious. It is a very cozy and fun atmosphere and can be great place for a date or a family dinner.  All the waitresses are so nice and friendly. My new favorite restaurant!!!",5.0
This restaurant is NOT malaysian. It might be fusion but definitely not Malaysian. I am Malaysian and was so excited to try this place based on reviews. However I was truly dissapointed. It was so dissatisfying. The roti canai/ prays was the frozen kind that they had heated up. And the nasi lemak came with regular rice which kinda defeats the purpose of the dish being called nasi lemak in the first place. The place was so crowded and there was one server attending to the crowd. It was okay. In def not going back when I'm craving a little taste from home. So disappointed. And we came all the way from manhattan to try it out !,2.0

"Delicious surprise that will now be part of regular rotation. Attentive staff, fast service, inviting environment, and excellent Malaysian food.

"I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  Warm and friendly staff, alongside an inviting and slightly modern atmosphere (not pretentious or overdone).  The food was very flavorful and good.  Portions a bit small, but perhaps I'm just used to oversized 'American' portions.  Wouldn't say I'd crave this everyday, but will definitely return.  I had a red peanut/coconut based curry, my buddy had the most popular/traditional dish (can't recall the name) on top left of menu.",4.0
"So glad this place opened up. Its already one of my favorite places in Park Slope and I highly recommend it. The Nasi Lemak,  the National dish of Malaysia is a standout and a go-to.  All of the other dishes I've tried have been great as well. Mantow buns with condensed milk are like Malaysian funnel ball cakes you dip in sugar. I'd also suggest Mee Goreng is like a wetter, more flavorful pad Thai!",5.0
"Yum! Just ordered delivery...nice staff, quick delivery, and really delicious food. Good spice, tastes fresh and nicely packaged. I had the roti prata which was crispy and not greasy and the nasi lemak, which was just lovely. I went by the place, and it looks nice...I would eat in.",5.0

This new Malaysian spot in park slope has definite potential. The staff was unbelievably nice and friendly! We loved the Nasi Lemak- but didn't love the Penang Asam Laksa- it was very fishy and didn't taste as fresh as we would have liked. The space itself is clean and has a nice vibe especially with the front doors and windows open.,3.0
"Probably the least authentic Malaysian restaurant I've been to. The nasi lemak did not come with coconut rice. How is that possible? It was plain white rice. It's like ordering a hamburger and they give you sandwich bread instead of a bun. The roti canai equivalent was lazy. Clearly the roti was the frozen version and the curry was not good. The restaurant is nicely decorated and clean, which is why I didn't give 1 star.",2.0
"I can only comment on the delivery service, as I have not dined inside the restaurant.  However, considering how bad the food was when I got it delivered, I would never bother to actually eat at the restaurant.  The food arrived cold and was not only bland, but for the most part, tasteless.  I love Malaysian food, and have had my fair share of it in the past as an avid Asian food consumer.  I was sorely disappointed to find out that Al Seabu will have to be included in the plethora of horrible Asian food dining options in Park Slope.",1.0
