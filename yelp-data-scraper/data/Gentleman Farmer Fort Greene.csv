"As we sat down we were attended to. You can smell the sweet smells of the grill floating in the air. We ordered a bottle of the Rose and it was presented so lovely.  This place is perfect for a date night or a catch up dinner  with a girlfriend.I must say when the food arrived, I was impressed. My cousin ordered the tuna tartar for me to try and I must say it was delicious. I'm normally very skeptical of ordering it at places My lamb was cooked to perfection. We also ordered dessert which was another win.",5.0
"I had a lovely evening here dining with a group of friends. Service was very friendly. I had the goats cheese salad for an appetizer, which was ok, pleasant but on the small size. For my main course I had the mushroom ravioli, which was very good. I was surprised that the portion size was quite generous as sometimes when you order ravioli in a restaurant you get about 4 pieces! My friends and I ordered a bottle of white and red wine, and I very much enjoyed the white wine ordered from the menu, it was recommended by our server as something similar to a Sauvignon Blanc (it was an Italian equivalent). I would definitely recommend it. The restaurant has a cosy atmosphere with dimmed lighting to make it feel like a romantic space. Bonus points awarded to our server, when it came to paying the cheque! They were very accommodating when our table wanted to split the cheque across so many cards!",4.0
Pretty decent. If you're a vegetarian there aren't a lot of options for you but enough to choose from where you won't starve. But it appears it is more of a meat eaters paradise. The ingredients were high quality and appeared pretty fresh. The atmosphere of the place is very nice and old fashioned. The waitstaff is really super nice and very accommodating. We didn't feel rushed or pushed to order or finish our food as soon as possible.,4.0
Fairly pricey but absolutely worth it. The food was delicious. I had the cassoulet which came in a pretty generous portion size and my girlfriend had the venison. We also had the seared foie gras to start. The bill came to around $98 including tax & tip. Great service too. Would definitely come back here.,5.0
"Everything was amazing! Took my in-laws and they absolutely loved it! Totally recommend. My husband had the filet with fioegras, I had veal sausage with duck confit - - everything was spot on. Delicious wine as well.",5.0
"Throughly enjoyed brunch there today - everything from the fresh coffee to the perfect parfait. The hangar steak and fruit bowl were also terrific. Very flavorful!  The staff was top-notch, too. Much success to this rather new establishment. I'll be back!",5.0
"Gentleman Farmer benefits from a rare confluence of extremely high quality ingredient selection and menu preparation from a classically trained French chef, an extraordinary and unique wine program and extremely knowledgable and approachable service professionals.  This is a great addition to a neighborhood  itching for this level of high quality food and service.  I don't know where to start with recommendations but the venison is amazingly tender and savory while the goat cheese or duck breast salads manage to be nutritious, full of textures and  delicious all at once.   You can't go wrong with anything on this food or drink menu.   Eat andDrink up!",5.0
A wonderful addition to Ft Greene. Every dish at both of my visits were just lovely. Wine pairings very nice. All in all one I will be returning to again and again.,5.0
"This place is average as fuck, maybe slightly below considering how many better places you could go for the same price ($40-60/person for food and wine).Decor: Nothing notable. Service: Somewhat busted. Restaurant was at 10% capacity, but took a while for drink/food orders. Also, server did that thing where they are CONSTANTLY bussing your table. Food: We stuck to small plates. Biggest disappointment was the mushroom fondue. Cauliflower undercooked. Risotto was weird. Beet salad was solid. Saving grace was the apple fritters for dessert, which were delicious.",3.0
"I'm super happy this restaurant has come to the neighborhood! Foie gras within steps of my home makes me joyful. We had:Starter bread and white bean dip - yumScallops and foie gras (awesome, could eat this every day)French onion soup - the broth is so light, not like the heavy beef broth situation that you can sometimes find yourself inPheasant pate - boyfriend loves stuff like this, he was over the moonMushroom ravioli with truffles - yes pleaseFilet mignon with (yes more) foie gras - deevine!Creme brulee - perfectThe service was friendly and great, we split the bill and it was $72 for each of us which, with drinks, was very reasonable.Will fold this into our dining routine happily!",5.0
"Went here during their first week, months back. Still dreaming of their filet mignon foie gras dish, Tournedos Rossini. A must.",5.0
"Gentleman Farmer is a tremendous addition to the Fort Greene neighbourhood. The menu is delicious. My friends and I ordered a lot of plates to share: a pâté and beet & burrata salad appetisers, and a braised rabbit entree. For dessert, the waiter brought us a selection of three distinctly different offerings, the most surprisingly sapid of which was a creme brûlée with foie gras. The service was excellent. The staff are kind, attentive and knowledgable with the menu, and wonderfully welcoming hosts. I will definitely be returning and highly recommend it!",5.0
"Yummy food, great service and good ambiance. We got the Venison Steak, Duck Breast and the Bison Short Ribs.They were all winners, although the Duck Breast is probably my top reco. We'll all be back! Very soon!",4.0
"What A Gentleman!I. Die! Such a terrific addition to the scene on Myrtle. There wasn't one flaw with the meal and the customer service was unparalleled. The offerings are great- diverse and tasty. They treated us, including my semi- loud 4 year old like royalty. Come check it out, and keep coming back. Start with the scallops and foie, and stay for the mains.",5.0
"This lovely little neighborhood restaurant is right opposite our apartment, and we've wanted to try it for a date night for a while. The ambience is lovely - it was pretty quiet and chilled at around 9pm on Wednesday night, so we could chat easily. The service was great, lovely French waitress who I think may also run the business was very helpful and informative on the menu, the wine, and how to order. They have a good selection of organic wines which didn't leave me with the heavy-headed feeling after a glass that is the case with so many wines you get in the US. We were most curious to try the food, though, as the menu looks fantastic. We usually stick to veggie/vegan food, but knew that the meat was of very good quality - localy, organic, grass-fed - so decided to try some. We had the impeccable roasted cauliflower for the fist course, with pecorino cheese and anchovy breadcrumbs, that reminded me of my childhood favorite - cauliflower cheese! Followed by the duck cassoulet for me and the beef tongue for my boyfriend. The duck was great, very nicely cooked, crisp skin and soft meat. The beans were very flavorful. The wagyu beef tongue melted on your tongue too... all in all, very impressed. We'll definitely go back, and the brunch menu they've added looks superb too.",5.0
"Excellent food. Excellent service. A gem. I feel bad that they're on Myrtle, which is fine for conveniences but has zero charm. Wish this place was on Dekalb or closer to bed stuy Clinton hill. Try the mushroom soufflé or onion soup for appetizer and anything on the menu for main will be delicious. Hope they last -- Myrtle sucks.",5.0
"Welcome to the neighborhood! We were lucky enough to get a chance to try Gentleman Farmer Fort Greene this weekend and especially lucky because it was the last weekend that they are BYOB. The food was delicious. We all started with the onion soup, which was light but with the cheesy flavor that makes onion soup so good. We also tried the bison tartar, which I'd never had before and thought was excellent. I had the red snapper, my husband had the bison short rib and my friend had the cod. We all loved our dishes, although my husband wished his portion was a little larger. I actually found that I could not finish my snapper. The service was spot on--they were friendly and there when you needed them. The decor was like a modern french bistro. While it's not huge, you could easily come with a larger party or enjoy a quiet dinner for 2 (or 3) as we did.So happy to see this great restaurant on Myrtle Avenue. We can't wait to enjoy many more delicious meals at Gentleman Farmer Fort Greene.",5.0
"I had dinner at Gentleman Farmer in Fort Greene Brooklyn last night with 5 clients and the food was spectacular. We all found the ingredients very fresh and beautiful and simple presentations of the appetizers and entrees. The Tunaand Bison Tartare, Curried Snails and Beet Salad were excellent.For entrees we had the Seared Codfish (flaky and fresh), Rack of Lamd (perfectly done medium rare), Braised Rabbit (basil mashed potatoes were to die for) and the Bison Short Ribs ( root vegetable purée was yummy).We had two great bottles of French wine reasonably priced and Karim, the owner, made us some amazing desserts as well!I am booking my holiday party here and will be a regular........bravo to this great new addition to the Fort Greene fox scene!!",5.0
"10/10. Had the curried snails, rack of lamb and venison steak. All were perfect. Server was quite nice. 'Nuff said. Come here before it becomes overwhelmingly popular (which it will).",5.0
One of my favorite places. My friend and I went 2 times in the first weekend they opened. The service is always attentive and food is delicious. The brother waiters are beyond cute and nice. I love coming here and have been many times. Great addition to the neighborhood.,5.0

"Ate dinner to celebrate a special occasion. The service started off great is generally very good. The waitstaff are very smily and eager but lack polish. The manager is flat out irresponsible and the chef is very hit or miss.The bread and bean dip was great.  We thought it could have had meat in it but it didn't. We told the waiter that was great since we didn't eat meat.We had to send back the snapper as it was practically raw. The ravioli was great. That said the cod they send out was also great. When we sent back the snapper one of the two waiters we had (one waiter is enough and would have been better) said that we could have desert on him. Since it took a while for the replacement fish dish to come, we asked for the desert menu and ordered a too sweet and too heavy chocolate mouse. After we finished the replacement fish dish and after we almost finished the too sweet mouse, they brought out two frois gras creme brûlées. Since we didn't eat meat and already had the mouse we sent it back. The evening then ended horribly. They charged us for the mouse they said would be on the house, refused to take it off the bill, and said that the one waiter did not tell the other that we did meat eat meet so we should have taken the lately served frois gras creme Brûlées. The manager hid in the corner and didn't come out, the waiter said she refused to comp the desert they said they would comp. It's really a shame and pretty crazy as the waiters are very eager and the chef tries hard. They just need to get their sh*t together, fire the manager, cook the fish a bit more, and train the waiters.. One per table would also help a lot and most importantly they need to follow through on the experience they tried to create.",2.0
This place is absolutely delicious and the owners are wonderful. I never write Yelp reviews but here's my first. I had the snails and onion soup as an app. Both were excellent followed by the beef with fois gras which melted in my mouth. All I can say is I'm taking my girlfriend back tonight and I think this is a new gem on myrtle ave.,5.0
"this place was completely empty on a sunday night at 8 pm. We were literally the only people in the establishment during our main course.  For appetizers we got the bison tartare and the goat cheese salad. Both were fantastic and had super complex flavors. The bread that was given was also great, but beware, everything is really big and we were so full after appetizers that we could hardly touch our entrees. We got the rabbit and the duck breast. I cannot say which one was better because they were both absolutely fantastic. Again, the flavors were very complex, very complimentary. This is the best place I have tried in awhile. Only qualm, we were too full to finish the entrees and get dessert. We know better than to order two appetizers next time.",5.0
"The food was phenomenal. Venison was so juicy and creamy. Red snapper and fennel went together so smoothly. Service was impeccable. All-around amazing experience and totally worth it.

"Absolutely amazing experience from start to finish. The staff was friendly and helpful with food selections. The room was dimly lit and by 8:00pm it was a packed house.  We loved it because it felt cool and trendy.  For starters, we had the scallops with foie gras, pheasant, and tuna tartare.  All three dishes were well seasoned. The scallop foie gras was especially delectable because the texture paired so well with the scallops and split pea velouté.  For the main course we had the bison short rib and the mushroom ravioli. I don't eat mushrooms but my husband said it was very tasty.  I myself devoured the short rib. It was so tender, I didn't want the meal to end. The wine was also very good. We tried 3 altogether, and the staff definitely poured generous glasses. Lastly we had creme brûlée and the apple tart for dessert. Both were good but we were so stuffed, we couldn't finish it all.  Overall ""A+"" experience. We can't wait to go again.",5.0
