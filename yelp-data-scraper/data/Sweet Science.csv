"Oh Sweet Science how sweet art thou! Hands down my favorite establishment in BROOKLYN!!! I have been going to Sweet Science for some months now, I guess I could say I'm pretty much a regular. In the beginning it was my Friday after work spot, shortly after it became my brunch spot, now it's my ""hey it's Tuesday lets go grab a drink at Sweet Science"" spot. It's an awesome feeling to walk into a place where everybody knows your name, my CHEERS bar!!! The staff at Sweet Science work super hard to keep their customers HAPPY, PLEASED, SATISFIED, COMFORTABLE, and of course DRUNK!!! LOL The owner James is absolutely one of the most funny, outgoing, humble people I have ever encountered myself with. Not only does James talk, interact and entertain his customers but you will always find him working his butt off (except for when he's making it clap). LOLThe manager Nikki, my MATE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE her!!! My girl can hands down make any cocktail for you at any given time! Nikki is an exemplary mixologist!! Not only do they taste exceptional but my God is this BEAUTY fast!!! My girl can keep you sitting at that bar for hours, some may say even 12 hours LOL ;-) I am so pleased with the friendship that we have created.  Ok, so not only is the service, ambiance, music, staff and drinks AMAZING but the foooooood is finger licking GOOD!!! Milton, the head chef, is not only an amazing cook but the presentation is delighting. His creativity definitely shines in his meals. I highly recommend Sweet Science to anyone who is looking to have a great meal, awesome cocktail, tons of laughs, and some serious eye candy!!! Love Love Love Sweet Science and all the wonderful friends I have gained from this place!!! Ok now ""I'm weaving with my piggles"" LOL",5.0
Brunch is amazing!!! Come have a good time Saturday and Sunday. And if your in the neighborhood during the week lunch or dinner will fill you. Shrimp N Grits is fantastic.,5.0
"OK ambience ,  but the food is ""meh"" at best.Came in toda ( Saturday) with my husband. No wait and had a choice  of seats. The waitress  was nice ,  but the service once spotty On to the  food. I had the Chicken and Waffles  and my husband  had the Oxtail  Hash. Good presentation, but boh needed seasoning. Can you say ""bland?"" We also had a side of biscuits  and grits . They both were good, as was the coffee.Glad  I came. Will we be back? No.",2.0
"Aight so the Science here is that, the vibe here is dope but the food here is nope. I love the feel and energy of Sweet Science, cool R&B/hip hop music, trendy looking crowd and hip decor. I wasn't greeted upon entering and was confused where to go to approach anyone. I ended up with a table near the door and every guest that arrived  looked just as confused. My crab cake was a frozen version not a flaky carefully crafted crab cake. The Mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy and had a distinct flavor while topped with breadcrumbs or Parmesan. The burger was dry and the temperature of everything was cold. It took an hour to arrive so I guess it sat around in the kitchen. The ciroc coconut rum taste nice but didn't give me much buzz. My waiter was courteous and gave nice suggestions. I'm willing to give SS a second chance because it has all the makings of a pretty cool spot.",3.0
Came here with a friend for dinner. 1. The food was great. We ordered the crab cakes and the chicken and biscuit bucket. The crab cakes were great. I would recommend them. The chicken was flavorful and the honey butter omg (best butter I've ever had). The biscuit was ok. A little dry (maybe an off day). But other than that the food still deserves two thumbs up. 2. The drinks were ok. I ordered the southpaw which tasted pretty good however I just wish they would have added more alcohol. The drinks in my opinion were a little weak. 3. I enjoyed the various pieces of art they had on display. 4. The music was great Overall thumbs up all the way. Will be returning,4.0
"Overall cool, dim environment but had cheap, folding chairs which weren't that comfortable. The drinks are strong and a good size. Our waitress was nice but reversed our orders each time and we had to remind her who ordered what dish. There is a lounge area with couches by the center of the restaurant and decor that reminded me of a modern Frankenstein.The fried pickles were abundant but too deeply fried (I ended up peeling off some of the fried parts). The jalapeño poppers were good, along with the catfish burger (but the taste of the burger could have been improved - it was somewhat bland). The chicken quesadilla was alright... The cream cheese was too hard and I could not dip the quesadilla. There was not enough salsa provided as well. The flavor that stood out the most would be the barbecue sauce. Overall, it is a good place for drinks and it is conveniently right in front of a MTA bus stop!",3.0
"Live right around the corner and have walked by this place every night on my way to work, but never gave it a second thought... Came here for brunch last Sun. w/ honey dip after worship and very much enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The space has a cool layout which features a spacious bar, a semi private lounge, and an assortment of seating to accommodate patrons of any group size, but (Note to mgmt...) please get rid of those wack folding chairs...not comfortable nor a good look! Other than that... we were given (2) complimentary mimosas and received two Henny shots along with our brunch (shrimp & grits, kale salad, (2) scratch biscuits, eggs, crab cakes, french toast, and a diet coke... what???) Yep we greedy! Food arrived in reasonable time, but could've been warmer though... the mixed wait staff was chill and friendly, and the music was eclectic as was the crowd... Definitely a nice chill spot that I will be revisiting sometime soon!",4.0
"I came to sweet science while in the area on a Sunday night. I used Yelp to find it. The restaurant is spacious and dimly lit. It's a nice date spot with an intimate setting. My friend and I ordered margaritas. They were great and had a perfect amount of alcohol. For food, we shared chicken quesadillas, truffle fries, and Mac and cheese, which had bacon and jalapeños. I was blown away by the food, truly. Everything was so delicious. The portions were a pretty big size. My friend and I couldn't finish everything even though we really wanted to. The service was very attentive. Also, I couldn't believe how cheap our bill was. I was expecting it to be much more considering we got a lot of food and four drinks. I loved this place! I can't wait to return when in the area again!",5.0
"Started off at 5 stars. This place is cute, quaint, trendy with a nice, calm atmosphere. The food is very tasty. I ordered the extra crispy honey barbecued fried chicken, with blue cheese sauce on the side. My friend ordered truffle fries and a shrimp and grits meal. She agrees that the flavoring and portion sizing was on point. They lost a star because our waitress was never around. I had to flag her down multiple times to address my order. When we first walked in, there wasn't any signage or anyone around to tell us whether we should seat ourselves or whether we will be seated. We sat ourselves, and then waited about ten minutes to place our drink orders, then another ten minutes or so for our drinks to arrive, then another 15 for her to come back and check on us ( after I flagged her down to get her attention). I am compelled to also say that the place was not packed.  So, will I go back maybe, when I mentally prepare myself to be annoyed by the indifference of the waitress. I think that some time should be spent on training the wait staff for a better dining experience.",4.0
So I went back & again everything was good but this time I realized the Mac & cheese is kinda salty but tastes better as left overs,5.0
"The other night I was here and this places vibe is so cool between the music,Decor,and atmosphere you immediately feel so comfortable.My bartender was Jacob I got there around 2 AM so I was already under the influence and forgot to leave him a huge tip but I can't wait to go back and slide him something for a great experience.The way he made our drinks was so good ..worth going to check out!!!",5.0
"I stopped in here on a whim,had it bookedmarked forever the owner was super cool.I have to bring the boo here great energy and the shrimp and grits were delicious.I have a new spot and its a black owned business.They also have a great speakeasy space.",5.0
"James, You took my comment left field about the staff. I know what the Law is, and I wasn't suggesting that you hire only African Americans. I'm just saying at the time I came I didn't see any. At the end of the day, that is your business not telling you how to run the show. I am just a customer who was saying her opinion on Yelp, This is my experience with the food. My thoughts on the staff are my opinion, but still you didn't address the issue which has to do with the tasting of the food. I heard about this restaurant on I don't do clubs black-owned section.   I came for brunch.  I order the chicken and waffles; I was very disappointed the chicken had no taste what so ever! And the waffle was horrible no flavor. My boyfriend had biscuits with lobster bites.  It was like one tiny piece of lobster at best the biscuits were not filling what so ever.  We had a drink called the Big- A-Lin which is grape juice and champagne.  It was ok I didn't taste any champagne.  I was very disappointed with this restaurant,  But now reading other reviews a few people had the same experience with the chicken not being seasoned. I wish I would have checked Yelp before coming. But you live, and you learn. I will not be coming back.",1.0
"Let me start by saying I wish I can give this place an additional star. The ambiance alone was enough to give it 5 stars. The urban infused art pieces was really a nice touch rather than the typical standard decor. This place is know for their ""Biggie Special"", which is the steak, cheese eggs, and welch's grape. This was made popular by late great Brooklyn native rapper, the Notorious B.I.G.Now to the entree. It's grilled hanger steak but in tender flavorful chunks. The eggs were so fluffy and had the perfect balance of cheese. The dish also came with home fries and salad. To wash down all of this delicious food was the ""Big-A-Lini"", welch's grape and champagne. That was very good. I'll definitely be back here very soon. Good ambiance, service, and food. 5 stars across the board!",5.0
"Sweet sweet science. I don't know what it is, but something about the name of this place makes me feel all warm and gooey inside. Weird, I know. I stopped into Sweet Science about 3 minutes after Yelp searching ""ribs"" within ""2 blocks."" When I want ribs, I want ribs right this damn minute. It was around 7pm on a Friday night when my gf and I sat down at a small table by the window. For the first few minutes of our visit, and randomly throughout the rest of our dinner, a group of douches by the bar were screaming along to whatever song was playing. Believe me, I've had my share of idiotic fun, but if you're going to be sitting in a restaurant, I would strongly suggest not to scream/shriek as loud as you can because no one, I repeat, no one thinks you're cute. When we sat down at the table, we quickly realized how cold it was. Maybe because we were sitting next to the window or maybe because there were only a few occupied tables, but either way, we both wore our jackets for most of the meal. We ordered the warm kale and beet salad to share which was pretty tasty. It was much cheesier than I had expected, which is alway a nice surprise. The dressing paired well with the lightly sautéed kale and soft chunks of beet. My girlfriend got the fried chicken and biscuit meal which she really enjoyed. There were 3 pieces of spicy crisp chicken and a flakey biscuit served with a side of creamy apple butter. Not a huge serving, but for $10, it was a nice amount of food.I got the ribs (duh) witch came with mashed potatoes (I substituted mashed sweet potatoes) and coleslaw. My $17 ribs were cooked nicely and smothered with a sweet BBQ sauce. The ribs lay over the mash and coleslaw so they also got a little smear of saucey goodness. The coleslaw had a great crunch, but the sweet mash lacked flavor. Another slightly annoying thing was that It was really dark at the table, so I couldn't really see what I was eating. A candle was brought over about half way through meal but it literally did nothing to brighten the table. A nice positive to the meal was the service. We started with a sweet woman who offered some IPA suggestions to my gf and checked on us just the right amount of times and we ended with a sweet gentleman who seemed to really enjoy his job.",4.0
"#I guess I got everything #Biggie Smalls related. The #Biggie Breakfast that comes with a #Big-a-lini (Welch's Grape Juice & champagne) and the #Big Bloody (Bloody Mary w/ shrimp, bacon and a beer chaser). And they are all big, not small.The #steak was okay, but better with A.1. sauce. I think I used half a bottle. Jeez, I love #A.1. sauce. A.1. is kind of expensive per ounce. So I guess I got my money's worth.They have #football on TV, but it's kind of weird when you are watching it and the girls that are in front of you think you are staring at them. I think they liked me.",4.0
"Me and the boy came in around 11pm on a Sunday for some much needed food when every other kitchen in the area had closed down - this is a great late night dining option! The space is pretty large, lots of seating at tables as well as around the bar. Food was solid. Pulled pork was OK. The Cajun catfish (not fried) comes slightly spicy with a side of collard greens. The fish was good but I was going nuts for those greens, they were positively loaded up with garlic. Fires were nice and crispy with enough soft ones thrown in to make everyone happy. The crab cakes taste better then they appear at first, and the lemon aioli they come with is delicious. Music was interesting for a Sunday night. Madonna, Whitney Houston, some rap sprinkled in. There was a birthday party going down so I think they were playing for that crowd. They have Crabbies Ginger Beer and an agave wheat beer, nice ambiance, and they serve food late- definitely worth a visit.",3.0
"I love this place! I usually stop here with my boyfriend after a long day at work and I just love the vibe. The lights are always pretty dim, they have nice artwork hanging around the place & they play old school hip hop. I always get seated right away & the waiters are just so nice & attentive! I always make sure to leave a great tip.My favorite things from here are the mash potatoes and I always have to have the southpaw drink while I'm here!!",5.0
"Is this cheeeesseeeee in my bloody mary? Yes, please! Sweet Science is a gigantic brunch spot in a tucked away in East Williamsburg. It never seems to amaze me how you can find the best places just walking a different path. I love the modern look of the restaurant. They have high ceilings, open space and a pretty large wrap around bar. I especially enjoy the Day of the Dead motif on the booze shelf. I am a sucker for all things sugar skull. And the shelf is definitely how I would set up by home bar. Sweet Science specializes in southern comfort. I love southern food but sometimes it's difficult to get pescatarian choices. But lucky for me this was not the case. The recommendation for pescatarians was the crab cake benedict or the lobster and biscuits or the shrimp and grits. Soooo many options. I was thrown off by the name ""Crab Meat"" instead of ""Crab Cake"" but it made sense when my dish arrived and there was less bread than crab. And let's face it, that's really what we all want. My dish came with a side of toast and home fries. We couldn't resist getting a side of biscuits. I love biscuits and instead of jam they gave us a side of marmalade. After my first bite you could just call me Paddigton Bear...marmalade is on the most underrated breakfast topping. I loved seeing the slivers of orange peel on my biscuit with a little more butter of course. Can one have too much butter? I think not. Then my brother got the chicken and waffles. He loves himself some chicken and waffles. The waffles came out separately adorned with fluffy clouds of whip cream and fresh fruit. I was able to sneak a bite and it was incredible. The waffle had the fluffy and crispiness that you look for in waffles. The chicken came in a cute little metal bucket. My brother being the big brother he is quickly grabbed his fried chicken and stroked that chicken allllll over his waffle to prevent any more theft of his breakfast. Obviously someone has sharing issues. And as I mentioned the bloody was the perfect beverage for brunch. And since there was pickled items and cheese...did I mention cheese, it was the perfect appetizer while brunch is being prepared. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other pescatarian options and I definitely have to come for dinner. I must have the Catfish sandwich! I also want to mention they have a frozen cocktail machine with three flavors. If you get all three it's called ""Cotton Candy"". The colors are reminiscent of circus fun but the taste is for us big kids! Totally worth the brain freezzzzze!",5.0
Sweet science is one of my favorite honey bbq wing spot !!! The ambient here is really nice and chilled. Really nice spot to come with friends for brunch. Wouldn't really recommend it to come to the bar for drinks because the crowd is kind of boring. The drinks are okay but still good. Waitresses are really nice and helpful.

"If you're in Brooklyn you have to stop here--for not only the top notch food and drink but for the great people who work there.I was passing through Brooklyn for an interview and stopped by and immediately met the owner, James, who joined me for drinks and introduced me to some of the regulars. All good people. The food was top notch. As a New Orleanian, I take food seriously and the fish sandwich was different than a traditional New Orleans po' boy, but gives it a serious run for its money.I couldn't help but return every night I was in town. I met the manager later that week, Nikki, who makes some outrageously delicious drinks. On a cold Sunday, you won't find a better Irish Coffee on this side of the Atlantic than at Sweet Science. So whether you're looking for great food, great drinks or just a great time--for fucks sake, get yer ass to Sweet Science.",5.0
"I came here with a few friends for Black Owned Restaurant Month.  We took advantage of the pre-fixe menu, which included an appetizer, entree, dessert, and cocktail for $35.  What a great deal!Before our meals, we had one of the frozen cocktails at the bar.  Before 8, they are only $5.  The peach whiskey is amazing!  So refreshing.  With the meal, I had the strawberry margarita.  Also a really good drink.  Sweeter than the peach one.  Be careful with these.  You can't taste the alcohol, so you end up sucking them down pretty quickly.Once we were seated, it took a while for anyone to bring water or take our orders.  I think they were understaffed.  That said, even though service was a bit slow, nobody seemed frazzled or annoyed, which tends to happen at other places when waitstaff is overwhelmed.  The owner of the restaurant was our server, and he was very friendly and conversational.  It's easy to overlook the wait time when you have someone who seems genuinely happy that you're there.I ordered the tangy South Carolina barbecue wings as my appetizer.  Such a delicious flavor.  The wings were perfect.  Crispy and meaty, not soggy at all.  It was also a huge serving.  I was almost full by the time our entrees arrived.I had the hanger steak.  It was like a mountain of meat on top of a mountain of potatoes.  So much food!  The steak was pretty good.  Well-cooked with a nice glaze (balsamic reduction, maybe).  The potatoes were also really good.  Very flavorful, and real potatoes, including the skin (my favorite).  The dessert was panna cotta.  It was topped with either raspberry or strawberry topping and a sprig of mint.  Yummy.I had a very good experience here, and I'm glad for BORM.  I never would have known about this place otherwise.",4.0
"Came here on a late Saturday night and this place was pretty empty, except for a few people at the bar getting drinks. We walked in and waited a few minutes to be greeted and were seated soon after. The menu wasn't extensive we quickly skimmed it and put in our orders. The food came to the table it was hot & fresh and tasty. I got the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend had the fish with the sweet potato purée. He loved it! I had a bite and it was tasty, my shrimp and grits had a really yummy gravy... Once the food cane to the table we felt the service kind of fell to the wayside. The employees were busy having a good time at the bar and kind of forgot us. I get that it was late on Saturday but we were the only ones eating so it should not be an excuse. All and all the food was good but I've heard amazing things about the brunch so I do want to come back and give them another chance. Overall Good, and satisfying but not memorable.",3.0
"Absolutely great service. The host was very friendly and let us eat/drink by the sofas. THE BEST ITEM on the menu hands down is the truffle mac n cheese. Also, the frozen drinks are AMAZING. I literally had to stop and remind myself that it had alcohol. It has become a staple restaurant for me. Super chill on sunday nights.",5.0
"Came here for lunch during the week. Practically empty- had my reservations at first and it was freezing inside- but I have to say that the food was great and service was attentive.Me , my friend and her daughters- shared the 6 piece wings with pineapple BBQ sauce and it was delicious. Both me and my friend had the catfish sandwich-we opted for sweet potato fries instead . Serving is huge . One of the girls had a BLT and she loved it. I suppose more people come at night and for their brunch. I took a gander at the brunch menu and it was a dope selection- anyone that has a selection of Benedicts and things like huevos rancheros and chicken and waffles are ok with me :) Will have to come back and try brunch :) and have a cocktailThere was also cool art up- Art Deco pieces of music stars made of broken up records. Didn't notice it until on of the little girls mentioned it. Pretty cool.",4.0
Located on Graham ave I have driven by this place a million times and never noticed it.  I was there first customer of the day so obviously service was fast.  Bartender was extremely friendly and very helpful when I asked for recommendations.  I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of fries.  Chicken had enough spice and it was nice and  crispy.  They even put avocado in it mmmmm. Bartender recommended my friend try the smoked chicken quesadilla.  Oh darn was that good. Give it a try if you are in the neighborhood.,4.0
"Okay! So it's my first week living in the neighborhood, and this place was in walking distance so we decided to give it a try! Kind greeting upon entering and very fast service (it was early and empty when we got here). Drinks: Peach Bourbon Slush. Need I say more? This drink had me buzzed about halfway through and it was delicious. Also a decent beer selection for my better half. Appetizer: Disclosure - I am a Buffalo native. Wings are our thing. When we saw Spicy Pineapple BBQ wings on the menu, we had to try them. The sauce was delicious. I am impressed, and as a wing connoisseur that's hard. They could've had more meat, but that's just something that comes with wings from Buffalo I think. I was licking the sauce from my fingers - that's how amazing it was. Main course: shrimp and grits. Oh my goodness. This was amazing, really. Five big shrimp, white wine creamy sauce, scallions, cherry tomatoes, and bacon. I can't get over how good it was. My boyfriend loved his BBQ chicken quesadilla too. Food came out super hot, atmosphere was great, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and the Beatles were blasting, and it was an all around terrific experience. I will be back.",5.0
"I ordered dinner from the prix-fixe menu. The shrimp and grits had a nice flavor, but there were hardly any grits and way too much sauce. The bread pudding was very dense and lacked flavor.",2.0
"I really feel awkward giving this a 3 star review. I wish I could give a 4. I wanted to like this place a lot. Maybe we went on a bad night. We attempted to partake in the Black Owned Restaurant Month festivities. This restaurant was on the list and I read the reviews.. so why not. We arrived around 6:30pm. There was only 1 waitress. She didn't welcome us, she just rushed and sat us down. She gave us a prix fixe menu and left. We saw another table get seated by the bartender and he gave them a full menu. When our waitress came back we asked her for a full menu to peruse. I wanted to know all the options since we were here. When she finally came back we ordered.  I kind of felt bad because she was the only waitress at the time. I was more patient than normal. It wasn't her fault. This is when things went down hill. Our appetizers took 30 minutes to come out. Spicy pineapple wings were tasty. The crab cakes were nothing to brag about. Almost tasted pre fab frozen. So we ordered another drink to waste time and because we were hungry. By the way the frozen drinks were tasty and a great price of $5.00 before 8pm. We received our entrees at 8:15pm. Did you miss the part that we came in at 6:30pm? Again, I really felt bad for the waitress. The place started to get packed. The owner and another waitress finally came out to help with the tables.  The good - My Hangar steak was delish!! I ordered a small side of mac n cheese just to taste and it was also very good. The bad - My friends ordered the Lobster Mac n Cheese from the Prix Fixe menu and it was very loose and wet. It didn't seem to be cooked thoroughly. We flagged down the waitress and she explained this is due to the lobster.  (THIS IS NOT OUR 1ST Rodeo show with Lobster Mac n Cheese. This is not the norm)The redemption - Hesitant about sending food back to the kitchen my friends barley touched the Lobster Mac and decided to skip it. The owner walked by and noticed the full plates. He aplogized and offered another Entree. We declined. However, he gracefully offered to discount the bill and tried to make it a pleasant dining experience.  He seemed very sincere and his apologies were extremely appreciated. Overall, the place was clean and well layed out. Looks like a nice hang out spot. Unfortunately, it wasn't the best dining experience. The owner did make us feel better. We didn't even have the heart to tell him the waitress never served us our desserts.  I still suggest giving it a try. Really may have been an off night.",3.0
"I love this place! My boyfriend and I usually sit at the bar and Nicky takes care of us (she's great), but we also bring friends here and sit at tables as well. The whole place is beautifully decorated, hip hop music on tap, as well as a great selection of beers and a full bar. The food is great, too. I particularly love the veggie quesadilla for dinner and the Juan Manuel Marquez for brunch. I've always been happy with the food and the staff are great.",5.0
"If you're in Brooklyn you have to stop here--for not only the top notch food and drink but for the great people who work there.I was passing through Brooklyn for an interview and stopped by and immediately met the owner, James, who joined me for drinks and introduced me to some of the regulars. All good people. The food was top notch. As a New Orleanian, I take food seriously and the fish sandwich was different than a traditional New Orleans po' boy, but gives it a serious run for its money.I couldn't help but return every night I was in town. I met the manager later that week, Nikki, who makes some outrageously delicious drinks. On a cold Sunday, you won't find a better Irish Coffee on this side of the Atlantic than at Sweet Science. So whether you're looking for great food, great drinks or just a great time--for fucks sake, get yer ass to Sweet Science.",5.0
"I came here with a few friends for Black Owned Restaurant Month.  We took advantage of the pre-fixe menu, which included an appetizer, entree, dessert, and cocktail for $35.  What a great deal!Before our meals, we had one of the frozen cocktails at the bar.  Before 8, they are only $5.  The peach whiskey is amazing!  So refreshing.  With the meal, I had the strawberry margarita.  Also a really good drink.  Sweeter than the peach one.  Be careful with these.  You can't taste the alcohol, so you end up sucking them down pretty quickly.Once we were seated, it took a while for anyone to bring water or take our orders.  I think they were understaffed.  That said, even though service was a bit slow, nobody seemed frazzled or annoyed, which tends to happen at other places when waitstaff is overwhelmed.  The owner of the restaurant was our server, and he was very friendly and conversational.  It's easy to overlook the wait time when you have someone who seems genuinely happy that you're there.I ordered the tangy South Carolina barbecue wings as my appetizer.  Such a delicious flavor.  The wings were perfect.  Crispy and meaty, not soggy at all.  It was also a huge serving.  I was almost full by the time our entrees arrived.I had the hanger steak.  It was like a mountain of meat on top of a mountain of potatoes.  So much food!  The steak was pretty good.  Well-cooked with a nice glaze (balsamic reduction, maybe).  The potatoes were also really good.  Very flavorful, and real potatoes, including the skin (my favorite).  The dessert was panna cotta.  It was topped with either raspberry or strawberry topping and a sprig of mint.  Yummy.I had a very good experience here, and I'm glad for BORM.  I never would have known about this place otherwise.",4.0
"Came here on a late Saturday night and this place was pretty empty, except for a few people at the bar getting drinks. We walked in and waited a few minutes to be greeted and were seated soon after. The menu wasn't extensive we quickly skimmed it and put in our orders. The food came to the table it was hot & fresh and tasty. I got the shrimp and grits and my boyfriend had the fish with the sweet potato purée. He loved it! I had a bite and it was tasty, my shrimp and grits had a really yummy gravy... Once the food cane to the table we felt the service kind of fell to the wayside. The employees were busy having a good time at the bar and kind of forgot us. I get that it was late on Saturday but we were the only ones eating so it should not be an excuse. All and all the food was good but I've heard amazing things about the brunch so I do want to come back and give them another chance. Overall Good, and satisfying but not memorable.",3.0
"Absolutely great service. The host was very friendly and let us eat/drink by the sofas. THE BEST ITEM on the menu hands down is the truffle mac n cheese. Also, the frozen drinks are AMAZING. I literally had to stop and remind myself that it had alcohol. It has become a staple restaurant for me. Super chill on sunday nights.",5.0
"Came here for lunch during the week. Practically empty- had my reservations at first and it was freezing inside- but I have to say that the food was great and service was attentive.Me , my friend and her daughters- shared the 6 piece wings with pineapple BBQ sauce and it was delicious. Both me and my friend had the catfish sandwich-we opted for sweet potato fries instead . Serving is huge . One of the girls had a BLT and she loved it. I suppose more people come at night and for their brunch. I took a gander at the brunch menu and it was a dope selection- anyone that has a selection of Benedicts and things like huevos rancheros and chicken and waffles are ok with me :) Will have to come back and try brunch :) and have a cocktailThere was also cool art up- Art Deco pieces of music stars made of broken up records. Didn't notice it until on of the little girls mentioned it. Pretty cool.",4.0
Located on Graham ave I have driven by this place a million times and never noticed it.  I was there first customer of the day so obviously service was fast.  Bartender was extremely friendly and very helpful when I asked for recommendations.  I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of fries.  Chicken had enough spice and it was nice and  crispy.  They even put avocado in it mmmmm. Bartender recommended my friend try the smoked chicken quesadilla.  Oh darn was that good. Give it a try if you are in the neighborhood.,4.0

It was okay.  Loved the decor.  A huge space..dimly lit..cool chill environment.  Service is not that great.  Sat at the bar...and the whole time the bartender was playing with her phone.  I'm not asking her to be my BFF....but that doesn't feel welcoming.  A small..how's ur day..or have you been here before  would be nice.  Ordered a peach whiskey frozen drink that was on happy hour special.  Five bucks.  It was good but felt like it was missing the whiskey.  Ordered takeout...the bartender kinda slammed the food on the bar..gave me the bill without asking me if I wanted another non alcoholic slushy.  Signed the bill and left a dollar tip for the drink which she kinda looked at with a smirk / sneer.  Umm..did u expect anything more..go back to playing with your phone miss. Well onto the food.  I ordered the sautéed Kale and beets and I actually really enjoyed it.  It was covered in a lemon dressing that was balanced.I also ordered the spicy pineapple glaze wings.  Meh.  The wings didn't taste seasoned.  It felt like they fried unseasoned wings and dipped it in the glaze afterward..so the flavors didn't sink in.  Sadly it wasn't even spicy.  Will I come back...not sure..,3.0
"Let me stay first by saying the decor here is very nice. The bar has a Dia de Los Muertos theme with a picture of Biggie Smalls in the back wall. Not sure how that ties together, but I like it.I came in around 4pm, so the place was practically empty, which is always nice. I ordered the Blue Hawaiian and it packs a nice little punch. It's a slushy drink if you like that sort of thing, which I do thank you very much! I was waiting for a date, and I had a lot of time to kill so I ordered the 6 spicy pineapple bbq wings and truffle fries. The wings when I first bit into them I didn't taste any spicy-ness, but as I kept eating, the spice showed up. Usually if a menu has the word spicy, I like my food spicy, not baby spicy. But they were good regardless. Nothing major for me to cry about. The truffle fries were ok... The mayo or aioli or whatever mayo and ketchup mixed together is called was not really my style, so I primarily used the ranch from the wings for my fires.When my date finally arrived, I ordered the smokin' Joe chicken quesadilla and he ordered the Cajun catfish. The quesadilla is a pulled chicken with big leafy greens. It says it has bacon and tomatoes, but I really didn't taste either. I was actually full when it came out, so I ended up taking it home. As for the Cajun catfish, it was actually very very very good; seasoned perfectly. The sides however, could have been better. According to my date, the sweet mashed potatoes were good and the collard greens were bland. If yo mama or grandma gets down with the greens, then you will be disappointed.Overall, I like this spot and can hopefully make it back for brunch with the girls.",4.0

"Came here with three friends for Black-owned Restaurant Week.  Our visit started off well - frozen drinks at the bar for happy hour, the peach whiskey flavor was great.  Then we were seated and wait over 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our table.  Finally the owner came by, took our order and brought us water.  He also took our drink order and then brought over free tequila shots for the table, which went a long way towards mollifying any bad feelings that may have been brewing.  I had the crab cakes and they were fine, not that flavorful, but good enough.  My friends seemed satisfied with their wings in all the flavors.  However, the true star of the evening was the hanger steak.  It was a large portion, cooked well, and flavored to perfection.  Everyone was very happy with it.  I wish I had had more just to take home for later.  The dessert panacotta was sweet and light and good punctuation to what had been a heavy meal.  All-in-all it was a good experience, that made up for subpar service with exuberance and tasty food and drinks.",4.0

Ok so Im totally a foodie or maybe just extremely greedy but I seen Sweet Science on instagram & added it to my restuarant bucket list.Upon arrival on a Sun after it was empty which was surprising to me after seeing all the reviews. The other half of my party hadnt arrived yet but they seated me anyway. Reviewing the menu I couldn't decide on what to get as I seen photo of most of the dishes but I finally settled for the shrimp & grits. Normally I ALWAYS have grits w cheese so I asked Brit our waitress would adding cheese be a problem. She said no and actually suggested I get the 3 cheese grits and put the shrimp on the side. Oooh my my my it was delicious man I was in love & planning my next visit. The shrimp was very good too. So much so I ordered more *greedy i tell ya*. While waiting on my friend another friend that lives in the area swung by to see me & said this place is great. So we have made plans to return for a girls day. The food was good I was happy I cane and not to mention theres still some time to take advantage of #BORM so Ill be back before the month is over to take advantage of the prefix menu.,5.0

"My second visit to Sweet Science today for lunch was just as pleasant as my first last weekend . My cousin and I were just walking around our neighborhood looking for a quick bite outside of a fast food venue and we bumped into Sweet Science. The outside of the spot was a bit dark so I didn't know whether it was open or not but once I went inside I seen the bar, the TV's and the crowd, I felt more at ease. We decided to grab a window table and ordered the Carolina tangy wings and Southpaw drink that was recommended by our waitress. Both selections were great. The waitress/ bartender was very attentive and accommodating to us. The spot had lively music and a nice trendy crowd. And the location was convenient being a block and a half away from my house. This was a good find. I did have to take one star off though. Lighting was a bit too dim for me but the spot was still cool.",4.0

"Came here with three friends for Black-owned Restaurant Week.  Our visit started off well - frozen drinks at the bar for happy hour, the peach whiskey flavor was great.  Then we were seated and wait over 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our table.  Finally the owner came by, took our order and brought us water.  He also took our drink order and then brought over free tequila shots for the table, which went a long way towards mollifying any bad feelings that may have been brewing.  I had the crab cakes and they were fine, not that flavorful, but good enough.  My friends seemed satisfied with their wings in all the flavors.  However, the true star of the evening was the hanger steak.  It was a large portion, cooked well, and flavored to perfection.  Everyone was very happy with it.  I wish I had had more just to take home for later.  The dessert panacotta was sweet and light and good punctuation to what had been a heavy meal.  All-in-all it was a good experience, that made up for subpar service with exuberance and tasty food and drinks.",4.0
"Really great is this place!!! I've been here a couple of times the menu is solid and service is good. The drinks are good too and the concept is well defined. Decor here is nice and the layout is spacious, the bar is large roomy and comfortable for extended stay. Sometimes the bar service is cold and impersonal but the food and drinks balance it out. If you have meat dishes request well done so it's fully cooked particularly the chicken dishes. It's around the corner from my friend's real cool custom clothing shoppe.",3.0
Ok so Im totally a foodie or maybe just extremely greedy but I seen Sweet Science on instagram & added it to my restuarant bucket list.Upon arrival on a Sun after it was empty which was surprising to me after seeing all the reviews. The other half of my party hadnt arrived yet but they seated me anyway. Reviewing the menu I couldn't decide on what to get as I seen photo of most of the dishes but I finally settled for the shrimp & grits. Normally I ALWAYS have grits w cheese so I asked Brit our waitress would adding cheese be a problem. She said no and actually suggested I get the 3 cheese grits and put the shrimp on the side. Oooh my my my it was delicious man I was in love & planning my next visit. The shrimp was very good too. So much so I ordered more *greedy i tell ya*. While waiting on my friend another friend that lives in the area swung by to see me & said this place is great. So we have made plans to return for a girls day. The food was good I was happy I cane and not to mention theres still some time to take advantage of #BORM so Ill be back before the month is over to take advantage of the prefix menu.,5.0

"My second visit to Sweet Science today for lunch was just as pleasant as my first last weekend . My cousin and I were just walking around our neighborhood looking for a quick bite outside of a fast food venue and we bumped into Sweet Science. The outside of the spot was a bit dark so I didn't know whether it was open or not but once I went inside I seen the bar, the TV's and the crowd, I felt more at ease. We decided to grab a window table and ordered the Carolina tangy wings and Southpaw drink that was recommended by our waitress. Both selections were great. The waitress/ bartender was very attentive and accommodating to us. The spot had lively music and a nice trendy crowd. And the location was convenient being a block and a half away from my house. This was a good find. I did have to take one star off though. Lighting was a bit too dim for me but the spot was still cool.",4.0
"Yesterday I had brunch at the bar - had a bad experience with the bar tender.  The Australian woman bartender told me the 100 I tried to pay with was fake because it didn't have a blue stripe!  She then pulled out her shiny new $100 bill with blue stripe to show me ""mine was fake""... LOL, You might want to educate her that not all $100's have the blue stripe if printed later than a few years ago if she is to be collecting money for your business.  I could have handled this and not written a review if the woman wasn't so rude about it, I was taken back....  It wasn't the message, it was how rudely she delivered it.  The friend I was with was a bartender and she was surprised how uninformed and condescending the bartender was.  I've lived in this neighborhood for 13 year, have liked your food but the service is seriously lacking.  After yesterday don't know if I'll be returning - left a bad taste in my mouth - no pun intended.",2.0

"I had my birthday here Friday. Everyone I interacted with at the bar was super friendly and they were very accommodating about my reservation.

"WORST SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF SERVICE. I apologize in advance but I HAD to!!!  I'd give 1/4 of a star if I could! My party of 5 went to this spot on Sat 11/21 for their Reggae Rhythms & Blues Brunch they were having from 11-4, I believe. We all RSVP'd to this event prior to the day. Apparently, for a table you had to email them in advance, which we didn't do because they said they were packed but it did say they were taking walk-ins. They were offering a $25 pre-fix (T&G not included) for an appetizer, entrée & beverage.So 1 of our friends arrived at 1pm to get our name on the list; the rest of us arrived at 145. We get there already knowing we may be waiting at least 45 mins-no more than an hour. It's a dope looking bar, nice size, but it wasn't overly packed. The host tells us @ 2pm that once they get all the 2pm reservations in, we'll be seated. Mind you there was only 2 other groups that came in after us that had reservations.  Since no on one really paid us any attention, we finally were able to get some seats at the bar itself and placed our order w the bartender since who knows when we'll get seated!  Literally 5 seconds after we ordered-the host says they have a table.  We tell the bartender sorry, we'll go with the table so its more private. We didn't get seated until 3PM EXACTLY, even though I saw several parties leave the party so I'm so confused as to why we weren't seated prior.  ANYWAY---at this time we're STARVING so we get to our table, pour OURSELVES water(even though other tables we observed while waiting got their water poured FYI). We have no menus at this point but approx. 10 mins later a flustered looking waitress makes eye contact with us after helping another table saying she'll be right with us. So now there are 5 hungry black women at a table, which is not something you want to see LOL  Luckily the bartender from earlier walks over w the drinks we ordered and told us that she put our food orders in for us. THANK GOD because clearly our waitress couldn't care less that we didn't even have MENUS this whole time.  -___-  When she finally decides to come over,(she doesn't even apologize for the wait)--my friend adds on a side order of fries to her meal.  Its now 345PM..there's NO FOOD at our table, but wait, here come's the order of fries ONLY, which was ordered after the fact. 15 minutes later, a side salad comes for a second person. 10 minutes after that an order of wings.  Literally, another 10 minutes and grits came out. So apparently, only one person can get an appetizer at a time at this establishment. I ask for the check at this point because there's no WAY we're waiting an additional hour for that to be handled after we eat. At this point, the table to our left who had about 8 women are apparently complaining to one of the hosts about the service  as they seem to be having the same trouble as we are. As good management/customer service SHOULD be--I hear him tell them they get a round on the house. Okay--so there may be hope for this hell that I'm currently residing in... but NOPE- no one comes to our table to apologize. NOT even our waitress who last came by 1 hour ago!! At around 4:15---all but 1 of my party had their entrée. At this time we're just pissed, so we start figuring out the bill. 3 of us put cash down, 2 put down debit cards. I respect the service field and consider myself a generous tipper. None of us planned on giving ANY tips today for the mess that was happening at this place. Waitress finally comes back w the checks from the debit cards. Apparantly she added an AUTOMATIC tip of 18% to the debit cards! #bishwhere  MIND you its about 4:45, the 4 of us are finished eating and my other friend STILL NEVER GOT HER ENTREE.  So we're even more pissed. We call the owner over to discuss because not only was the service crap, the customer service crap--but an automatic tip was added to the debit cards although no where on the original receipt or menu says anything regarding tips being added automatically to parties. We explain that we don't understand why there's an automatic tip to the debit cards. So the owner already looks like he's had a bad day mind you. He starts getting 75% loud talking about what do you me to do. You want me to take off the tip? I""l take off the tip. Tip is automatically added to parties of 6 or more. (MIND YOU ITS 5 OF US).  But that's not the only point--you can't ""automatically"" add a tip bc its a debit card. After this trash of service, you and your staff should get a 2% TIP.  What kind of owner talks to his customers like this? I don't care HOW your establishment may be busy--even though it wasn't even that busy at this point as before. You NEVER treat your customers that way. He finally comes back with the checks that he ""voided"" the tips.  Just to make a point we say, ""look, our friend still doesn't have her meal while the rest of us are already finished with ours"".

"Sweet science is pretty sweet..but not sweet enough. We went on a weeknight and it was pretty empty, but it was late, so the music was still pretty loud. The venue is pretty massive and it is definitely a popular place on the weekends, but tonight it had the feeling of a club after everyone has left for the night. Our waitress was nothing special and although she wasn't rude in any way, she was pretty indifferent towards us. For drinks, we got a beer and a whiskey cocktail. We forgot the names of the drinks, but the beer was good and the whiskey cocktail was strong and delicious. For food, I got the fried chicken and the biscuits, which were a step up from Kentucky Fried Chicken, but nothing more than that. The biscuit was very warm and delicious, but there was only one of them, so overall the meal wasn't anything special. For her, she ordered the fried catfish sandwich, which was very tasty. The fish was well cooked, not too greasy, still buttery, and the broccoli rabe complimented the flavor. My only complaint is the bun, completely drenched in butter, made the sandwich slippery to the touch requiring loads and loads of napkins.

"I am severely disappointed in our visit tonight. I've been here three times, and with each visit, the food and service has decreased. Our waitress took our order and then never came back. Not even to check if we were okay. But she did come back the second we filled out the receipt. Which was extremely uncomfortable. We had to ask another server (Gabe, who was great!), to take our plates, wrap our food, and get us the receipt. The female server never even gave us her name. As for the food, the steak sandwich was okay, but nothing special. The veggie quesadilla is delicious. And the frozen drinks were really good- especially the peach bourbon. We also got an order of truffle fries that had little to no truffle oil it. If the waitress would have come back at all we could have let her know.

"This place is amazing for a few reasons. I came here with a big group for my birthday.

After we were seated and more than half way through our meal, a few other stragglers came along and they accommodated them easily. Our waitress Caprice was awesome. She was really attentive and made a good time even better. Now, to the food...My friends and I shared the wings. Pretty standard as far as wings go. No complaints.I ordered the catfish sandwich. I didn't care for the broccoli rabe but other than that, it was pretty good.The star of the night was the punch drunk steak sandwich. Absolutely delicious!

"Sweet science is pretty sweet..but not sweet enough. We went on a weeknight and it was pretty empty, but it was late, so the music was still pretty loud. The venue is pretty massive and it is definitely a popular place on the weekends, but tonight it had the feeling of a club after everyone has left for the night. Our waitress was nothing special and although she wasn't rude in any way, she was pretty indifferent towards us. For drinks, we got a beer and a whiskey cocktail. We forgot the names of the drinks, but the beer was good and the whiskey cocktail was strong and delicious.

Met a friend here for supper and I immediately loved the dim lighting and ambience of the place. Plenty of seating too, always a plus.The menu was typical American. I ordered the veggie burger and a cocktail. The veggie burger was gigantic and delicious! It came with a generous portion of french fries. My tequila-based cocktail, however, was a fail, as it may as well have been a margarita. I switched to beer after that. Substantial portions and reasonable pricing. Service was...ehhh, it was alright. That was probably their weakest point and the reason why I'm giving them four stars instead of five. I would, however, definitely go back.",4.0
"The cocktail was just syrup and strawberries. No alcohol. It took way too long to get any service for a slow Sunday night, another guy came in while I was waiting and he left after a few minutes of waiting and no acknowledgment from anyone. There's a bartender (white guy, dark hair, hipster glasses, facial hair) that made my experience uncomfortable. It started out normal, I asked for his recommendation after he told me they were out of the ingredients for the first cocktail I chose, his response was beer and tequila (that's not even a recommendation, that's just laziness), I declined and ordered a different cocktail and some food off the late night menu, he then just stares at the food menu for a bit. After ordering I asked for the wifi password. Then it all gets weird. He brings the drink and then just stand there and stares at me. Yes? He never asked If I wanted to start a tab or anything, he just stood there and stared at me for several seconds as if I were some sort of mind reader. Are you gonna ask me if I want to start a tab? Do you have a question? I tried to tell him I'm gonna pay the bill at the end after I get my food so he'd stop staring and just go away in which he responded with a frown and starts shaking his head like I was crazy. He then snaps and says ""just give me $12"". Seriously? Who the hell do you think you are? I had to explain to him again that I was gonna pay for everything after I get my check since I also ordered food. He then says he's gonna have to ask someone about this. What do you mean ask someone? Do you not know how to do your job? Also Stop staring if you don't have anything useful say. And how far up your ass did you go to pull out $12 for a glass of sugar water? You think you honestly deserve a $2 tip for that crap? Can't tell if what I'm feeling is the non-existent alcohol or the on come of pure rage. I ordered a beer which he gave to me on the house because of that sorry excuse for a mixed alcoholic drink, that's an extra star. At the end I asked for a check and then he automatically asked for my card without even giving me a printed copy of my bill. I then repeated to him to Give me my check. Why would I blindly let you charge my card? After handing me the check, he proceeded to stand in front of me and stare again as if I was planning to dine and dash. I had to wait 20 minutes before you could even take my order on a slow Sunday night but you have all the time in the world to watch me when it comes to anything related to payment? I payed in cash. The tip I left was way too generous for a person like him. And yes, it was a decent amount.I might go as far to say this guy is racist by assuming I didn't have money on me and treating me, the lone female, minority patron like dirt just because he though he wasn't gonna get his money's worth with me. Don't get me wrong, the place had non-white patrons but all were either in a group or were men. This guy doesn't have the balls to treat a guy the way he did with me since he would get a fist slammed into those hipster glassed face.",2.0

As this was my first time in Brooklyn I was expecting a harsh welcoming being from Los Angeles. Brian was like family from the second we walked in. Not to mention there were no tv's on in the bar so it was super vibey. Rock on Sweet Science. You nailed it.,5.0
"Interesting menu, art and owner . I frequent this place when I'm in a chill mood , If you are in the area you should check it out . I love the truffle Mac and cheese and you can dip into the speakeasy next door when your done dinning",4.0
"We came with a big group on a Friday evening for Happy Hour.  This was pointless, the happy hour ""specials"" were nothing spectacular, $1 off drafts, and that was it.  The prices were high for this area and the food subpar.  We ordered everything from wings, to catfish, to fried chicken.  Most of the food was lukewarm at best.  Friend chicken was dry and Catfish was especially salty, good thing we had the beer to wash it down with.  I wouldn't recommend this place for Friday specials, or any specials.  It was a very nice establishment and the staff was great.  Dave was awesome and he made the restaurant a lot better.  Too bad the prices weren't appealing and the food didn't make you want to come back.",2.0
"Always a great crowd! Excellent food, my fav bacon halepeno Mac and cheese, I had dreams about it. Ask about the secret bar.",5.0
"I discovered this place while visiting friends in Brooklyn about 3 weeks ago I have been there a total of 3 times since, The ambiance offers great tunes, affordable bottles of wine ( nice $30 bubbly). All three times I ate the same thing "" The Catfish Sandwich"" !!! It is theeeee Best . One would not think that Broccoli Rabe would be a good topper for a Catfish sandwich but it is a HIT . The happy hour is pretty cool $5 for a pretty generous Vodka and Cran, I went earlier this week  2 of us had 2 drinks each and a Fish Sandwich each for $45 . I live in NJ about 1 hour and 20 minutes away but now this place has me making up reasons to visit friends in Brooklyn more often.",5.0
"I loved this place as soon as I heard the name, although I guess I was expecting something a bit different (perhaps some mystery restaurant with a weird science lab layout??). Met a friend here for supper and I immediately loved the dim lighting and ambience of the place. Plenty of seating too, always a plus.The menu was typical American. I ordered the veggie burger and a cocktail. The veggie burger was gigantic and delicious! It came with a generous portion of french fries. My tequila-based cocktail, however, was a fail, as it may as well have been a margarita. I switched to beer after that. Substantial portions and reasonable pricing. Service was...ehhh, it was alright. That was probably their weakest point and the reason why I'm giving them four stars instead of five. I would, however, definitely go back.",4.0
"The cocktail was just syrup and strawberries. No alcohol. It took way too long to get any service for a slow Sunday night, another guy came in while I was waiting and he left after a few minutes of waiting and no acknowledgment from anyone. There's a bartender (white guy, dark hair, hipster glasses, facial hair) that made my experience uncomfortable. It started out normal, I asked for his recommendation after he told me they were out of the ingredients for the first cocktail I chose, his response was beer and tequila (that's not even a recommendation, that's just laziness), I declined and ordered a different cocktail and some food off the late night menu, he then just stares at the food menu for a bit. After ordering I asked for the wifi password. Then it all gets weird. He brings the drink and then just stand there and stares at me. Yes? He never asked If I wanted to start a tab or anything, he just stood there and stared at me for several seconds as if I were some sort of mind reader. Are you gonna ask me if I want to start a tab? Do you have a question? I tried to tell him I'm gonna pay the bill at the end after I get my food so he'd stop staring and just go away in which he responded with a frown and starts shaking his head like I was crazy. He then snaps and says ""just give me $12"". Seriously? Who the hell do you think you are? I had to explain to him again that I was gonna pay for everything after I get my check since I also ordered food. He then says he's gonna have to ask someone about this. What do you mean ask someone? Do you not know how to do your job? Also Stop staring if you don't have anything useful say. And how far up your ass did you go to pull out $12 for a glass of sugar water? You think you honestly deserve a $2 tip for that crap? Can't tell if what I'm feeling is the non-existent alcohol or the on come of pure rage. I ordered a beer which he gave to me on the house because of that sorry excuse for a mixed alcoholic drink, that's an extra star. At the end I asked for a check and then he automatically asked for my card without even giving me a printed copy of my bill. I then repeated to him to Give me my check. Why would I blindly let you charge my card? After handing me the check, he proceeded to stand in front of me and stare again as if I was planning to dine and dash. I had to wait 20 minutes before you could even take my order on a slow Sunday night but you have all the time in the world to watch me when it comes to anything related to payment? I payed in cash. The tip I left was way too generous for a person like him. And yes, it was a decent amount.I might go as far to say this guy is racist by assuming I didn't have money on me and treating me, the lone female, minority patron like dirt just because he though he wasn't gonna get his money's worth with me. Don't get me wrong, the place had non-white patrons but all were either in a group or were men. This guy doesn't have the balls to treat a guy the way he did with me since he would get a fist slammed into those hipster glassed face.",2.0

"I want to preface this review by saying that I've been to Sweet Science more times than I can count, and I end up there almost once a week on average. So I'm a huge fan. I'm friendly with several of the bartenders there, and on occasion I also pop upstairs to Featherweight, the beautiful/romantic cocktail bar that you absolutely have to go to if you haven't already.So I might be slightly biased, because I'm a regular. But I'm just never ever let down by the food. Maybe the beer menu could rotate more or be a little more exciting, and the happy hour prices leave a lot to be desired considering other options in the neighborhood, but the cocktails are good and decently priced, and the service is so great that really, in terms of your average go-to-regular bar, this place nails it.First of all, this place is huge. It has a wrap around bar with plenty of seating, as well as tables along the windows that sort of complement the bar itself, and two separate (and very large) rooms of tables for diners. I almost always get a seat at the bar if I want one, and I love all of the odds and ends on the shelves. There's always something new that I notice.I've had most things on the menu at this point, and I can heartily recommend all of them. The only one I had that was somewhat disappointing was the gravy biscuit at brunch. Being from Virginia, I have high expectations out of biscuits, and also prefer sausage gravy to bacon gravy. The bacon gravy was well made, though, but the biscuits were a little too dense (not light and fluffy as I would have hoped) and very well-done on the bottom.My number one recommendation is the catfish sandwich. The broccoli rabe is an awesome touch, and it's so big that I'm never able to finish it in one sitting. I'd recommend the fried jalapenos to start, too. And if you can manage it, get a side of their macaroni and cheese. It has bacon and jalapenos in it and makes most other macaroni and cheese seem like a joke.This is one of my favorite places to go and I'm so fortunate to live only a block away from it.",5.0

"It took several visits for me to stopping projecting what I wanted Sweet Science to be and enjoy the spot for what it actually is.It was hard not to have expectations by the time this place opened in the spring - I watched, day by day, as an abandoned laundromat transformed very slowly into a combination restaurant and bar with reclaimed tables, leather couches, and rooms separated by large panes of glass. In the fall of 2012, I snuck into - with three pints of liquid courage - a private event held after the first Presidential debate. The cocktails on offer that night were tasty (and free) and the portrait of Biggie over the bar made me think that this would be a tribute to the nearby Marcy Projects. Licensing and logistics kept the place from opening for another six months - long after Eastwick stole the bragging rights of first cosmopolitan eatery to open on this stretch of Graham Avenue.Early visits (this place is essentially downstairs, so it's easy to pop in) were confusing. The beer list was sub-par, the menu fussy with entrees in the $20+ range. It didn't feel like a neighborhood bar, but the sometimes deafening late 2000s hip-hop meant it wasn't a terribly  nice place for a good meal. And the food didn't justify the price tag.Thankfully management realized the problems as well, parting ways with a chef and rolling out a new menu with twists on bar food. With the addition of the smoker, this is now a real food destination. My pulled pork sandwich last night (with a tangy South Carolina barbecue sauce) was shockingly tasty. The pork is tender but had none of the sogginess that can sink but the bun and meat in this dish. The mixed green salad had a nice vinaigrette to balance out the bitterness, while the sweet potato fries came with a zesty barbecue sauce. The wings are also highly recommended, while the innovative specials change out frequently. Prices have come down to $10-18 for an entrée. The beer selection is improving as well - although they have some distance to go before meeting the standards of neighborhood favorites like Duck Duck and The Tradesman.Now that Sweet Scicence has found itself, maybe the neighborhood will now have a better idea what to do with it. The place continues to be busy or not on a schedule that flouts reason. Mondays at 8 pm can be packed while Thursdays are quiet. Saturday nights tend to pick up only very, very late (like 1 am). I think there's a ""final stop"" mentality at work here, but the food means that more should come earlier.",4.0
"Went here on a Sunday night for some quick drinks(no work the next day). The place was decent with dim lighting which was fine for us because we were there for drinks but I don't think I would have felt comfortable eating there with such dim lighting. My 2stars are because I felt kind of ripped off. We ordered margaritas which I believe usually are 6.50 or 8.50 (as per the bartender) however, we decided to have them with Patron. Now I know that this is a Premium Liquor however, I would never have thought that I would be paying 16 dollars for a margarita in Brooklyn!!! Well, in that part of Brooklyn. You would think that they would have at least let us know about the BIG price change. We made no big deal and just paid the bill. Overall not a bad place but you definitely have to be cautious.Almost forgot to mention that I ordered takeout about a month ago, I had the ribs and my fiancé had the burger. Not sure how the food taste fresh when you eat there but those ribs were not good at all. They had such a odd taste to them. The burger was not tasty at all, cold and soggy along with the fries.",2.0
"Fantastic. This is my new go-to place for grub on Friday night when I am seeking comfort from my busy/stressful work week.

"This restaurant was terrible. We were being served by three different servers, and they were all confused about whether and what we had ordered. I asked for my burger rare, and they brought it to me quite raw. When I asked if they could cook it for a few more minutes, I got t back charred. I was not being a diva or rude about it, so I'm not sure why they felt the need to char my burger as if to teach me a lesson. Very petty. I also had a kale salad and the kale was not cut up, the leaves where huge and hard to manage, at most places kale is cut quite small to make it easier to chew. I will not be going here again.",2.0
I came here awhile ago with a friend of mine on a Friday night. (Pretty late) I was glad to hear that they were still serving food that late. That's the good thing about Williamsburg they have all these fun restaurants that stay open. Anyways... I yelped this place and it sounded really good. I had a steak sandwich and my friend had the chicken and biscuit. The food was amazing. So much flavor it was incredible. We shared the mac and cheese and the fried jalapeños. I can't even begin to describe how delicious they were. Our waitress was truly a sweet heart. There was a little confusion with the order but nothing that couldn't be fixed! Things happen. I love Williamsburg and their trendy restaurants and this has become one my favorites now. I'd love to try brunch soon :),5.0
Love this place! So much better then Eastwick across the street. The food is always solid and well priced. The staff is nice and knows the menu well and its just a great place to hang out and grab a beer or tuck in and have a romantic dinner. Menu is seasonal and fresh. Just all around great place.

"Sweet Science, you've done good! So far so good!I grew up around the corner, went to school across the street from this spot but the ultimate test would be my mom who is a townie for sure!She's got high standards as we've only frequented the most unpretentious of new spots in the hood over and again. So a friendly smile goes a long way and it is sweet at this spot.We did brunch here one Sunday and while it is drafty in cooler months,large wrap around windows, the atmosphere is friendly and warm. Waitstaff are attentive and the music is never too loud.Mom had the BLT which overflowed with bacon, which she loved. It was hot on arrival. The ciabatta roll was huge but the flavors all worked well for such a staple.I had the Biscuits and Gravy which had great gravy flavoring but the biscuit I could have made. The drinks never fail: Biggie-tini was refreshing while the bar menu rarely disappoints.This was my third visit and I highly recommend the steak sandwich, Joe Louis Burger, kale salad, crab cakes are good (a little too much batter) and of course the wings and sides.I appreciate this place for many reasons. One being that its hard to find decent anything this side of Grand St and two that they take themselves seriously and still understand that they are part of a neighborhood that had much flavor already.Thank you for adding food that was needed (shrimp n grits, steak) and well stocked bar with tv screen and friendly staff, all needed and welcomed in WillyB.We will be back, give em a chance, so far this winter they have been hitting all the right notes!",4.0
"Went to this place last night for food and drinks with my girlfriend and we both had an excellent experience. I started off by having what is called the B53 or B43, which is a whiskey cocktail that garnished with an orange peel. It was excellent. Also try the peach whiskey frozen drink. For food we started off with the beer battered Brooklyn pickles. They were perfectly fried and had a hint of spice to them but with the ranch that it is served with it's perfectly balanced. The fried catfish sandwich was excellent and the steak sandwich was perfectly cooked and delicious dipped in the au jous that is served with it. All of the food here was well seasoned and balanced for a good price. The service despite what some other reviewers have said was excellent. Overall I think that we found a new great spot to frequent for great food and beverage.",5.0

"Sat down at the bar only to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated at a cute table on a Saturday night at 9pm (no reservations). For appetizers, we ordered the pineapple wings...D-licious! For drinks got the Meadowlark and another cocktail, both were delicious. Wait was a little longer than expected for our entrees which were the Cajun Catfish and the Louis Burger. I like spicy, but that Catfish set my buds on fire! I loved every moment of it. The burger was simply put: JUICY! We forgave the staff because the server told us they were operating on a skeleton staff. The space is large enough, but small enough so that the noise level wasn't overwhelming, good music too. Overall, pleasant dining experience. I would recommend it.Don't forget to check out the cozy very DL speakeasy bar through the awesome door - URWELCOME.:)",4.0
"Sweet Science could have been much sweeter I really hate to admit.Stopped in for Sunday brunch, my guy was looking forward to the ""biggie brunch"" and I really had mild expectations as it was his choice and I had never heard of Sweet Science before.  It is really a cute place and concept.  The restaurants decor is cute and they have some interesting artwork made of music artist and celebrities made out of record albums most of them look like they are for sale.  Its sort of like a restaurant/art gallery and would be a great place for a party/late night dinner/reception or really anything.We arrived around 12:15 about 15 minutes after opening.  There were already 2 parties seated.  We were promptly seated and this is where everything goes downhill.  We are both pretty laid back, its Sunday and there is no reason to rush but when we weren't even asked for out drink order after 15 minutes we were getting a bit annoyed.  I finally popped over to the bar and told the guy standing back there we could order whenever etc..He mumbles ""there must be confusion over servers"" ok.. ..  We ordered.   The food came out about 15-20 minutes later.  The ""biggie brunch""  and the burger were both pretty good, except for the server who said they forgot about us forgot to brink the ""biglini"" (champagne and grape juice) that was suppose to come out with it.  We had to remind him and he brings out a glass of grape juice.  We didn't make a complaint although that wasn't what was listed on the menu.  At this point we were both annoyed and decided to just pay the check and head out.  To be honest, I wanted to love this place, but just like i noticed in the other reviews the service is truly lacking.  For me, service and consistency with food is imperative for a restaurant to get my vote.   There are too many amazing places in NYC to come back to a place that doesn't take those  things seriously.    I also noticed someone said you can DINE and Dash here.. and uhh yeah my feeling exactly.  We never got the check.  We had to ask for it, but I'm sure if we walked out no one would have noticed.  siggggh.",2.0
"I definitely give this place 5 stars the food is GREAT, the music is great and the service is definitely  on point.

"i am sorry....I really wanted to like this place. I live in the neiborhood so it would be nice if the food was always coming out warm....i got the BLT which was a brioche bun with 743873 slices or bacon, lettuce and tomato.which is a great idea cause I love bacon and I love brioche and I love lettuce and I love tomato.what I didnt love was the fact that it came out cold,UHHHHHH and we were the only people there.yo! fix that.

"Seriously yummy! Went with a few people, we all agreed. My ONLY qualm is that the portions aren't really that big, I still felt a bit hungry when I left. I think if spending $13 on fried chicken, that's enough to not leave hungry, but it's definitely quality over quantity.",4.0
"*****FIRST REVIEW & RESTAURANT OF 2014Coming up Graham from Broadway, the Avenue of the Puerto Ricos is lined with 99cent stores, hispanic bakeries, puerto rican foods, and your typical specialty stores. What the neighborhood lacked was a 'cooler' bar/restaurant with 'new' american food. I was happy to discover sweet science. I can only assume that it opened sometime in 2013 so being a few months late, took the opportunity to try it.Walked in on a Sunday evening around 6:30, there was a sign on the door saying that it was closed for a private party at 7pm. Walked in talked to the guy at the bar asked him if it was okay that we come in and grabbed a bite. The guy was friendly, said of course and then arranged the table to fit our party of 5.Our waitress was quick, cute, and attentive. She swung by bringing us the standard brooklyn tap in green wine bottle. Orders:2x 1/2 chickencatfishfried chicken bucket + side of collardsjoe louis burgerThe chicken bucket is a tiny cute bucket which fits three pieces of chicken with a biscuit sitting on top. The chicken is breaded and well seasoned. Fried well. With the help of the breading, quite crunchy. Not Commodore-level fried chicken but good none-the-less. The biscuit was quite good, flaky and delicious. The accompanying apple butter is amaze. $12Collards. This is fresh sauteed collard greens. Not the long stewing olive green collards that are cooked down and sit on top of a hot plate simmering collards. This is bright green, a little chewy, a little crunchy collards. Good collards. $3The Joe Louis burger is a nice hearty burger. Good-sized. Cheddary. Juicy but not messy. Very good. Fries are real potatoes with seasoning and salt. Portioned a little small but not too much so that you wouldn't have enough to enjoy. $12Question - Where is the ketchup? [Not that the food lacked flavour or anything just...okay, the truth is i'm addicted to catsup :( ]The place blasted some 90s hip hop jams, as it got later the evening the volume got raised, but this is to big expected as there was as mentioned a private event. The ambiance was nice, the tables are candle lit, little jars of plastic plants dotted each table. The bar was beautiful, well-shelved, well lit, and the bottles on display looked nice. It layout is very attractive and had a modern meets vintage bk look. dark, sleek, sexy. The 'secret' red room area in the back was intriguing and invites a return trip. Another great touch was when they lowered the gates, the insides of them had well done graffiti.The guy that helped us and okayed our group from the beginning (maybe the owner?) stopped by after to shake hands and thank us for coming.

So far so good!I grew up around the corner, went to school across the street from this spot but the ultimate test would be my mom who is a townie for sure!She's got high standards as we've only frequented the most unpretentious of new spots in the hood over and again. So a friendly smile goes a long way and it is sweet at this spot.We did brunch here one Sunday and while it is drafty in cooler months,large wrap around windows, the atmosphere is friendly and warm. Waitstaff are attentive and the music is never too loud.Mom had the BLT which overflowed with bacon, which she loved. It was hot on arrival. The ciabatta roll was huge but the flavors all worked well for such a staple.I had the Biscuits and Gravy which had great gravy flavoring but the biscuit I could have made. The drinks never fail: Biggie-tini was refreshing while the bar menu rarely disappoints.This was my third visit and I highly recommend the steak sandwich, Joe Louis Burger, kale salad, crab cakes are good (a little too much batter) and of course the wings and sides.I appreciate this place for many reasons. One being that its hard to find decent anything this side of Grand St and two that they take themselves seriously and still understand that they are part of a neighborhood that had much flavor already.Thank you for adding food that was needed (shrimp n grits, steak) and well stocked bar with tv screen and friendly staff, all needed and welcomed in WillyB.We will be back, give em a chance, so far this winter they have been hitting all the right notes!",4.0
"Went to this place last night for food and drinks with my girlfriend and we both had an excellent experience. I started off by having what is called the B53 or B43, which is a whiskey cocktail that garnished with an orange peel. It was excellent. Also try the peach whiskey frozen drink. For food we started off with the beer battered Brooklyn pickles. They were perfectly fried and had a hint of spice to them but with the ranch that it is served with it's perfectly balanced. The fried catfish sandwich was excellent and the steak sandwich was perfectly cooked and delicious dipped in the au jous that is served with it. All of the food here was well seasoned and balanced for a good price. The service despite what some other reviewers have said was excellent. Overall I think that we found a new great spot to frequent for great food and beverage.",5.0
"My wife and I had our baby shower there last week. Nikki was super helpful with planning.They have great options on their menu for parties at a good price and the space is awesome. The food and drink was well received and all of our guests had a great time. Would def recommend to anyone looking for a good BK spot to have an event. They also have a great brunch, dinner and bar so it's a good place to hang out with friends.",5.0
"Most items on the menu are great. However, the kale Caesar salad looked like it was gonna be the jump off, but was actually too salty.",3.0
"Sat down at the bar only to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated at a cute table on a Saturday night at 9pm (no reservations). For appetizers, we ordered the pineapple wings...D-licious! For drinks got the Meadowlark and another cocktail, both were delicious. Wait was a little longer than expected for our entrees which were the Cajun Catfish and the Louis Burger. I like spicy, but that Catfish set my buds on fire! I loved every moment of it. The burger was simply put: JUICY! We forgave the staff because the server told us they were operating on a skeleton staff. The space is large enough, but small enough so that the noise level wasn't overwhelming, good music too. Overall, pleasant dining experience. I would recommend it.Don't forget to check out the cozy very DL speakeasy bar through the awesome door - URWELCOME.:)",4.0
"Sweet Science could have been much sweeter I really hate to admit.Stopped in for Sunday brunch, my guy was looking forward to the ""biggie brunch"" and I really had mild expectations as it was his choice and I had never heard of Sweet Science before.  It is really a cute place and concept.  The restaurants decor is cute and they have some interesting artwork made of music artist and celebrities made out of record albums most of them look like they are for sale.  Its sort of like a restaurant/art gallery and would be a great place for a party/late night dinner/reception or really anything.We arrived around 12:15 about 15 minutes after opening.  There were already 2 parties seated.  We were promptly seated and this is where everything goes downhill.  We are both pretty laid back, its Sunday and there is no reason to rush but when we weren't even asked for out drink order after 15 minutes we were getting a bit annoyed.  I finally popped over to the bar and told the guy standing back there we could order whenever etc..He mumbles ""there must be confusion over servers"" ok.. ..  We ordered.   The food came out about 15-20 minutes later.  The ""biggie brunch""  and the burger were both pretty good, except for the server who said they forgot about us forgot to brink the ""biglini"" (champagne and grape juice) that was suppose to come out with it.  We had to remind him and he brings out a glass of grape juice.  We didn't make a complaint although that wasn't what was listed on the menu.  At this point we were both annoyed and decided to just pay the check and head out.  To be honest, I wanted to love this place, but just like i noticed in the other reviews the service is truly lacking.  For me, service and consistency with food is imperative for a restaurant to get my vote.   There are too many amazing places in NYC to come back to a place that doesn't take those  things seriously.    I also noticed someone said you can DINE and Dash here.. and uhh yeah my feeling exactly.  We never got the check.  We had to ask for it, but I'm sure if we walked out no one would have noticed.  siggggh.",2.0
"I definitely give this place 5 stars the food is GREAT, the music is great and the service is definitely  on point. The manager/owner (not sure which he is but he's super cool and welcoming) I had the tangy South Carolina wings and the South Carolina pulled pork. Im definitely impressed.  The drinks are great too i had whats called ""one more sip"" delicious! The ambiance is really cool you'll definitely have a good time A+",5.0
"i am sorry....I really wanted to like this place. I live in the neiborhood so it would be nice if the food was always coming out warm....i got the BLT which was a brioche bun with 743873 slices or bacon, lettuce and tomato.which is a great idea cause I love bacon and I love brioche and I love lettuce and I love tomato.what I didnt love was the fact that it came out cold,UHHHHHH and we were the only people there.yo! fix that. I wanna come back and have a wonderful BLT.",2.0
"Seriously yummy! Went with a few people, we all agreed. My ONLY qualm is that the portions aren't really that big, I still felt a bit hungry when I left. I think if spending $13 on fried chicken, that's enough to not leave hungry, but it's definitely quality over quantity.",4.0
"*****FIRST REVIEW & RESTAURANT OF 2014Coming up Graham from Broadway, the Avenue of the Puerto Ricos is lined with 99cent stores, hispanic bakeries, puerto rican foods, and your typical specialty stores. What the neighborhood lacked was a 'cooler' bar/restaurant with 'new' american food. I was happy to discover sweet science. I can only assume that it opened sometime in 2013 so being a few months late, took the opportunity to try it.Walked in on a Sunday evening around 6:30, there was a sign on the door saying that it was closed for a private party at 7pm. Walked in talked to the guy at the bar asked him if it was okay that we come in and grabbed a bite. The guy was friendly, said of course and then arranged the table to fit our party of 5.Our waitress was quick, cute, and attentive. She swung by bringing us the standard brooklyn tap in green wine bottle. Orders:2x 1/2 chickencatfishfried chicken bucket + side of collardsjoe louis burgerThe chicken bucket is a tiny cute bucket which fits three pieces of chicken with a biscuit sitting on top. The chicken is breaded and well seasoned. Fried well. With the help of the breading, quite crunchy. Not Commodore-level fried chicken but good none-the-less. The biscuit was quite good, flaky and delicious. The accompanying apple butter is amaze. $12Collards. This is fresh sauteed collard greens. Not the long stewing olive green collards that are cooked down and sit on top of a hot plate simmering collards. This is bright green, a little chewy, a little crunchy collards. Good collards. $3The Joe Louis burger is a nice hearty burger. Good-sized. Cheddary. Juicy but not messy. Very good. Fries are real potatoes with seasoning and salt. Portioned a little small but not too much so that you wouldn't have enough to enjoy. $12Question - Where is the ketchup? [Not that the food lacked flavour or anything just...okay, the truth is i'm addicted to catsup :( ]The place blasted some 90s hip hop jams, as it got later the evening the volume got raised, but this is to big expected as there was as mentioned a private event. The ambiance was nice, the tables are candle lit, little jars of plastic plants dotted each table. The bar was beautiful, well-shelved, well lit, and the bottles on display looked nice. It layout is very attractive and had a modern meets vintage bk look. dark, sleek, sexy. The 'secret' red room area in the back was intriguing and invites a return trip. Another great touch was when they lowered the gates, the insides of them had well done graffiti.The guy that helped us and okayed our group from the beginning (maybe the owner?) stopped by after to shake hands and thank us for coming. Appreciated that.New neighborhood gem, looking forward to coming back ~",4.0

It's a nice little spot in Brooklyn to go drinking after you've already had a blast at another bar. The place was really nice visually. It was packed and they did a bad job of mixing drinks and food as a pair. The bartenders were so bland and rude. I understand you don't want to be there but don't take that out on me. What really stood out to me was how filthy the bathroom was. Tissue everywhere as if someone teepeed the toilets. I would have rathered held it in. The DJ wasn't that good either.

The atmosphere and ambience is perfection, it feels very comfortable, casual, and cool. I came here because of another review about the burgers and sadly to say... There's only one burger on the menu and way far from being ""gourmet."" It was cooked to perfection at medium rare though! I also had the crab cakes which were ok, I like my cakes with lump crab and a bit more flavor/seasoning, so I give it a 5/10. My partner enjoyed his food which consisted of ribs and a side order of Mac and Cheese. The service is superb, the waitress brought samples of beer since my partner didn't know what he would like.

"Went here and had drinks only after dinner at Qi Thai Grill. As far as drinks, not impressed. My boyfriend and I ordered Patron magaritas. The mix was COMPLETELY off. Thankfully, my boyfriend can force almost anything down his stomach so he finished both our $12 drinks. I was so upset I refused to try it again, even with another bartender. I then decided on Jack & Coke, which is so basic I figured it was a safe bet. I was right so for $14 we had drinks we could actually enjoy. Otherwise, love the decor. Very nice bar with a great display of the spirits that the bartenders don't seem to know how to use. When we got in, a guy was sitting on the bar flirting with 2 girls who were eating. Turns out, that guy is a bartender. Incidents like that turn me off to a place, but to each his own. Probably will come here again but ONLY if I want something basic and we are already in the area. The locals seem friendly if you enjoy meeting new people, but you can also pick a corner and get some privacy. Just don't come here for complicated drinks.",2.0

"Having grown up in this neighborhood, sitting inside what used to be a furniture store and what is now sweet science was surreal. The interior is clever. The bar is probably the most eye catching thing in there next to the unusual but still nice set up of the dining area. I love the name. I also love the names on the receipts. The name of our ""waiter"" was ""Hal Jordan"". Another was ""Tony Stark"". These are clearly not their real names but its a hat tip to all the comic nerds out there. clever! It was pretty low key on a Sunday evening around 7pm. The menu isn't grand by any means but they certainly have something for everyone. I am following a Paleo type diet so my choices were limited but definitely comfortable after a few modifications. I had the Joe Louis Burger (sans bun) with hand cut sweet potato fries and a side salad. The Joe Louis is a beef burger topped with bacon, pineapple, caramelized onions and cheese. A delicous combination. Though my burger was a little more done than i would have liked, there was enough going on with the toppings to distract me from the semi dry patty. The sweet potato fries were out of sight! Nearly cleaned the plate. BF had the pineapple bbq wings. They packed a spicy punch. He ordered 12 wings. They were meaty. And he barely got through them. very tasty though. We both had a drink from the bar. I had a patron on the rocks with lime, he a cocktail on the menu with strawberry and chamomile- both were tasty. Will def be coming back.",4.0

"I hate writing bad reviews, but maybe a bad review will inspire Sweet Science to have a ""we need to get our shit together"" Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares moment.  The decor is great.  It's clean.  The staff is hip and attentive, but the food is so sub par.  I ordered the burger which appears to be THE item to get on the menu.  Prior to my review, Sweet Science had a perfect 5 star review on Yelp.  My friends and I passed up every other pub, burger joint, and  dive bar for what was supposed to be the best burger in Brooklyn.  I love burgers, but rarely eat them anymore, so the idea of an amazing burger sounded pretty spot on. That's what makes this so disappointing.  I grew up in Ohio.  Applebee's, Max & Erma's, McDonald's and Burger King were all a stone's throw from my suburban, any town USA, childhood home.  What I would give for any one of their burgers compared to what I got today at Sweet Science.   I got the basic burger prepared medium rare.  The waiter did inform me that the burger was only 4 oz, but he didn't tell me that it would come out well done.  It came with lettuce, tomato, and pickles with a ""side"" of fries.  What I received was a dinky, overcooked, pre-made beef patty with seven french fries.  If the meal would have been five or six bucks, I would have been satisfied at best, but the real salt in the wound was the price.  $12 for a basic burger, $16 for a double, and $18 for the works (egg, cheese, bacon, onion),  I'm fine paying $18, but it better be worth $18.  I left feeling a bit cheated.  I left wondering if I should stick a finger in my mouth, dust off my wounds, and hop on the L to Shakeshack.  To the restaurant's credit, I didn't try any of their cocktails, and it seems like many Yelpers love Sweet Science as a bar.  I love the location.  I honestly hope that maybe the owner will read this and say, ""maybe this guy's right.""  I don't mean to scare customers away, but I don't see Sweet Science staying in sweet business if they don't rethink their menu.  I remember learning the scientific method way back in the 7th grade:  Ask a question, do some research, come up with a hypothesis, test it, then draw a conclusion.  Well, the conclusion has been drawn and it's time to rethink the hypothesis.  Whether it be a new chef or new menu, something's got to change with the food.  New York does not cater to mediocrity.  It's time to get back in the lab and earn the ""sweet"" in the name.  If not, I feel this scientific theory will get destroyed the same way the theory that the Earth is flat was.",1.0

"My fiance and I were excited to go to this restaurant for his birthday, but beyond disappointed and disgusted. It started the moment we entered the door. We were not sure if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated so I caught the eye of a bartender and asked him for a table for two. Clearly I had annoyed him as he sighed and said ""Hold on. I have to clean a table for you.""He then proceeded to reluctantly lead us to a table in the back of the restaurant, which coincidentally all the black costumers were located. I will say our waitress for the evening was really nice and although she was handling the tables on her own she apologized for making us wait. After we finished our meal a different woman cleared our plates and then asked ""would you like another drink?"". After we said no and she immediately brought us our check and said ""We are changing over to dinner and you need to close out because I'm trying to get out of here"". So first issue is that we have no idea who she is because she was not serving us at all that night. Second issue is that it was 7:30pm at that point and dinner started at 5pm. We were given the implication of being thrown out. We were highly annoyed, paid the check and left without anyone even saying thank you and have a good evening. We did enjoy the food and drinks but we felt the service was terrible and that we were discriminated against due to being black patrons. I would not recommend this place to anyone and we will definitely not be returning. Very disappointing.",1.0
"This bar is great! So glad to have it in the neighborhood! The staff is very hip,  friendly, and attractive. James, the owner, is very welcoming and a great guy all around! The decor has a cool and dark, modern rustic feel with compliments of natural/stained wood and subway tiles. Walking through the door you are greeted with a Biggie portrait, paying true homage to Brooklyn. Being on a corner windows line the front and side letting in plenty of natural light. There is one flat screen TV mainly for sports games, but the staff and patrons promote a better social atmosphere, especially with a 3 sided bar counter.The food is very good and as of yesterday, has been updated with even tastier selections, after the installation of a new BBQ smoker! A more flavorful wings selection has been added, a personal favorite; spicy pineapple BBQ. not to mention, the pickled beet and kale salad with cranberry goat cheese is delicious! On a side note, the 1 star reviews are premature. You need to give a bar time to workout the menu and experiment with new creations. Having spent many nights here since it's  opening, it's safe to say Sweet Science is serving up knockout meals now! Weather you're a neighbor living in the area or venturing into Brooklyn for an entertaining evening, drop by Sweet Science, and you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"Only have great things to say about this place. Food and drinks are both top notch, as well as the staff. Beer and wells are reasonably priced as well. Exactly what I could've hoped for in a local bar back when it opened, and it's lived up to that ever since. Bartenders are friendly and make sure you're having a good time.At times I wish the music was a little more up-beat, but not so much that I'd remove a star. I've had the veggie quesedilla multiple times and it always comes out delicious. Highly recommend checking out this spot.",5.0

"I'm so psyched to see a place like Sweet Science in the neighborhood that I joined Yelp just to say so.  What is with this sudden rash of one-star reviews because some kids who've ""been in NYC for almost a whole year!!"" were dissatisfied with a burger?If you're hungry for something Mama used to cook but want it done kinda dirty, if you like bartenders with Bart Simpson tattoos, if you have a story about a dresser you bought in the place while it was still a furniture store, this place is for you.  As a new Yelper inclined to make an obvious pun, I'll say Sweet Science hits the *sweet spot* of what the neighborhood's been missing: a chic but welcoming place to eat AND chill.  It's really as simple as that.",5.0
"My fiance and I were excited to go to this restaurant for his birthday, but beyond disappointed and disgusted. It started the moment we entered the door. We were not sure if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated so I caught the eye of a bartender and asked him for a table for two. Clearly I had annoyed him as he sighed and said ""Hold on. I have to clean a table for you.""He then proceeded to reluctantly lead us to a table in the back of the restaurant, which coincidentally all the black costumers were located. I will say our waitress for the evening was really nice and although she was handling the tables on her own she apologized for making us wait. After we finished our meal a different woman cleared our plates and then asked ""would you like another drink?"". After we said no and she immediately brought us our check and said ""We are changing over to dinner and you need to close out because I'm trying to get out of here"". So first issue is that we have no idea who she is because she was not serving us at all that night. Second issue is that it was 7:30pm at that point and dinner started at 5pm. We were given the implication of being thrown out. We were highly annoyed, paid the check and left without anyone even saying thank you and have a good evening. We did enjoy the food and drinks but we felt the service was terrible and that we were discriminated against due to being black patrons. I would not recommend this place to anyone and we will definitely not be returning. Very disappointing.",1.0
"This bar is great! So glad to have it in the neighborhood! The staff is very hip,  friendly, and attractive. James, the owner, is very welcoming and a great guy all around! The decor has a cool and dark, modern rustic feel with compliments of natural/stained wood and subway tiles. Walking through the door you are greeted with a Biggie portrait, paying true homage to Brooklyn. Being on a corner windows line the front and side letting in plenty of natural light. There is one flat screen TV mainly for sports games, but the staff and patrons promote a better social atmosphere, especially with a 3 sided bar counter.The food is very good and as of yesterday, has been updated with even tastier selections, after the installation of a new BBQ smoker! A more flavorful wings selection has been added, a personal favorite; spicy pineapple BBQ. not to mention, the pickled beet and kale salad with cranberry goat cheese is delicious! On a side note, the 1 star reviews are premature. You need to give a bar time to workout the menu and experiment with new creations. Having spent many nights here since it's  opening, it's safe to say Sweet Science is serving up knockout meals now! Weather you're a neighbor living in the area or venturing into Brooklyn for an entertaining evening, drop by Sweet Science, and you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"Only have great things to say about this place. Food and drinks are both top notch, as well as the staff. Beer and wells are reasonably priced as well. Exactly what I could've hoped for in a local bar back when it opened, and it's lived up to that ever since. Bartenders are friendly and make sure you're having a good time.At times I wish the music was a little more up-beat, but not so much that I'd remove a star. I've had the veggie quesedilla multiple times and it always comes out delicious. Highly recommend checking out this spot.",5.0

"I've been to this establishment a few times... Half of the times were great, the other half, not so great because the service was super slow. Anyhow, i told James (manager) how dissatisfied i was with the slow service and he was extremely apologetic (even willing to comp the bill). Although i was highly appreciative of the offer, i too own a business and could never accept such a thing- every bottom line counts. Anyway, on my last visit, i decided to come here again after Easter mass and all i can say is 'finally they got their sh*t together!!' Service was prompt! I was there with my one year old son and the waitress knew to get us in and out. The food was great as always. I was so happy that i had to let James know how impressed i was with his staff. Listen, i have property in the neighborhood- i want businesses like these to succeed so that we can draw a newer crowd and enjoy the success together!",5.0
"My new hubby and I just threw the best party at Sweet Science! We cant even count the number of times people asked ""How did you find this place?"" or said ""The food was so good"" or ""The staff is awesome.""  James the owner and Nikki the coordinator made it so easy to make this the best party!  I have also received multiple voicemails and texts saying how awesome it was.  I cant say enough about this place, a must-go, whether just 2 of you for a great dinner or to throw a party!  Yeah Sweet Science, so sweet. :)",5.0

"This place is phenomenal. For anyone who's never been to the neighborhood you're going to be in for quite a shock. The first thing you'll notice is how well designed it is. It's very cool, they even worked in the original facade's glass into the interior which creates a 3 bars in 1 kind of feel. There's the bar, a dining area, and even a little 'VIP' private area that's not really VIP or private, but it feels like it. Beyond that they are constantly rotating new art and adding that gallery event fun. But of course, that's not why you come. The drinks are great and they have a nice amount of drafts. The food is bar food, but it's damned good bar food. It used to be that the nearby restaurants would own the dining scene but Sweet Science has held its own and is luring people with more than just booze. Beyond that, they synergy with neighboring Feather Weight makes for a great experience. You wanna be rowdy and have that good party bar feel, stay in Sweet Science, but if you decide you want to hear a conversation or step up the romance then all you need to do is pass through the painted door. The two spots act as one providing a solid experience no matter what you're looking for. All that being said, Sweet Science is still a great place to meet people and chat, hell, James'll make sure of that.",5.0

Um.... really? An hour and a half to get our order?I had the fried chicken and my husband had the burger.  Both were ok. Not bad, but not awesome.At this point we were tired of sitting in the folding chairs and the loud music had gotten louder, so we hunted our waitress down and gave her the card before she brought the check.  Dinners at Sweet Science are $10-17, beers are $4-5 and specialty cocktails are $10, but his Crown & Cokes were charged at $15 each!!! $15?!?

Started off with a Smoked Chicken Quesadilla  which was awesome i will be adding a photos after i write this.Then i had the Ribs  and i must say  some of the best i ever had   and this is coming from a guy that has a hashtag on instagram that's #ilovemotherfuckingribs      i eat alot Ribs  and when i make my own its just like that   Smoked falling off the bone with a good spice and charred really it's a must try  i am even thinking about going back tonight to eat the pulled pork.Then i had a few drinks  i like that the Rocks glasses are big and nice glassware. Jameson on the rocks was like $7  a  pretty good price  and i also had that drink called Johnson street   that was really good def a great drink for summer it was Cucumber and vodka and some other stuff  sorry i can't remember lol   which is a good thing :-) Come check this place out really nice decor cool hip hop kinda vibe. i love that the 1st thing you see walking in is a Framed picture of Biggie Smoking a blunt  lol Met the owner James  he was really cool and explain the background of the bar and was very excited to tell me about things on the menu and drinks. i will end this review with this... too all you hipster that complain about price (even tho your a trust fund baby) Go get a case of PBR and order a pizza,5.0

Their Joe Louis Burger is amazing and could be shared if your not as greedy as me. Also I believe the food was priced fair for what we had was here with two friends we order Joe Louis Burger, Grandma Chicken, and they had a special order of ribs that was great i've paid more for less in the city at burger spots like BRGR,shake shack or New York Burger Company just to name a few. 2.

"Well, I started a job on a Monday for a position I was offered the Wednesday before, sooo long story short, I was subletting a place from a drummer who was on tour for a couple of weeks AND THIS BAR WAS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. Feeling pretty beat after my first day on the job, I rolled out of the apt. and fell across Graham Ave into the doors by the neon, cursive, ""sweet science"" sign, and I'm glad I did.

"You might ask why I gave Sweet Science only 3 stars when I left happy, it was because of the wait staff that didn't seem like they worked there for no more then four minutes. I first pulled up to Sweet Science and instantly fell in love, just from the great facade of the place. If the outside isn't well preserved and taken care of I automatically don't like the place, sorry, that's just me! I was with two friends and we walked in and the server told us to sit in the back area and as we chose a table and were about to sit another server came running over stating the back room was reserved. Ugh. We went back to sit in the original booth we wanted right next to the bar. Case in point why I thought the servers were all brand new. It doesn't get better when our actually server approached. She seemed annoyed that we came in at 11pm when the hours posted said the kitchen doesn't close until 12am, we are definitely not campers (tables that linger way behind the point.)Now for the dinning experience. Drinks: Myself and one friend ordered beers on draught; Laguintas Little Sumpin and Nitro Milk Stout, and my other friend order a house cocktail; Mezcal and hot sauce were some of the ingredients. The waitress I guess wasn't capable of carrying a try or misplaced all of them or the place doesn't have any because she carried each one to our table individually, which is fine if they were brought over like 7 minutes apart! Just saying...Food: Overall the food was delish, I had the Honey BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich! Compliments to the chef! My friends respectively ordered the Joe Louis Sandwich and the Quesadilla, they had no complaints as well; the only thing was the waitress seemed irritated that we asked for utensils and salt & pepper! Well, don't know if she knows but if food is served with a garden salad, people like to use a fork to eat it! Dessert: they only had a brownie with walnuts so we passed.  For Ambience: I would give 5 stars, it was nicely set up in there! Plus whom ever the DJ was, he gets 5 stars as well, the music he was playing mostly late 80's and 90's reggae, which was amazing! So don't go in late at night expecting amazing service! Go in for a beer and great tunes...maybe sit at the bar, order a pint, and get lost in song! Cheers!",3.0

"This place is not the place to host a meal for a large party. This place advertises they have a party room but its simply understaffed and kitchen is not equipped for such large parties. I was invited to a christening celebration and food was served like 2 hours everyone arrived... By the time I got the good my appetite was good and food was all bland and tasteless. My plates were piling and had to request to get taken away. The manager at the time kept saying the delay was because of the hanger steak was being ordered well done v.s medium rate SERIOUSLY???!! It's hanger steak that doesn't take too long. The place had like close to 100 people there and like 3 people working.

I haven't patronized this hot spot yet, but I'm on my way there today. I can't wait. Presentation is everything and I like what I see.

It's a great place to drink, but there's nothing special about drink selection or food. I'm not saying it's bad, but if you're a cocktail or whiskey snob, or a foodie, this is not the place.",4.0
this place is way better than Privileges across the street. The Joe Louis burger is quite good and fried chicken is delectable. Wash it all Down with a bottle of Malbec. This place won't bust your bank!,5.0
"Sweet Science is my favorite new neighborhood bar!! We've lived in the area for 5 years and have seen some amazing additions, Sweet Science embodies everything we love about living here. James, the owner is genuinely interested in your experience and is open to feedback. They have revamped the entire menu, although I loved it before. We ordered several items last night, including the fried pickles, kale salad, wings, and the burger. We were intent on making a dent on the new dishes. I am happy to report we love the changes and were stoked to know we can continue our love affair with this place! Go to Sweet Science if you are looking for a bar with zero pretense, attentive bartenders, solid beer and cocktail selection, great food, and amazing company. Thanks so much for joining the neighborhood, Sweet Science!",5.0
"Well, I started a job on a Monday for a position I was offered the Wednesday before, sooo long story short, I was subletting a place from a drummer who was on tour for a couple of weeks AND THIS BAR WAS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. Feeling pretty beat after my first day on the job, I rolled out of the apt. and fell across Graham Ave into the doors by the neon, cursive, ""sweet science"" sign, and I'm glad I did. Bartenders: so friendly! Clientele: so cool! Peekskill IPA: so refreshing and delicious! I drank some spirits, chatted up some spirits, and my spirits were lifted. Brooklyn? Not so bad :)",5.0
"yeah, i wanna to say to the kid with the one star review about the burger price... it's new york. shits fucking expensive. anyway, i think james is really great and the bar is fantastic. the bartenders are nice and talkative and they have a few good reds. they have a TELEVISION, so you can watch things and not have to socialize which is a #1 for me. it's big, and there are different areas you can go to (backroom, dining, etc), great cocktails, great atmosphere. bushwick!!!!",5.0
Art tastefully intense. Decor sparse and urbanite.  Cocktails chilled and tangy. Colors of the neighborhood fading.  It's Fall in Brooklyn y'all.  Beauty.,5.0
"You might ask why I gave Sweet Science only 3 stars when I left happy, it was because of the wait staff that didn't seem like they worked there for no more then four minutes. I first pulled up to Sweet Science and instantly fell in love, just from the great facade of the place. If the outside isn't well preserved and taken care of I automatically don't like the place, sorry, that's just me! I was with two friends and we walked in and the server told us to sit in the back area and as we chose a table and were about to sit another server came running over stating the back room was reserved. Ugh. We went back to sit in the original booth we wanted right next to the bar. Case in point why I thought the servers were all brand new. It doesn't get better when our actually server approached. She seemed annoyed that we came in at 11pm when the hours posted said the kitchen doesn't close until 12am, we are definitely not campers (tables that linger way behind the point.)Now for the dinning experience. Drinks: Myself and one friend ordered beers on draught; Laguintas Little Sumpin and Nitro Milk Stout, and my other friend order a house cocktail; Mezcal and hot sauce were some of the ingredients. The waitress I guess wasn't capable of carrying a try or misplaced all of them or the place doesn't have any because she carried each one to our table individually, which is fine if they were brought over like 7 minutes apart! Just saying...Food: Overall the food was delish, I had the Honey BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich! Compliments to the chef! My friends respectively ordered the Joe Louis Sandwich and the Quesadilla, they had no complaints as well; the only thing was the waitress seemed irritated that we asked for utensils and salt & pepper! Well, don't know if she knows but if food is served with a garden salad, people like to use a fork to eat it! Dessert: they only had a brownie with walnuts so we passed.  For Ambience: I would give 5 stars, it was nicely set up in there! Plus whom ever the DJ was, he gets 5 stars as well, the music he was playing mostly late 80's and 90's reggae, which was amazing! So don't go in late at night expecting amazing service! Go in for a beer and great tunes...maybe sit at the bar, order a pint, and get lost in song! Cheers!",3.0
gentrification radar is on 1000%. a damn good catfish s'wich but for sure overpriced. the booze is however priced decent! good tunes as well.,3.0
"This place is not the place to host a meal for a large party. This place advertises they have a party room but its simply understaffed and kitchen is not equipped for such large parties. I was invited to a christening celebration and food was served like 2 hours everyone arrived... By the time I got the good my appetite was good and food was all bland and tasteless. My plates were piling and had to request to get taken away. The manager at the time kept saying the delay was because of the hanger steak was being ordered well done v.s medium rate SERIOUSLY???!! It's hanger steak that doesn't take too long. The place had like close to 100 people there and like 3 people working. Totally understaffed, horrible service, not even an apology to the guests at the table nothing place is horrible totally don't recommend going there, food not even decent.",1.0
"I remember the first time I saw Sweet Science. I couldn't believe my eyes,and then just as quickly as it appeared, it disappeared. Well now its' back and I'm very happy to have such a classy place come to my neighborhood. Definitely a sign that things are changing for the better. I haven't patronized this hot spot yet, but I'm on my way there today. I can't wait. Presentation is everything and I like what I see. As far as the neighborhood being""unfriendly"" according to one review, hey this is Bushwick. I have lived here all my life. Seen the best and worst. Hopefully it will get better. You have to understand not everyone is ready for change, but its appeciated. I look forward to enjoying and sharing good times with friends at this new spot. Good luck Sweet Science.

"Sometimes a place comes along where 5 stars are just not enough! This is one of those places. Beautiful candlelit ambiance and sleek romantic decor sets the mood almost before you even walk through the door. The restaurant is decorated with partitions so that no matter where you sit, it feels intimate. This, along with elegant and silky black wood finishes and with soft candlelight throughout really makes this a great date spot. The cocktail list has some very creative heavy hitters which made for a difficult selection but we loved the ones that we ordered- the 'luchador' and the 'sour monkey' (the sour monkey being my favorite). There were 3 of us so we all got to sample each of our dishes. We tried the veggie burger, the Cajun fish and the Joe Louis burger. The veggie burger was veggie goodness with its mayo sauce, the cajun catfish was flavorful and cooked to perfection and the Joe Louis burger had a wonderful mix of ingredients including caramelized onions, bacon and grilled pineapple. The level of service is also worth mentioning as we were shocked as to how attentive our waiter was, catering to all of our needs. In addition, everything was extremely well priced. Entrees that are usually well in the $30s ranged from $14 t0 $17. Overall, sweet science provides a superb dining out experience that makes this place quickly become a favorite!",5.0

"We worked with James (owner) and Chris (chef) to plan our going away party one Sunday late afternoon at Sweet Science back in mid-June 2013.  I'm mad at myself that I forgot to do the review until now.  I recommend this place soooo highly.   It is classy and large inside with a great area for private parties (the room near the kitchen naturally gives it self to be a demarcated event space but still open to the rest of the restaurant so you can enjoy the decor).  Chris put together a sophisticated menu of vegetarian appetizers upon our request for a very fair price (vegetarian cuisine is NOT their specialty and we weren't expecting anything fancy-- we were pleasantly surprised to get okra tempura, a pumpkin bruschetta - fancy, delicious stuff).  James and the bartenders were great about communicating with us as the night went on as we were keeping a running tab. We had a designated bartender, Django who was friendly and attentive to our group. I would definitely recommend working with Sweet Science for a private event.  It was low-stress, low-key and tons of fun -- exactly the kind of going away party we wanted.",5.0
"We all know Sweet Science is one of the best bars in the neighborhood, but ever since the new chef started in July, it is now one of the best restaurants too! New chef and new menu with American BBQ style entrees and starters. An electric smoker in the back produces flavorful smoked chicken for the quesadillas, juicy pork shoulder (smoked for a whopping 12 hours) for the pulled pork sandwich and the sweet and sour ribs that quite literally, fall off the bone. Don't forget to try the chicken wings with your choice of BBQ spicy pineapple (the best), Honey BBQ, Buffalo and lemon/pepper sauces. Oh and the fried pickles from Brooklyn Brine too. Might as well get a side of sweet potato fries with chipotle aioli while you're at it. Paired with a frozen Johnson St (cucumber dill infused vodka with lime juice) or a Hibiscus Margarita (you can thank the owner, James, for these sweet concoctions), you've got yourself a perfect summer dinner.
