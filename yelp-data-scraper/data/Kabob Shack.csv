Reasonably priced. Good portion sizes. Clean. Usually fast delivery. Really delicious fries with a wonderful array of dipping sauces and probably my favorite doner style gyro around. Always solid. Their white sauce is a little bit like a thick ranch dressing and their hot sauce is SUPER HOT.,5.0
So disappointed :( I loved this place. I have been coming here since the first week they opened and I used to come 2-3 times a week. I usually get the chicken gyro with fries but sometimes I'd get lamb or a falafel sandwich. Tonight I went for the first time in about 4 months and I can't believe how much the quality has changed and not for the better. The falafel and fries I ordered were a complete disappointment.The fries were only a handful and mostly extra crispy to burnt end pieces like potato chip crumbs. The falafel was a soggy mess with mushy pieces of flavorless falafel. It's really unfortunate how different the quality is now. I like to support local businesses but I guess I'll be going to Maoz from now on.,1.0
"The price:You can spend between $5-10 and get a decent meal that will fill you up.The food:Love going here for lunch while I'm at work. Hands-down, this is my favorite place to get a falafel! Well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the amount. I typically buy the falafel and fries combo for $6.50. The fries are delicious and I love the variety of sauce to choose from. I also like the ""fish plate"", which is grilled salmon kabob, white rice, pita bread and a roasted slide of tomato - this comes to about $10.My roommate loves the chicken kabob plate and frequently will go out of her way just to come here, lol.The Service:Service is good, but can take some time (10-15 minutes, depending on how busy) so it's often better to call ahead and order. I usually see one person working the counter and there's one cook.The Location:Parking can be a little difficult in the middle of the day, but there's usually a spot within a block or so. Inside there is a decent amount of seating, but my favorite part is the artwork on the walls.Check it out if you're in the area!",4.0
"I'm a BIG mediterranean food lover. Kababs, hummus, falafels are some of my favorite foods, so I, of course, had to try Kabob Shack. I took my parents here because they've never had a kabob before. Like, what? Is that even possible? So, took them to one in the heart of Brooklyn. It's a small shop with limited seating, but I noticed their kabobs were for great prices. A basic falafel kabob is only $4, which I think is a pretty great deal. They also have awesome fries, even falafel fries, with a choice of like 8 different sauces. Overall, the falafel itself was very delicious. It's not the best falafel I've had (you could say I'm a kabob snob after having the best in Europe), but still savory. The falafels were cooked just right, the hummus was creamy, and the veggies were very fresh. It probably could have used less of the white garlic sauce, but other than that, very tasty. I've had a lot of kabobs around NYC, and this is definitely up there as being one of the best. When you go there, make sure to order a falafel WITH hummus and a side of fries. It makes for a great meal.",4.0
"Delicious afghan kabobs with tons of flavor, the Middle East meets Brooklyn with love. First off this place has one of the cleanest kitchen in Williamsburg and a smiling staff willing and able to help you. Now to the food the kabob dishes come with salad, rice and the house special white sauce, they also give you a little hot sauce on the side. It's hot if your into heat. The flavor takes you back to Casablanca, here's looking at you kid. If your into kabobs this is the place to visit. Enjoy!",5.0
"I've been here twice, and I have to say... it is beyond delicious. On my first visit, I ordered the beef kabob plate. The meat was tender and juicy; the rice was just as good; and the bread was still warm. On my second visit, I ordered the falafel pita sandwich with fries (combo). Though it was a bit messy, it was still good enough to eat. The falafels were fresh and the fries were crispy. By far the best place in the area for lunch and dinner. I also love the various choices of sauce you can choose from. I totally encourage everyone to come here and try it out for yourself!",5.0
"Their $6.50 falafel and fries lunch special is great. The falafel: Nice chewy fresh pitz, perfect fried falafel balls, but what sets their falafel apart is the cabbage slaw which has an almost creamy texture to it. The stuff is insane and makes the falafel if you ask me!The fries: Freshly fried, crisp as all hell, good salty crispy fries and a choice of dipping sauces. I always get the roasted garlic which is insanely good. Overall, I've only had the falafel and fries, but they are awesome!",5.0
The food is super good... And specially all the workers...Super Cool!!! Hopefully u gonna enjoy,5.0
"OK, I've been here couple of times and this place rocks if you don't care about much sitting space and the cold wind every time door opens. The food is adequate in amount on most orders, makes you feel good about being fiscally responsible and VERY GOOD. So I am a returning customer and plan to continue that way.",4.0
"Lady did not get order right. Menu not descriptive, food was bland. Chicken flavorful but need more seasoning, frozen lamb from restaurant depo.Fries though were better than predicted, came with sauces not so special. Best part: bottled Honest Tea",2.0
So much food for such a small price. And the food is great - go figure! Falafel and fries is what I get. The white sauce for the sandwiches is dilly and delicious  and the fries come with your choice of several different dipping sauces. Try the garlic sauce - it is YUM.,4.0
Best thing I ate the entire time I was in New York.  Simple menu of falafel and gyros.  I chose the falafel sandwich with fries and kicker sauce.  My number one complaint with falafel places is that they don't put enough sauce on it.  This was doused in yogurt sauce which I loved.  The pita was grilled and the falafel was well spiced.  The fries had a nice crunch without being too crispy and came with a very good spicy dipping sauce.  And this was all about $6.50,5.0
"I'm from Jersey and my friend (who lives in BK) and I always like to try out new restaurants. Last time it was the indian spot next door, and last night it was Kabob Shack! I love the cozy little spot, love the wall art & most definitely enjoyed my meal. I had the gyro platter. The rice was so yummy and tasteful as well as the gyro lamb. It was delicious. Very filling! One thing, the salad they add to the plate is huge and takes away from everything else on the place, little less salad would be perfect. Also, we ordered hummus and feel it lacked salt , or flavor in general. But - we will definitely return again! & I'm sure my friend will order more frequently. Thank You! for the delicious experience.",4.0
"Second time here, so I figured it's time to write a review. Great, great, shawarma sandwich! I don't think I've had better anywhere else! The meat is juicy and well-seasoned and the fries are the perfect complement. They even have these special sauces for the fries that are phenomenal.",5.0

"Nothing negative to say about this place other than you can wait a while for a pick up order as they cooked your food to perfection.

"I've only had the gyro because it's the apex of gyros.  Granted, in my experience, competition hasn't been stiff. There's the diner baseline of pre-sliced frozen lamb in dry pita, and lots of places only slightly rise above it if at all. Regardless, Kabob Shack consummately lives up to the promise of a gyro like none of the others I've regrettably eaten, and I am confident I'm not just grading it on a curve. I'll give the rest of the menu the benefit of the doubt. They throw every other purveyor of Mediterranean sandwiches into sharp relief.",5.0

"I've only been to the newly opened Kabob Shack once, but I was definitely impressed. When I think of Kabobs, falafel, and a shack, I think of Mamoun's. A seedy old hole-in-the-wall with delicious but questionably-sourced food. But this is no shack. Nothing here seems questionable. There's a gorgeously worn-in bench for waiting, one modest  wooden table, and counter stools for a quick bite. The place knows its hood, and appropriately hangs a chalkboard menu and local art, as would be expected in good ole willyB. I wouldn't have been surprised if that chalkboard menu said ""Baked organic falafel on whole wheat pita - $6."" But this place proves that its decor and menu are signs of caring owners, not hipster magnets. I got a $3 falafel that was filled to the brim and fried potatoes with a delicious jalepeno cheddar dipping sauce. Seriously, I HATE jalepeno, yet I continuously doused my potatoes in them. For the record, I think they used jarred jalepenos so my tongue was spared a burning. What I liked about the falafel sandwich (besides it's deliciousness) is that they put a little bit of red cabbage to brighten it up. It was thoughtful of them to add the gorgeous color to my sandwich, it really does make a visual difference. It's the little things that show me the owners put thought, time, and effort into their business. The only thing I can fault them for is calling it a Shack. It's really more like a cute little establishment. But I guess they couldn't call it Cute Little Kabob Shop.",5.0

I can't vouch for the meat, but the hummus and falafel sandwiches rock (I get them without cabbage and with lots of hot sauce), the fries are completely addicting, and the people who work here are great. I live right around the corner, and this has become one of my favorite spots- Inexpensive, delicious and quick.",5.0
Had the Bolani and Falafel.  Both were excellent!!,4.0
Great Falafel and fries with a variety of dipping sauces - much better than Oasis.,5.0
"Rating: 1.5 Stars.Falafel is a staple in my diet and thus, upon noticing this store on a Havermeyer excursion (my final destination was Whirlybird, of course), I was overcome with joy. While there isn't much falafel competition in this part of town, Oasis is a wonderfully consistent option where - for $3 - your hunger needs are satiated in earnest and Zizi Limona now offers delicious versions of our familiar Mediterranean favorites. Of course, Taim lingers a short way across the bridge, but that is in a league of its own.Kabob Shack seemed clean enough, though this is clearly a take-out joint and I could not escape from the storefront quickly enough - cheap and clinical is how I would describe this place and, while this is adequate for your dentist's waiting room, it is not an environment sporting come-hither seating or decor. It doesn't even possess hole-in-the-wall charm, if that's what you're after. The sandwich comes in a wrap form as opposed to being encased in glorious pita, which immediately resulted in several stars being struck from my rating of the place. The joy of the pita is that it is a self-contained unit of pleasure; the beast at Kabob Shack places an emphasis on a curious sauce which didn't quite taste like tahini and was certainly not hummus (any guesses?), while the falafel balls were mediocre at best. With sauce dripping down my hands post meal, I felt only the shame associated with my betrayal of Oasis. This mistake shall never be repeated.Conclusion: There is truly no reason to opt for Kabob Shack over Oasis if you are in the mood for falafel in the area - it's a painless ten-minute walk. Furthermore, if you're looking for cheap food options, there's Whirlybird around the corner, the Bagel Store a couple of blocks away etc. With Zizi Limona now in the game, I would recommend that you save up a few extra dollars and venture up the road to that establishment.",1.0
"It's decent.  The food and place is clean.  I have high-ass expectations when it comes to falafel.  Thats what I ordered, and it wasn't spectacular, nor bad.  So-so.  My favorite in New York is still Mamoun's in Manhattan.  Best in the world is a hole-in-the-wall in Beirut.  This place is ok for falafel, but I have yet to try their kabobs so I'd give it a shot and come back.",3.0
Friendly staff. Beef kabob wins by Far Over chicken.,3.0
Kabob Shack is the undisputed king of all restaurants of its kind that I've visited. I feel blessed that I only live a couple of blocks away. I feel like I really do live right next to the best falafel place in New York City. The falafel is crispy. All the food is fresh and hot. There's NOTHING on the menu that I've tasted that doesn't blow me away - especially for the price. Enjoy the prices before they go up. The dudes that run it are warrior/poet/chef/philosophers. I love Kebab Shack. I will kill anyone that says anything bad about Kabob Shack.,5.0
"This lil place is great!  I just went there today and the employees were super friendly and the food was delicious.  I just got the felafel sandwich and it was super yummy.  It was a pita with some felafel, chopped tomatoes, shredded purple cabbage, red onion, and plenty of tahini.  They gave me the hot sauce on the side.  The art on the wall is local and it's just a very inviting place to grab a bite.",5.0
So Happy to have falafel in the hood!  So far so good.  Super friendly.  Good falafel.  I'll be back.,4.0
"Really great food, well priced, and the guys who work there are exceptionally nice. I am a big fan of the lamb kabob-tender meat, warm pita bread, perfectly cooked rice, flavorful chopped salad. The house yogurt sauce and the hot sauce that come with it are amazing. My roommate has had the falafel and says it is excellent as well.",5.0
"Psyched to have a kabob/falafel joint on the south side. Good food, good prices, nice people. I had the falafel sandwich, medium fries and two dipping sauces (European ketchup and a really zippy hot one, which name I can't remember). The falafel sandwich was filling - it was a little dry for my tastes, but still plenty yummy. The only thing I wish they had included in the sandwich was pickles or hot peppers, since they add such a nice balance to the flavor. The fries were awesome - crisp and salty. And the peppy dipping sauce was incredible. Now I just hope they stay open late for a post-pub-crawl nosh!",4.0
"So happy they are here! Great food, friendly staff, healthy food at great prices! Open late. Not many options in this neighborhood other than fast food especially late. Falafel really great, filling, for $3 ! Love the white sauce, I get it on the side for the fries, which are great and super light. I also recommend the chicken kabob, super soft chicken, grilled and seasoned very nicely, comes on a bed of rice with tomato, onion, pita bread, the amazing white sauce, a little green sauce and a little salad of chopped cucumber and tomato.  Really good and filling for $8",5.0

"I decided to stroll down to this place on a warm evening since I've been to Oasis enough times already and because as far as I can tell you can't get a half decent falafel in Greenpoint. Anyway I ordered the lamb kabob. When it arrived, it looked a little small, but actually with the generous mountain of rice and the whole roasted vegetables thrown in there, it was a satisfying and very tasty meal. If I was in the area, I would definitely eat here again.",4.0
pretty good. nice staff and fresh tasting food. wished the veggies in the falafel salad were chopped and not enormous. also takes longer than your average falafel place. but its good.,4.0
