Great brunch! We moved to the neighborhood only a few weeks ago and we have already been a handful of times. The pastrami Benedict is amazing! I also recommend the French toast and bacon (they definitely win at bacon). The service has been great each time as well!,5.0

"You know what... I have to say that BRUNCH was delicious today..... Fried green tomatoes were awesome with that special hot sauce....Folks, the FRIED CHICKEN is the God's honest truth!.... it was soooooooo good.... and the serving was everything-3 pieces of chicken... loved it!That French Toast with blueberries was a knock out... this is a definite spot that I will return to...The only thing that was kinda off putting... was that the resto was not crowded at all and we waited over 40 minutes for a table... after like 25 minutes there were one tthree empty tables... I literally had to approach the hostess who then sat us down immediately....The staff was very friendly and the tunes were on point... with a very mixed crowd... I have tried the other two sister restaurants... Peaches and Peaches Hot House... If I were to rate the three sister restaurants with 1 being the best.... it would go in this order... 1. Marietta (the fried chicken here is waaaaay better than Peaches Hot House)2. Peaches (it was tough to put it at 2... might be a tie w/ Marrieta but they don't have fried chicken.. lol lol)3. Peaches Hot House ( low budget compared to the above... sorry to put it that way)",4.0

People have been telling me about this place since I came to the neighborhood. Happy to have been invited to a dinner with friends here. The place is quite a bit bigger than I had originally thought. I had the roasted chicken and it was really good. Also fried green tomatoes!!,4.0
"I'm not sure there is any better way to start the work week than with some scrumptious fried chicken for lunch.  Tell me I'm wrong...  Today, a friend and I, wandered over to Marietta for our mid-day meal to find a near empty restaurant and our choice of tables.  Our waiter was quiet but provided good service and lunch made its way to our tables quickly.  Each plate was piled high with greens (in a light vinaigrette) and a larger than expected chicken sandwich... But I found myself a tiny bit disappointed in that sandwich.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but I feel like it needed a little extra something.  So for now I'm handing out three stars.  Let me explain... I ordered the 'Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich' ($10) w/ Swiss (+1) (also comes w/ lettuce, tomato and onion).  The chicken was great.  Super juicy thigh piece with sooo much crunch.  Guessing its rolled in panko before its fried  - the crunch is crazy.  And then to balance all that crunch is the softest toasted roll everrrr. However... if there was any spice in this 'spicy' sandwich than sadly it was lost on me.  And I didn't love Marietta's 'Comeback Sauce' which is served w/ all their sandwiches.  We asked what was in it and were told a combination of mayo, fish sauce & anchovies sauce and that 'it goes great with the chicken'.  For me - it did not go well at all.  Fishy sauce w/ fried chicken?  What?  No.  It was good for us that it came on the side and not automatically on the sandwich.  I'd rather have a dash of hot sauce or dijon...  but we didn't ask if either was available, maybe next time. And I'm pretty sure there will be a next time.  This gal needs the occasional fried chicken sandwich and despite that fishy sauce Marietta is a great option in Clinton Hill.",3.0
"Solid neighborhood restaurant that does a very nice job on food execution.  I also really like the creative cocktails and the price point overall is very reasonable. I have eaten here several times and have always had a nice time.  I recommend the fried chicken, the crispy skin salmon, and the burrata.  I found the black rick surf & turf to be a bit too salty.  Like the other restaurants in this restaurant group, Marietta is a real crowd pleaser, and I highly recommend it for group dinners, first dates, etc.  It works well for all occasions.",4.0
"Came to visit my best friend for her birthday and this place was the perfect Sunday evening spot. It was a party of three and we were looking for a calm, low dim lit restaurant to unwind and we found it. Marietta was able to service us with ample time. We were switched servers but the transition was so seamless we barely noticed. We ordered a bottle of Tempranillo priced at $32 which is reasonable. My party ordered a burger, the fried chicken option and I ordered the mussels ($17). The mussels were a hefty amount, I always love with restaurants give you a bang for your buck.  A large bowl of MUSSELS! And ...they understand how to serve them because they brought out and extra bowl for your empty shells. This entree always brings a side of fries. The add on and specialty here is they're sauce. ""Comeback,"" sauce. To me, it tasted like ketchup, mayo and Siracha. But you can only guess as its their special sauce. In total, the bill was about $98 for three people and that includes a bottle of wine. I think that's a great price and a great time. I recommend this place for romantic dates. Very cute and cozy.",5.0

"I would say it was teetering on amazing, it was a 4.5 for me. There were a few hiccups on some dishes but overall a very excellent meal. The restaurant itself is a long restaurant with a decent amount of seating and for some reason, the decor had a Hamptons/modern Southern feel to the place. I came with a few friends and it was a nice way to sample a lot of what the restaurant had to offer and I was very pleased. Marietta is also part of the people who do Peaches, Peaches Hothouse, and Smoke Joint.The food:Charcuterie Plate- Whipped Pork Shoulder, Pork Cheek, Chicken Liver Mousse, Country Ham. I thought their Charcuterie plate was really great. I thought their Chicken Liver mousse and Country Ham were excellent, they were my two favs. The whipped shoulder was good but wasn't as exciting. I think the pork cheek was served with mustard and the flavors really worked but the mustard was excellent.Roasted Brussels Sprouts- Whipped garlic, olive oil. I thought these were very nicely cooked, they had a nice clean flavor and it was a nice side dish.Ham and Cheese Heirloom Grits- Anson Mills, Benton's Smoked Ham, Aged Gouda. I thought the grits were great, they were very cheesy, kinda felt like scrambled eggs in a weird kinda way but a good way. The grits were so nice and rich, then it pairs really well with the salty porky flavor of the ham. I would get this again.Extra Fancy Fried Chicken- Lemon-Honey Brine, Marietta Hot Sauce. This is kinda the go to dish here and for good reason, it has really great flavor while juicy yet not greasy. It was fried so well it didn't feel like it was fried at all.The sauces were nice especially the spicy honey, then the chipotle, both really worked with the chicken. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Crispy Skin Salmon- Cauliflower- whipped and roasted, Sea Beans. I am normally not a fan of cooked salmon but the one here was ordered med raw and it was so perfectly cooked, it is probably one of the best cooked salmon dishes I have had. And then the crispy skin was a wonderful addition.Rib & Tail- Charred Ribeye, Oxtail Sauce, Fresh Herbs, Lime. This dish didn't feel American at all, honestly, it felt like a Thai dish.  It really resembled a Thai salad with a kick. The bone marrow was great complement to the steak. Steak itself was cooked nicely but with an Ribeye, it had some huge chunks of fat, it also had some chewy pieces. The dish was good, but would have been great with a slight adjustment. yelp.com/user_local_phot…French Roast Chicken- FreeBird Chicken, Anson Mills Polenta, market mushrooms. I was really excited to try this dish since it had it's own section on the side of the menu. The idea of roast chicken seemed enticing, the chicken was extremely juicy and the flavor of the chicken was nice but the dish came off very salty and that kinda ruined the dish for me.Grilled Leg of Lamb- Asparagus, Confit Tomato, Dill, Feta, Black Olives. This was my least favorite dish, the leg of lamb was really chewy. The flavor of the lamb was OK but the dill and feta didn't work for me, I was not a fan of this dish. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",4.0

The menu may seem small to some, but I like to think of it as curated. The lights were low enough to feel soothing but bright enough to read the menus with no issue. The food: I ordered the whiting sandwich after seeing another persons order. Its ridiculous. It included three (3!)  pieces of light crispy fillets between a succulent butter toasted bun (think lobster roll bun). I actually took one fillet off the sandwich when eating it and shared it with my table. It also is served with their Comeback sauce, which is a spicy mayo. I tasted a bit of the fried chicken and black rice and both were delicious too. But I'm still glad I went with the whiting sandwich.",5.0

I don't EVER order crab, hell, I thought I didn't even like crab meat. The blue crab spaghetti was superb. I almost scraped my plate. I learned on that night that I like crab meat.

"So I want to start by saying that overall this is really a fine restaurant. Fairly priced, lovely staff, creative menu, pleasant space. However a troubling incident occurred today while I was at brunch. I ordered a plate of the fried chicken, which by all accounts was one of their signature menu items. When the dish arrived, there were two pieces of chicken- a breast, and a wing. Now, anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant knows that there are two acceptable uses for chicken wings- staff meal, or buffalo wings as a bar snack (or entree in a more casual restaurant, usually served cheaply by the half dozen). A $17.00 plate of fried chicken (which to be fair also includes a piece of french toast) that includes a wing is frankly somewhat insulting to the customer, as it's clearly a way of cutting costs by using undesirable cuts of meat. I asked my server if I might be able to swap it out for a leg or a thigh, and she was more than gracious, even so far as to somewhat agree with me. I got a leg and all seemed to be fine- however, I noticed that one of the other members of my party who had also ordered the fried chicken also got a wing. Clearly, this is common practice at Marietta, and it's unacceptable. Customers aren't stupid, we know that wings are throwaway pieces of meat, and it undermines the otherwise high-end nature of the restaurant. Now maybe I'm nit-picking, but I think that a restaurant with as good of a menu and reputation as Marietta's would seek perfection in every plate- and for the price tag, a customer should expect as much. Clearly, the kitchen disagrees. Now I really want to stress that other than this one complaint, we had a great time and a fine meal- so this is really more of a comment for the kitchen to make a change to a particular dish rather than an overall negative review of the restaurant. If you're thinking of going, go. You'll like it. But as someone who's worked in the restaurant business for years, I consider it important that the kitchen not underestimate their customers' expectations.",4.0

"Some of the worst service I've had, ever.... on multiple occasions. Every time I go back I kick myself for it. Ugh.I used to live right down the street, so it was an easy place to meet someone. Haven't had a good experience since last summer, and now that I've moved a few blocks away I am sure I will not be back. The 2 Stars are for the quality of the food and the location - there's not a lot else on those few blocks, and the food is actually pretty good.The Good : charcuterie plate, fried green tomatoes and the black rice surf and turf are great. The burger used to be fantastic, but the last 2 times I've had it was just meh. I don't know if the recipe changed or just the people cooking it, but it's just not as good.The Bad : The cocktails ( most are too sweet, none I've had are well balanced). The beers (not a lot of choice on tap, which is fine - but on 2 separate occasions I sat in front of the bartender and she poured me a beer that was literally half full, the other half with foam. Not ok). The service ( Ignored at tables for excessive amounts of time without a single greeting, and then left...Had rude comments dished by both a server and manager, separate times.. and had both food and drinks forgotten, in the same experience). It's bad.I don't like writing negative reviews, but I hope someone sees this and rethinks who and how your business is running.",2.0
"I took my boyfriend here for a date on a busy Friday night. Even though we didn't have a reservation, we were seated immediately. The decor was charming and warm without the hipster extremes typical of most restaurants in the neighborhood. I would describe it as rural chic with fun accents. We ordered the fried chicken and fish sandwich. Both were great and served piping hot. There was so much fish on my sandwich that I had to take it apart to eat it, which is a good thing. The breading was light and not too overpowering. It could've used more spice or at least a more flavorful sauce (maybe a chipotle sauce or lemon base) to round out the flavor. The only bad thing about our visit (and this is pretty damn bad)...Toward the end of our meal, a MOUSE ran through the dining area. Yes, at prime time Friday night when the restaurant was full, bustling, and very loud, a FUCKING MOUSE decided to make a visit. This smacks of a much more serious rodent infestation. And no, the front door of the restaurant wasn't propped open, so the mouse clearly came in through some hole. I really really don't like rodents especially where I am eating. So of course the table next to us say something to our shared waitress. Her response--priceless. ""I can't do anything about it."" Manager comes over. His response--priceless. ""Do you want to move outside?"" That was it. No apology. No offer to comp the meal, which is standard policy in the restaurant industry when this shit happens. Thanks, Marietta for the fabulous meal with the mouse droppings as the garniture alimentaire to my fish sandwich. In return for your unsanitary conditions and bad service (i.e., not comping our very expensive meal), you get reported to the Health Department.",2.0
Went to dinner with another person here. Nice environment and sorta of small place. I got a cheese burger with fries. Its was 15 dollars. $15! For a burger and fries. The burger was decent but was worth no where near $15. The fries were about the same size as McDonald's dollar fries. My friend got the salmon with some other stuff in it. That was $20 dollars! The salmon once again was decent but wasnt worth $20...Ive been to other places where the salmon and burger was bigger and a hell of alot cheaper. Am i saying this is a bad place to eat? No but is it worth the money? Sorry dont think so.,2.0

"Should a neighborhood restaurant be rated differently?I am reminded of this question every time I read a review from a friend who has checked into that restaurant 50 or so times. Clearly, for the phenomenon to recur the restaurant has merits, but then, why don't I share that enthusiasm after my own visit? As someone who travels long distances to try restaurants in different neighborhoods, I was tempted to dismiss this behavior as a preference for convenience. Till, after half a dozen visits to Marietta I think I have greater clarity.Marietta, Clinton Hill which harkens back to the romanticism of Marietta, Georgia by recreating its spirit, is a restaurant with considerable merits. To count a few virtues of the restaurant and its management:They get the basics right. I am a temperature eater, and am positively unhappy if an entrée is not hot, let alone warm. Honestly, I've never had a lukewarm entrée at Marietta. The food is always piping hot - no mean feat to pull off on a busy weekend night. Also, the portion sizes are substantial: the Long Island Whiting sandwich could well be serving the whole fish!They pay attention. The service is absolutely top notch. While they won't know the name of your dog, the staff will be watching you to make sure that you're being taken care off. One Friday evening as I waited for my Memphis Fried Chicken, the manager showed up next to me with a plate of Burrata, apologizing for the delay and explaining that given the rush of patrons the kitchen had been delayed in processing orders, and in the interim he wanted me to enjoy the complimentary Burrata. That was a first for me. Sure, I have been comped a menu item AFTER drawing attention to a service delay, but never proactively addressed. What was amazing was that the Burrata was the appetizer I had been debating before opting for the Fried Green Tomatoes. That the manager got the perfect remedial dish, might be luck as opposed to anything else... but, luck is what happens when your preparation is rigorous.They listen. I was pleasantly surprised to see a dessert menu on my most recent visit. When I mentioned this to the server, he said that other people had brought up the paucity of desserts as well, and added that I finally had a new dessert to try (The Brown Butter cake). I'm surprised he remembered my polite gripe two months back, when I had said that I was forced to choose between the Butterscotch pudding (very good) and the Drunk Toast (Excellent) on each occasion as the other dessert, the chocolate cake, inevitably ended up being dry under the surface (design flaw in the dessert's execution) every time.They serve consistently excellent food. The menu changes regularly, keeping things fresh for easily jaded diners. I've loved the Smoked Whitefish Salad, Fried Green Tomatoes, Black Rice Surf & Turf, and the Memphis Fried Chicken. Now, the fried chicken has much thicker batter than I prefer, (e.g. the lighter coating at Root and Bone) but one can still appreciate its perfect execution: always crisp and served hot (unlike at R & B). It's so good that I am even willing to forgive the descriptor of ""Memphis"". Honestly, other than a Mambo with the Nashville style fried chicken at sister restaurant Peaches HotHouse, I don't know why it's named ""Memphis"" style (unless a Memphis relative's recipe), for I've eaten at Gus's - the definitive Memphis Chicken - and this is not the same style. One of the many deft flourishes a keen observer will appreciate at Marietta is the creative use of the hot vinegar, which isn't too pungent (I'd rate the heat a 2 on a scale of 10), but which lubricates the chicken perfectly.With a tab of $ 50-60 per person (drink, appetizer, entrée, dessert, taxes, tip), Marietta is one of the most under-appreciated restaurants in NYC. Should you not come here expecting the technical brilliance of a Per Se, you'll leave wishing you lived nearby - which to me clarifies that it's the experiential elements of a neighborhood restaurant that define why it's special... Marietta is positively stellar.",5.0

"Had brunch here yesterday, and the food was absolutely divine! However when I think of brunch, I think of bottomless drinks, or a drink included with your meal. Either way, the food was worth the price. My  biggest issue, and reason for the four star rating was the service. Our waitress seated us, and was gone for more than 10 mins before coming over to ask for our order. The entire time we were there (about 1.5hrs), she came back to check on us once. She isn't very attentive, and messed up one of our orders resulting in one of my dining companions being unable to eat her food, and having to order something else. I do believe that it is extremely important to listen to a patrons requests seeing as everyone has different meal requirements. Unfortunately for her, she received a lousy tip, and it was simply because of her lack of attentiveness.

The fried chicken and the burger are a must-eat/order. The one hit wonder cocktail was also very delicious. From the wonderful owners that brought you Peaches, this is a solid restaurant!",4.0
"Been here for brunch and for dinner, both times did not disappoint. Brunch I got the avocado toast with a side of scrambled eggs and a side of bacon. The bacon's perfectly crisp and not greasy at all. Eggs were, well, eggs, but done well. Had a few mimosa's which can up the bill quite a bit but overall food and atmosphere is great! Service is decent, they did not have my reservation written down but accommodated my group very quickly regardless!",4.0
"Some of the worst service I've had, ever.... on multiple occasions. Every time I go back I kick myself for it. Ugh.I used to live right down the street, so it was an easy place to meet someone. Haven't had a good experience since last summer, and now that I've moved a few blocks away I am sure I will not be back. The 2 Stars are for the quality of the food and the location - there's not a lot else on those few blocks, and the food is actually pretty good.The Good : charcuterie plate, fried green tomatoes and the black rice surf and turf are great. The burger used to be fantastic, but the last 2 times I've had it was just meh. I don't know if the recipe changed or just the people cooking it, but it's just not as good.The Bad : The cocktails ( most are too sweet, none I've had are well balanced). The beers (not a lot of choice on tap, which is fine - but on 2 separate occasions I sat in front of the bartender and she poured me a beer that was literally half full, the other half with foam. Not ok). The service ( Ignored at tables for excessive amounts of time without a single greeting, and then left...Had rude comments dished by both a server and manager, separate times.. and had both food and drinks forgotten, in the same experience). It's bad.I don't like writing negative reviews, but I hope someone sees this and rethinks who and how your business is running.",2.0
"I took my boyfriend here for a date on a busy Friday night. Even though we didn't have a reservation, we were seated immediately. The decor was charming and warm without the hipster extremes typical of most restaurants in the neighborhood. I would describe it as rural chic with fun accents. We ordered the fried chicken and fish sandwich. Both were great and served piping hot. There was so much fish on my sandwich that I had to take it apart to eat it, which is a good thing. The breading was light and not too overpowering. It could've used more spice or at least a more flavorful sauce (maybe a chipotle sauce or lemon base) to round out the flavor. The only bad thing about our visit (and this is pretty damn bad)...Toward the end of our meal, a MOUSE ran through the dining area. Yes, at prime time Friday night when the restaurant was full, bustling, and very loud, a FUCKING MOUSE decided to make a visit. This smacks of a much more serious rodent infestation. And no, the front door of the restaurant wasn't propped open, so the mouse clearly came in through some hole. I really really don't like rodents especially where I am eating. So of course the table next to us say something to our shared waitress. Her response--priceless. ""I can't do anything about it."" Manager comes over. His response--priceless. ""Do you want to move outside?"" That was it. No apology. No offer to comp the meal, which is standard policy in the restaurant industry when this shit happens. Thanks, Marietta for the fabulous meal with the mouse droppings as the garniture alimentaire to my fish sandwich. In return for your unsanitary conditions and bad service (i.e., not comping our very expensive meal), you get reported to the Health Department.",2.0
Went to dinner with another person here. Nice environment and sorta of small place. I got a cheese burger with fries. Its was 15 dollars. $15! For a burger and fries. The burger was decent but was worth no where near $15. The fries were about the same size as McDonald's dollar fries. My friend got the salmon with some other stuff in it. That was $20 dollars! The salmon once again was decent but wasnt worth $20...Ive been to other places where the salmon and burger was bigger and a hell of alot cheaper. Am i saying this is a bad place to eat? No but is it worth the money? Sorry dont think so.,2.0
"Marietta was our last stop before leaving from our weekend in NYC - what a lovely farewell meal! The neighborhood is beautiful and the food is comforting yet refreshing. Based on other reviews, my mom and I both got fried chicken (she, the main plate, and I, the rice bowl). Simply, yum. If I hadn't been driving, I would have loved to try some of their cocktails. Guess I will have to go back some day :)",5.0

"Should a neighborhood restaurant be rated differently?I am reminded of this question every time I read a review from a friend who has checked into that restaurant 50 or so times. Clearly, for the phenomenon to recur the restaurant has merits, but then, why don't I share that enthusiasm after my own visit? As someone who travels long distances to try restaurants in different neighborhoods, I was tempted to dismiss this behavior as a preference for convenience. Till, after half a dozen visits to Marietta I think I have greater clarity.Marietta, Clinton Hill which harkens back to the romanticism of Marietta, Georgia by recreating its spirit, is a restaurant with considerable merits. To count a few virtues of the restaurant and its management:They get the basics right. I am a temperature eater, and am positively unhappy if an entrée is not hot, let alone warm. Honestly, I've never had a lukewarm entrée at Marietta. The food is always piping hot - no mean feat to pull off on a busy weekend night. Also, the portion sizes are substantial: the Long Island Whiting sandwich could well be serving the whole fish!They pay attention. The service is absolutely top notch. While they won't know the name of your dog, the staff will be watching you to make sure that you're being taken care off. One Friday evening as I waited for my Memphis Fried Chicken, the manager showed up next to me with a plate of Burrata, apologizing for the delay and explaining that given the rush of patrons the kitchen had been delayed in processing orders, and in the interim he wanted me to enjoy the complimentary Burrata. That was a first for me. Sure, I have been comped a menu item AFTER drawing attention to a service delay, but never proactively addressed. What was amazing was that the Burrata was the appetizer I had been debating before opting for the Fried Green Tomatoes. That the manager got the perfect remedial dish, might be luck as opposed to anything else... but, luck is what happens when your preparation is rigorous.They listen. I was pleasantly surprised to see a dessert menu on my most recent visit. When I mentioned this to the server, he said that other people had brought up the paucity of desserts as well, and added that I finally had a new dessert to try (The Brown Butter cake). I'm surprised he remembered my polite gripe two months back, when I had said that I was forced to choose between the Butterscotch pudding (very good) and the Drunk Toast (Excellent) on each occasion as the other dessert, the chocolate cake, inevitably ended up being dry under the surface (design flaw in the dessert's execution) every time.They serve consistently excellent food. The menu changes regularly, keeping things fresh for easily jaded diners. I've loved the Smoked Whitefish Salad, Fried Green Tomatoes, Black Rice Surf & Turf, and the Memphis Fried Chicken. Now, the fried chicken has much thicker batter than I prefer, (e.g. the lighter coating at Root and Bone) but one can still appreciate its perfect execution: always crisp and served hot (unlike at R & B). It's so good that I am even willing to forgive the descriptor of ""Memphis"". Honestly, other than a Mambo with the Nashville style fried chicken at sister restaurant Peaches HotHouse, I don't know why it's named ""Memphis"" style (unless a Memphis relative's recipe), for I've eaten at Gus's - the definitive Memphis Chicken - and this is not the same style. One of the many deft flourishes a keen observer will appreciate at Marietta is the creative use of the hot vinegar, which isn't too pungent (I'd rate the heat a 2 on a scale of 10), but which lubricates the chicken perfectly.With a tab of $ 50-60 per person (drink, appetizer, entrée, dessert, taxes, tip), Marietta is one of the most under-appreciated restaurants in NYC. Should you not come here expecting the technical brilliance of a Per Se, you'll leave wishing you lived nearby - which to me clarifies that it's the experiential elements of a neighborhood restaurant that define why it's special... Marietta is positively stellar.",5.0
the eligible bachelor drink is really good (blood orange juice and champagne).chicken and french toast (very good but not the best fried chicken i ever had but better than other places nearby). service: friendly atmosphere: very nice and warm.,4.0
"Had brunch here yesterday, and the food was absolutely divine! However when I think of brunch, I think of bottomless drinks, or a drink included with your meal. Either way, the food was worth the price. My  biggest issue, and reason for the four star rating was the service. Our waitress seated us, and was gone for more than 10 mins before coming over to ask for our order. The entire time we were there (about 1.5hrs), she came back to check on us once. She isn't very attentive, and messed up one of our orders resulting in one of my dining companions being unable to eat her food, and having to order something else. I do believe that it is extremely important to listen to a patrons requests seeing as everyone has different meal requirements. Unfortunately for her, she received a lousy tip, and it was simply because of her lack of attentiveness. I do recommend, and I would return, and actually wouldn't mind having her as a witness again, though I may need to call her out on where she's lacking.",4.0

They come with toast and salad.  We always get a side of brussels sprouts, which most people think are the best brussels sprouts they have ever had!

"Southern food meets Brooklyn chic.  I rue trips on the G train, so I decided on a 45 min walk, and what better way to reward such a trek than with fried chicken.  The place was bigger than I thought it would be.  It was intimately lit and on a cold winter night it was like stepping into a sanctuary.  We started with drinks and the fried green tomatoes.  They had the most artisanal ice cubes I've ever seen in a drink.  Mine had a frozen grapefruit.  The fried green tomatoes were amazing, not at all like any that I've had before.  We had the fried chicken, the whiting sandwich and a side of brussels sprouts.  The chicken was excellent as reported and though I would have preferred dark meat to white, the pieces I had were tender and juicy with a crispy and well seasoned skin.  The fish sandwich was okay, but nothing really stood out about it.Overall, a top 3 contender on the fried chicken list.  There are many other things on the menu I'd like to try (24 hr lamb??), and so I'll probably be back for more!",4.0
"Best burger I've ever eaten. It's juicy, flavorful, and just goddamn delicious. Add pork cheek for an extra punch of meaty goodness.

"I just had possibly one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in NYC tonight. I'm not sure if it was an off-night or they are really going downhill, but absolutely everything about the experience was awful.Let me preface the food review by saying that I'd been here twice before, about a year apart each time. Both those times, the food was great. Some of the entrees were a bit pricey, but meh, par for the area and type of restaurant. The standout dish was the fried chicken. Juicy, tender, crispy on the outside, not greasy and with the right amount of spicy kick. Seriously, was my favorite fried chicken joint in the city...until now.The restaurant was fairly busy for a Thursday, and it looked like they had only one poor waitress for about half of the restaurant (bad management!!). She truly did her best to take care of every table, but because there was just one of her, service was incredibly slow. Moving on to the food, because of our great experiences with the fried chicken on two other occasions, my boyfriend and I decided to both order it again. Wow, it was truly unrecognizable. I wish I had taken pictures. The batter was heavy, greasy and very cakey and it looked like the spices hadn't even been mixed in. The most egregious thing, however, was that my chicken was RAW on the inside! I never send food back, but this was a health hazard. They did try to re-cook it, but the chicken I got back was still quite undercooked (still pink!!) and very rubbery. Really, really unappetizing, and it's already not sitting well on my stomach, merely hours afterwards.I hope it was just an off-night. I really do--this was my favorite place to get fried chicken, but if the quality is going downhill, then I won't be likely to return. What they served me was disgusting and not safe and certainly not worth the price (and the re-cooking did not make the quality any better--they should have either comped it or given me new chicken that was properly cooked).",1.0

"After spending new years day (I'm so behind with my reviews! Ah well, a chance to relive my awesome holiday) keeping my hungover sister company, I managed to coerce her out into the cool new air of 2014 to join me for dinner.

The eggs Benedict was fantastic - eggs were done well, bread was just the right amount of hardness and mushrooms tasted heavenly. Would definitely go back to try the other variations. Finally the butterscotch pudding was equally divine and I will definitely be back to try the rest of their extensive dessert menu.",4.0
"I was looking for food around 11 pm on a Friday night after an event. After a few places, we were glad to find a place with an open kitchen so late at night. Per a recommendation, I got the Extra Fancy Fried Chicken. The skin was crispy and flavorful and the hot sauce added a another layer of complexity to it as well. I just wanted to strip the chicken naked and eat all the outside parts first. On top of that, the chicken meat was perfectly cooked. I felt complete after eating everything in my plate (at the amazement of my date).",4.0

This place is wonderful.   It has a lovely ambiance and a great staff.   I ate fried chicken.  I am a southerner and KNOW my chicken!!!   It was delicious.   It was served with a side of leafy greens.   Perfect for people into food combining.      I also had the fried green tomatoes.    YummyI had the warm pistachio cake for desert.   It could have been warmer but it was still good.  Served with pistachio ice cream....delicious.!!!   I will be back again and again!!!    P.S.  I ate waaaaay too much fried stuff that night but....trust me..it's worth it..Great job Marietta!!!!!,5.0
"I had my first brunch experience today at Marietta's. It was great! I enjoyed my food completely and the atmosphere was so cool. The music playing was right up my alley, old school classics. I enjoyed the French toast and perfectly fried eggs easy over medium. My sister had the shrimp&grits which was also pretty amazing!   The customer service was also on point I will be coming back!",5.0
"I came here with a group of lady friends. We were able to be sat right away, even though it was a Friday night. The server was friendly and extremely accommodating about any questions we had about the menu. We all ordered something different. Each dish was Divine. I happen to order the Salmon. The skin was perfectly crisped. I ordered it medium-rare and is was just that. Perfect! We also all ordered dessert. I got the butterscotch pudding. It was a great way to end such a delicious meal. We all left full and happy. I live in the neighborhood and look forward to trying out there brunch soon.",5.0
"THE PERFECT BRUNCH SPOTHas there been any french toast better than their granola crusted french toast? No. Topped with lemon ricotta and a blueberry compote, this is the meal I always order. I get a side of sunny side up eggs because I love eggs, and the four slices of heaven definitely fill me up. The Marietta burger with pate is also amazing.I've gone here for brunch twice while visiting my cousin, she lives in Bed-Stuy so it was a nice short walk since it's on the border of Clifton and Bed-Stuy.I'm not a huge fan of bloody marys but theirs was really good as far as they go; they were smoky and spicy and you couldn't really tell it had alcohol. I was disappointed by the lack of mimosa on the menu.The ambience was really nice, I like the bigger room in the back more, nice exposed brick, full bar. The server was very nice and the food came pretty quickly. Also, can we give it up to whoever makes the playlist because Marietta will take you on a musical journey back to your childhood with their compliation of 90s jams.",5.0

"Overall tasty neighborhood joint that plays with food artfully . Better decor ,more finesse and restraint in certain aspects of food with improved service would make this a destination place.The badDecor is minimal and very uninteresting. Definantly not Brooklyn cool. Not one piece of art on the walls. Most uncomfortable seating ever. Chairs as well as most benches without pillow support. Service was  barely adequate not particularly attentive given place was pretty empty for a Saturday evening at 8:30. Fairly high price point for quantity of food and this area of Brooklyn. Mains require a separate side.Drinks pretty weak and unimpressive. Small  unimpressive wine per glass and bottle  selection.The goodStarter shared very large watermelon salad with avocado purée. This was one of the most inventive delicious flavor profiles in a salad I have ever had. Ice cold Watermelon chunks  seasoned with Asian flavors umami underpinning layered with spicy purslane and very clean avocado purée. Very aromatic starter. Mains roast guinea hen and rib eye. Rib eye overcooked( I ordered rare - arrived medium /medium rare) but was extremely moist juicy with lovely exterior char and interesting seasonings which were hard to identify. Oxtail sauce silky smooth with good oxtail flavor.Ribeye was served with a little too aggressive amount a mountain of various herbs( mint, chili slices) that was not chopped.This made it very hard to get a mouthful of steak with herbs. Would have worked better if steak had been placed on top of this herbs then some would have wilted and perfumed steak or chopped even roughly. Other very odd thing was this steak did not taste like ribeye more like sirloin strip. Even though grass fed which tends to be leaner rib eye usually has super tender mouthfeel. Double checked with waitress and she was adamant rib eye. Side order with steak mashed potatoes with scallion butter. Overkill with 1/4 cup of scallion butter.Guinean hen was nicely cooked. Not many interesting flavors. Tiny portion compared to steak.Side of fries very underwhelming with everything else on menu thinking out of box. Dessert olive cake with hyssop.Simple tasty moist not overly sweet dessert. Could certainly taste olives.Good sharing portion. Vin Santo ordered unusually sour and dark although improved as it aired( was old 1997).So would overall come back especially to try their brunch.",3.0
"Let me start by saying, I come here often and usually everything is great; service, food, drinks, etc. That was not the case today. The kitchen was WAY off its game today. The smoked salmon and whitefish platter came sans whitefish. The rice dish came with a very undercooked egg - almost raw and no rice! The waitress didn't seem thrilled to be working brunch to begin with, but I think the kitchen mistakes really did it for her. She was visibly annoyed and made no apologies or concessions for the mistakes at hand. There were three of us and none of us actually ate at the same time (except for a shared appetizer). Overall, not a great way to start the day.",3.0
"We've been here three times, and we will surely return. The first time, we just had a couple beers and a tasty white bean dip. We've returned for brunch twice, and each time, were super impressed with the food. The first time, I had the crepes with farmers cheese and bourbon apple. They reminded me a lot of blintzes, which is not a bad thing at all. My husband got the skillet rice, which was super tasty. I had a gin cocktail that was delicious: loads of basil, and a hint of sweet lime. The second time, I got a smoked salmon scdamble and my husband got the mushroom egg benedict. That dish was a revelation; the meaty mushrooms and hollandaise were a great combo that I'm surprised nobody has thought of before. I was less thrilled by my drink that time, though: it was a little overly sweet (and a little under filled), but it was the brunch rush, and with such tasty food, all is forgiven.",4.0

Their cocktails are by no means ""weak"" or ""watered-down"". I ordered the Gumption (Manhattan-esqe cocktail) and 2 Cosmo's for my wife and mom. Last but not least was the dessert. Now I can't remember the last time I order dessert from a restaurant, but after the list of option the had, I simply settled for the Brandy flavored Gelato. And of course ""it was great"".

"There was something a bit off from the moment we got there for brunch.  The vibe from the host wasn't the most welcoming, but we thought that maybe it was a matter of being harried by having a lot going on. Our party of three was seated at what to be a two-top, one of us having to sit perched blinded by the sun in a window box, higher than the two regular chairs at the table.  The server was very pleasant and helpful in providing suggestions.  We decided to start with fried green tomatoes and Brussels sprouts.  The tomatoes were passable - the sauce they were served in was tasty, while the Brussels sprouts were nearly flavorless and not very warm.The conversation around the table was good, so we brushed off the disappointing appetizers and crossed our fingers for the main courses: fried chicken, pastrami, and eggs benedict with mushrooms and black kale.  My eggs benedict was served on oily bread and the dressed 'side' salad was directly on top which mucked up any flavor the kale, mushrooms, and hollandaise might've had on their own.  The eggs were poached well, but the dish was otherwise a disappointment that I only got through because I was hungry and didn't want to waste food.  The bruncher having the pastrami felt similarly about her dish.  She also has celiac disease and was told she could get more greens in place of bread, but instead she got the same amount of greens as I did.  Our third wasn't impressed with the fried chicken, and not a compulsive food-finisher like the other two of us, left most of it on her plate.  The host from earlier who may also have been the manager came over, seeing the unfinished food and asked her about it.  She told him that it was ""just okay"".  He told her he would take it off the bill and she said that it wasn't necessary, but he insisted.  Somehow, even this whole interaction felt off, like there was something aggressive about it.  He also didn't ask either of us who'd finished the food how our meals had been.To top off the whole experience, two of us were sick to our stomachs afterward for the rest of the day.",2.0

Best fried chicken I've had in a very long time. Only way I can explain it is that it was made by God. It has a nice spiciness and seasoning was perfect.

"Two things that differentiate a 3 from a 4 when it comes to brunch: you gotta have strong, powerfully flavored coffee. If you can't get that right, it's game over. Marietta excels in this department. Second is that you need a subtle twist on a traditional brunch dish. If I want eggs benedict, I'll buy the hollandaise from Trader Joe's and make it myself. I want to try something just a touch out of the norm. Cue Marietta's hash dishes. Thanks for sprinkling your own personality as a restaurant on what could could be just an interchangeable part in the brunch machine.",4.0
"APBC stop #1. Yea, this was the first destination. Italian food would be a no-no. But drinks, I can handle. So, this place was cute, exposed brick serving Italian but nothing remarkable except for the staff. There was squash scrub in a bottle sitting on the bar. What is it?

"This meal was unbelievable from start to finish. We had the burrata appetizer and the charcuterie plate. Each one was a work of culinary art. The little elements to each dish, sauces, and hidden flavors were really amazing. We had a delicious Tempranillo red wine and the service was thoughtful, well paced  and attentive throughout. The fried chicken was a stand out with a bit of spice and a thick crispy crust. The ham and cheese grits were like a savory dessert as well, filling in any room you may possibly have left in your stomach. We also splurged on dessert which did not disappoint. A jar of butterscotch pudding mousse was melt in your mouth delicious and the sweet toast dessert with gelato and toffee topping was equally as decadent. Will definitely go back..large portions of well thought out plates with great service and a simple, welcoming space.",5.0
"So, we came in last night for a late dinner, the place is nice over all but I wouldn't jump out the window by saying that it's GREAT by any means.  I love the decor it has a  rustic flair,wooden tables and chairs and the lighting was low and romantic. Our server was pleasant and did well with up-selling...-Blueberry Hill Muddle-delicious not strong at all but tasty down to the Un-muddled blueberries at the bottom.-Clementine-not strong at all...think Orangeade with a hint of alcohol...a small hint.-Charcuterie platter- The best part of it was the ham & pork cheek...everything else they could have kept.  I think we didn't mix the Brown Jam but I was fine with leaving it...I might try it again next time.  The crusty bread was TOO crusty for our liking we couldn't eat 2 slices of the 4 slices they served...these were practically croutons..without the salad.  WOMP WOMP-Eight Hour Oxtails-  Liked it...my family is from Jamaica and we take our Oxtails SERIOUSLY! These has a different taste but they were good, moist, flavorful but covered in some bread crumbs that i could have lived without. Nice presentation & taste-Extra Fancy Memphis Fried Chicken-It was tasty, well seasoned he liked it but it came on a slice of white bread(not impressed) and some pieces of lettuce(again, not impressed)... It was tasty but again...nothing to write home about.-Whipped Potatoes with Scallion Butter- It was good but not really worth finishing to me...I've had better-Flageolet & Ham dish-It was LACED with salt and was deemed inedible...too salty for any human trying to avoid hypertension or a stroke.Overall it was a nice dining experience, I just know what not to order next time around.Happy Yelping!",3.0
"Came back Saturday night for dinner and everything was amazing! One of the partners, Alicia, was warm, welcoming, and just the nicest host. She really showed that they care about their customers.The food was so delicious and everything was cooked well. The anchovy toast was simple and good. The country ham was buttery and went so well with the toast. The crab spaghetti was full of crab and was buttery goodness. I had the trout, which was good, but the skin was a bit of a turn-off and would probably have been better if it was crisp. But I'll let that slide because it was a great meal overall.",5.0
"We went to Marietta's Friday night, as a group of 3. It was the second time I had been there - first time was excellent, so i was excited to try some different dishes to see if it would stand up. And it absolutely did; in fact, it even exceeded my high expectations!We shared the smoked whitefish and fried green tomatoes, both of which were awesome. I had the mushroom spaetzel, which was absolutely incredible. The other two people both got the French roast chicken, and they could not stop raving about it. Throw in some delicious cocktails, and we had just a phenomenal meal and night.  Cannot wait to go back and continue making my way through the menu!",5.0
Great brunch! The pastrami benedict was awesome and the brussel sprouts were amazing. It wasn't even overly crowded.,4.0
"Pros: The food at brunch has been consistently very good! The fried chicken is delicious, smoked fish platter is solid, French toast is tasty too. Mehs: Service has varied from excellent to distracted/indifferent. Cons: music volume in bar area! Seating in the bar area tends to be way too loud at brunch, very loud music (typically pop R&B) with bass tones bouncing off the brick walls into our heads - difficult to talk across a two-top table. The staff must like it loud as after we've asked one to turn it down another at the bar turns it back up. Hint for those who prefer to talk during the meal: we try to sit in the area facing the street corner which is lively with background noise but not overwhelming volume.",3.0

"I loved Marietta. I went last weekend for brunch with friends while in town and it was delicious. The food was great, ambiance was great, menu was great. Loved the look and feel of the place. The one thing holding this review back from 5 stars is the grumpy server. She did her job well, but frowned the whole time!",4.0
"Two things that differentiate a 3 from a 4 when it comes to brunch: you gotta have strong, powerfully flavored coffee. If you can't get that right, it's game over. Marietta excels in this department. Second is that you need a subtle twist on a traditional brunch dish. If I want eggs benedict, I'll buy the hollandaise from Trader Joe's and make it myself. I want to try something just a touch out of the norm. Cue Marietta's hash dishes. Thanks for sprinkling your own personality as a restaurant on what could could be just an interchangeable part in the brunch machine.",4.0

"As a former small business guy I have to say I have ultra respect for business that continue to strive for greatness.  Since Marietta has opened they have tweaked their menu, their cocktails and their wine list in the best possible way.  First few times we went it was good but kind of limiting.  Food we had this afternoon was fantastic.  They now have outdoor seating.  Changes in the wine list were seismic compared to the cocktail/bourbon/beer direction they had.  Our food was great.  Service was great. TV's are gone.  So many things have been fine tuned.  I have to say I'm very happy about every single change that has appeared at Marietta.  I hear that they will soon be open on Monday's and also for lunch which ups our options in the neighborhood.My hat is off to the staff and management for continuing to tweak the Marietta experience for us!***Also appreciated the music being played at a comfortable level for conversation.I'd give 'em a 5 but I want to go back a couple more times and I will for sure.",4.0
"Y'know, the other day some commentator mentioned ""all the four-star places"" on Yelp, so giving Marietta five instead of four stars must be some reaction to this grade inflation. Take it as motivation to go if you like what you see.The first visit was very good. The star was a whole crispy porgy.The second visit was better. Me and the daughter ate the Beet Salad with crunchy black quinoa, watercress, and lemon ricotta ($9, $5 on happy hour that evening); fried Long Island Whiting ($12); house smoked sausage on a bun with green tomato relish and grainy mustard ($6); and a summer corn side with cilantro and mayo ($5). Every dish was terrific. The beet salad is creative and delicious.BONUS: Good value!TIP: Beer prices are on the climb everywhere ($7 pints, ouch, but the quality is there)TIP: Happy hour - $2 off cocktails (which TIP: Fair A/C, but really what restaurant in the BK in a vintage building has Texas-type AC?",5.0
"Took the 'rents here when they were in town and had a great experience. Nice neighborhood vibe, no wait for a table and great prices.We really enjoyed everything we ordered -- the burratta was a nice balance of creamy cheese, salty anchovies and tapenade on a thick piece of toast and greens.The black rice ""surf and turf"" was so flavorful with octopus and 12 hour oxtail and a bit of crunch from cilantro sprouts on top. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist inside and the ham and cheese grits addictive. The blue crab spaghetti was very good as was a special that sort of a summer stew with vegetables and ricotta dumplings I believe.Can't wait to go back!",4.0
"Recently tried this place for dinner and was verrrrry pleasantly surprised. I'm not really a huge fan of the interior set up of the restaurant, which actually is what kept me from passing this place so frequently yet not giving it a chance. I felt like the best spot to sit was at their massive bar. Had the smoked whitefish salad which was out of this world, I could eat it every single day. The fried chicken and cheesy grits were also HEAVENLY. My friend and I ate every single piece of food that was given to us and probably could have done it all over again because it was just THAT good. This place is definitely a comfort food type of place where you just CANNOT go wrong.",4.0
"Excellent spot, great drinks, great food, diverse crowd and good music. I think the other spots they run are pretty bad, but this place is well-managed. Generally house cocktails are crap--there's a reason for the standards-- but this place is an exception. Burgers are flavorful, juicy, and the portion is healthy. Squid surf and turf was tasty and imaginative. Fried chicken is solid. Inside and outside seating. I've been twice and I'm looking forward to going back.",4.0

"Probably the worst restaurant experience and treatment of my life. This place isn't deserving of a long review so I'll try to keep it short. Basically, we complained about how terrible the service was after multiple incidents. We were not pushy at all; just told the manager that this level of service was unacceptable. The manager (red hair, glasses) proceeded to scream at the top of his lungs like a maniac in front of a full restaurant. He ordered us all to get out of his restaurant and leave, screaming the entire time. It was really a mind blowing experience and clearly this guy was projecting other problems in his life on to our group. Either way, I've never experienced anything quite like that, and this guy definitely deserves to be fired for treating anyone like that.",1.0
"I'm sold. This place is huge. No problem with seating. Attentive waiter. Chill atmosphere. Excellent food.  My girlfriend and I decided to split the fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, and grilled broccoli. That was a smart move. Tomatoes were cut into chunks, not slices and the batter was not too thick or thin. Perfect crunch and that ""comeback sauce"" earns it's name. The fried chicken was some of the best I've had in NYC along with the Dutch and the Brooklyn Star. Coating may be a bit thick for some people, but I was really into it. Comes with a side of slightly sweet honey toast and that ""comeback sauce"" with a small bottle of spicy vinegar. It was juicy (thanks to a lemon honey brine) and very flavorful. If you want a side, I'd suggest the grilled broccoli. It's really impressive. Smoked cod aioli was an interesting choice and it paid off. It was slight spicy, slightly smoky. Very satisfying all around. Didn't do dessert but the server was good enough to tell us about them when asked. Nothing too out of the ordinary: chocolate cake, butterscotch pudding, pistachio gelato; they all sounded good but the Drunk Toast interested me the most. Granola coated French toast, jack Daniels glaze, vanilla gelato. I'll be back for that. Drinks were moderately priced and well made. The ""muddles"" are the signature cocktails. Pretty good and made with Fresh fruits. I'd order those again. I'd recommend this place to just about anyone. Unless they hated excellent food and really attentive servers in a relaxing and chic environment. Then I would not. KT",5.0

If you've had the fried chicken at Peaches hothouse or Peaches you've had this fried chicken as  well ( yes, I know this is also owned by the same folks). I thought the lamb was too fatty to enjoy and the eggplant miso had a unsavory flavor to it. Couldn't stomach it. Overall the best thing about my meal was the mashed potatoes and broccoli.

I also had the corn which is like the Mexican corn on the cob with all that yummy stuff on it, the only difference is that the corn they serve here is de-cobbed (let's pretend that that is a real word). The corn is out of this world. They also have this calamari app that is super good. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good comfort food.

Had to request our drinks three times, food didn't arrive for 30 minutes and the person who originally served us even asked who took our order when we asked about it!  They charged for the complimentary bread and white bean hummus that they gave...not their best night I'm sure...Having said that the toast we ordered - the Japanese eggplant and the whitefish were so good. I'm sure our experience was not typical but unfortunately I'm unlikely to find out.",1.0

"Wow! Right by my apartment, and one of the many new additions to the neighborhood, I expected this brunch to be decent and satisfying but nothing special. I was wrong! It was delicious, and worth traveling for if you are out of the neighborhood. The poached eggs with my benedict were perfect, the fried chicken absolutely amazing, and I loved the salad dressing. The service was a little odd, although friendly -- but they still have some stuff to work out on that end. Also I had a hard time with the music's thumping bass, which they happily turned down but it was still a lot for 11am. But that food! I'll be back in a heartbeat.",5.0
"My new fave in Brooklyn. Such a great place, quiet and out of the way (though close to the G train so not inconvenient).

"Absolutely excellent.  Just moved into the area, and I came to lunch on moving day with my parents.  They each had a burger, which they absolutely raved about, and I had one of the rice bowls.  I am still dreaming about it, anxious to go again.  High quality, flavorful ingredients, nice layering - just excellent.  Oh and don't miss the fried green tomatoes.  Best I've had.  Lovely venue as well.  Highly recommend!",5.0
"I came here with my sistah friends for brunch. It was AHMAYZING!! The drink I had was tasty. The eggs were nice, fluffy n cheesy. But the grits are absolutely the BEST I have EVER had in a long time. The fried chicken was very juicy. It was good, but I'm also good with not having that when I return again.

"This. Is. Everything. ***I preface this review with the fact that the owners were treating my boyfriend and I after a horrific experience at one of their other restaurants.***However, this place is quite possibly the best restaurant in Brooklyn. I haven't had such an amazing meal in FOREVER and even LONGER since I had a great one in Brooklyn (Five Leaves...I miss you).We arrived earlier than we had planned and decided to get drinks at the bar. The bartender was sweet like the drinks, not saccharine-y or fake, but real, natural sweet. We had the Blueberry Hill, The Marietta and the special. All three drinks were FABULOUS!! In fact, we're going to suggest our friends use the Blueberry Hill as their wedding drink. We were able to snag a table outside and started with the special appetizer and the charcuterie. Hi, frog legs special? It was lovely to meet you, I only with you could have stayed longer. Fried perfectly crisp and tender inside with little grease and cilantro aioli...yes. The charcuterie...the liver mousse...and the brown jam...and the ham...sweet, lord, I just made myself salivate. They also sent us the beet salad which had quinoa and a lemony ricotta heaven going on. We died at the amazeballs of it all.Then, boyfriend's fried chicken and my blue crab spaghetti came out. I can't even explain what was happening in my dish. I was transported to an evening in Maryland cracking a thousand crabs on some outdoor deck...the smell was divine. I knew I was done after the first bite. I would absolutely have to eat every single morsel of food off the plate, no matter how full I felt. The pasta was perfectly al dente and dressed so elegantly - it wasn't heavy and the crab flavor really shined. And the fried chicken...which was a TAD salty (likely due to the brining of the chicken before it's fried) was divine. It was spicy in a beautiful black peppery way, not in an overheated Scoville unit through the roof kind of way. The meat was so juicy and rich on the inside it was like it had never met the crispy breaded skin it was wearing. AND THE SIDE OF CORN...buttery, cheesy, goodness. The inner child in me is crying wishing I had some right this second. After the entrees, we were stuffed beyond stuffed. And so happy. Quietly raving about the food together. Then the magic butterscotch incident happened. Our lovely waiter, TJ, brought out warm chocolate cake with ice cream (which was great in its own right, but overshadowed by it's partner in crime) and this gorgeous mason jar pot de creme looking thing. It was cappuccino colored and covered in chocolate shavings...and tasted like what I imagine rainbows would taste like if they could give their joyful selves up to be eaten. Thank you, thank you, Marietta! One of my favorite meals ever, and I cannot wait to go back.Side note: if you're looking for a quick bite, sit at the bar.

The LES benedict had a perfectly poached egg wrapped in a sleeping bag of the tastiest pastrami. The clincher was the bed of challah bread for it all to soak into. The Kale and Caraway really did the kale justice. As a semi-played out veg, I was impressed to see kale on the menu in a new way. The caraway cheese was melted just so and a perfect companion to bring everything together. It came with toast and I copied a guy at a neighboring table's technique of scooping the scramble on to the toast and eating it like that. Yum.The Ham scramble was also bomb. The ham was obviously the highlight, but I must say the eggs were perfectly cooked. Two of my dining companions had the Bloody Mary (so so, but they opted for the vodka instead of the Marietta way with mezcal which was probably it's undoing). I went for the Breakfast Club and I was not dissapointed - all of my favorite things - vodka, champagne and St Germain - in one perfect brunch cocktail.Marietta. Go.",5.0
Wow! I was so pleasantly surprised by our recent brunch experience that I feel obligated to write a rave review. Marietta is owned by the same Restaurant Group as the local Peaches and HotHouse (both equally delicious). The boyfriend and I live nearby and were in the mood for breakfast out. We arrived around 1:30pm on a Saturday and were promptly seated. The interior felt 'cool' - wood accents and warm ambiance. I ordered the Crispy Pork Shoulder and Sunny Eggs and my boyfriend got the Mushroom/Kale Benedict. Both were equally delicious and plentiful portions. This was a real treat and 5 steps above the usual brunch experience. I will definitely be back (perhaps for dinner next time).,5.0

"My wife was beyond excited to try this place, as fried green tomatoes is one of her favorite dishes. Well, it underwhelmed to say the least.

However, we also ordered the beet greens, and it was mostly kale. The waitress was swamped and we just ended up eating it.This place looks like you could get a good, even great meal - we just didn't. And the server wasn't bad, but she seemed spread far too thin. All of our food came out at the same exact time (4 dishes) and it was pretty inconvenient to eat on a small table (the actual plates themselves were very large.) There are just so many other places to eat in this neighborhood that if you don't crush it on your first go audition, you probably won't get a second try for a while. This barely got 3 stars.",3.0

"Holy foodie. Husband and I had heard about the burger at Borough, and were in a cab on our way there when Yelp steered us to Marietta instead (""Better drinks."").The menu is impossible, as everything sounds so delicious. We went a little crazy, so: menu, then service, then space.FOOD!1. Charcuterie sampler. -- ""Brown Jam"" -- ridiculous potion of creamed chopped pork, pork fat, salt, pepper, crack cocaine. Served in a little mason jar I wanted to kidnap and take home with me. Too salty to finish, but unbelievably, inexplicably delicious.-- Chicken Liver mousse, served with side dollop of molasses. Husband loved this - I felt meh. (Tasted like what I imagine spam tastes like.)-- Pork Cheek, with dollop of ridiculous yum grainy mustard. I'd never had cheek, so was leery, but it's delicious. The cheek comes as a flat disc, that seems like the particle board of pork parts-- comes apart easily into little charred chunks of yummy savory pork.-- Prosciutto with benne (sesame) butter.  This was just your average yummy prosciutto, so paled in comparison to everything else for me. BUT, our server (Jessica) was fantastic, and schooled on the history of benne as the African version of sesame when I asked.2. Fried green tomatoes, with chow chow, vidalia onions, and ""comeback"" sauce. So: fried green tomatoes as chunks, not slices, which makes for a juicier bite. Great. Onions, okay fine. Chow Chow? CHOW CHOW.  Pickled things (cauliflower? onions?), pickled really well, spicy like, and so very delicious. The Comeback sauce shows up in a few places on the menu, and should -- a really nicely spiced, flavorful, thick version of something along the lines of Frank's Red Hot / Red Devil.3. ""Surf and Turf."" OH MY GOD.  We almost didn't order this, but opted for it over the Ham and cheese grits at the last minute. The winner, hands down. Oxtail and calamari in a squid ink risotto. Also with comeback sauce. I have no idea -- the oxtail in the risotto with a little comeback sauce just blew my mind -- all these different flavors happening, and the richness of the oxtail with the spice and ink and sauce... It really was unbelievably savory and delicious.4. The burger, with cheek. I am a burger snob, and this one was $12, served with no sides, which normally would put me off it. (Husband and I agreed to split it so we could order a dozen other things, so I wasn't too bothered about lack of sides.) But it, too, was inexplicably delicious. They don't ask for a doneness preference, so it just arrived perfectly cooked, salted, we added ketchup. Really really moist, great burger to bun proportions, and strangely didn't get sidelined by all the other wondrous things we were eating.And then cocktails. The Peaches crew does liquor well, so I didn't expect any less. There are a couple of ways to go at it -- Muddles vs. Cocktails. At Marietta, ""cocktails"" is shorthand for ""more straight up liquor"", while Muddles are more for ""fruity drink.""  They do fancy craft cocktail ice, so drinks don't water down. I forget names, but: Cocktails: 1. Cognac + honey syrup / sage / absinthe. This comes as cognac on the rocks with a shot of the honey/absinthe/sage mix. Apparently, you're supposed to shoot the shot, and sip the cognac. Me, being confused, dumped the shot in the rocks glass. Still a very strong drink with a lot of really nice herbal flavors happening.2. Gin + honey syrup + ...some other stuff. Apricot liquer maybe? Apricot garnish. In a rocks glass with a couple big cubes. It was a little more subtle than ingredients would lead you to believe.3. Blueberry Hill Muddle. Don't recall ingredients here. Husband had this -- said it was fruity, nice flavor, not overpowering and not weak. Served in a mason jar.4. Junebug. Strawberry, prosecco, maybe vodka/gin? I forget. Yummy, buzzy, really really good and would probably stick with this one when we go back. Served in a highball with a single very fancy tall ice cube. I'm such a sucker. SERVICE!I'm biased, because it turns out an old friend of mine works here, so we got the insider treatment. But: for a Friday night at 9:30, we were seated immediately, served immediately, food was very quick, runners, bussers, and servers alike seemed happy to be there. My friend has worked many a restaurant job, and I've definitely seen her disgruntled and unhappy with management and restaurant philosophy. I've always sort of wondered about the Peaches empire, and she raved. She said the owners know what they're doing, have gotten managers invested in the restaurant's success, and the servers feel taken care of and respected. That means a lot to me, and I think leads to a more successful, comfortable dining experience.SPACE! They've opened two spaces up for this spot, and while I don't think the space is used totally economically, it adds a comfortable layer. Seating isn't cramped, the sports-bar-like bar is away from dining, and unlike Hot House, you can breathe here.100% win.",5.0
"I've been slacking on writing reviews on Yelp for a bit.  But snap out of the laziness to write a review for Marietta.  Came here this past Saturday with a group of 6 people.  Few people showed up at 9 and hung out at the bar and when the rest of the folks showed up at 9:30 we were seated immediately.  It was actually pretty empty... only about 2 other tables were there. the decor is super rustic/woody/cute.  wooden tables and chairs/stools.  the service was ahhhmazing! some of the best service i've ever received (even in comparison to some super fancy 4* restaurants).  our waitress was lauren and she great!  super quick with bringing out stuff as requested, all the dishes she recommended was delish and super friendly.and the most important part... the food.   probably would describe it as a fancier spin on comfort food.  i don't think i've ever been to a restaurant where i loved everything i ate... that was 'til Marietta.  felt like we tried almost everything on the menu lol.  Anchovy Toast, Fried Green Tomatoes, Rib And Tail, Chicken And Duck Liver Mousse (so good we ordered a 2nd plate), corn (forgot what it was called), kale salad, Crispy Fried Whiting , Honey-Jack ' Drunk Toast', seafood risotto and over course... the Extra Fancy Memphis Fried Chicken .  not going to review everything ... but everything we had was good.  the fried chicken-- skin was so crispy, not greasy and seasoned well.  meat was moist.  and the vinegar sauce that comes with it is so freakin' good.before i end this review, i also have to write how amazing the drinks are! the drinks and the bartender.  the boys loved their signature drink 'Marietta'.  and i love loved loved the drink with the frozen cube of grapefruit.  forgot the name of it--- back something believe.  and the drink with the fresh muddled blueberries was yummy too.  the drinks were so good that we ended up going back to the bar after dinner for more drinks.  and it was even better b/c there's a happy hour special 30mins before close.  $2 off drinks.will def be coming back here.",5.0
This is the one place I see giving Peaches Hothouse competition with their fried chicken. I came here when the place was known as Grand Dakar. It has since changed in cuisine and ambiance. It feels much more spacious. It is a comfortable and relaxed place to visit with a date or friends. The food here is great. The drinks are on point. The staff is very friendly. I will visit them again hopefully before the end of the summer.,4.0
"Visiting from MD, wanted to check out the restaurant, since it's under the same umbrella as Peaches and The Smoke House.  This is definite a more upscale restaurant compared to those two. Cocktails are definitely worth every penny. For dinner, I had the whiting sandwich which was tasty. However, I was disappointed with the slaw it came with. My husband had the ribeye topped with oxtail. I enjoyed that more than the whiting sandwich. We didn't stay for dessert and although the food was good; there are so many great restaurants in BK, I wouldn't go back for dinner, but definitely for drinks and music!",4.0
"Simply the worst service ever. I normally do not post reviews of restaurants I do not like. I usually just don't go back and leave it at that, but after my 3rd attempt at Marietta's, I have to speak up and warn people. The service is painfully slow. I go early to dinner, around 5:30pm, because I have a 4 year old, and there are very few people in the restaurant, so I'm not sure why they are so slow. Let me say that I usually like a longer dinner and am not in a rush by any means. But an hour and a half to two hours for a family of three is ridiculous. We ordered a single butterscotch pudding, which took them 25 min. to bring to the table. PUDDING!!! Sad really because the food is pretty good, but they need to get their shit together on the service end. You've been warned.",1.0
Cocktails are really nice. And not too pricey. Muddle me some blueberries and bourbon! The fried green tomatoes are delicious and nothing bad can be said about the fried chicken. MMMMMMMM.,4.0
"Fried. Chicken. Wow. This is the fried chicken I've been looking for. Somehow the seasoning seeps deep into the meat so even if you don't get a bite of the crunchy skin you still get a mouthful of yummy. My girlfriend had the risotto which was also fantastic. The portions are on the small size, but the prices are modest so it's hard to complain. The drinks were also great. I had the Bad Habit which substitutes a frozen grapefruit cube for ice. We went on a Sunday night fairly early. The ambiance is chill, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. It started to fill up around 8, but it looks like this place might still be flying under the radar so I'd check it out before the word gets out.",5.0
"I had their asparagus and snap pea lunch bowl which came with kale, mushroom, rice, pecorino and other goodness. One of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. My partner had the fried chicken sandwich and loved it. Service was good too and prices are reasonable. I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"My wife was beyond excited to try this place, as fried green tomatoes is one of her favorite dishes. Well, it underwhelmed to say the least. They came out like chicken mcnugget/hockey pucks. 1/5To be fair, the quinoa/beet appetizer was very good, 4/5, and the trout was decent 3.5/5. However, we also ordered the beet greens, and it was mostly kale. The waitress was swamped and we just ended up eating it.This place looks like you could get a good, even great meal - we just didn't. And the server wasn't bad, but she seemed spread far too thin. All of our food came out at the same exact time (4 dishes) and it was pretty inconvenient to eat on a small table (the actual plates themselves were very large.) There are just so many other places to eat in this neighborhood that if you don't crush it on your first go audition, you probably won't get a second try for a while. This barely got 3 stars.",3.0
"Excellent staff, pretty good food. The smoked and cured meats are fantastic. Nice ambience",4.0
"Holy foodie. Husband and I had heard about the burger at Borough, and were in a cab on our way there when Yelp steered us to Marietta instead (""Better drinks."").The menu is impossible, as everything sounds so delicious. We went a little crazy, so: menu, then service, then space.FOOD!1. Charcuterie sampler. -- ""Brown Jam"" -- ridiculous potion of creamed chopped pork, pork fat, salt, pepper, crack cocaine. Served in a little mason jar I wanted to kidnap and take home with me. Too salty to finish, but unbelievably, inexplicably delicious.-- Chicken Liver mousse, served with side dollop of molasses. Husband loved this - I felt meh. (Tasted like what I imagine spam tastes like.)-- Pork Cheek, with dollop of ridiculous yum grainy mustard. I'd never had cheek, so was leery, but it's delicious. The cheek comes as a flat disc, that seems like the particle board of pork parts-- comes apart easily into little charred chunks of yummy savory pork.-- Prosciutto with benne (sesame) butter.  This was just your average yummy prosciutto, so paled in comparison to everything else for me. BUT, our server (Jessica) was fantastic, and schooled on the history of benne as the African version of sesame when I asked.2. Fried green tomatoes, with chow chow, vidalia onions, and ""comeback"" sauce. So: fried green tomatoes as chunks, not slices, which makes for a juicier bite. Great. Onions, okay fine. Chow Chow? CHOW CHOW.  Pickled things (cauliflower? onions?), pickled really well, spicy like, and so very delicious. The Comeback sauce shows up in a few places on the menu, and should -- a really nicely spiced, flavorful, thick version of something along the lines of Frank's Red Hot / Red Devil.3. ""Surf and Turf."" OH MY GOD.  We almost didn't order this, but opted for it over the Ham and cheese grits at the last minute. The winner, hands down. Oxtail and calamari in a squid ink risotto. Also with comeback sauce. I have no idea -- the oxtail in the risotto with a little comeback sauce just blew my mind -- all these different flavors happening, and the richness of the oxtail with the spice and ink and sauce... It really was unbelievably savory and delicious.4. The burger, with cheek. I am a burger snob, and this one was $12, served with no sides, which normally would put me off it. (Husband and I agreed to split it so we could order a dozen other things, so I wasn't too bothered about lack of sides.) But it, too, was inexplicably delicious. They don't ask for a doneness preference, so it just arrived perfectly cooked, salted, we added ketchup. Really really moist, great burger to bun proportions, and strangely didn't get sidelined by all the other wondrous things we were eating.And then cocktails. The Peaches crew does liquor well, so I didn't expect any less. There are a couple of ways to go at it -- Muddles vs. Cocktails. At Marietta, ""cocktails"" is shorthand for ""more straight up liquor"", while Muddles are more for ""fruity drink.""  They do fancy craft cocktail ice, so drinks don't water down. I forget names, but: Cocktails: 1. Cognac + honey syrup / sage / absinthe. This comes as cognac on the rocks with a shot of the honey/absinthe/sage mix. Apparently, you're supposed to shoot the shot, and sip the cognac. Me, being confused, dumped the shot in the rocks glass. Still a very strong drink with a lot of really nice herbal flavors happening.2. Gin + honey syrup + ...some other stuff. Apricot liquer maybe? Apricot garnish. In a rocks glass with a couple big cubes. It was a little more subtle than ingredients would lead you to believe.3. Blueberry Hill Muddle. Don't recall ingredients here. Husband had this -- said it was fruity, nice flavor, not overpowering and not weak. Served in a mason jar.4. Junebug. Strawberry, prosecco, maybe vodka/gin? I forget. Yummy, buzzy, really really good and would probably stick with this one when we go back. Served in a highball with a single very fancy tall ice cube. I'm such a sucker. SERVICE!I'm biased, because it turns out an old friend of mine works here, so we got the insider treatment. But: for a Friday night at 9:30, we were seated immediately, served immediately, food was very quick, runners, bussers, and servers alike seemed happy to be there. My friend has worked many a restaurant job, and I've definitely seen her disgruntled and unhappy with management and restaurant philosophy. I've always sort of wondered about the Peaches empire, and she raved. She said the owners know what they're doing, have gotten managers invested in the restaurant's success, and the servers feel taken care of and respected. That means a lot to me, and I think leads to a more successful, comfortable dining experience.SPACE! They've opened two spaces up for this spot, and while I don't think the space is used totally economically, it adds a comfortable layer. Seating isn't cramped, the sports-bar-like bar is away from dining, and unlike Hot House, you can breathe here.100% win.",5.0

The benedict came with a super salty ham/prosciutto which overpowered the dish for me (this is coming from a serious salt fiend), and lacked the decadent spillage of hollandaise that I crave, but it was still damn good and the spring greens that came with it were awesomely crunchy and fresh. Our cocktails were so amazing that we didn't hesitate to order a second round.

"Ok.. Should have actually been 4.5 stars, but yelp is so limited. Arrived at 9:30 on Saturday night, no one in dining room, but bar and bar tables were all full.

"New Yorkers thrive off of convenience, yet rarely ""just settle"" on quality. A while ago I dined at Marietta, a part of the restaurant group that brought us Peaches, Peaches Hot House and Little Brother Barbeque in Brooklyn. The reputations of the latter mentioned all live up to high expectation, so the bar was set high for the more ""sophisticated"" sibling of the bunch. Dinner was my first experience. I was greeted by a charming, young girl who seated us, and served our table. The rest of me recollection consists of: an intolerable irony Chicken and Duck Liver Mousse, tiny entrée portions, and worse, a mistakenly served entrée to our table. Told to keep the mistake and after my correct dish finally arrived, I was promptly charged for both entrees. ""A bad night perhaps?"" I thought. Let's try brunch, brunch can't go wrong! So, on a recent Sunday I thought to give Marietta another try. The sun was bright and my stomach as empty. Most of the restaurant was empty, too. The man at the door sandwiched us between two other parties and dropped the menus. We proceeded to order drinks with our server. Unlimited coffee was 3.50, a special blend created by Stone Street Coffee in Gowanus. Meanwhile, Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice was 4.50, not unlimited. The food arrived fast, which was a delight for my hunger, however the lukewarm temperatures were displeasing to the tongue. Baked Grits and Shrimp was a hearty portion, tasty and served with very fresh salad greens. The shared Granola French Toast with Blueberry Compote and Ricotta was good, but had an odd texture. A far better improvement over our dinner service, but for being in the neighborhood it leaves me with the dilemma of convenience over quality.

The drinks are interesting as is the food. Service was great and very knowledgeable.

Been to this fine establishment several times within a one month period. A clear indication that I like. The cuisine has southern and caribbean influences such as their whole porgy with hot peppers reminiscent of an escoveitch. Other standouts were the slow cooked oxtail and that delicious fried chicken. Portions on the chicken were generous one night then significantly smaller on the most recent visit so they need to work on their consistency. Hope they bring back Not Another Kale Salad which was a great appetite opener. All in all a comfortable neighborhood feel and good solid food.,4.0
"I definitely need to update my last review! We went back to Marietta last night and they have definitely made staffing improvements. They were still a little slow on the welcoming/seating, but after that service was very attentive and friendly. There seem to be plenty of servers & bussers now to keep things running smoothly.All of the food we tried was great -- fried green tomatoes (still good!), fried chicken, the burger (better than I remembered), and sides of brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. The only thing I still think is kind of strange about Marietta is that everything is basically ""a la carte"" but it's not really clear on the menu. They also *don't* include fries with the burger, or even have them listed anywhere on the menu, but the first thing the waiter said when I ordered it was ""it doesn't come with fries...do you want to order fries?"" Weird!Now that the service issues are worked out, I'm looking forward to coming back to Marietta. it's a nice neighborhood spot for good food and drinks in a low-key setting.",4.0

I came in for a few afternoon drinks to sit in the giant windows that face the street for a perfect daydrinking spot. The menu both for food as well as drinks is upscale, affordable, and interesting Had 2 of the cocktails, one called the storyville which had muddled apricot and came in a decent sized mason jar, and another off of the brunch cocktail menu that had tarragon infused St. Germaine. The drinks are interesting as is the food. Service was great and very knowledgeable. The place was PACKED but absolutely no problem getting a set since there are so many in here, and service was fast. If you are looking for a great place in the neighborhood that you can show off to your fancy Manhattan friends, then this would be a safe bet .",5.0
"Food was tasty, but probably worst dining experience I've ever had. The service was so bad.",1.0
Been to this fine establishment several times within a one month period. A clear indication that I like. The cuisine has southern and caribbean influences such as their whole porgy with hot peppers reminiscent of an escoveitch. Other standouts were the slow cooked oxtail and that delicious fried chicken. Portions on the chicken were generous one night then significantly smaller on the most recent visit so they need to work on their consistency. Hope they bring back Not Another Kale Salad which was a great appetite opener. All in all a comfortable neighborhood feel and good solid food.,4.0
"I definitely need to update my last review! We went back to Marietta last night and they have definitely made staffing improvements. They were still a little slow on the welcoming/seating, but after that service was very attentive and friendly. There seem to be plenty of servers & bussers now to keep things running smoothly.All of the food we tried was great -- fried green tomatoes (still good!), fried chicken, the burger (better than I remembered), and sides of brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. The only thing I still think is kind of strange about Marietta is that everything is basically ""a la carte"" but it's not really clear on the menu. They also *don't* include fries with the burger, or even have them listed anywhere on the menu, but the first thing the waiter said when I ordered it was ""it doesn't come with fries...do you want to order fries?"" Weird!Now that the service issues are worked out, I'm looking forward to coming back to Marietta. it's a nice neighborhood spot for good food and drinks in a low-key setting.",4.0
"Have come here twice. Once on a date and once with the family. Each time we were wanting delicious comfort food, but didn't want that greasy-why-did-i-just-eat-that? feeling.  Awesome food, definitely try the fried chicken and the fried green tomatoes!",5.0
"There are a few things I'm not too keen on about this restaurant, the price is a little high and it's probably a little too ""Brooklyn"" but none of that matters and it still gets 5 stars as the fried chicken is outstanding. I think that with The Dutch and Pies and Thighs it's the best fried chicken in New York. ...oh and also my wife and sister-in-law liked whatever food it was that they had.",5.0

Our waitress was not the least bit friendly & at times acted as if we were bothering her. First bad sign!

Then the burgers which came without fries (just un american to serve a burger with no fries) so fries were ordered Al a carte & came out ice cold... Burgers came without requested condiments & were cold when we finally got the condiments. Finally, I asked for a manager because the service was just horrendous & he took the shrimp & grits back & reheated the burger. He tried to apologize but a lil to late & most of the food was lousy. Also, the fresh squeezed orange juice ordered at $4.50 each was Tropicana which I saw myself was poured from the carton & the coffee was served cold. Well, I purchased a birthday cake for my son but never cut it because the manager tried to make up for our horrible meal by bringing us comped desserts to little to late.

That fried chicken was incredibly delicious.  I seriously entertained the idea of gnawing on the bones too.  It's that good.  Although the scanty few watercress served with the chicken made me sad.  Could be a bit more generous with the side of greens just so it would look like such an after thought.  The mashed potatoes with scallion butter was very yummy too.  The burger was also a hit.  Server was friendly and dining room with the large windows made for good people watching.,4.0

"So far so good! Have been in the neighborhood long enough to have visited the previous incarnation of Grand Dakar. These guys have done wonders with the space - it's beautiful, much more open, and I love the bar and separate dining room. Now onto the food: I must say, I came hear because of the rumors flying about the insanely high-quality fried chicken being served at this place. Well, after going to town on their 3-piece fried chicken dinner last night, I can prove the rumors correct. I love Peaches Hothouse chicken, no doubt, but this chicken is pretty darn good! If the spicyness of Peaches' chicken is a bit overwhelming for you, this is possibly the next best thing. The skin was sooo incredibly crispy and flavorful, the chicken was so moist but not so much as to make the skin eventually soggy, and I love the vinegar and spicy sauce it comes with! My one gripe: no sides. It comes with a little arugula salad, but that's it. Even one side would have been nice. However, even a side, that plus the chicken will set you back $18-ish dollars, which is not too shabby in my book. This is a great new addition to the neighborhood, and I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu offerings!",4.0

Apparently they were bottomless, but we were never offered a refill or told any such thing. Rip off. Terrible service, bad attitudes, ridiculous prices. Another hipster nightmare destroying Brooklyn.",1.0
"The ambiance of Marietta is lovely. Very modern and hip vibe. Love the music....reminds me of a lot of restaurants in Atlanta!! The food is great. I'll have to go back again to try more dishes....the chicken was good, but this review is solely for the cheese grits. Ahem......these are the BEST CHEESE GRITS I HAVE EVER HAD!! I've been living in the south for almost 7 years, so I can pretty much say, with certainty, that I have a good grasp on what is good southern cuisine......cheese grits....made me want to go hug the person in the back!! Great job Marietta!! Great job!!",4.0
"Can't say enough about this place.  I've always been a fan of their sister restaurants.  But at Marietta they really take it to another level.  In essence its southern food done with high end technique.  House cure proscuitto and other in house made meats are amazing.  Upon my last visit I had the trout dish which was perfectly cooked, light but feeling.  Really fun cocktails and a small but growing wine list.  The price point at Mariettas make it one of the best bargains in NY.",5.0
"my husband and i came here for dinner last week. service was nice. my hubs had the fried chicken and i had the steak.  my steak was good but a bit too salty. my hubs liked the fried chicken but wasn't wowed by it. the flavors were there but definitely something missing.  also, the ambiance feels a bit cold and too open...could def be a lot cozier. other than that, we'll definitely be back though.",4.0
"Some in our party were hungry (me), and others in our party just wanted something to nibble on with their drinks. Marietta did a good job of satisfying us all. I had the soft-shell crab special, which was deliciously salty. My friends loved the quail, and we all enjoyed the smoky pork shoulder rillette thing (it was called something else on the menu). Only the fried green tomatoes were a little too deep-fried for our liking. The service was fine, none of the delays or issues reported elsewhere. Can't wait to come back and have a cocktail or two. A great addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
That fried chicken was incredibly delicious.  I seriously entertained the idea of gnawing on the bones too.  It's that good.  Although the scanty few watercress served with the chicken made me sad.  Could be a bit more generous with the side of greens just so it would look like such an after thought.  The mashed potatoes with scallion butter was very yummy too.  The burger was also a hit.  Server was friendly and dining room with the large windows made for good people watching.,4.0
"The food BLEW MY MIND! Literally the best thing I have tasted in the Bedford-Stuyvesant/Clinton Hill area. Throughout the entire meal, my fiance and I thought ""I wish we could have our wedding here!"" We will definitely visit again!",5.0
"So far so good! Have been in the neighborhood long enough to have visited the previous incarnation of Grand Dakar. These guys have done wonders with the space - it's beautiful, much more open, and I love the bar and separate dining room. Now onto the food: I must say, I came hear because of the rumors flying about the insanely high-quality fried chicken being served at this place. Well, after going to town on their 3-piece fried chicken dinner last night, I can prove the rumors correct. I love Peaches Hothouse chicken, no doubt, but this chicken is pretty darn good! If the spicyness of Peaches' chicken is a bit overwhelming for you, this is possibly the next best thing. The skin was sooo incredibly crispy and flavorful, the chicken was so moist but not so much as to make the skin eventually soggy, and I love the vinegar and spicy sauce it comes with! My one gripe: no sides. It comes with a little arugula salad, but that's it. Even one side would have been nice. However, even a side, that plus the chicken will set you back $18-ish dollars, which is not too shabby in my book. This is a great new addition to the neighborhood, and I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu offerings!",4.0
