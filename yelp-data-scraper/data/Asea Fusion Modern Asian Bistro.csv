I came here with a bunch of friends for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated promptly. We ordered a bunch of apps and sushi rolls which all tasted good but nothing spectacular.  The two most memorable dishes was the calamari appetizer and the ramen.One huge disappointment though was the omakase. I shared it with a friend and the fish was sliced paper thin. It wasn't cheap either. I never had a omakase like that before. It's definitely not worth it here.,3.0
I live in walking distance of this joint so when I saw a sushi place in Sunset Park with such gold ratings I knew I had to jump on it! Inside it's warm and inviting which set the evening off on the right foot. My boyfriend and I came in for dinner and were seated right away. We were the only patrons for a few minutes but that changed as the dinner crowd began to roll in. The service was super friendly and attentive. The free sake with the Yelp check-in is always a nice touch. I started off with the Kani salad which was good but I've had better. We both ordered a few rolls. All the rolls were awesome! On the particular night we went in the specialty rolls were half off. I don't remember why exactly but we didn't question it. Everything was fresh and delicious. I know I absolutely can't wait to return!,5.0
"This is a little hidden gem. Getting off at the 9th Ave stop isn't something I want to necessarily do again...but I am happy I came to Asea. My friend and I made a reservation and I got there a little early...about an hour. They seated me and brought some tea over. LOVE the tea. I sat and read my book until my friend arrived. The place wasn't packed by any means, but it was steady. Ambiance was nice. They started decorating around 9PM for the Chinese New Year.Anyway, we both did the ""check-in"" offer - a free little bottle of sake. It was such a nice start! As an appetizer, I got the Kani salad - very good :) $5.As an entree, I had the spider roll ($9) and one of their regular rolls, spicy crabmeat. I enjoyed everything and service was decent. I won't go out of my way to come back, but if I'm in the area I definitely will!",4.0
Cool bar with 3 high def big screen tv's!  Atmosphere is great.  Clean and updated decor.  Most importantly the Raman is BOMB!  As good as Ippudo.  I can't wait to go back.,5.0
"I came here with some girlfriends on a Sunday night and it was pretty quite. There weren't that many people inside. The waitress I had was really nice and patient and answered any questions we asked. My favorite dish was the sushi pizza, soooo good and interesting. The presentation of the dishes were really nice, my friend ordered the salmon tartar and it came with a dolphin drawn with spicy mayo sauce. The pad Thai was good too, spicier than most places and a generous portion. Overall I have no complaints and I would come back again because the food was good and the service was great.",4.0
"We were looking forward to the BBQ lamb but unfortunately they were out of lamb........however Each dish we had was delicious; Japanese Pizza  (minus eel/added salmon), spicy shrimp roll, shrimp tempura roll, hibachi shrimp,nagamaki roll, sweet potatoe roll, peanut avocado roll, avocado cucumber roll and green tea tempura ice cream...oh yea we redeemed a coupon for a hot bottle of sake....woo hoo!!!The service was great with the exception of our bill being brought to us before we asked for it.",4.0
"To preface, I mostly knew of this place because my coworkers usually ordered from here at night. They used to preface that the food was really good. I decided to come here for myself! A note: parking is a bit difficult to find in this area. But worth it to come! The venue itself is quite airy and nice, and I like how much ample seating they have. Very comfy and cozy while trendy at the same time. Love it! Now to the important food: Live Uni: MY GOSH. I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE EVERYDAY. It's not available everyday and I would recommend calling to see if you can reserve it for when you come for dinner, but my gosh is it worth it. We got these large pieces of uni in the actual sea urchin shell. It made ms really happy. Worth it. Japanese Pizza: Delicious. I love how they incorporate so many different elements in this dish. I would say it is worth it to get and it is a great dish to share. Mussels: Meh at best. I wasn't as impressed with it. The sauce was ok, but I've had better mussels. Spider Roll: Nice large pieces of freshly fried crab. I usually am not a huge fan of spider rolls but I'm convinced this place does it right. Spicy Salmon Roll: My staple that I love to get at any restaurant. YUM. Eel Avocado: I was not expecting much from this roll, but was pleasantly surprised. Everything is amazingly nice and fresh. Yellowtail scallion roll: It's ok at best, not terrible but not amazing. Seafood Chow Fun : The noodles are pretty tasty - for those who know, the chow fun is  cooked 'wet' so be aware of that. I felt this was cooked with great flavor. Yum. Green Tea Crepe Cake: They told it is is Lady M cake. I've never had Lady M because I've never gotten around to going, but MAN IS THIS DELICIOUS. I was stupid-full when I finished my meal yet somehow 'trudged' through this cake and finished it. I really enjoyed coming to this place so don't hesitate to come for dinner! Not to mention, Yelp Check-in right now gives you FREE HOT SAKE.",4.0
"I thought this would be a trendy looking Asian Fusion restaurant. But, there is nothing to boast about the décor. I thought they would have really good sushi from the pictures I see on yelp, so I came try it out. We got this thick menu and I have to say they have such an extensive list of dishes to offer. I came for sushi, so we ordered the Love Cruise for two, which comes with 10 pieces of sushi, 16 pieces of sashimi with a california roll and a dragon roll for $50. The presentation was okay. I didn't think it was all that pretty. One of the sashimi was cut weirdly. I never seen it cut like that. It was too thick to eat. I don't know why it wasn't cut like regular sashimi. But the other cuts were fine and they are generous with the cuts. The fish was okay. What really disappointed me was the rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice. It taste like regular rice and it wasn't made right. I like my rice done right as much as decent quality fish. The rice ruined the fish for me. It just didn't taste good together.",3.0

"I was really surprised we loved this place. Now my only experience is with delivery but I can tell you food gets delivered piping hot and fresh and super fast.

The spice level is just right, all ingredients are fresh, and was just overall delicious. I strongly recommend mixing the soup and noodles immediately when it arrives that way you can let it sit for a while and cool down + build flavor. Also it was so filling. The pad thai was good, not the best we've had but good nonetheless. The Shumai appetizer was worth it.",4.0

"Duchess status! I found this place about two month ago and have been coming here about once a week or more if I'm on a sushi kick. Glad it's good because there are no other japanese spots in the area to satisfy the craving. It's located in a very quiet area, although just a block over from the wonderful Ba Xuyen! I've never actually sat down since the walk here and back takes up about half my lunch break but I've never had any issues with placing orders to go or for delivery. The young lady who's put in my order a half dozen times so far has been polite and pleasant.I've gotten the 3 roll special each time which comes with soup or salad and includes all the standard hand rolls to choose from. After tax, it is only a whopping $10.90. Their spicy tuna, spicy salmon and eel avocado are delicious and fresh. Big rolls. No issues. They also offer box sets and hibachi for lunch specials if you're not in it for sushi.The regular menu is extensive with your typical Asian fusion offerings -- noodles, wok specials, curries, yakitori, etc. Unfortunately, I probably won't get to try any since the lunch special is too good to pass.Delivery minimum is $10.

My sister ordered the Seafood Udon; I managed to sample it and it was pretty good. For dessert, my sister pressured me to get the Fried Ice Cream, even though I was already filled up from the entree. I was reluctant to order more, but after eating the Fried Ice Cream, I was ready to order another one.Overall, it was a great experience.

"We came here on a Christmas night, and there was a lot of people there, all the tables were full. As a result, our food came rather slowly as I imagined the kitchen must have been swamped with food orders. Our server was a guy wearing a Santa hat (well they all were wearing Santa hats for the night), and he didn't speak much Cantonese, despite the restaurant being located close to the Brooklyn Chinatown. All the menus were in English, although I seem to recall they used to have bilingual menus when I came here the first time. The tea we were given was a bit funky tasting, a little bitter and not the usual flavor I would have expected in tea, but it didn't seem to be bad for my stomach, so I drank most of it. The waiters did not come back to refill our tea cups until almost the end of the meal though. I ordered a Thai iced tea, and it was decent, although it had a strange taste to it as well, stronger than the Thai iced teas I have had before elsewhere, but it wasn't all too unpleasant to drink.For our appetizers, we ordered the popcorn chicken, the wallop fries, and the Japanese pizza. The popcorn chicken was nothing special, just tasted of normal fried chicken, and it did not come with a dipping sauce, which could have made it taste great. The wallop fries were not impressive on first taste, and it came with a wasabi mayo sauce that I was not a fan of, as I don't like mayonnaise. However, after eating the Japanese pizza, the fries seemed to taste better and had a slightly spicy taste to them which was pleasant. The Japanese pizza was disappointing as it came cold and it wasn't particularly flavorful this visit. I had it before on my first time here, and it was really good that time -- sort of like a flat Takoyaki, with really great sauce. However, on this visit, the sauce wasn't really there, they only drizzled a little bit on each one (there were four of them) and it couldn't be detected.After the appetizers, we waited a long time for the next round of food. As an apology, the waiter came back with a free plate of seaweed salad for us to munch on while we waited. I wasn't a fan of it as it only tasted of oily seaweed strips, but my mom quite liked it. For entrees, we ordered the chicken rendang, seafood pineapple rice, a spicy seafood ramen, and the Malaysian stir-fried noodle that I couldn't remember the name of. The chicken rendang dish was one of the most disappointing dishes of the night, the chicken was tough and the curry was nonexistent, it was just barely there to cover the pieces of dry chicken. I would definitely not order that again. The seafood pineapple rice came in a real pineapple and it was great, extremely flavorful, although the pineapple chunks were a little sour for my liking. When mixed with the chicken rendang, the chicken became more tolerable to eat, I guess, so it saved the other dish. The most delicious dish was the Malaysian stir-fried noodle, which although it wasn't spicy, was extremely flavorful and I think I could have eaten the whole plate if I weren't stuffed from all the other food that had come out earlier. It tasted better than the Pad Thai I have had here, and I would definitely order this noodle again when I revisit. The seafood ramen came in a really big bowl, and it must have been good, as my cousin ate the whole bowl in one sitting and finished it all without sharing it! Overall, this place serves great food and I would definitely come back again in the future. The service is on the slower side though, even when there aren't many people (on my first visit, we were the only ones in the restaurant besides one other table). The waiters aren't the most attentive either, and most of them don't speak Cantonese fluently, but their English is fine.",4.0

You don't need to pay a whole lot for a full stomach, drinks are reasonable and always something new to try on the menu (plum wine is highly recommended) Great place for a date. Good for kids who love trying new and exotic foods hand down.. One of the best in Brooklyn",5.0

"We came here on a Christmas night, and there was a lot of people there, all the tables were full. As a result, our food came rather slowly as I imagined the kitchen must have been swamped with food orders. Our server was a guy wearing a Santa hat (well they all were wearing Santa hats for the night), and he didn't speak much Cantonese, despite the restaurant being located close to the Brooklyn Chinatown. All the menus were in English, although I seem to recall they used to have bilingual menus when I came here the first time. The tea we were given was a bit funky tasting, a little bitter and not the usual flavor I would have expected in tea, but it didn't seem to be bad for my stomach, so I drank most of it. The waiters did not come back to refill our tea cups until almost the end of the meal though. I ordered a Thai iced tea, and it was decent, although it had a strange taste to it as well, stronger than the Thai iced teas I have had before elsewhere, but it wasn't all too unpleasant to drink.For our appetizers, we ordered the popcorn chicken, the wallop fries, and the Japanese pizza. The popcorn chicken was nothing special, just tasted of normal fried chicken, and it did not come with a dipping sauce, which could have made it taste great. The wallop fries were not impressive on first taste, and it came with a wasabi mayo sauce that I was not a fan of, as I don't like mayonnaise. However, after eating the Japanese pizza, the fries seemed to taste better and had a slightly spicy taste to them which was pleasant. The Japanese pizza was disappointing as it came cold and it wasn't particularly flavorful this visit. I had it before on my first time here, and it was really good that time -- sort of like a flat Takoyaki, with really great sauce. However, on this visit, the sauce wasn't really there, they only drizzled a little bit on each one (there were four of them) and it couldn't be detected.After the appetizers, we waited a long time for the next round of food. As an apology, the waiter came back with a free plate of seaweed salad for us to munch on while we waited. I wasn't a fan of it as it only tasted of oily seaweed strips, but my mom quite liked it. For entrees, we ordered the chicken rendang, seafood pineapple rice, a spicy seafood ramen, and the Malaysian stir-fried noodle that I couldn't remember the name of. The chicken rendang dish was one of the most disappointing dishes of the night, the chicken was tough and the curry was nonexistent, it was just barely there to cover the pieces of dry chicken. I would definitely not order that again. The seafood pineapple rice came in a real pineapple and it was great, extremely flavorful, although the pineapple chunks were a little sour for my liking. When mixed with the chicken rendang, the chicken became more tolerable to eat, I guess, so it saved the other dish. The most delicious dish was the Malaysian stir-fried noodle, which although it wasn't spicy, was extremely flavorful and I think I could have eaten the whole plate if I weren't stuffed from all the other food that had come out earlier. It tasted better than the Pad Thai I have had here, and I would definitely order this noodle again when I revisit. The seafood ramen came in a really big bowl, and it must have been good, as my cousin ate the whole bowl in one sitting and finished it all without sharing it! Overall, this place serves great food and I would definitely come back again in the future. The service is on the slower side though, even when there aren't many people (on my first visit, we were the only ones in the restaurant besides one other table). The waiters aren't the most attentive either, and most of them don't speak Cantonese fluently, but their English is fine.",4.0

I was only there to grab a bite or two so I ordered two items: the coconut shrimp appetizer and the tom yum goong soup. The coconut shrimp was to die for! They are ginormous! You can taste the coconut flakes if you don't use the sauce.As for the tom yum goong soup it was horrible. It tasted like drinking a bottle of heated hot sauce. So after taking a few sips hoping it would get better I had to push it aside. Without telling the waitress she immediately knew I was not pleased with the soup so she took it off the bill without being asked. Great customer service!!!!,4.0

Pad Thai was cold coming out of the kitchen, think they waited for my shrimp tempura and noodle turned cold.

"I went here three times during my month-long stay because they have an awesome happy hour, asian beer selection (~$4!), and epic FRIES.

They are perfectly crispy yet soft on the inside, and are dusted with just the right amount of chili powder. The kicker is the WASABI AIOLI. Very creative and highly addicting. every weeknight has a different special for $1/$2. The sushi was standard/mediocre, but they have a large menu with items representing multiple asian countries, so there's something for everyone.

"This place advertises pretty heavily in the Chinese newspapers/magazines that my parents read, so we decided to stop by on a Saturday night for dinner.

Weirdest thing was that there were two ""valets"" out front, and maybe 2 or 3 tables inside with people.Anyway, the good:-the mutton curry (lamb) was really good. Pretty spicy too.-waitresses are attentive and keep your tea refilled.-there are two big TVs, good for sports.-reasonably priced dishes all around. Lots of selection as well.The bad:-the sexy roll had some weird soy paper wrapping, which made it taste really weird.

Great place to watch games too, by the way, in the back bar area.

"2 stars because the food is pretty good.  Not great, but in a neighborhood with so few restaurants one has to take what she can get.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which was supposed to be an Australian red $20.  The server informed us that the owner had to run across the street to get the bottle of wine and he came back with a $5 dollar bottle of California red.  Don't worry they still charged us 20 for the crappiest bottle they could find at the liquor store.  Ok, so we did have our baby with us, but he is really good in public.  No fussing, screaming or throwing things.  I know all parents say their baby is good - but ours literally didn't make a peep.  The owner made two negative comments to us about our kid and glared at us the entire time we ate.   We only came to this place bc our neighbors raved about it, I guess they are really nice, but only if you're a straight couple without a biracial baby.",2.0
"Is Asea charmingly nestled/tucked in the heart of so-and-so quaint Manhattan neighborhood? No. It's on a particularly bare section of Brooklyn's 8th Avenue, with a price point that doesn't fit the affordability of the surrounding area.Does it have hype surrounding it and shouts concerning whether said hype is deserved? No. The food is neither nuanced nor intellectually relevant, and it will never deserve a writeup in the Times. Just like most other Asian fusion restaurants, the huge menu could stand to be much more concise....And yet, Asea is far from bad! True, people who don't live nearby won't miss much by disregarding it as another soulless fusion spot, but we were pleasantly surprised by the taste and especially presentation of the dishes. It means something when chefs look like they give a crap about the food they're putting out.The mutton curry was actually pretty good, almost not gamey enough, but with a dry, dense heat from the curry. Whole grilled squid was beautifully presented and cooked just right. Roti canai again came with a strong curry, and they may even have made the roti from scratch! Yakitori are 6 sticks for $12, which is reasonable. Even these skewers have been ""fusion""ized by marinating and seasoning Chinese-style, and each was meatier (good) and saltier (bad) than you'd find at a typical izakaya.The interior is clean and modern, albeit in a generic way. Facebook check-in gets you free edamame, but the waitress brought us one anyway sans social media whoring. Service was attentive and happy to make suggestions. The most dissatisfying aspect of our meal was the price ($15 for curry in this neighborhood?!). I won't come back too soon because I'm not looking to have $20+pp meals in Sunset Park, but for cheap sake and yakitori, it's an option. Asea is the only spot in the immediate area open until midnight - impressive when even the best banh mi in the borough (yelp.com/biz/ba-xuyen-br…) two blocks away closes at 6:30pm every day.",4.0

The squid was delicious and a must have and so is the calamari bowl. We also had some skewers (sausage, bacon roll, and lamb); my favorite were the bacon & lamb. Then our dragon roll came and it was yummy too. Next up was the house special udon dish which was pretty satisfying. We ended with fried ice cream and it was huge! I wish we just ordered one because I almost died finishing mine. Every dish we had were presented to us with so much thought and effort; they all looked pretty.

"in terms of the food, it's only ok, far from good. what annoys me is that, i ordered the food to be delivered at 5pm today, and I got out of the subway at 4:40, then I received the call from the delivery person, he yelled at me for not picking up the phone, then i saw him standing at the gate of my neighbor's (he even couldn't find the right building number) and yelled out loud that people passing by even stared at us. I explained, but he kept yelling and saying he didn't know, then I saw that on the confirmation sheet he brought, there's a note in HUGE BOLD FONT saying that it should be delivered at 5pm!

"Some of these 1 star reviews are ridiculous. At least rate the food and service but then giving it a 1 star because they hand out menus? Are you serious..

Their Malaysian Curry Seafood curry Laksa for $7 on another. Asea also has a bar, with the Sushi area right in front and 4 large TVs hanging.

Another 1 star complained about not being able to swipe credit card because they were short. There has to be a cutoff somewhere.. Why not just say ""Oh I am only a $1 short"" or $2.. Most places on 8th ave don't even offer Credit payment and yet people whine about not being able to make the $10 minimum and then getting a reason for it?

"This place is great! The service is wonderful, decor is nice and the restroom is fancy. My boyfriend loved this place so much that he said he'd make a yelp just to rate this place! :) Haha, knowing him, I just decided to rate it for him. We had BBQ squid and calamari as appetizers. The squid was delicious and a must have and so is the calamari bowl. We also had some skewers (sausage, bacon roll, and lamb); my favorite were the bacon & lamb. Then our dragon roll came and it was yummy too. Next up was the house special udon dish which was pretty satisfying. We ended with fried ice cream and it was huge! I wish we just ordered one because I almost died finishing mine. Every dish we had were presented to us with so much thought and effort; they all looked pretty. Overall the food and service here is just amazing and I was in a food coma after. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! :D",5.0
"I love the lunch sets from here and the delivery man is very nice. Their sushi is alright and it is worth it with their lunch sets. Teriyaki and Katsu is also very good.

"Ordered delivery for dinner from here on Seamless. Got two special rolls, seaweed salad, avocado salad, pad thai, and two bubble teas. I was a bit shocked when it came to $66, which was more than I was expecting to pay in this neighborhood. The Winter Roll and the other (I forgot the name) were delicious, better quality than I had expected from a pan-Asian place and not your run of the mill sushi rolls. The $11 pad Thai was nothing special. Skip the avocado salad which is a bunch of iceberg lettuce with paper thin slices of avocado and standard sushi bar ginger dressing. Seaweed salad is also standard issue. Both were $6 each. Bubble tea was fine but also $6 each. My global assessment is that this place is a good option for delivery sushi in Sunset Park but expect Manhattan prices for dinner menu and other menu items are just alright, so don't give in to the impulse to add on items.",3.0

"Relatively new spot on 8ave that a lot of my friends have been going here to try out since it's suppose to be the local fresh sushi and food spot.So PROS:Good service- they were really nice and our server did a good job at just going ahead explaining thoroughly about the specials and recommending what's good.Food- I actually really love their yakitoris! My boyfriend loved how the lamb&pork belly tasted as I thought the bacon enoki was grilled perfectly... We may actually think it's better than the ones in St.Marks and all of 8ave skewer spots, but go when they have it for $1(mon&tues) cause it's normally $5 here!CONS:They ran out on one of my fave sashimis, sweet shrimp & live uni. So we ought to get the regular uni from Cali and Japanese uni, which of course the Japanese one is more expensive and tastes sweeter but their regular uni did not melt in your mouth whatsoever, also leaving the briney taste on your tongue... That is not fresh uni. The next crazy thing, we asked for was two piece of toro(tuna fatty belly) and they brought it to us seared... Who on earth ever sears such great delicate Kobe piece of the sea? Toro must be eaten raw. So we sent that back, few minutes later he said they're all out on toro, automatically we knew they had to do a bogus move by searing it because the toro didn't look or tasted fresh at all. Then the live scallop, it wasn't decent sized chunk of scallops but very thinly sliced which is actually not the way I prefer it. Also their pricing is priced pretty weird and off, really expensive for certain things.I love white tuna, which didn't fail nor did their foie gras. Everything else was pretty good or ok, nothing to really run home about. Maybe their sashimi wasn't fresh because I did go on an off day(Monday) for dinner and I'm still actually willing to give this spot a second chance for their sushi but I'd defiantly would come by on their $1 special yakitori just to dine in and have that haha!",3.0

It's good to have fresh firm fish than soggy mush that isnt fresh. Though sometimes during the lunch hour there's a line for pickup.

"I had the baby yellowtail sushi special, live Uni and Chirashi, which also came with Miso Soup. My guest tried to order the Beef Yakitori, and they ran out of it. Then, she tried to order the live scallops, and they were also out of that. So she ordered the Salmon skin hand roll.The miso soup arrived, and there was no complaints about that. The baby yellowtail sushi special was delicious. It came on a bed of lettuce, avocado slices and sprouts. It had a light dressing on it and did not need any additional sauces. All the flavored worked really well together. With that being said, they kept the lettuce as one big piece, which made it really inconvenient to eat. We had to request for a knife to cut through the large chunk of lettuce and then the entire dish fell apart. It would have been much better if the lettuce was already sliced or shredded. We tried to recommend that to the owner, but he didn't seem to care.The live Uni came, and that was presentation at its best!  They had the Uni meat positioned over a green leafy vegetable on top of the Uni shell. This was my first experience with live Uni, but I really enjoyed it!  My guests have had it before elsewhere and said that it was definitely the largest slivers of Uni that they have ever seen!  So at a price of $22 for this large Uni, they were very pleased.I did enjoy the Chirashi sushi entree. It's a great value, as you get a nice sized bowl of rice topped with three different pickled vegetables, ginger, and 3 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of yellowtail, 2 pieces of tuna and 2 pieces of cooked octopus... All for $15!  It was very filling!Then they brought out the salmon skin sushi roll for my guest... Did you catch that mistake?  She ordered the hand roll and now had to wait another 15 minutes for the correct salmon skin hand roll to arrive. Another guest had ordered the hibachi salmon with fried rice, and they brought her meal out with steamed rice.Then we tried to order the Green Tea Crepe Cake and were really excited about it because we were told by the waiter that it was from Lady M's Confections. Only to discover a few minutes later that they had run out of it.Overall, the food was actually really good here. But the service and lack of ""inventory"" was sub-par this time around.",3.0

We ended up on Yakitori night, which entails $1 yakitori (although each order comes with two, so technically $2 for 2 yakitori).  For the price, they were absolutely delicious- if you're feeling adventurous, the smelt is very well flavored and comes with a belly full of eggs (freaked us out too at first).  The staff were very pleasant, and happy to make accommodations for gluten-free requests (celiac in the party).  Indoor decor was great, and quite upscale.  The menu was large- between sampling various dishes from take-out and now from eating in, I'd say customers are safe eating pretty much anything.  Thai curries are delicious (a bit sweet at times), sushi is fresh (not especially large, though), and yakitori is well-seasoned.",4.0
"My bf's mom and I came to have dinner tonight.This place looks fairly new and the deco is very nice. We have ordered bacon with enoki and bacon with scallop as appitzier. We also have Teriyaki steak and Thai basil chicken. All the food taste pretty good, although it is just a tad little sweet (just my opinion). Overall we were very please with the experience, the servers are very friendly. I didnt get a chance to try their seafood and sushi, since my bf's mom is allergic to shellfish. I will definately come back again. I am glad this part of Brooklyn has a place with nice deco to dine.P.s. Toro, the manager gave us a discount after we mentioned about Yelp. That's very nice.",4.0
"I had the baby yellowtail sushi special, live Uni and Chirashi, which also came with Miso Soup. My guest tried to order the Beef Yakitori, and they ran out of it. Then, she tried to order the live scallops, and they were also out of that. So she ordered the Salmon skin hand roll.The miso soup arrived, and there was no complaints about that. The baby yellowtail sushi special was delicious. It came on a bed of lettuce, avocado slices and sprouts. It had a light dressing on it and did not need any additional sauces. All the flavored worked really well together. With that being said, they kept the lettuce as one big piece, which made it really inconvenient to eat. We had to request for a knife to cut through the large chunk of lettuce and then the entire dish fell apart. It would have been much better if the lettuce was already sliced or shredded. We tried to recommend that to the owner, but he didn't seem to care.The live Uni came, and that was presentation at its best!  They had the Uni meat positioned over a green leafy vegetable on top of the Uni shell. This was my first experience with live Uni, but I really enjoyed it!  My guests have had it before elsewhere and said that it was definitely the largest slivers of Uni that they have ever seen!  So at a price of $22 for this large Uni, they were very pleased.I did enjoy the Chirashi sushi entree. It's a great value, as you get a nice sized bowl of rice topped with three different pickled vegetables, ginger, and 3 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of yellowtail, 2 pieces of tuna and 2 pieces of cooked octopus... All for $15!  It was very filling!Then they brought out the salmon skin sushi roll for my guest... Did you catch that mistake?  She ordered the hand roll and now had to wait another 15 minutes for the correct salmon skin hand roll to arrive. Another guest had ordered the hibachi salmon with fried rice, and they brought her meal out with steamed rice.Then we tried to order the Green Tea Crepe Cake and were really excited about it because we were told by the waiter that it was from Lady M's Confections. Only to discover a few minutes later that they had run out of it.Overall, the food was actually really good here. But the service and lack of ""inventory"" was sub-par this time around.",3.0

"I'm so glad I found this place! I'm not a Brooklyn girl-but whenever I dine in at a Japanese restaurant in brooklyn, every sushi restaurant is a disappointment.

Food arrived promptly and they serve a generous amount of everything!I've never seen a restaurant that serves this much kani salad! The squid appetizer is crispy and the flavor is on point.

"ATTENTION: DO NOT BE DECEIVED BY THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. I came to this place during my lunch hour based on the rave reviews on Yelp. I was greeted by an indifferent, but not impolite, host. I ordered the chicken pad thai which came up to $9.80 after tax. I tried to pay with my credit card but was told that it must be $10.00 or more. Seriously? 20 cents is a big deal?(Sidebar: Merchants aren't allowed to demand a minimum charge for credit card use. It's a violation of the merchant agreement with the credit card companies.)Anyway, I ordered jasmine rice for $1 to get above the $10 mark. I got back to my work place and took about four bites of the pad thai before discarding it. It was by far the WORST pad thai I had ever had. Both the chicken and noodles were very dry and tasted like leftovers from the day before. There was no flavor and no spice, despite it being advertised as spicy. $11 gone down the drain. I was so upset about it that I decided to create a Yelp account just so I could write this dump of a place a negative review.

"A cute and pretty decent spot at the very faaarrr end of the Asian-Chinese 8th Avenue.I had previously heard about this place from friends and when there was a Groupon deal offered, I bought it and decided to have a dinner date with one of my friends. It was a first experience here for both my friend and I.First, let's talk about the Groupon, it offered 2 beers/wines, 2 special rolls and a ramen/noodle/udon, etc. I forgot the price I paid for this Groupon though. I felt that they were accommodating to our request of the Groupon cuz we did not want to drink beer/wine so we each ordered one of the regular drinks on the menu. They offered a wide range of drinks, from smoothie to slushies to bubble teas and some regular drinks. If you see the drink menu has such a big variety, that would mean that the food menu would be a huge variety too, and you're right! There's a variety of different dishes on the menu. All the food sounded so appetizing! My friend and I ordered a sushi pizza as a starter then 2 special rolls, which were all very delicious and unique. The stir-fried udon we ordered to share was good portion and well-sauced! Definitely a good amount of food to try.I would like to come back in the future. The only downside would be that it is rather far from the main 8th Avenue area, and if you're walking, it's a work out for your legs! If you're lucky enough to catch the bus, that'd be great too.

He would explain what's inside each dish and I enjoyed it. However, ordering from seamless seems totally different. The delivery guy called me and screamed DELIVERY then hung up real quick. Seems like he didn't like his job or hate the restaurant. He did not even bother to give me any eye contact or smile.

"This is the best sushi place in Sunset Park. We actually order delivery from them all the time, but I think we are just going to go to the restaurant from now on because it's such a nice place. The sashimi was great, the rolls were delish, the sake was fair (could be very good, but I don't have a palate developed for it yet, so I'm not sure), the service was fabulous, and the owner was there hovering in the room to make sure everything was perfect. I had the white tuna mango roll which was really great, goes down like butter. The spicy tuna is my fave, and the philadelphia roll was nice and smokey. Also you get a free edamame appetizer when you check in and like on Facebook, so we did that too.My sister came in from out of town so there were four of us, and the owner would check in at every service check-point to make sure we were happy. He ended up giving us a free large sake. Also we got the mochi for dessert, which was fresh (I hate it when you order mochi and it's got freezer burn), so every course was very good. When we finished our meal we moved to the bar, and had some top notch cocktails and ethnic beers, and he ended up giving us a free bottle of wine to take to go. This guy knows how to get his customers to return. And who wouldn't want to, with that yummo sushi?!Also, the restaurant itself is super clean, super updated, the bathrooms were well maintained (which is a pet peeve of mine), and everyone is just really nice.

"Asea is a seriously unique spot for the 8th Ave. stretch in Chinatown in that it's the only place you can head out to eat for a evening that feels special.

(FYI, have had extremely mediocre sushi delivery experiences, and an absolutely excellent lunch bento delivery. Do with that what you will.)The yakitori is delicious. I've had the squid, beef and pork belly. All cooked perfectly with great flavor. Definitely don't hesitate to order a heap of these with some appetizers for a meal.The Malaysian Seafood Udon Curry soup was CRAZY GOOD. The broth reminded me of my favorite spicy miso ramen dish in the city, and the seafood was perfect. Giant portion and quality for $9. I will be coming back for this bowl.Masaman curry was a bit of a disappointment, though not because it tasted bad. It was just different than other Masamans I've had, so it didn't exactly hit the spot. I've had a General Tso bento lunch box that was super good, as well. The Tso was leaps and bounds better than most of the Chinese delivery restos around here, and all of the bento components were spot on.And don't forget dessert. The green tea ice cream and fried bananas is something serious. Mochi is also good. I'm a big fan of Asea because of delicious food, nice ambiance and really great service.

"First things first.  I already consider myself a regular and I've only been here once.  I'll tell you why.I will admit it, I did not expect this place to be a 5 star review.  I've been to enough 8th Avenue restaurants to know to keep my expectations low-- especially one that spends  money on decor?  red flags all over.  Passing by the restaurant, I couldn't help but be drawn by the Sushi/Yakitori/Asian fusion menu mix.  After seeing Dorie L first review and a 5 star at that--- I had to give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.Service-  Being a new restaurant, business is still kind of slow but waiters were still very energetic and hospitable.  One of the waitresses (Mei), even introduced herself and spoke fluent English...  is it true?  am I still on 8th ave???  Drink-  BYOB.  Go across the street.  Coors light 6 pack cans cost $5.  Nuff said.  Food- I had a hard week of work so I wanted to reward myself with a decent meal.  I wanted to give Asea a fair shot so I made it a point to order as many things as I could.Here's how my meal went.Appetizers- 1) Yakitori-  these on average costs about $1.50-$2.  Bacon Enoki, Beef Shorts Ribs, Fish Ball, Octopus Ball, Chicken Gizzard and Chicken Skin.  The Chicken Skin is where's it at!  Beef Short Ribs were juicy-- Bacon Enoki were good and so were the Fish balls.  Expect about 3 pieces each.  The Octopus ball and Chicken Gizzards were just ok.2) Pangkor Wings- $5 were a little pricey for 4 wings but they were flavorful and big wings.  They are flavored with 5 spice-- similar to the Yakitori flavor.  3) Wallop Fries- I like these!  They're just usual freezer thin fries but coated in a spicy chili powder and served with a nice serving of wasabi mayo.  I love wasabi mayo.  I love chili powder.  I love fries.  Win!Entrees-You're probably thinking... what about the sushi?  So I had to order sushi.  1) Alaskan Roll $4- a little too much cucumber and not enough salmon.  2) Sushi Lovers Entree- 4 pieces of Salmon Nigiri and 1 Salmon Avocado roll for $11.  You save $1 as opposed to ordering a la carte.  The rolls were decent.  If you've had Sushi on 86th street you know what to expect.  There's a good balance between rice and fish--- I liked it a lot, I almost ordered a second.Noodles-1) Malaysian Curry Laksa-  Very flavorful, 4 pieces of shrimp, 4 pieces of fish cake, sliced egg and a coconut milk based spicy curry broth.  This bowl of noodles was slamming.  For $7, it's not the cheapest bowl of noodles but feels comparable to stuff I would pay for at my other fave malay restaurants.  I tried my best-- all this food was split amongst two ppl.  I will need to come back to try the rest of the menu.  Think Thai, Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese and Japanese fusion.  I can come back every day!  maybe... The owner, Eddie, greeted me on my way out.  I told him I will be back, gave him a pat on the back and said good job and meant it.",5.0
Wow! This is actually my 1st time in life reading such a review!We all know Asea fusion can considered as the new Number 1 place to go for everyone in the neighborhood...most of my friends love it! So do i  i go there often... the wait staff there actually do sit talk and drink with customer( but never to me). i call this service as warm and friendly...  this is y they still able to survive in such quiet location.Ya is true... sometime the restaurant will get a bit noisy...

"How do I review this place? I'll get the most impressive things out of the way first. The service was exceptional. Staff was friendly and helpful all around. Decor is modern Asian restaurant lounge, done well, and the background music fit the vibe perfectly. Asea Asian Fusion is also an outstanding value - $43 before tip bought us the level of pleasure we.re used to paying three times as much for. BYOB helps, as does a location in an unfashionable stretch of 8th Ave. It's a very happy surprise of a restaurant, manned by a crew of people eager to share their own excitement about the place.The concept is less impressive on the surface. Here ""Asian Fusion"" is less a hybrid cuisine of Asian influence, and more a menu consisting of mainly Japanese and Chinese dishes alongside various pan-Asian greatest hits. Some dishes are Americanized, others less so. That might truly be the ""fusion"" angle. Surprising thing is how well the concept works. If you drop any prejudice you have you can piece together an exciting meal here more or less at random. Pleasure doesn't have to make sense.Our meal began with a complimentary salad from the sushi chefs. It was a lovely mix of raw salmon, cucumber, mango and seasoned seaweed. Balanced and delicious, although I could have done without the mayo, which was thankfully applied lightly. Our yakitori orders arrived next. The short rib, sausage (seasoned hot dog) and chain sausage (fish sausage) were satisfying. Would order again. The chicken skin was even better (obscene). The whole grilled squid app is a deal at $7, even if the sauce is a little on the sweet side. Portion size is generous. A live scallop arrived with a light shining from the bottom of the bowl upon thin slices of the meat over lemon, and the sex organ over a seaweed salad. A steal at $13, yet no comparison to an $80 scallop I had in Japan. Unnecessary comparison, though. It was a lovely dish for $13, and the yuzu dipping sauce was spot on.Next was the sushi. The chefs recommended the yellowfin and the tuna, so we split rolls of each. If you're looking for fresh fish in south Brooklyn here it is. If you're looking for top quality fish you'll have to drop much more money elsewhere.And you probably won't be doing it in south Brooklyn. Think good pedestrian sushi and you'll be satisfied here.Bottom line:Service: 5/5Decor and vibe: 5/5Value: 5/5Food: 4/5Concept: ???Loved the experience, and will be back.",4.0

"My husband and I were headed home after a long walk with our dog. We were hungry, but weren't craving the standard 8th avenue fare - Chinese or Vietnamese.

The miso soup tastes much like the soup I've had everywhere - it could be from a mix for all I know. The rolls were a nice size - not generous, but not stingy either. I got the avocado, eel avocado, and spicy shrimp. My husband liked the spicy shrimp very much and I enjoyed the rest. Not bad. We'll definitely be back when I get the itch again.

"First things first.  I already consider myself a regular and I've only been here once.  I'll tell you why.I will admit it, I did not expect this place to be a 5 star review.  I've been to enough 8th Avenue restaurants to know to keep my expectations low-- especially one that spends  money on decor?  red flags all over.  Passing by the restaurant, I couldn't help but be drawn by the Sushi/Yakitori/Asian fusion menu mix.  After seeing Dorie L first review and a 5 star at that--- I had to give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.Service-  Being a new restaurant, business is still kind of slow but waiters were still very energetic and hospitable.  One of the waitresses (Mei), even introduced herself and spoke fluent English...  is it true?  am I still on 8th ave???  Drink-  BYOB.  Go across the street.  Coors light 6 pack cans cost $5.  Nuff said.  Food- I had a hard week of work so I wanted to reward myself with a decent meal.  I wanted to give Asea a fair shot so I made it a point to order as many things as I could.Here's how my meal went.Appetizers- 1) Yakitori-  these on average costs about $1.50-$2.  Bacon Enoki, Beef Shorts Ribs, Fish Ball, Octopus Ball, Chicken Gizzard and Chicken Skin.  The Chicken Skin is where's it at!  Beef Short Ribs were juicy-- Bacon Enoki were good and so were the Fish balls.  Expect about 3 pieces each.  The Octopus ball and Chicken Gizzards were just ok.2) Pangkor Wings- $5 were a little pricey for 4 wings but they were flavorful and big wings.  They are flavored with 5 spice-- similar to the Yakitori flavor.  3) Wallop Fries- I like these!  They're just usual freezer thin fries but coated in a spicy chili powder and served with a nice serving of wasabi mayo.  I love wasabi mayo.  I love chili powder.  I love fries.  Win!Entrees-You're probably thinking... what about the sushi?  So I had to order sushi.  1) Alaskan Roll $4- a little too much cucumber and not enough salmon.  2) Sushi Lovers Entree- 4 pieces of Salmon Nigiri and 1 Salmon Avocado roll for $11.  You save $1 as opposed to ordering a la carte.  The rolls were decent.  If you've had Sushi on 86th street you know what to expect.  There's a good balance between rice and fish--- I liked it a lot, I almost ordered a second.Noodles-1) Malaysian Curry Laksa-  Very flavorful, 4 pieces of shrimp, 4 pieces of fish cake, sliced egg and a coconut milk based spicy curry broth.  This bowl of noodles was slamming.  For $7, it's not the cheapest bowl of noodles but feels comparable to stuff I would pay for at my other fave malay restaurants.  I tried my best-- all this food was split amongst two ppl.  I will need to come back to try the rest of the menu.  Think Thai, Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese and Japanese fusion.  I can come back every day!  maybe... The owner, Eddie, greeted me on my way out.  I told him I will be back, gave him a pat on the back and said good job and meant it.",5.0

For the idiot who asked who goes to this place on Sunday at 12...A PERSON WHO WANTED TO EAT...and don't tell me give the guy a break.  The idiot of a owner gives me an attitude for WANTING to try his place out.  Good job asshole.  Still not going to try this place because of how I was treated when I wanted to try the assholes restaurant.   Who knows how I would have been treated if I went in there.,1.0
"I was pondering whether I should give them 4 or 5 stars. The staff were exceptional. They were attentive, helpful, and had really good recommendations.

We had the ""sexy"" and ""volcano"" rolls, and the sushi chef was not shy about topping on the fish and caviar. Their fried cheese cake was EXCELLENT, highly recommend, and so was their Kani Salad. The only thing though, was that their yakatori was disappointing. They're not a specialty Japanese restaurant, so I don't want to hold it against them.

"We shamefully order from here about once a week. It's reliable. The menu is large and we mostly stick to sushi + malaysian seafood curry + yakitori, so I can't speak for the hibachi. I will say that we sometimes have gotten other curries, and they're not bad, but nothing stands out like the malaysian one. Also, for yakitori the Pacific saury is pretty unbeatable so long as you are okay with possibly eating the eyes of a fish because you're distracted watching Game of Thrones.

I went here for lunch one day with my friend, and got the shrimp hibachi lunch box for around 10$ and changed my mind. I loved it!! Shrimp was great it came with fried rice, two rolls, and veggies. Great, cheap lunch where youd never expect it. Service was great as well! Sushi was OK.",4.0
Great food and great service. Definitely worth trying the Kim Chi Fried Rice and Mee Siam Noodles. Deelish!,4.0
"We shamefully order from here about once a week. It's reliable. The menu is large and we mostly stick to sushi + malaysian seafood curry + yakitori, so I can't speak for the hibachi. I will say that we sometimes have gotten other curries, and they're not bad, but nothing stands out like the malaysian one. Also, for yakitori the Pacific saury is pretty unbeatable so long as you are okay with possibly eating the eyes of a fish because you're distracted watching Game of Thrones. It's literally a small grilled fish cut in half with the front end on one stick and the back end on another.",5.0
"We used to hike all the way to 86th Street and 5th Avenue (Bay Ridge) for sushi or order from some restaurant in Prospect Park. We are so glad that a sushi place has opened up in our neighborhood. We are always skeptical, being that we've had our fair share of 'bad' sushi - too little fish, too much rice for example.We order or eat out from this restaurant at least once a week, and it has been consistent so far. The portions are good, and the prices are decent. We've had everything from the Love Cruise to the salmon teriyaki lunchbox to the Malaysian Curry Seafood Noodle. No complaints here... in fact, it is the highlight of ending a tiring workweek.",4.0
"Finally a decent non-Japanese Japanese restaurant I can go near my house!!! Very unique, and great service!!!! I heard soooo much about this place and live right by it but never had the chance to visit.Finally had the chance to drop by with my wife. A long day of shopping and decided something close to where I live, I thought I would give it a try. I seriously did not expect much. Was I wrong!!!! The atmosphere was a bit loud but food, service and staffs were awesome!!!!We ordered yakitori which was decent and some vegetable dishes which was great along with some rolls. Couldn't eat much raw food since my wife is pregnant. But ramen noodles at the end was great!!! The owner at end came to our table asking how everything was and we had a blast of laughter and fun talks!!!! He was very friendly  and positive attitude of making things better in the restaurant. He even bought me a round of drinks with some hot sake!!!Price, food, decor, interior and service all score great!!!!! Want to visit Lunch for and see how how they serve lunch and give them the last 5th star!!!!",4.0
"i really wanted to love this place, but i guess it didn't last longer than a month. i've came to asea so many times, it's uncountable. the quality of the sushi and the taste of it flunctuates so often, i don't even know if i like it that much anymore. sometimes in the eel avocado rolls, the avocados almost the entire roll and you can barely see the eel. the salmon has a very bland and not fresh taste. the rolls are subpar. sometimes the wasabi is very strong and other times its not. the only thing i'm never disappointed in is the salad and its sauce. it's the only salad sauce i eat (my dad made it to the exact same taste before asea opened), and it never fails to taste good. i thought i found a secret inexpensive yet amazing tasting sushi place in brooklyn, but i'll have to look around some more.",3.0
I like this place so much.!!! I came here yesterday night for dinner with my friends and I know this place from facebook and yelp. Those food are fresh and the price isn't high. I want to try the live uni but they all sold out yesterday so I'll come back nxt time for it! I highly recommend this place to those people who want to get fresh and great sushi!!!,5.0
Okay let's just say that this place is new so some stuff might be a bit pricey. But my recommenation is these shots of egg yolk. they taste really...unique. Though I have to put it out there that the yolks are raw. Also their special roll is great. I think that one has coconut in it.,4.0
"Delicious food, good portions, fresh fish, but deliveryman is  very rude. He begged for a tips. When I gave him 2$ he counted them and began to mutter something in Chinese. I was disappointed.",4.0
"Everyone who's ever eaten will tell you I'm not just picky, but snotty and a b____ about my food and tonight I begrudgingly agreed to get this for take out since it just opened in our neighborhood. I got the yaki soba with shrimp and it was... SPECTACULAR! I cleaned my plate. We got gyoza as well, also delicious. The pad Thai my husband wasn't bad either, but for real- yaki soba from this place is the best I've had yet! I'm so glad this place opened",5.0
"Very tasty food, and great service. Love the recommendations by the waitress, May. Volcano rolls is my new fav!",5.0
"The sushi was okay but there are definitely cheaper and better options in brooklyn. Some of the rolls didn't hold up and fell apart and didn't have much of a flavor. Had the bacon scallop and chicken skin yakitori which were pretty decent. I would return to try more of the yakitori since they're fairly priced. Honestly the menu is too big for its own good, they should just get rid of the mediocre offerings.Their tap water was disgusting- did not taste like ny tap and we could taste it in the hot tea as well. The service was extremely slow. Waited like a hr just for 2 rolls. Friends' omakase was wrongly described (way smaller portion than informed). Waitress was apologetic but offered no solution. Seems like there's still a lot of kinks that needs to be worked out.",3.0
Maybe I just didn't get the right dish but I wasn't particularly impressed with the malaysian seafood curry. The service was excellent though and a friend vouches for it. If I'm back I'll try the sushi and see how it goes.,3.0
Asea is awesome.  The selection of several difference cuisines is wonderful.  The food is outstanding.  The service was what you expect from a much more expensive restaurant.  As is the care in decorating this lovely restaurant.  The calamari was the best I have ever tasted and the octopus the most tender.  Yakitori was a wonderful appetizer before the great sushi.  A wonderful restaurant with very reasonable prices = easy to get there from Park SlopeMarie M.,5.0

This place sucks. When you ask for suggestion they only would recommend the expensive ones. It also seems like the place it not clean they would have there finger in the food and even see hair in it. Omg all they would say is to replace it but who know if it is the someone just take it back and be right out with it.,1.0

"I just had a very unsatisfying dinner. We ordered from this place a couple of special rolls, kani salad, tom yum soup and a couple of basic rolls. Nothing tasted even like a typical mediocre cheap sushi place, it was worse, much worse. First about the 11 dollar special roll - Kamikaze - I had a piece, my boyfriend had a piece. We threw out the rest. The fish tasted mushy and gross. Definitely wasn't fresh. Very unbalanced flavor as well. The rice in the rolls was overcooked. The kani salad was inedible as well with little flavor, very soggy. We pretty much didn't finish any of the items. While I may be a tad picky (although, refusing to eat fish that tastes like its gone bad is not exactly being picky...),  my boyfriend isnt picky at all. And for him not to finish any of the ordered food means it has to be inedible, and for us to both agree to throw food out and not eat it later, well that almost never happens unless the food is moldy. But this also qualified.",2.0

"If I could recommend any restaurant in NYC it would be this one for sure. A newly outfitted restaurant it stands out amongst your more typical Chinese restaurants on this 8th Ave strip. Inside the decor is fun if but a little on the flashy trendy side but somehow it makes the atmosphere so much more enjoyable like the beaded curtain to the super trendy toilets. Even though it was our first time we were treated like regulars. The service was impeccable and it's lovely that the manager Toro was there just to make sure everything was perfect, which by the way it was. There are quite a few pleasant servers that are never short on smiles and one is always around when you need them. The food was amazing and they have all types of asian it's almost an overwhelming amount of variety; chinese, japanese, thai, malaysian! They call it fusion but it's more like a cornucopia. But I have never had a laksa that good in NYC it was really old school and fresh and I'm pretty sure it cured my cold. We also ordered the Massaman curry which was also delicious and thick more like a redang than that cheap watery stuff you get from your local thai joint. The chicken yakitori was great as well as the tempura and spring rolls. We also were lucky enough to try a complimentary octupus seaweed salad that's not even on the menu was so refreshing. To finish our wonderful meal we shared a tempura ice cream and let me tell you it didn't come out in a huge ball with a frozen arctic heart it was a beautifully proportioned tempura ice cream roll perfectly cut and ready to share. The real kicker of this place is the bill at the end soooo unbelievable you'll wish you had ordered twice as much. Im coming back and taking all my friends with me!!!",5.0
