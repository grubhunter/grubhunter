"Stayed a block away from this place in Brooklyn and came here twice for breakfast.1. Customer service - EXCELLENT! Best customer service I've experienced my entire 10 days here in the east coast. We got bagels and coffee and the barista was so sweet and welcoming. She kept talking about how she put her heart into making it and she definitely did. Also, the second day we went, the owner was so nice and friendly. He even came up to our table later to make sure everything was ok. Then, when my husband was outside he even helped him catch a cab while carrying his adorable little son2. Food - first time we just got bagels with cream cheese. It was good. They definitely aren't stingy with the cream cheese :D second time I got egg and cheese and it was no ordinary egg and cheese. Definitely worth the money you could taste how fresh the ingredients are. 3. Coffee - best in east coast. And guilt free since they sweetened it with natural agave! I had the Angelica latte and iced coffee sweetened with agave. It was bangin. I am a coffee lover but because of being sick stopped drinking it, but had it at this place and it was so refreshing.4. Atmosphere - probably the nicest joint in the area. Looks newly renovated, clean, corner location. Even the customers are friendly and just really good vibes at this place.Overall, HIGHLY recommended if you're in the area (or not).",5.0
"They have an Iced Coffee monopoly on Nostrand, and well its actually an Iced Americano - no cold brew, sadly. I love this place for the convenience, and usually pop in every morning before I get on the train.The oatmeal is tastey, the sandwiches are good too.  Sometimes it can take some time to get everything you ordered.",3.0
"Found this cute, very new and modern cafe while I was waiting for a client to show. I love the decor, it's fresh, neat and if I were to ever need a place to work quietly on my laptop -- this would be it. They have healthy eats items on their shelves before you get to the counter. I love that their menu is short and too the point, they're not trying to overdo it and what they serve they excel at.I ordered a coffee (which was really strong, bold and tasty)And ordered a chocolate croissant which was pleasantly delicious. The server (sorry didn't take his name) was really sweet, helpful and served with a smile. Follow me @nycfoodiediary on instagram.",4.0
"Super friendly staff and delicious coffee (from a former barista who isn't a snob, but knows good coffee). Beautiful space and good looking menu, too. The only reason for not giving 5 stars here is that service time could speed up a smidge, but hopefully that will come with time!",4.0
"The coffee here is SO GOOD and SO CHEAP! The iced coffee is actually an iced americano and a small is $2. I didn't know that it was an americano for a while and was getting a large (only $3.50) and was flushed and had heart palpitations 'cause I usually drink decaf. Whoops!!! hahaha. The eggs sandwiches are BANGIN'. They're really nice, and they have La Croix seltzer (in mango, coconut and two other flavors) and the kale salad is good. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood! If you're hungry, go here! If you work here, keep it up!",5.0
"Love that we have a new cafe & market in the neighborhood. Reasonably priced teas, coffees, and v friendly staff!",5.0
"- Was very unimpressed with my dry  BLT- Potato Leek soup was as equally unimpressive- Maybe I should have had the oatmeal for lunch, that everybody seems to be lauding",2.0
Stopped for a quick breakfast last week - and today picked up a sandwich to go - added plus brought my bike in and no complaints. Roasted Turkey sandwich is very good.,5.0
Great addition to the area. Need more choices like this where quality and freshness are top priority. They use amazing locally sourced ingredients and the service is polite. Next time I come back I'm getting pastries. Hope they are just as delicious as their savory items.,4.0
When you order an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich here they gook it to order and so the egg and cheese are integrated in a most delicious way. It's one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had and I probably eat too many breakfast sandwiches. The atmosphere is a little too spartan for my liking.,4.0
Since this place opened I've usually just come in here for coffee since it's how it all started. However they have slowly but surely expanded their menu!!! Which is great. This neighborhood needs more places like this. I was happy to walk in today just to get some coffee and a Danish when they showed me the new menu and even offered us a sample of the kale slaw. It was really tasty and I can't wait to go back for more!!!  They even let me have some for the office and everyone that tried it and the potato soup really liked it. We're all excited about the new menu since there's only about one other place around here that serves healthy food. I love the way this place looks and how big it it. They have a nice staff and everyone's great. Definitely a place to try if you live/work around here and if you want something new to try.,5.0
This review is only for coffee because I have not tried any food here yet but their coffee is heavenly good. I'm a huge fan of Caffe Vita from Seattle so it's  very grateful to be able to have their coffee in my neighborhood.,5.0
"$9 for a sandwich with 2 thin slices of turkey and cheese, and somehow it took them 10 minutes to put it together. I really want to like this place- it's cute and they have great coffee, but this was extremely disappointing. I hope this experience is an exception.",2.0
"Just discovered this new gem in my neighborhood thru seamless and I'm so glad I did. So good that I ordered two days in a row. First off, the hummus and bagel chips were the best I've had. I added aged prosciutto and strawberry jam to that order and made two diff snacks with the bagel chips. Also had the Blt on a everything bagel and the Mac and cheese. I was not disappointed. Great find and great service!",4.0
"Starliner Cafe is a Brooklyn breath of fresh air.  Breakfast was excellent!  Perfectly toasted bread incasing a deliciously light flavored sandwich.  Not heavy or greasy as is the norm.  Coffee is very bold and smokey with a hint of chocolate with the addition of a bit of sugar and 1/2&1/2.  Staff was friendly and helpful without being bothersome.  The place is kept neat and clean and is simply decorated.  Simple, also, is the menu yet, eclectic enough to satisfy nearly any palette.  If in the neighborhood, I definitely recommend.",5.0

"The food, the people, and the atmosphere is amazing!! I love the oatmeal (be sure to try it) and the breakfast sandwiches. If you are looking for organic high quality food, you'll find it here.",5.0

"This brand new place gets 5 stars for food and coffee, and 5 stars for atmosphere. First, the food and coffee. They serve Vita Coffee. I'm pretty sure that's a Seattle roaster. In any case, my coffee was great. I had a black coffee, so I can't attest to their espresso drinks. I also had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. They get their bagels from a shop in Windsor Terrace, and mine was great. Reasonable prices, too. My bagel and coffee was less than $4, with free refills. According to their website, they will soon have fresh organic fruits and veggies. Sort of a brick and mortar farmer's market. Looking forward to that.Second, the space itself. Such a clean, attractive, functional space. Nice and bright with big windows. Lots of seating. They have wifi, but it's kind of weak. The manager/owner was really nice, and he mentioned that they're working on the wifi situation.I spent an hour at Starliner this morning, and there were only a few other patrons. I'm really hoping there is enough of a market in this neighborhood to keep Starliner alive and well. To be honest, I'm worried that this place is about 5 years ahead of its time for this particular part of Brooklyn, but I hope I'm wrong.",5.0

"Tried this place this morning.The espresso is the smoothest I have ever had, service was very friendly! It's definitely ahead of its time in this area, they still have some major kinks to work out. Over charging, not making correct drink sizes. I think the employees are new to coffee and business. All in all give it 6 months and it'll be a good place to try again.",3.0
"Excellent and friendly customer service. I've been here a few times and tried a number of the items, including the bagel with smoked salmon, and been quite pleased. The owner is also very friendly, though he should let his employees handle the coffee, as they're much better at it  than him (when the owner made my drink he's pulled the shots for too long and scalded the milk, but the latte I got from an employee was spot on).",4.0
It's so great to have this in the neighborhood. The food is delicious and holy crap the Kaapstad tea is so good. Support this business so that we can get more stuff like this!,5.0
"Awesome experience and great customer service. I went there when they first opened and bought an apple sauce and yogurt for my daughters. The cashier guy was very helpful and offered me a sample of their ice herbal tea. He also ask if I had any questions and concerns, there wasn't much I can think of. As I was leaving he offered me a lollipop for my daughter. Far as the place itself,  Its clean, organized and they have a lot of organic products",5.0
This place is great and I can't wait for the fully stocked market.  They serve great coffee and pastries plus other snacks and it's a great place to hang out.  Welcome addition to the neighborhood!,5.0
It's one of the coldest days in Brooklyn this morning. I looked for a place nearby that not only delivered breakfast but had quality ingredients. I was so pleasantly surprised by not only being the first Yelp order but to have my order hand delivered by the owner himself and his son (for being the first Yelp order). They were so kind; It truly made my day! I could not thank them enough. I ordered the egg and cheese sandwich with hickory smoked bacon and coffee. Absolutely delicious! Tasted fresh and with quite a generous amount. I would definitely recommend this place and am so thankful to have found such a a place in the neighborhood! Thank you!,5.0

"Great little spot! Love that a cafe is opening up in PLG, the neighborhood needs some life. Great breakfast and coffee, super friendly staff, and affordable!

"I'm so happy this hidden gem opened! My journey for finding a cafe near Downstate has ended. Great food (my favorite is the kale salad and lox bagel. The menu is constantly expanding to) and great people. Issac loves what he does and it really shows in the care and attention he puts into his menu, customers and market items. This cafe is a great place to sip on a cup of coffee under a ton of natural lighting. I also don't come out smelling like bakery food which is a plus. Hands down, 5 stars.",5.0
