"Went there for lunch/dinner today.  I live in the neighborhood and have been waiting to try this place for some time.  Staff is super friendly, a large variety of interesting sandwiches.  They even make their own breads, sourdough, Pullman, baguettes and a few other things.  In addition to sandwiches they have fries and wings and salads.  I ate two sandwiches as I couldn't make up my mind.  Fried chicken sandwich is a huge crunchy thigh.  Porchetta is delicious as well, love their homemade bread on this.  It's a very welcoming and chill spot to get some amazing and creative eats.  Prices are great.",5.0
"first let me state that, with all my hearti love chicken.i will never disrespect a chicken.that being said.one night, my chicken levels were dangerously low and i live close to endless summer so ive been meaning to peep but at the time i was in an exclusive relationship with the chicken shack.my flesh is week so i gave into temptation and ordered. it came quick but when i unwrapped the pretty much opened foil i was less than impressed.the fries were a nightmare.limp, soggy, oily, strange odor, brown and way too many.the sandwich was just a chunk of chicken on a soggy martins roll.it looked up at me kinda sad like.i asked for the slaw on the side but i guess they forgot so i cant judge that but im going to use my deductive reasoning and guess that it would have been soggy too.regardless, i ate it standing up over the stove.because like i said, my chicken levels were depleted.but for the price, i dont think it was worth cheating on my one true chicken love.the #lpfedme reco here:if you are a stupid baby that poses in front of food you dont actually eat bc you have no teeth or money bc you are a babythen get a chicken sandwich i guess.but if you are going to actually eat it then: just use Postmates and order the Chicken Shack from Shake Shack tbhand if it's your first time, here's $10 in delivery cash: just enter RG2PY at checkout.tell em #lpfedme sent you",2.0
"Got delivery, there was too much slaw on both the brisket and chicken sandwiches. The Brisket didn't have any particular ""wow"" aspect to it and the chicken kind of fell apart and was inedible by the end. Not the worst thing in the world but I think this is one option i'd prefer to try in house as opposed to have delivered.",3.0
Go for the fried chicken sandwich and add some pickled habanero peppers,3.0
"I've had Endless Summer's fried chicken sandwich three times now--once as a walk in and twice via delivery. The sandwich is as good as they say, and transports pretty well for delivery. But for the real experience, you should swing by the small storefront and order one in person. I went after work in the fall and was the only person in the shop. The cashier was friendly and my sandwich came out fast. The chicken is crispy and juicy, and the remoulade really adds flavor. All three times I also got a side of fries, which is more like a second meal--a very generous portion. The fries are also crispy with soft middles--the best kind of fries. Since I live in the opposite direction I haven't been back to visit, but delivery took within an hour, so I can still enjoy their sandwiches.",4.0
Great spot with really solid fried chicken and Mac n cheese. It may be just a bit overpriced but other than that can't complain. I would like to see some more options on the menu because I really like what I tried,4.0
5 stars. Hands down one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had. The salads are great too. I'll definitely be back!,5.0
"Maybe chalk it up to high hopes that were dashed.There was clearly a lot of care and thought taken into design of the flavors and the preparation of these sandwiches (Chicken and Asian Pork) but the execution  just was not there. Both sandwiches were too salty for my palate as were the natural cut fries which, outside of the salt, were the bright spot of my meal.  The Asian pork had a bun that was nothing to write home about while the fried chicken was served on a small loaf that lacked flavor and was too dry.The portions were quite small making value very low for $8/$8.50 per sandwich. I took the sandwiches to go but there is just a few stools if you care to eat in.The staff was friendly and the wait was not too long.I would not suggest making this a destination, but if you live in the area it might be worth checking out to see if your experience is better than mine.",2.0

"I'm home sick and got a strange craving for a burger. I ended up ordering the chicken sandwhich and OMG!!!! WOW is all I have to say. Thank the Heavens !! I may not be 100% cured of my sickness, but the world is a better place now. AMAZING.",5.0
"Order from here all the time. The chicken sandwich IS. SO. GOOD. Best sandwich I've ever had. The pickles and the cabbage and the perfect crispy-ness of the chicken - AHHHHH. Fries are good, too. And delivery is fast! Once I ordered and was eating 18 minutes later. GET THE CHICKEN SANDWICH. You'll thank me later.",5.0
"AMAZING fried chicken sandwich. I've gotten it many, many times, and it's perfect and delicious each time. The pickles on it are awesome. I've also had their grilled cheese, beef brisket, fries, and panzanella salad. Those are all pretty solid choices, but the fried chicken is really the most amazing thing they have. Super friendly staff and orders are always ready pretty quickly whenever I order on Seamless. Small interior with only 3 or 4 stools. Best for takeout.",5.0
"The sandwiches here are fine, but not particularly special.Problems with naming conventions aside, the ""pulled"" pork is simply okay. Saucy pork on a bun with some cabbage. The whole sandwich was on the ""soft"" side, but it tasted okay. I'd have liked more pork flavor and less sauce/cabbage, but it was decent. The bread on the smoked whitefish sandwich was awesome. Big, crunchy and soft kind of like Texas Toast. But the sandwich didn't pack as much of a flavor burst as I was hoping for. The fries were average.It would have been nice if the (tiny, we're talking seating for ~5) store were air conditioned, as the temperature inside was probably in the 80s. But it's a valid lunch option if you're in the area.",3.0
Always happy to have a new place and I've heard good things. Roasted Veggie sandwich was dry. It needed a sauce or something on it. Chicken tortilla soup was great.  Delivery was fast even though the minimum is $15 which sucks.  Delivery guy was pleasant and it came quickly. Might try again if someone is already ordering from there.,3.0
"They should call this place The Fried Chicken Sandwich. It's all I could think about after leaving the   restaurant. I was rewarded with this sandwich 6 months ago after a few hours hard work. Then, I didn't know where it came from. Today, I recognized it immediately. The pickles are lucidly dressed with just the right amount of sour and paired with the perfect cabbage slaw/condiment ratio thanks to the cook, Francisco. The chicken breast is thick, juicy and fried to perfection. I wouldn't change anything. Also, the sandwich is priced right and ready in five minutes. Paul was holding down the front and guided me through the menu while eating. I've decided on catfish for my next visit. I don't know how it can compare. Sorry catfish sandwich, it's not a fair fight!",5.0
"The service is entirely disappointing. I have ordered takeout on two different occasions which happened to be rainy weekend nights. The first time, I waited for 1 hour before calling to see what happened to the 40 minute delivery time. The manager apologetically admitted they were backed up on deliveries due to the rain/heightened demand for delivery. He offered to have the delivery guy give me cookies as an apology. When the delivery guy didn't show up for another 45 minutes (thus an hour and 45 minute wait for 10 blocks) I called back and was given a refund.After this experience, I at least appreciated the attempts to accommodate and decided to order again on another rainy Friday. This time when the delivery was 1 hour tardy, I called again. A female said her only delivery girl was biking through the rain and would basically get there when she got there. Because of her tone - I just wanted a refund. She refused but offered store credit. She then hung up the phone saying, ""Stay Dry!"" With that I called back and asked to speak to the manager and the same voice said... Speaking!If that's management's outlook I will not patronize their establishment again.

"I love this place. I live around the corner, and I never call ahead because getting my take-out order usually doesn't take longer than 8 minutes.The whole place is about as wide as 2 walk-in closets pressed up next to each other.

What I got was a kale salad with a few small pieces of the above mentioned components. All the salads were like that. When I grew up salad was based on lettuce, not kale. If we had known there was no lettuce I believe none of us would have ordered them. The dressings were unusual- but not good. The fries were tasty but super salty. And the sandwiches were good.

I ordered the smoked white fish sandwich... My only regret was not ordering another! The fish was light and smokey, big meaty portion in between the lightly toasted and buttered bread. Everything seemed to be made in-house, they offer flavour combinations that aren't commonly used. The fish was topped with a sweet pepper relish, and slaw. It was perfect.  I don't normally get so enthusiastic over a sandwich... But I will definitely return when I go back next time.",5.0

The parsnip fries? Soggy. The salad we ordered? Soggy and overpowered with dressing. I'd chalk it up to delivery, but actually, they delivered it fairly quickly, which is a definite plus, but then that just means the food isn't up to par in general. And for that quality, it's way too expensive. Might give this place another chance, but definitely will never order takeout from them again.",2.0

"This review is for the catfish sandwich and fries. Catfish sandwich was decent. The piece of fish was noticeably smaller than the bread it was placed on. I also didn't really get too much of a hot sauce flavor. And while the portion was huge, the french fries were soggy. I could tell they would have been delicious if they were crispy. The guy at the counter was nice and made sure to ask if I wanted sauce with my fries. I asked for hot sauce. Their hot sauce is kind of chunky; I was expecting a sauce like Frank's red hot. Still, the sauce was pretty good .I asked if they had any pickled habaneros after reading that a fellow Yelper got some on the side. The counter-guy asked the woman cooking the food if they had any downstairs and she said hot sauce or habaneros so I just stuck with the hot sauce; kind of wishing I hadn't. They could have spared a few habaneros for a new customer...The decor is reminiscent of their truck and there's some counter seating if you decide to eat there. Prices are pretty reasonable too. I know they just opened about a week ago so I'm guessing they're still working on some things. I'd come back to try a different sandwich.",3.0

So tender, juicy and flavorful! Damn! The fries are some of the best ever. I don't know what they put on them, or how they do it, but again: damn!

"It pains me to write this review. I've been a been fan of Endless since it started delivering, ordering sometimes two or three times a week to get my fix. But the last few deliveries have included sandwiches which did not live up to the previously set standard. I'm not sure what's happened, but the quality control has been lacking. Twice now I've had fried chicken sandwiches that included a flat piece of chicken smaller than a baby's fist and an overload of cabbage, the pulled pork has had pieces of meat that were incredibly dry and tough to chew, the brisket sandwich was loaded with fatty gristle to the point it was inedible. I refrained from speaking up. Because I don't want to be that guy. But I'm hoping this might help bring back the high quality food I came to expect when ordering from you. My roommate and his girlfriend have also experienced a downturn in quality. We talked about it because we care. I've spent hundreds of dollars on your food. And in the last couple months I've been disappointed enough to consider spending my money elsewhere. I don't want to do this.I'm rooting for you guys to turn this around. I want to give you my money. I want to eat your food once or twice, hell maybe three times a week, because I love a great sandwich and I remember how great yours can be. To be fair, until the last couple months I would have given you guys five stars. Your fries are still on point. Your delivery is always fast, your people are kind. Let's not make this a longterm separation. Out of all the delivered sandwiches I've known, I've loved yours the most.",2.0

"just moved to the hood and saw this place had great reviews so I wanted to check it out. I ordered the eggplant sandwich with the garlic sauce on the side. eggplant was a bit greasy but tasted ok, the garlic sauce was pretty good. The reason I give it 2 stars (bordering on 2.5 because the garlic sauce was tasty) is that I paid $10 for a sandwich and was still super hungry after I ate because it was SO TINY. (I was thinking...what is this a sandwich for ants!?...zoolander..anyone? :)). Probably would not go back unless everything else in the area was closed and I had nothing to eat.",2.0

yo the chicken sandwich here is easily top 3 in THE ENTIRE CITY. get on it people. you are missing out if you haven't experienced it. the slaw plus the sauce plus the high quality chicken = damn give me more. i dont know what else to say besides maybe wash it down with a glass bottled sugar cane coke.,5.0
"well, everyone around here knows I love this place.  But when you love something, you gotta take the good with the bad.  There might be some lil' issues that bug you, get on your last goddamn nerve - you try asking her to stop (for instance) nagging you about meaningless bs all the time and she says ""I'm trying!"".  Well, we all know that ""trying"" means ""deal with it"" and I'm not about that.  But you love her anyway.Speaking of that, I was having a chat with my friend Ben about these sandwiches, just really getting into the groove of the conversation and he says, ""dude....cauliflower sandwich"".  Honestly, I've seen it on the menu but just thought, well they have to have something for the Pratt kids, you know.  I never took it seriously, never gave it more than a passing glance.  I indicated that all to Ben and he just goddamn insisted that I try it.  I'm like, sure man but I better not be disappointed.Well, I don't like to waste time so I went in the next day, kind of reluctantly ordered that cauliflower sandwich (really?  a sandwich stuffed with cauliflower?) and sort of explained the experiment I was running here.  The counter dudes are giving me the wide eyes and blank stares, like, man you have no idea what you're getting in to.My first impression, when they handed me the wrapped up sandwich was that it was pretty hefty and felt like a sandwich, which is a great thing.  I took it home, popped a beer, and sunk in to it.  Goddamn, that first bite was like the first time I tasted coca cola as a baby.  It SUNG to me.  The best way I can describe it is some beautiful ethereal angel whispers backed with some stoner dude shredding on a gibson explorer hooked up to like 3 amps, 1 bass amp, and the sweetest cabs you've ever seen.  Full blast.  Like, walls are shaking and shit.  Like, you can just feel it in your gut.Anyway, I was pleased and I'll have it again.",5.0
"I've had some great sandwiches here (including the chicken,whitefish sandwiches)  but the last 2 times I tried new stuff and was majorly disappointed.

The first couple of times I came here I gave it 5 stars. I write this urging you to rework your menu and remove the stuff that is not working. I really want this place to step it up.

"After a bad reception at a place a few doors down, we decided to try Endless Summer instead, and we're so glad we did!I had the egg salad sandwich, she had the Fried Chicken Sandwich, and we shared a side of fries.The egg salad was good, but completely overshadowed by the awesome fried chicken! So tender, juicy and flavorful! Damn! The fries are some of the best ever. I don't know what they put on them, or how they do it, but again: damn! I had a moment where I was clearly enjoying the chicken sandwich, the chef glanced at me, I nodded enthusiastically in approval, and he smiled and gave me a big thumbs up - classic!We shall return!NB: it's literally a hole in the wall, so only a few stools and small counter space available, so if you're in a big party, be prepared to eat standing, or take it to go.",5.0
"It pains me to write this review. I've been a been fan of Endless since it started delivering, ordering sometimes two or three times a week to get my fix. But the last few deliveries have included sandwiches which did not live up to the previously set standard. I'm not sure what's happened, but the quality control has been lacking. Twice now I've had fried chicken sandwiches that included a flat piece of chicken smaller than a baby's fist and an overload of cabbage, the pulled pork has had pieces of meat that were incredibly dry and tough to chew, the brisket sandwich was loaded with fatty gristle to the point it was inedible. I refrained from speaking up. Because I don't want to be that guy. But I'm hoping this might help bring back the high quality food I came to expect when ordering from you. My roommate and his girlfriend have also experienced a downturn in quality. We talked about it because we care. I've spent hundreds of dollars on your food. And in the last couple months I've been disappointed enough to consider spending my money elsewhere. I don't want to do this.I'm rooting for you guys to turn this around. I want to give you my money. I want to eat your food once or twice, hell maybe three times a week, because I love a great sandwich and I remember how great yours can be. To be fair, until the last couple months I would have given you guys five stars. Your fries are still on point. Your delivery is always fast, your people are kind. Let's not make this a longterm separation. Out of all the delivered sandwiches I've known, I've loved yours the most.",2.0
Great sandwiches. Grabbed lunch here at the last min and was impressed. Fish sandwich was good. They have this spread that went well with it.,4.0
"My friends came over my house unexpectedly, they told me that they were really hungry. Unfortunately I had nothing to offer them at home so I had to figure out something really quickly. So I decided to call this place. It was a great experience to order from there for a delivery . Sandwiches were delivered very fast to us. Everything was correct when we received our order, fresh and hot. I ordered fried chicken sandwich for myself and very enjoyed it. My friends also liked sandwiches they ordred. I'm very satisfied with this place.",4.0
"just moved to the hood and saw this place had great reviews so I wanted to check it out. I ordered the eggplant sandwich with the garlic sauce on the side. eggplant was a bit greasy but tasted ok, the garlic sauce was pretty good. The reason I give it 2 stars (bordering on 2.5 because the garlic sauce was tasty) is that I paid $10 for a sandwich and was still super hungry after I ate because it was SO TINY. (I was thinking...what is this a sandwich for ants!?...zoolander..anyone? :)). Probably would not go back unless everything else in the area was closed and I had nothing to eat.",2.0
"I've been here a handful of times and have been impressed with each visit.  There are a lot of good options for vegetarians, which I appreciate.New options on the menu are consistently well thought out and full of flavor.  The staff is friendly and willing to make recommendations, often for less expensive items.",5.0
"Ordered delivery on Friday.  Went in on a Saturday for more, it was that good!Husband had the fried chicken sandwich both times.  He won't stop talking about it, he's obsessed!  I've tried the Asian Roast Pork sandwich and the Grilled Cheese (made with Pimento cheese!!!). Both were very tasty.  Also tried the french fries and carrot and parsnip fries...both delicious as well.Everyone who works there is really nice, food is tasty and fresh, and their prices are great.  Love this addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
yo the chicken sandwich here is easily top 3 in THE ENTIRE CITY. get on it people. you are missing out if you haven't experienced it. the slaw plus the sauce plus the high quality chicken = damn give me more. i dont know what else to say besides maybe wash it down with a glass bottled sugar cane coke.,5.0
"well, everyone around here knows I love this place.  But when you love something, you gotta take the good with the bad.  There might be some lil' issues that bug you, get on your last goddamn nerve - you try asking her to stop (for instance) nagging you about meaningless bs all the time and she says ""I'm trying!"".  Well, we all know that ""trying"" means ""deal with it"" and I'm not about that.  But you love her anyway.Speaking of that, I was having a chat with my friend Ben about these sandwiches, just really getting into the groove of the conversation and he says, ""dude....cauliflower sandwich"".  Honestly, I've seen it on the menu but just thought, well they have to have something for the Pratt kids, you know.  I never took it seriously, never gave it more than a passing glance.  I indicated that all to Ben and he just goddamn insisted that I try it.  I'm like, sure man but I better not be disappointed.Well, I don't like to waste time so I went in the next day, kind of reluctantly ordered that cauliflower sandwich (really?  a sandwich stuffed with cauliflower?) and sort of explained the experiment I was running here.  The counter dudes are giving me the wide eyes and blank stares, like, man you have no idea what you're getting in to.My first impression, when they handed me the wrapped up sandwich was that it was pretty hefty and felt like a sandwich, which is a great thing.  I took it home, popped a beer, and sunk in to it.  Goddamn, that first bite was like the first time I tasted coca cola as a baby.  It SUNG to me.  The best way I can describe it is some beautiful ethereal angel whispers backed with some stoner dude shredding on a gibson explorer hooked up to like 3 amps, 1 bass amp, and the sweetest cabs you've ever seen.  Full blast.  Like, walls are shaking and shit.  Like, you can just feel it in your gut.Anyway, I was pleased and I'll have it again.",5.0

A few month's ago I was in the neighborhood looking for a great alternative to KFC and the Vegan place around the corner and  was fortunate enough to stumble upon Endless Summer Sandwich. I had terrific customer service and an even better pork sandwich. The only con was the temperature inside the tiny store. It was one of the first hot day's of summer and it was sweltering in there. All and all a great experience and a delicious sandwich.,4.0
Very delicious sandwiches for sale here. This isn't your run of the mill sandwich shop as they have a bunch of cool different choices. The Asian roast pork is very tasty. You must try the fried chicken sandwich. The fries are also very good and served In the big Chinese take out cartons. Great spot to grab a sandwich.,4.0

"The only thing Endless is the deciding on sandwich choices.  The Fried Chicken is a masterpiece with a beer batter that is on point.

"Underwhelming. I had heard only great things about ""Endless Summer Sandwich."" I finally decided to try it, on a rare Sunday off from working a busy brunch as a line cook myself. Firstly, after checking the payment details on yelp I noticed they mention bicycle parking which was definitely a plus. Unfortunately, as I arrived so did another cyclist and he occupied the only spot left on the already tiny bicycle rack. Tough luck. Only about 3 bicycles fit on the rack and that's only if you really ""Tetris"" them in. I don't mean to be nit picking but if you're gonna highlight ""bicycle parking"" on your profile then it should be worth it. Otherwise don't mention it. To make matters a little more annoying, the cyclist was an employee there. He showed up for his shift and took up valuable front window parking. A bit inconsiderate to say the least, and lame. The cashier was awesome, very friendly, welcoming and present. I ordered the BLT and a side of fries. I don't think there's much you can do to ""mess"" up a BLT. It's a classic delicious sandwich. Simple. Right? Wrong. The bread was way too thick, but it still got soggy way too quickly. And the contents of it was way too little in contrast to the bread. The ""B"" definitely stood for ""bread"" not ""bacon"" :(   The use of the ends of plums tomatoes was a horrible decision. They just squeeze right out when you bite!! ...so did the chopped up little bits of iceberg. I say whoever created this sandwich still has a lot to learn in the way of successful sandwich composition. I couldn't experience any of the flavors as a whole because everything kept falling out. I really really wanted to like it. But it was very unsatisfactory even though I was starving! The fries were nothing to write home about. I could buy a bag of fries like em in the frozen food isle. But what really got me was that there was no ""in house"" ketchup! I had a mountain of fries and then a basket of small packets of ketchup by the register! What?!! I had the Tedious task of squeezing about 12 tiny ketchup packets into my basket of fries! If the fries could stand on their own there'd be no problem but the fries really needed them.

The cookies are fresh baked and the fries were also good. I hear the deliver now which means I'll be getting more addicted to them. Endless summer is a nice addition to the restaurant scene in bed stuy. Its comfort food, in a bun.",5.0
I had the pork sandwich and fries. Both were absolutely delicious. The pork has pickled vegetables on it. The beets must be pickled in coriander or some other interesting spice very unique tasting.   The sandwich was a little greasy. When you squeeze it a little some of that red pork fat came out. To me it would've been perfect if the pork sandwich was 20% less fatty.,4.0
Great food.  Didn't even know this place was near me.  Will be going back again soon.,5.0
"SCUM ALERT. First off, let me start by praising their sandwiches which are extremely tasty and I recommend them to everyone. My problem is when I ordered through Seamless, I ordered two sandwiches. When they arrived I also got two soups that I didn't ordered. When I checked my receipt, they charged me $12 for soups I never wanted. Turns out when you add a sandwich, they automatically add a soup unless you deselect it. What a scummy, dirty trick! I order through Seamless all the time. No other restaurant has ever done this to me. So please be warned that you have to deselect the soup option, and also cheese ($2) which I actually wanted, or your $10 sandwich becomes an $18 sandwich without your consent. That almost doubles your bill, plus I tipped a percentage of the total. This is undeniably unethical and I would urge them to change their approach.",4.0
"After waiting for an hour and a half, the girl on the phone told us that they left the food on our porch without having buzzed or called us. Obviously the food was gone by the time we figured it out. When we called them back they argued and tried to turn the blame on us. We asked for a refund, and she said she didn't know how to do that, so our only option was to wait for the sandwiches again.  Once they finally arrived, they were cold. Somehow their screw up turned into our problem.",1.0
"The tomato sandwich is perfect! I love some good tomato and they were great. Not to mention the mozzarella cheese on it! The mozzarella came on with a thick slice cold and it was awesome! The weirdest thing was it had olives on there(I'm not a fan of olives), and it made the whole thing! ... Saying that the sandwich is one of the best I've had in BK. I also got the french fries and they tasted amazing!",5.0
You're missing out if you live in Brooklyn and haven't tried this place yet. You'll have a hard time getting sandwiches like this for under $10 anywhere else. This rap says it all. smule.com/p/323613272_10…,5.0
"Had the vegan roasted veg sandwich. So damn good! It wasn't overly oily as some restaurants prepare the vegetables for vegan dishes/sandwiches. They were perfect. A great combo of veg as well, nicely seasoned.",5.0
And they have EXCELLENT customer service!!!,5.0
So good...I loved the roasted carrots and parsnips! The ingredients were all fresh and cooked perfectly. I only took off a star for the mass amount of oil used; I'm sure it would have been just as good with a little less grease. But it's a great option for the neighborhood. Enjoy!,4.0
"So glad to see spots like this open! Great food with friendly staff. Affordable and satisfyingly delicious. Great options for everyone, from the meat lover to the strict vegan. Perfect addition to this great neighborhood. Thanks Teddy and Lauren you guys are great!",5.0

"Great new sandwich shop in Bed-Stuy. Don't leave without trying the fried chicken sandwich and the fried catfish sandwich. Bring a friend and go half-sies, or just indulge and get both. The cookies are really chunky, chewy, and served warm. The staff is polite, chill, and committed (they let me try their homemade bacon jam that they were experimenting with). Five stars.",5.0

"Bahn mi was not as advertised. Missing fresh herbs and quite greasy. Also pretty small for $9.50. The fried chicken sandwich was better but nothing special. Also on the small side for the money. I don't mind dropping $15 on a dandies hand fries, but it should fill me up and be of better quality. We ordered in, which was probably a mistake. Food arrived reasonably warm, but would hopefully be better in person. I want to like it, given the hood's limited restaurant options, but was unimpressed.",2.0

"Just tried it for the first time, and I'll definitely be back soon! I had the catfish sandwich. The catfish was beautifully fried, the slaw and the remoulade nicely complemented the fish, and the bread was firm enough to hold the sandwich together but easy enough to bite through that I didn't have the catfish to get a bite. They really know what they're doing!",5.0
