"Everything about this place is really terrific. The food was simple, well-seasoned, and fresh. The service was excellent, friendly, and informed. The bartenders and the drinks were stiff and well-made. The decor, atmosphere, and mellow crowd made for cozy and relaxed winter's night. Worth the trek, even if you don't live in the neighborhood.My one small complaint was the tiny portion of the grilled cauliflower appetizer, but I'd give them six stars for the music selection if I could.",5.0
"I randomly about this in Epoch Times and have been curious about Buschwick for a while, so fiance and I ventured out here around 8/9 on a Saturday.  Being this is off the Jefferson L stop, it's really more Middle Village area (Queens...).  The area's a bit desolate but there are plenty of good spots to go if you do your research or just walk around and stumble upon cool stuff. Montana is definitely cool - it's more noticeable, and def LOOKS like a wooden lodge trial house.  Prices are definitely noticeable cheaper than in the city, portions are more generous and food's just as good - and so are the drinks.  They don't take reservations, so we began at the bar.  I ordered the seasonal Street Shark cocktail which was rum based and had a lot of tangy things, like tamarind and citrus... my fi had a bunch of IPA beers.  We both had a glass of tempernillo and bourdeux, later. Drinks are boozy and the wine pours are mean. Onto the food.  To start, we shared the appetizer bibb lettuce salad which was just ok.. good lettuce, but the rest of the main ingredients, like the pumperknickel croutons and the blood oranges fell flat.  We split the cheesy grits as an app and that was honestly probably the best thing we had - seems simple but the cheesy atop was extra cheesy and gave the grits a great flavor.  For my main, I had the fried chicken which were 3 big pieces of tender dark meat, well marinated so salty/juicy.  The skin was very light and crisp.  The hoe cakes it came with were whatever; could have used more buttery flavor, and the slaw was ok.  My fiance had the root beer brisket which was tenderly cooked and well portioned, over a bed of the same grits. We didn't taste much of the root beer though.For dessert, they gave us an apertif shot, and we had the banana bread s'mores pudding...which had an awesome crispy crust but wasn't as earth shattering as people said here. I kind of wish I'd gotten the butterscotch pudding... but it was good, no doubt.  The toasted marshmellow was very good.Service was prompt and on time - we had to wait 20 minutes for a table but we choose to do so we could have eaten at the bar.  They seated us as soon as possible.. and while we ate, food came out quick and we were not rushed even though it seemed to get busier 9:30 onward. It did take a while for us to get the bill, though but I think they made up for that with the free shots.  They're open for late night bites, so it does become more of a bar after dinner.. the restaurant's pretty small, I can see why they don't take reservations.. Recommend if in the area or nearby BK or if you just want to be adventurous like us.  I'd recommend coming for brunch too - their brunch looks good.",4.0
"Went for an early dinner and the cocktail and duck rillette appetizer were AMAZING. My husband got the brisket and I had a bite, and it was OUTSTANDING. The only thing is that my fried chicken (otherwise FANTASTIC) had one piece that seemed undercooked (i.e. there was a bit of blood and even slightly pink). I did not send it back for another piece, as it was the last piece of chicken and we had to leave anyway, but the waitress was apologetic and said that the chicken was brined in addition to being cooked (and I have been in perfect health ever since).If it weren't for that, I would have given this place five stars. I can't ignore the fact that it happened, but it does seem like it was an isolated incident. This is one of my favorite restaurants that I've tried in recent memory, so I definitely would still recommend to others and go back myself as well.",4.0
"Went for brunch at sunday around 2pm. Had the baked french toast which was delicious! The bloody Mary was good too, very spicy. We had to wait outside for about 30 min before getting a table. Overall great service and good food!",4.0
"Truly the best brunch in Bushwick! The Montana Trail house has a special place in my heart along with their griddled banana bread that is made to perfection with a hint of maple sugar. I decided to take my Best friend David to my secret spot for his birthday breakfast. Both ladies in our life ordered the winter hash with 2 eggs sunny side up. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which has Ham, Fried Egg, White Cheddar, Black Pepper Aioli, on a brioche roll. Now this is not your ordinary breakfast sandwich its the ingredients that make the sandwich and I recommend you try it at least once. My other Fave is the french toast. The Staff is always welcoming and super friendly.",5.0
"This place probably deserves 5 stars but I didn't get to take full advantage of it during my visit.I had no alcoholic beverages because I was too hungover to try one.But!!! I did have their cheese grits and I was in shock. Those cheese grits are TOO DAMN GOOD. Their brunch menu had me stressed. I just couldn't pick and choose because I didn't want my eyes to be bigger than my stomach. I settled for the cheese grits, the banana bread, and the homemade sausage. That sausage was sooooo good and the banana bread wasn't too bad itself. I'll come back here again in no time and hopefully be able to give this place the 5 stars I believe it possesses.",4.0
"I came to visit my cousin in NY and she took me to the best places to eat in Bushwick for brunch. On a Saturday morning - the wait was only 20 minutes. We got some ginger sodas (which were SUPER gingery yum) while we waited outside. Since the weathers been great lately - hello 60s in December what, I didn't mind the short wait. We ordered the:+ Baked Eggs: This is pretty SPICY. It only comes with one small piece of bread but you can ask for more since by itself it's not as good :p. Yummy tomato goodness with eggs. + Fried Chicken Biscuit: This was amazing. I can't believe how good it was. Just writing this review I'm drooling thinking of it. Juicy tender chicken with a nice crunch and a delicious biscuit to top it off. And that sauce they have inside!! I don't know what they put in it but it was so good and sweet. This is a MUST GET. Only complaint I would have is that the waiter forgot about us for a bit after we got our check. Do they want our money or not? Other than that fantastic food and the atmosphere is just perfect.",5.0
"Holy Defensive server, Batman!My party was only able to stop in for a quick bite because we were catching a nearby show. I let the waiter know that we had a show at 8pm and he sat us after clearing the table. He didn't  offer his name and we didn't ask. We promptly ordered some fried chicken and a vegetable pot pie. After waiting patiently and without a complaint for nearly 40 minutes, we flagged down our waiter (who hadn't stopped by to check in on us at all in that time) to ask whether we could get our food to go because we had to catch a show in 20 minutes. He immediately got defensive by throwing up his hands and smugly insisted that ""maybe (you) should not have ordered the pot pie if (you) knew you were in a rush."" Pure gold. If you've ever watched the movie True Lies when Arnold imagines punching Bill Paxton in the face for talking dirty about his wife, that's what was going on in my head.My response in reality (as with Arnold's actual response in True Lies) was far more cordial: ""We let you know that we had a show to catch at 8pm when we arrived at 6:55pm  How could we have possibly known that the pot pie would take over 40 minutes? Maybe you could have been helpful by letting us know ahead of time and offering an alternative.""Well, with no apology or attempt to rectify his over-reaction, he left in a huff and returned with our food 5 minutes later, a whole 45 minutes after we were seated. Maybe he spit in it, I don't know. Regardless, we wolfed down our dishes and paid the check. Chicken was great. Loved the biscuits too. Those are good enough to return for if I'm ever back in the area despite the rude server. The pie was not worth the wait. *********Edit: After reading my review, the owner reached out to me and was sincerely apologetic for my experience there. Really sounds like a genuinely good guy.Four stars minus 1 for unhelpful service, plus 1 for good guy owner.",4.0

"I traveled 30+ mins from the city to this bar just to get brunch (and to see an art exhibit). Walked in around 1pm on Saturday and it was packed. Hostess told us it would be around an hour wait so we put our name down and walked around outside, which was no problem since this place is surrounded by graffiti.Came back exactly after an hour and was seated pretty quickly. I recommend the following brunch food: - Deviled Eggs: whipped perfectly - Baked French Toast: although it was warm and fluffy, I didn't enjoy the house-made preserves (heard they change it depending on the season)- Trail House Burger: must have been craving a burger that day cause I throughly enjoyed every last bite Reasons why I didn't give this place 5 stars: 1) We were seated in the middle of the room, which was uncomfortable to begin with. Why? People were standing at the bar and kept backing up in to our table so I didn't appreciate that. 2) The curtains were pulled back so the sun was shining through and making me sweat. Couldn't enjoy my meal anymore and just wanted to leave Service and food makes this 'gotta try it at least once' place",4.0
"Went for dinner on Thursday night.  Enjoyed a delicious whiskey cocktail, the cauliflower, bone marrow, and fried chicken dinner.  So good.  The cauliflower was good and the ricotta was super fresh.  The bone marrow was BUTTER.

"My sister and her hubby took me to this hip spot for brunch last week. This place was packed when we got there. We couldn't get table seating. Bummer! but luckily we got seats in the diner section. All of us were starving so we couldn't care less. As appetizers we got the Banana bread and Deviled eggs(3 pieces). Oh my goodness! we finished it in seconds. In fact, my sister ate two-thirds of it.This explained one thing... I need to be quicker next time.For drinks I ordered the Bloody- Mary, mimosa, and a cup of coffee. I know it sounds like a lot of drinks but I really wanted to try it. Bloody-Mary was my favorite. It was so delicious and has a spicy kick. Mimosa and Coffee were alright. For entree, I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich. It didn't disappoint. My sandwich tasted so damn good. It was juicy, well flavored, and the bun was slightly toasted. Overall, I will be back.",5.0
"Waited an hour to sit on a busy Sunday brunch rush and the wait was well worth it! The vibe is definitely hipster , but not up right at all. We sat at the bar and were welcomed by very friendly and attentive bar tenders. I had the French toast and it was the best I ever had. The sauce was the perfect amount of tangy to compliment the sweetness of everything else. My fiancé had the chicken biscuit and the chicken was perfectly marinated and fried, he really almost cried eating it. Would definitely come back again!",4.0

So naturally I felt right at home here.We went around 1pm on a Saturday and it was a 45 minute wait. Don't worry if you have to wait because you are going to be in the heart of the Bushwick Collective graffiti area. Some of NYC's best graffiti is in this neighborhood so walk around and explore while you wait!Once you get in make sure to get the deviled eggs for an appetizer. They are so good you won't want to share! I got the Spring Hash and everything tasted amazing! Also the bread pudding was pretty delicious too!I will definitely be back to this warm, cozy and super trendy spot!",5.0
"I just LOVE this place. This instantly became my new go-to spot. The atmosphere is always so chill and the food is top notch. Great corner location with a rustic cabin in the woods interior.

It has all of the hipster bar features: packed bookcases (which is a trap door FYI), vintage decor, wobbly tables and chairs and real deal deteriorating hardwood floors. All jokes aside, this spot is as legit as they come. The limited seasonal menu offers farm to table, quality, tasty food. Food:Fried Chicken: Crispy exterior with tender, juicy meat that's packed with flavor. My favorite pairing is with the spicy cheddar au gratin potatoes. Burger and beer Monday's: $10. The burger is out of this world! So sad it's only there on Mondays. Pork Belly: SAME, so damn good. Green crispy chick peas top it off. Pretty decent portion too.Watercress salad: Generous serving, light and refreshing vinaigrette.Banana bread smores: Exceptional, just get it.Butterscotch pudding: Sweet but very good.Drinks:The gambit has a light and summery taste. The bartender also surprised me with a blueberry cocktail, not sure of the name but it was delightful. Papa Midnite was my absolute fave, definitely a great summer cocktail. Service was down to earth and laid back but attentive.",5.0

Ok, maybe you're trying to make a statement and have it go with the casual atmosphere, but really? You serve your cocktails in fancy little cocktail glasses, so I accept no excuses.

When we walked through the door, we were more than pleased to see our buddy Meredith hard at work at the bar.  The bar was pretty tight but we finally got one more stool.

Right away we order a round of necessary Bloody Mary's. They have just enough kick to get the appetites going. My brother and husband get the bacon deviled eggs. The eggs get inhaled  promptly after their arrival.I know what want I want before the menu was even brought over. It's Salmon Pastrami all the way. I have not had pastrami in like half a lifetime. I only eat seafood so I was intrigued by this new pastrami form. When it arrived the salmon was presented almost lox style. The salmon came with a small scoop of egg salad, pickled onions, watercress and pumpernickel bread. I loved the dark bread layered with the crisp watercress, the creamy eggs and the fresh and spicy salmon, topped with the briney pickled onions.  So good! I could get this everytime! I saved one little triangle piece of toast and asked for some cranberry jam. Dang! It hit the spot. I ended the meal with a Switchel Cocktail. The soda is made with house made apple cider vinegar aged in bourbon barrels with ginger and maple. So I knew I had to get it.  Cocktails have been getting so sweet so this was the perfect refreshing after brunch drink. My poison is usually gin! And it married well with the soda!

"Wow. Best brunch in NYC hands down. Not even expensive.Everything was very flavorful and fresh. It was also not your obvious brunch items such as ""Eggs Benedict"" or ""Pancakes"". Think more about high quality pastrami or roast beef.

The staff is very nice and although there is a very Brooklyn/hipster vibe they don't give you any attitude even if you think you don't fit in.For $4 you can also get banana bread.

Right away we order a round of necessary Bloody Mary's. They have just enough kick to get the appetites going. My brother and husband get the bacon deviled eggs. The eggs get inhaled  promptly after their arrival.I know what want I want before the menu was even brought over. It's Salmon Pastrami all the way. I have not had pastrami in like half a lifetime. I only eat seafood so I was intrigued by this new pastrami form. When it arrived the salmon was presented almost lox style. The salmon came with a small scoop of egg salad, pickled onions, watercress and pumpernickel bread. I loved the dark bread layered with the crisp watercress, the creamy eggs and the fresh and spicy salmon, topped with the briney pickled onions.  So good! I could get this everytime! I saved one little triangle piece of toast and asked for some cranberry jam. Dang! It hit the spot. I ended the meal with a Switchel Cocktail. The soda is made with house made apple cider vinegar aged in bourbon barrels with ginger and maple. So I knew I had to get it.  Cocktails have been getting so sweet so this was the perfect refreshing after brunch drink. My poison is usually gin! And it married well with the soda! I need to go back and try that grilled Banana Bread S'More next time.  And the roasted winter hash with caramelized onions was also calling my name.",5.0
"Mmhmm yum this brunch is tasty for a cold day! Had the Baked Eggs of spiced tomato sauce, andouille sausage, spinach, cheese and toasted challah and boy did it hit the spot! Decent coffee and hot tea but wish I would have tried one of their equally appetizing cocktails. Good service and friendly staff overall. Interesting vibe inside with a mixed bag of hipsters and young professionals but great windows and natural light. I would try to call ahead for a reservation as they were busy the whole time we were there. Definitely going again soon!",5.0
"Wow. Best brunch in NYC hands down. Not even expensive.Everything was very flavorful and fresh. It was also not your obvious brunch items such as ""Eggs Benedict"" or ""Pancakes"". Think more about high quality pastrami or roast beef. Or a delicious breakfast sandwich (highly recommended).Portions may be on the smaller side (except for the roast beef sandwich), but that's even better. You get to try more awesome things. The staff is very nice and although there is a very Brooklyn/hipster vibe they don't give you any attitude even if you think you don't fit in.For $4 you can also get banana bread. It would be foolish not to order it. It is DELICIOUS.The place looks really nice and the music is pretty good (nothing weird).  Highly recommended.",5.0

"Montana's does brunch well. They offer a balanced selection of dishes such as home made granola, beans and eggs, giant slabs of bacon, devilish eggs... So much stuff and the menu changes every season, or some items do. They also offer switchel which i've never had before until Montana's and it's delicious. They age it for 30-60 days and it tastes different every time. At $5 a pop it's pricy but worth it.Montana, the owner of Montana's Trail House is very friendly and puts a lot of effort into visiting every table... greeting every guest.

"When my boyfriend suggested going to Montana's Trail House for dinner on a recent Saturday night, the only thing I could recall about it was a scathing review of it in the New York Observer last year. After reading some very positive reviews elsewhere, I was willing to give it a try, and I'm so glad we did!We arrived around 6:30 and were seated immediately in the rustic main dining area. It took a while for the server to come to our table, but we weren't in a rush, so that wasn't a big deal. We weren't hungry enough for an appetizer, so we just ordered drinks and entrees. We both had the gin and jam, which was so delicious! I honestly could have slurped down about six of those, but limited myself to two so as not to be completely trashed. For main courses, I got the fried chicken with greens and sour cream mashed potatoes, and my boyfriend got the pork shoulder. I have to say that the fried chicken was superb--the batter was amazing, and the chicken was very tender. The mashed potatoes were great as well. I'm not much of a pork connoisseur, but I tried the shoulder and it was tasty. My boyfriend loved it. For dessert we got the banana bread s'more, which was good, but not fabulous.Beyond the food, the atmosphere was cozy and warm. The tables are very close together, so having a conversation with the people next you is almost inevitable (we did just that).My only complaint had to do with the service, which was kind of slow and inattentive.

As it happened, my drink was empty and I wanted to order another one. I tried to get her attention, but she was already gone. It wasn't a major ordeal, just something I noted.

"Stopped in here today with my bf for Sunday brunch. Arrived around 12:30 so we figured we would have to wait, but were pleasantly surprised when the hostess told us it would probably be less than 30 minutes. We took a walk around the neighborhood to kill time and came back after about 20 minutes. Another 30 minutes later (making our total wait time 50 minutes) and we still had not been seated. We asked how much longer it would be and were told that we were the next party of two. A table for four which had only had two people seated at it left, and instead of separating the tables so two groups of two could be seated a party of three who had arrived AFTER us was seated. Two seats at the window also opened up and we were asked if we wanted to sit there or wait for another table. We said we would wait, as the sun was shining directly into the window, so we went into the main dining area to see if we could get a drink at the bar. Looking at the other diners seated in here, it looked like it would at least be another hour before we would be seated, so we chose to leave.

"Hey, what's with the emo music? Why are you playing it so loudly? What does Taking Back Sunday have to do with the ambience of Montana? Or a trail house? The food - both brunch and dinner - is good. The switchel and switch back are some of my favorite drinks in all of Bushwick. But it's not easy to enjoy it with the thrash punk/emo in the background. I wanna talk to my friends about our hangovers and shitty jobs. Now is not the time to get me to mosh.Also, the customer service is spotty. I'd say 60% of the time we get a great server, someone attentive and communicative. And the other 40%, they're absent (both minded and physically.) It seems to be an epidemic among Bushwick servers. They think sarcastic and aloof is the norm. I don't expect perfect service, but at least communicate when the kitchen gets slammed or the bartender is backed up. Too often our drinks come out moments before the food arrives or one person's plate comes out 10 minutes after the rest.Other than that, this place really is good. It gets packed at brunch so get there early.",4.0

Saturday brunch was only eh. We were seated immediately and the atmosphere was pretty cool. We had bloody Mary's and then I had the chicken and biscuit and my boyfriend had the baked eggs. The bloody Mary's were so spicy we had a hard time drinking them. My mouth is still burning an hour later. The chicken and biscuit was decent but didn't come with any sides and came on an enormous plate. The biscuit had an apple honey jam on it that was delicious but didn't really go with the fried chicken. To its credit the chicken was perfectly cooked. My boyfriends baked eggs were good but had what seemed like a LOT of tomato in them. We also got a side of slab bacon. Again well cooked but super super salty and hard to finish. All in all we're glad we tried it but I think we'll pass in the future.,3.0

"Lets start off this review by saying I love the fact that the design of this place isn't symmetrical at all. It's nice having a bar that's different than every New York bar/restaurant. It's the little things that count. Let's stick to talking about the decor, and let's say it's amazing. It has a southern feel with that hipster touch. They have a deer head on the wall, they use cabinets for bar storage and the music is different and definitely works for the bar. The seating is a little uncomfortable but I barely noticed until I got up from my seat. Now the food, and oh boy was it good. I had the squash cold soup and the tongue and cheek sandwich and after all that I had the smores desert. If you haven't tried it yet, you're just wasting time anywhere else.",4.0
"I'm actually torn between a 3/4 star rating. As we walked in, there wasn't a wait but the place they wanted to put us was the window bar area with the sun shining directly in your face. We asked to move and the guy was nice about it. We sat at the bar in the main dining area. The bartender lady that was there didn't seem like she knew the menu that well. Someone got a plate on the menu that looked delicious and that's what I told her I wanted to order and asked her what it was. She told me it was the Kentucky Hot Brown but when I received that order, it was not what the other customer ordered. A little disappointed. My friend ordered the house cured salmon pastrami. She wasn't that much of a fan of it but I think I wouldn't been happy with what she ordered instead of what I ordered. I think I have to try this place again except order different things and not ask the bartender lady for advice.",3.0

That's what they're doing with all that time. I like the place and the servers, but the combination of huge wait times and hit and miss food means I'll not rush back..................................................................................Updated.... also went late night, and that was good, but not nearly as good as brunch.  The corn-dog is tasty but a whole new level of greasy unwholesome.  And the DJ was way too loud, his music selection was cool, but volume was stupid, difficult to hear the person sat next to me, maybe I'm just getting old.....................................................................................Best brunch I've had a long while.  Those potatoes!  Get them.  Twice.  It took a long time for them to bring the food, long enough to lose them a star because I was so hungry.  But this was six-star food so they still got five. Go Hannah's.",3.0
"Hey, what's with the emo music? Why are you playing it so loudly? What does Taking Back Sunday have to do with the ambience of Montana? Or a trail house? The food - both brunch and dinner - is good. The switchel and switch back are some of my favorite drinks in all of Bushwick. But it's not easy to enjoy it with the thrash punk/emo in the background. I wanna talk to my friends about our hangovers and shitty jobs. Now is not the time to get me to mosh.Also, the customer service is spotty. I'd say 60% of the time we get a great server, someone attentive and communicative. And the other 40%, they're absent (both minded and physically.) It seems to be an epidemic among Bushwick servers. They think sarcastic and aloof is the norm. I don't expect perfect service, but at least communicate when the kitchen gets slammed or the bartender is backed up. Too often our drinks come out moments before the food arrives or one person's plate comes out 10 minutes after the rest.Other than that, this place really is good. It gets packed at brunch so get there early.",4.0
"The bartenders were friendly .. Food was good , small portions but the flavor were on point . I enjoyed the French toast with bacon & Biscuit  with fried chicken sandwich .",4.0
Saturday brunch was only eh. We were seated immediately and the atmosphere was pretty cool. We had bloody Mary's and then I had the chicken and biscuit and my boyfriend had the baked eggs. The bloody Mary's were so spicy we had a hard time drinking them. My mouth is still burning an hour later. The chicken and biscuit was decent but didn't come with any sides and came on an enormous plate. The biscuit had an apple honey jam on it that was delicious but didn't really go with the fried chicken. To its credit the chicken was perfectly cooked. My boyfriends baked eggs were good but had what seemed like a LOT of tomato in them. We also got a side of slab bacon. Again well cooked but super super salty and hard to finish. All in all we're glad we tried it but I think we'll pass in the future.,3.0
"Awesome! That's it.... Great service and you must order the cornbread with the smoked cheddar, mushroom gravy and sunny side egg. They had me at smoked cheddar ( oh yeah and they smoke it themselves). And get that Sticky Date Cake.... Be careful if you share with friends, there will be a fork fight!!! Soo good.",5.0
"Lets start off this review by saying I love the fact that the design of this place isn't symmetrical at all. It's nice having a bar that's different than every New York bar/restaurant. It's the little things that count. Let's stick to talking about the decor, and let's say it's amazing. It has a southern feel with that hipster touch. They have a deer head on the wall, they use cabinets for bar storage and the music is different and definitely works for the bar. The seating is a little uncomfortable but I barely noticed until I got up from my seat. Now the food, and oh boy was it good. I had the squash cold soup and the tongue and cheek sandwich and after all that I had the smores desert. If you haven't tried it yet, you're just wasting time anywhere else.",4.0
"I'm actually torn between a 3/4 star rating. As we walked in, there wasn't a wait but the place they wanted to put us was the window bar area with the sun shining directly in your face. We asked to move and the guy was nice about it. We sat at the bar in the main dining area. The bartender lady that was there didn't seem like she knew the menu that well. Someone got a plate on the menu that looked delicious and that's what I told her I wanted to order and asked her what it was. She told me it was the Kentucky Hot Brown but when I received that order, it was not what the other customer ordered. A little disappointed. My friend ordered the house cured salmon pastrami. She wasn't that much of a fan of it but I think I wouldn't been happy with what she ordered instead of what I ordered. I think I have to try this place again except order different things and not ask the bartender lady for advice.",3.0
"Gave Montana's another try about a week ago, and I'm glad that I did! The owner, Montana, met us at our table and was extremely apologetic about our first visit. Stakes were high on this second visit though, because we brought along Russell's father and his girlfriend...but we all left full and happy.We arrived about an hour after they opened on a Sunday morning, and were surprised to find the place already packed! But there were a few tables available in the front parlor area and we were quickly seated there. The hostess came over and quickly got us fixed up with coffee and water. Our waitress came by a few minutes later and walked us through the menu. She was super pleasant and helpful. She sold us on the switchel shots, so we ordered a round of those for the table. I ordered the PBB&J, Rus got the special which featured venison, and our guests ordered the french toast and the breakfast sandwich. We also got the slab bacon and a plate of the deviled eggs to share.The switchels were so good. If you love vinegar or ginger, you'll love this! We drank ours straight up, but you can try them with club soda or with rye or tequila. We started and ended our meal with a round of these! They are a must try.There was a bit of a wait for our food (again, because we came during prime brunching hour), but the staff acknowledged the wait and treated us to some of the banana bread (and delicious refills to our coffee, of course). The front room got a bit sunny during our stay, but they've actually got a stash of sunglasses that you can borrow from to ward of those rays. Especially handy for the hangover crowd. Wink wink.When our food arrived, we descended upon it. The PBB&J was so good. If you're a lover of pumpernickel bread, this is a must try! The sweetness of the preserves against the salty fattiness of the bacon is one thing...perfect. I love this adult spin on the classic PB&J. Rus' dish was also delicious and I was really loving the yolk action on the breakfast sammich.So some tips:- Either come super early (like when they open) or on the tail end of brunch.- GET THE SWITCHELS. MAKE EVERYONE GET THE SWITCHELS.- The bacon is great and anything they've got with bacon on it will be great.- The banana bread is really freakin' good, so give it a try.The end! I have to say thanks to Montana for inviting us back and kudos to him and his staff for delivering awesome service during our latest visit.

"I was here for an early dinner last night (Sunday). We were immediately seated and intrigued by the menu. What we loved: Flawless Victory, the special (Pork Chop?), Crispy Pig Ears , & Roasted Corn Hash. The portions were good enough to share and the ambiance was perfect for a Sunday. We loved being here. The whole experience is great but the food is what will bring me back. I'm sure there are many options to choose from and I scrolled through a few and I'm so glad I went with this place. The menu is not that extensive and doesn't need to be. It was perfect.",5.0
"When I first walked by this place, I thought it looked great and that I would love it.  My experience almost exactly matched my expectations.  Accordingly, if this doesn't look good to you, it probably isn't for you.  It is what it is, and you can judge this book by the cover.Chill atmosphere.  Nice staff.  Food was exotic by a lot of standards, but very good.  I had:chicken liver pate - was actually a moouse, of course but it was excellent, and a nice sized portion for a good price; well accompanied too.pigs head terrine - hell yes.  can't imagine returninging and not ordering again.tounge and cheek ruben - didn't love it, frankly; too much cheese and saurkraut, over powered the meat.  Also, I'm just gonna say I don't like being able to see the pipili and shape of the tongue, but I knew what I was getting myself into.I also didn't love my smoked drink on it's own, but thought it paired very well with the food, and was suprised when I found myself ordering another.Overall, prices were reasonable, which puts the rating over the 4.5 mark for me.",5.0

"don't you just love when you step into an overhyped venue all ready to smugly point out every flaw so that you can end up leaving with a pretentious ""told you so"" face? no? that's just me? well fine, but god damnit i'm not ashamed to report that i read these reviews, made a visit with the aforementioned intentions, and before the Check came i was already asking my crew about planning our next visit.  DAMN. GOOD. BRUNCH. aside from the charming ambience and decor (part minimalistic, part rustic cabin-in-the-woods) the food was incredible. INCREDIBLE!!!! we went for brunch; i ordered the chicken biscuit sandwich- a ginormous piece of juicy, meaty fried chicken on a flaky warm biscuit with apple jam spread. pure mastery of the sweet and savory combo i tell you. i shared an order or the fried yukons (potatoes) as well which were good but neglected for my main dish, sorry. the brunch cocktail menu was extensive albiet confusing. there was a whole section on ""swivel"" crafted cocktails and i was unfamiliar (perhaps this is a given, and swivel is a vocab word on the hipster initiation exam). swivel is aged apple vinegar so i assumed it would be reminiscent of kombucha and i was correct. i ordered a swivel + whiskey cocktail but ended up trading with my guest for their swivel rum cocktail, in which the swivel was stronger.great service and our check was delivered in a vintage book. can we go back tomorrow?",5.0

"This might sound like a bad thing, but it's meant in the best possible way - You know how if you go to Disneyland  and there is a wild West/cowboy themed ride or something like that, they do it so well that you actually feel like you are transported into the wild west? That's what this place is like, only minus the DB's and kids. The interior is beautifully done to create what feels like a very rustic 'out on the ranch' kind of feel, lots of cool old kitschy stuff and reclaimed wood and fixtures. Gorgeous. The menu fits the theme with a lot of comfort food and unusual drinks, everything about the place seems unique. They somehow managed to make what could be a really gimmicky concept classy and laid back simultaneously. It just totally worked for me.Food was great - I got the fried chicken biscuit and loved it. My better half got the root beer (?) brisket hash, that was tasty as well, but I liked mine better. We got a side of smashed potatoes and they were otherworldy good. We didn't order drinks, but you can tell they make a lot of the mixers from scratch and are definitely not what you see everyday. I am looking forward to trying out the late happy hour corndog!If I were to have any minute criticism, it would be that our food took a little while. BF was starving to the point where he couldn't concentrate and was just watching food being delivered to other tables and noticeably deflating when he realized it wasn't ours.

Staff were all very friendly.Oh wait - here is my criticism - If I ate there very often I would weigh 700 pounds. It might be worth it, but I'd rather not.  Luckily, it seems to be crowded to the point where It might not be easy to get a seat on a whim.

"I have to give it to Montana's: they provided me with what was probably my strangest and least satisfying brunch experience to date.There were two of us visiting. We ordered the Baked Eggs & Grits and the Winter Vegetable Hash. We waited 10 minutes for the table, and it took a solid 10 minutes for our waitress to make her way over to us, but, once she did things seemed fine. Then, about 35 minutes after ordering, we received the bill. Yup. But we waited, thinking that maybe somehow we miscommunicated that we didn't want to order any more. No big deal, we didn't.About 20 minutes later we started noticing the tables around us getting their food, so now about 65 minutes into our trip we asked the waitress what was happening. She looked shocked and confused, and went to check.She then came back to explain that everything was being plated and nothing had been forgotten. I had a hard time believing this but didn't fight it. She then came back a few minutes later to explain WHY everything was taking so long to be plated: ""the Baked Eggs & Grits is cooked inside a skillet and always has the longest cook time."" Just as she said this--amazingly--a couple next to us was served the EXACT same dish. They had been there for less than half the time we had. An awkward stillness ensued as she muttered the last few words of her explanation and registered our sidelong glances at the Baked Eggs and Grits sitting literally less than a foot away on the neighboring table.About 5 minutes later we got ours, and it appeared to be a very runny rendition of the dish our neighbors had received. Independent of the inconveniences thus far, so I got the waitress' attention and asked it to be put back in the oven for a minute or two. She acted VERY annoyed and took it away. It's OK, we've all had bad days. Then --yes-- the waitress returned again, this time to lower herself to my dining companion's eye level and explain, with hands clasped in a prayer position, that typically the Baked Eggs and Grits are served runny and take a long time to plate.Yep. Loud and clear. But then things got even weirder.A bearded man in overalls sat down next to me and shook my hand. Nice guy, honestly, said his name was Montana. He never said it explicitly, but I had a feeling I was in his trailhouse.Montana explained what the waitress had explained, with all the gentleness one in a managerial position typically employs when dealing with crotchety customers. Our demeanor, I think, displayed that we were not impatient crotchety customers but just that we had waited a while and wanted the eggs slightly more cooked. Plus that whole bill-before-the-food thing. Plus the waiting an hour thing. He offered us a drink to make it all better (which was nice) but we were very hungover and didn't want one. He said he'd fix the bill.So, that was totally bizarre. Quick tally: that was 5 table visits before we got the food, and one while trying to eat it. But, again, we weren't upset really -- just kind of thrown by how overbearing everyone had been. So we ate. Aaaand here's the reason for the single star: nothing we had was very good. The contents of the cast iron skillet might as well have been the tasteless sludge people will eat in the future when all joy is sucked out of the world. The veggie hash was FAR better, but better versions of this are available at nearby restaurants.So while our experience was awful, and the owner was really nice about it (which is appreciated), the 1 star comes from the food and the possible high-ness of our server -- Montana's was overpriced, not too tasty, and all in all pretty weird. Don't bother.",1.0
We just went here for drinks on a Friday night when were in town visiting friends in Ridgewood. If you're looking for the hippest hipster bar on the face of the earth then you might want to stop in and I say that with love for the sub culture. They had a DJ spinning old Rare 50's Rock and Roll 45 records.The atmosphere was on point. I couldn't stop talking about this place for the next couple weeks.,5.0

"Yesterday was our first time at Montana's, and overall I gotta say I was really pleased.We arrived towards the middle of brunch time, so the place was packed already. Our wait was a decent one but it we hung in there.The host was really nice, he kept updating me as to how long it might be. This was a nice departure from the usual having to chase the host down and ask how much longer before we can be seated.Once we were seated we waited a bit before our waitress got to us. As far as I could see she was the only one handling all the tables, and it was prime time so it was understandable, but the wait wasn't too bad. She got us some drinks, and we went straight to ordering food. I also got some coffee which was just regular coffee. Thank you Jesus!I just can't drink the dark, strong euro-coffee that everyone drinks now. What the heck did people drink before that type of coffee was even around!?The food came within a decent time, and it was quite good. Both my wife and I got the chicken biscuit, my son got the French toast. We enjoyed the food.The waitress was very attentive which was nice. The host came over and even payed us a compliment for being so patient and offered to give us complimentary drinks. He also gave my son a kids book from their library which was really nice of him.I really like the decor and style of Montana's. I love the dark rustic feel, and even that's it's a bit tight. It really gives a nice intimate feel/experience. We even had a short conversation with someone sitting right next to us.Out of everything, the customer service really got my attention. I'm huge on customer service and just a few simple things like keeping a customer informed, being kind and attentive go a long way. I definitely would go back, and we're planning on it. Looking forward to our next time at Montana's.",4.0
"Sunday brunch and as a first timer here, i was impressed by the fantastic design and concept for the decor here. it looks like it used to be an old car shop, and they kept the old vintage sign above the one for the restaurant. thats cool. Food was right up there as well. Baked eggs were ridicoulously good, and my gf's egg sammie was top notch also. Had to cut the star for the below average waitress who served us. What a waste! No smile, absent of any manners- before we sit down or look at menus- ""ok so do you know what youre gonna drink?"" jeez girl relax. but good thing the other 2 waitresses were nice and helpful.",4.0
"Wow. It's hard to express my feelings in words about the meal I had here. I lean vegetarian most of the time but last night I shared butternut squash risotto and LAMB NECK. The waitress said it tasted great, so I trusted her despite my limited experience with eating lamb... and eating necks. Good God it was amazing. Lamb tends to taste sort of rancid to me (never my meat of choice when I do eat meat), but the flavor of this lamb was mild. It mostly tasted and felt like butter in my mouth. It looks intimidating at first, just sitting there on the vertebra, but even the lightest poke of the fork will cause all of the meat to fall right off of the bone. The couple next to us who hadn't received their food yet couldn't take their eyes off of our plates. The risotto was also mind numbingly delicious, it was lighter than the lamb (thankfully) and had roasted pecans and creamy butternut squash. Who knows what else they put in there, crack? It was freezing and rainy outside and this was the perfect meal to have for the start of Autumn.The service here was great, I loved the cocktails I had, and the restaurant itself is gorgeous. It reminded me of a tavern you'd come across somewhere in the countryside. Very rustic, lots of wood and candle light. Giant bookshelf. Go here for a date, or alone, or with your mom - it will be great regardless.",5.0
Now this was exactly what I needed on a Sunday. The brunch is fantastic. I had the chicken biscuit and it is divine. Much better than the chicken biscuit at pies and thighs. French toast is pretty tasty as well. Now the switchel shots alone are worth coming here! I will never want a pickle back shot ever again. Oh and the service was great. I was worried having read some reviews about a rude waitress but my server was awesome (male w blondish hair),5.0
"My bf is not up for ""hipster food"" as he calls it, so i suggested it to my brother and so happy we came. It was still cold so we each had a hot toddy and they were very good. I really like the wild boar meatballs, you'd never guess there was ricotta in there and so fluffy. Yum! The brisket was also tasty, very tender too!",4.0
"I have to give it to Montana's: they provided me with what was probably my strangest and least satisfying brunch experience to date.There were two of us visiting. We ordered the Baked Eggs & Grits and the Winter Vegetable Hash. We waited 10 minutes for the table, and it took a solid 10 minutes for our waitress to make her way over to us, but, once she did things seemed fine. Then, about 35 minutes after ordering, we received the bill. Yup. But we waited, thinking that maybe somehow we miscommunicated that we didn't want to order any more. No big deal, we didn't.About 20 minutes later we started noticing the tables around us getting their food, so now about 65 minutes into our trip we asked the waitress what was happening. She looked shocked and confused, and went to check.She then came back to explain that everything was being plated and nothing had been forgotten. I had a hard time believing this but didn't fight it. She then came back a few minutes later to explain WHY everything was taking so long to be plated: ""the Baked Eggs & Grits is cooked inside a skillet and always has the longest cook time."" Just as she said this--amazingly--a couple next to us was served the EXACT same dish. They had been there for less than half the time we had. An awkward stillness ensued as she muttered the last few words of her explanation and registered our sidelong glances at the Baked Eggs and Grits sitting literally less than a foot away on the neighboring table.About 5 minutes later we got ours, and it appeared to be a very runny rendition of the dish our neighbors had received. Independent of the inconveniences thus far, so I got the waitress' attention and asked it to be put back in the oven for a minute or two. She acted VERY annoyed and took it away. It's OK, we've all had bad days. Then --yes-- the waitress returned again, this time to lower herself to my dining companion's eye level and explain, with hands clasped in a prayer position, that typically the Baked Eggs and Grits are served runny and take a long time to plate.Yep. Loud and clear. But then things got even weirder.A bearded man in overalls sat down next to me and shook my hand. Nice guy, honestly, said his name was Montana. He never said it explicitly, but I had a feeling I was in his trailhouse.Montana explained what the waitress had explained, with all the gentleness one in a managerial position typically employs when dealing with crotchety customers. Our demeanor, I think, displayed that we were not impatient crotchety customers but just that we had waited a while and wanted the eggs slightly more cooked. Plus that whole bill-before-the-food thing. Plus the waiting an hour thing. He offered us a drink to make it all better (which was nice) but we were very hungover and didn't want one. He said he'd fix the bill.So, that was totally bizarre. Quick tally: that was 5 table visits before we got the food, and one while trying to eat it. But, again, we weren't upset really -- just kind of thrown by how overbearing everyone had been. So we ate. Aaaand here's the reason for the single star: nothing we had was very good. The contents of the cast iron skillet might as well have been the tasteless sludge people will eat in the future when all joy is sucked out of the world. The veggie hash was FAR better, but better versions of this are available at nearby restaurants.So while our experience was awful, and the owner was really nice about it (which is appreciated), the 1 star comes from the food and the possible high-ness of our server -- Montana's was overpriced, not too tasty, and all in all pretty weird. Don't bother.",1.0
We just went here for drinks on a Friday night when were in town visiting friends in Ridgewood. If you're looking for the hippest hipster bar on the face of the earth then you might want to stop in and I say that with love for the sub culture. They had a DJ spinning old Rare 50's Rock and Roll 45 records.The atmosphere was on point. I couldn't stop talking about this place for the next couple weeks.,5.0

"Yesterday was our first time at Montana's, and overall I gotta say I was really pleased.We arrived towards the middle of brunch time, so the place was packed already. Our wait was a decent one but it we hung in there.The host was really nice, he kept updating me as to how long it might be. This was a nice departure from the usual having to chase the host down and ask how much longer before we can be seated.Once we were seated we waited a bit before our waitress got to us. As far as I could see she was the only one handling all the tables, and it was prime time so it was understandable, but the wait wasn't too bad. She got us some drinks, and we went straight to ordering food. I also got some coffee which was just regular coffee. Thank you Jesus!I just can't drink the dark, strong euro-coffee that everyone drinks now. What the heck did people drink before that type of coffee was even around!?The food came within a decent time, and it was quite good. Both my wife and I got the chicken biscuit, my son got the French toast. We enjoyed the food.The waitress was very attentive which was nice. The host came over and even payed us a compliment for being so patient and offered to give us complimentary drinks. He also gave my son a kids book from their library which was really nice of him.I really like the decor and style of Montana's. I love the dark rustic feel, and even that's it's a bit tight. It really gives a nice intimate feel/experience. We even had a short conversation with someone sitting right next to us.Out of everything, the customer service really got my attention. I'm huge on customer service and just a few simple things like keeping a customer informed, being kind and attentive go a long way. I definitely would go back, and we're planning on it. Looking forward to our next time at Montana's.",4.0
"Sunday brunch and as a first timer here, i was impressed by the fantastic design and concept for the decor here. it looks like it used to be an old car shop, and they kept the old vintage sign above the one for the restaurant. thats cool. Food was right up there as well. Baked eggs were ridicoulously good, and my gf's egg sammie was top notch also. Had to cut the star for the below average waitress who served us. What a waste! No smile, absent of any manners- before we sit down or look at menus- ""ok so do you know what youre gonna drink?"" jeez girl relax. but good thing the other 2 waitresses were nice and helpful.",4.0
"Wow. It's hard to express my feelings in words about the meal I had here. I lean vegetarian most of the time but last night I shared butternut squash risotto and LAMB NECK. The waitress said it tasted great, so I trusted her despite my limited experience with eating lamb... and eating necks. Good God it was amazing. Lamb tends to taste sort of rancid to me (never my meat of choice when I do eat meat), but the flavor of this lamb was mild. It mostly tasted and felt like butter in my mouth. It looks intimidating at first, just sitting there on the vertebra, but even the lightest poke of the fork will cause all of the meat to fall right off of the bone. The couple next to us who hadn't received their food yet couldn't take their eyes off of our plates.

"My friend swears she's been to this place in a dream. Montana's looks and feels like the rustic cabin you've always wanted, complete with a secret passageway bookcase.  The atmosphere makes you feel like you've walked out of Bushwick and stumbled into some distant relative's home in the Smoky Mountains. Came here first on a Friday evening, and loved the light flowing in the giant windows. It was serene and peaceful, a lovely place for Happy Hour with friends - so I was surprised to find it rather empty. They offer $2 off draft beers & well drinks, which might also be good for those with a heart condition, as I hear saving money helps lower blood pressure. On our next visit, three of us settled into the last empty table on a late Tuesday night and  shared a smorgasburg of apps & mains. To start, we ordered the califlower salad and deviled eggs. The salad was refreshing with bites of orange, and the deviled eggs were so good that even I, one-who-does-not-eat-deviled-eggs, kept trying to take smaller and smaller bites to make the experience last longer. (Follow up question to friends: is that what I have been missing all this time? Answer: No-uh, these are just ridiculously good). Next came the Fried Chicken Special, Winter Harvest Plate, and side of smashed potatoes. My friend loved her fried chicken plate, while two of us ""literally couldn't even"" with how good the corn cake, kale, and sweet potatoes were on the special.

Service slow and sloppy and poor knowledge of the rules Gluten Free. Maybe we chose the wrong night, perhaps exaggerated our expectations ...",2.0
"Wow. I never thought I'd find a place like this in Brooklyn. Your feel like you're in a (hipster, albeit) elk lodge of some sort in the (Montana?) wilderness. The service is incredible and the food is fantastic -- orally orgasmic in a way that is suitable for children to see in public. A tad pricey, but you expect that.",5.0
We were here for dinner on a Friday evening. The lamb shank over grits was spot on!  The banana pudding smore dessert was also very good. Definitely coming back for another meal.,4.0

"This place is ridiculously good. The service is good. The food is amazing. The atmosphere is fabulous! It has everything (and cute bartenders to boot!)

But I had the brisket hash and the skillet grilled banana bread. I also stole a bite of my friend's sausage. All was amazing!!Dinner I had to revisit the brisket. It fell apart in my mouth. My roommate loved it as much as I did. We also got the fat potatoes. (I know that's not what they're called. But they'll be that in my head forever.) So good we got two servings.

I loved that the veggies were full of wonder even though we bought them as the healthy counterpart to our duck fat and butter laden other dishes.

They must have salvaged several New England barns to cover the place in old wood, only to then have faux-wood pattern plastic countertops. The walls are covered in shitty antiques and vaguely ""wild west"" tchotchkes. The whole time you feel you are in some stupid wild west themed Bennigans or Applebees spin off.

The restaurant is gorgeous.  So much beautiful detail went into making this place look and feel authentic.  From the secret doors in the bookcases to the rusted light fixtures -  they went all out on the decor.  Atmosphere was fine - your typical Bushwick crowd.Service could be buttoned up.  Wait staff seemed like they were all over the place.  Our waitress didn't pay much attention to our two-top and was more interested in chatting with her friends.  It took about 15 minutes just to get salt and pepper on the table.The brunch menu is small and lacks a bit of creativity.  You can find these menu items elsewhere in Bushwick right now.  The brisket was dry and only came with one egg.  Very small dish that left a lot to be desired.  The baked eggs and grits were very good.  It came in a skillet with collard greens.  The banana griddle cake was great too.

"The wait to get a table is FOREVER. We sat down to enjoy a cup of coffee French toast, Kentucky brown and slab bacon. The coffee took about 20 minutes to get and was just regular drip coffee. The food took about 45 minutes to get. The French toast was amazingly good! However it is not very filling. The Kentucky brown also has a great taste and the turkey is very tender. When the bacon arrived it was pure fat. The waitress explained that is what slab bacon is - that it is a bit different; however, she did offer to bring us new bacon and it was much less fatty and crispy. That's when the manager brought the bacon. The overall taste of the food is great! Service is a bit slow and lags this is what brought the rating down to 3 stars.",3.0

"Delicious! My girlfriends came in from Maryland and we went on Yelp to find a great Sunday Brunch place. We found Montana's Trail House. Thank you Yelp! The food was great! We ordered the Breakfast Sandwich, the French Toast, the Trail House Burger, the Fries, the cheese grits, and the Banana Bread. Wow! Everything was great! The service was great as well! Oh, the Bloody Mary was delicious! I recommend Montana's Trail House for brunch.",4.0

"Montana sure does have a lot of friends... its unbelievable that this place has almost no bad reviews... other than in the pressI can't fathom anyone returning to this restaurant... unfortunately because i live in the neighborhood I have returned multiple times and each time has been worse than the rest...The food is obnoxiously over priced. under portioned. and not good... watery greens, greasy chicken... even greasier vegetables (which is weird vegetables shouldn't be greasy)The service literally couldn't be worse... never in my life have a heard the word ""chill"" used to describe menu items... and not just once it was for every single thing.... there was nothing ""chill"" about any of my experiences...The commodore is a perfect bar/restaurant severing similar food at half the cost, half the wait time and twice as good. I whole heartedly agree with the review written in the observer.  this is a Disney land theme restaurant trying to cash in on and aesthetic... the saddest part is what they don't know is that they're not pioneers... North east kingdom has been in the neighborhood for what? 7 maybe even 8 years? There's a cafe down the block with a waterfall in it!!! They're not trailblazer or trendsetters... the neighborhood is already dead and over...they might as well be selling ""jefftown"" hats and T shirts and beer cozys at a lil stand out front...if you want a drink. go to pearls. From what i can tell its an honest version of what Montana is trying to rip-off... it was nice of him to at least not open too close to them...oh wait.... it's a block away....",1.0
I wanted to love this place based on decor alone. Great vibe with a fun camp lodge feel. The food and service unfortunately was just okay. I've never waited 30 min. just for coffee and 45 min. for two meals. They really need more support staff. My gravy and biscuits were great but my BF's dish was terrible. The baked eggs were so overcooked that they looked like hard boiled eggs. It was crazy to me that they would serve a dish that was so obviously forgotten in the oven. Our server and the hostess were very friendly but we could barely get anyone's attention. It also seemed overpriced for what you receive. I wouldn't go back for brunch but maybe drinks because the space is really nice.,3.0

"The wait to get a table is FOREVER. We sat down to enjoy a cup of coffee French toast, Kentucky brown and slab bacon. The coffee took about 20 minutes to get and was just regular drip coffee. The food took about 45 minutes to get. The French toast was amazingly good! However it is not very filling. The Kentucky brown also has a great taste and the turkey is very tender. When the bacon arrived it was pure fat. The waitress explained that is what slab bacon is - that it is a bit different; however, she did offer to bring us new bacon and it was much less fatty and crispy. That's when the manager brought the bacon. The overall taste of the food is great! Service is a bit slow and lags this is what brought the rating down to 3 stars.",3.0

"had dinner here with the lady. cheddar grits, kale salad, fried chicken. grits were good (although lacked a pinch of salt). kale salad was awesome. fried chicken was super hot and super crispy... like the skin was like cracklins. chicken had decent flavor, but they only serve dark meat(thighs and drumsticks), which are my least fave pieces, but it was still good. house made hot sauce had good flavor but could've used a bit more heat(hey, i've got louisiana blood). so, i'll give 4.5 stars for the food, but 5 bold stars for the service which was impeccable from start to finish. i accidentally knocked over my beer(i was kinda excited about the chicken!) and the server cleaned the glass and promptly brought me a new beer(no charge) which is totally classy. there were also a couple of stray dudes who had come outside to smoke on the patio and when i alerted the server that i had asthma(arrrrgh, cigarette smoke!!) she kindly asked them to move. plus, the lady said the music was almost too good. indeed, it was. all in all, a great dining experience.",5.0

"The decor was awesome, light/fan fixture instead of your regular old fan, lots of candles (too much, wait til my next comment), book shelf, bathrooms are actually awesome, etc. Either way, the whole thing was totally thrown off by the claim to being an Appalachian/East coast food restaurant.  So, are you coastal or are you in the mountains?  They never meet... and I've hiked the trail before, so nice try guy.Either way, decor (though so dark I could barely see) can't make up for the lack of flavor behind the cocktails (really?! no moonshine?) or the lack of taste in the food.  Being that the bar was so dark, I couldn't see a damn thing so when I ordered, I half counted on the server to politely let me know what I was being served at the time when the delicate, flat white plat arrived... wishful thinking. You say, what? How did you not know what you ordered? I did, thank you very much, but I ordered a few things and it would have been nice to know the plates as they arrived. The pork rillette, or Ham Toast, was so flavorless; could have used at the very lease some acidity to get some flavor in there. I do have to say, the chicken liver pate was delicious.  However, the ""Spring Harvest Plate"" (mind you, this is late June) was a few vegetables (carrots & asparagus) cooked and thrown on a plate. Some vinegar, olive oil, lemon even would have helped get some of the flavor out!I wanted to focus on the food, since that's what a restaurant should focus on and be concerned with.  But let me tell you, my Miley Cyrus look-a-like server was more concerned with her butt cheek hanging out then us getting drinks and the fact that our appetizers took 20 minutes to come out (definitely heard the table next to us talk about their unexpected liver toast plate)... weird.Seriously, great concept but really failed here. I hope you get it together because my friends and I would love to enjoy a great restaurant that focuses on Appalachian trail inspired cuisine, as I'm sure many who have actually hiked the trail would.",1.0
The fried chicken is delicious. The staff is always super friendly. And I love their landscaping.,5.0
"had dinner here with the lady. cheddar grits, kale salad, fried chicken. grits were good (although lacked a pinch of salt). kale salad was awesome. fried chicken was super hot and super crispy... like the skin was like cracklins. chicken had decent flavor, but they only serve dark meat(thighs and drumsticks), which are my least fave pieces, but it was still good. house made hot sauce had good flavor but could've used a bit more heat(hey, i've got louisiana blood). so, i'll give 4.5 stars for the food, but 5 bold stars for the service which was impeccable from start to finish. i accidentally knocked over my beer(i was kinda excited about the chicken!) and the server cleaned the glass and promptly brought me a new beer(no charge) which is totally classy. there were also a couple of stray dudes who had come outside to smoke on the patio and when i alerted the server that i had asthma(arrrrgh, cigarette smoke!!) she kindly asked them to move. plus, the lady said the music was almost too good. indeed, it was. all in all, a great dining experience.",5.0

"Went here for dinner the other night and really enjoyed it! Food was great, esp the fried chicken and sticky date pudding! Service was good, everyone friendly. Overall really liked the vibe of the place. Would definitely come back!",5.0
"Place is awesome. Food is tight. Decor is unique, as is the space. The sides are really really good. Also, nobody gives a fuck if you've hiked the Appalachian trail. Read below.",5.0
"The decor was awesome, light/fan fixture instead of your regular old fan, lots of candles (too much, wait til my next comment), book shelf, bathrooms are actually awesome, etc. Either way, the whole thing was totally thrown off by the claim to being an Appalachian/East coast food restaurant.  So, are you coastal or are you in the mountains?  They never meet... and I've hiked the trail before, so nice try guy.Either way, decor (though so dark I could barely see) can't make up for the lack of flavor behind the cocktails (really?! no moonshine?) or the lack of taste in the food.  Being that the bar was so dark, I couldn't see a damn thing so when I ordered, I half counted on the server to politely let me know what I was being served at the time when the delicate, flat white plat arrived... wishful thinking. You say, what? How did you not know what you ordered? I did, thank you very much, but I ordered a few things and it would have been nice to know the plates as they arrived.
