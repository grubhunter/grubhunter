"Great place for breakfast and lunch, I work in the neighborhood and try to eat here once a week. Bit off the beaten path but worth the trip. Their bread is great, the pairings they make on the sandwiches are so flavorful they brighten up a crappy day.  My personal fav is the piglet. Truly genuine flavors that come together perfectly. They also use a lot of farm fresh seasonal products so the menu changes with the season.",5.0

"Stopped in very briefly yesterday with boyfriend to try one of their overstuffed sandwiches after an IKEA run. I'd totally have missed it if not for their chalkboard sidewalk sign.  They aren't so easy to find, as they are located mid block on a side street just off of Van Brunt.   We tried a sandwich named after a Winnie the Pooh character - Piglet, with generous ham slices, Vermont white cheddar, lettuce and a relish like mayo on a nice crusty bread.  It was tasty, filling, and had lots of character.  Definitely worth a trip for sandwich afficianadoes on their way back from or on their way to IKEA. But be forewarned, there's not a whole lot of seats, and what's there may be full, in which case, you'll need to take it outside.",4.0
Holy SHIT. This place is the bomb. Super tiny inside. Some seating. The sandwich was crunchy in the right spots and gooey in the right spots and all around CRAZY good. I'm moving in across the street just for the sandwiches. Wow. I got corned beef and it fell apart.,5.0
"Was wandering down Van Brunt st in Red Hook where I work looking for something for lunch, saw a sign for Court St Grocers Hero Shop and detoured down Sullivan St. Found the tiny little shop, read the eclectic board of sandwiches and settled on ""The Ollie"" which was Roast Turkey,Broccoli Rabe, Provolone,Siracha Honey and Mayo.Waited the few minutes in the cute little shop (the have a Calvin and Hobbes book!) listening to great classic rock (Jimi Hendrix,The Stones) and had my samich. Walked it back to the office and let me tell you this was sandwich nirvana. First off the bread is amazing, crunchy and fresh despite the humidity we had been having, the turkey is not the typical cold cut style turkey but chunks of carved turkey, the provolone which too often has no taste was the real sharp deal,the broccoli rabe was garlicky and laced with red pepper flakes, the sriracha honey was sweet and spicy as you would expect. The harmony of these flavors, sweet, spicy,salty,earthy was like a symphony! Im gonna go ahead and say it that this is the best sandwich I have had this year.     As fo the price that people seem to gripe over it was 9.00, a premium Subway sandwich is about a dollar cheaper, can you compare the two? I put this place up there with Defontes based on that one sandwich. Cant wait to try the sweet potato and beet one",5.0
"Okay so I have to start by saying that the first few times I tried Court Street Grocers right after they opened years ago, the portions were comically small.  The turkey sandwich was literally one tiny strip of chicken on wonder bread.  As a result I wrote them off along with the subsequent sub shop in Red Hook.  With great options like HBH nearby I never thought about them again.  Fast forward a few years and I found myself hunger for a turkey sandwich so decided to give them another try today.   As it turned out the Court street location was sold out of turkey and roast beef so we called the red hook location.  Turned out they had both and their prices are actually a few dollars cheaper. When I got there I realized this used to be the location of our favorite Mexican joint, Viva (oh how I miss their avocado fries and salsa). We always loved this out of the way location.  Court street made the tiny shop look great and the staff was super friendly.  We got the $9 Droopy (roast beef with horseradish sauce and fried onions on Caputos hero).  The roast beef was cooked to perfection and incredibly tender and easy to eat with no fat or mystery bits.  Just a really solid and huge sandwich (literally 3 times what they used to give you).  We also got the $8 turkey sandwich with butter pickles arugula and red onions).  It was pure perfection. Really great flavor profile and huge.  Both sandwiches are substantial but don't feel heavy or overwhelming.  They are just really well balanced sandwiches. The experience turned around my whole opinion of the company.  In fact think I may be going again tomorrow.",5.0
"This small offshoot of the sandwich counter at Court Street Grocers serves sandwich-type foods to go or eat in their cozy space. We were a little surprised that our sandwiches we were served were cold, as were later learned they were intended to be that way, but they were good. It's nice that several people who have lunch here largely know each other from the neighborhood. It adds to the neighborhoodly vibe.",4.0
"Chucky for $9.80 plus some Cheerwine made for a nice afternoon meal, even if it took longer than it should have, even with just the one friendly staffer. Closes at 4, which is a shame, but understandable.",4.0
"As a kid I was terrified of beets. The smell, color and texture...it really freaked me out. I decided to tackle my fears courtesy of Court Street Grocers. The Yam and Cheese was my ticket to beet redemption and it was incredible. Yams, beets and cheese. Holy shit. You must try this sandwich. One of the best vegetable sandwiches I have ever had.Update: I went back the next week, as soon as I was able to do so. I now dream about this sandwich. Beets flying overhead, hero bread as clouds and one hungry person laying down, hoping for rain.",5.0
"A sandwich is a subtle and elusive mistress. It seems so simple. So elegant. But can easily be over complicated and temperamental. The folks here are sandwich gurus. They effortlessly go between the classics to the adventurous. And they consistently hit home runs. My suggestion: get a classic (turkey, Italian etc) and pair it with something cool and wacky( like the Uncle Chucky). Finish it off with a soda and chips. Boom. Mic drop.",5.0

"We were in gowanus/ Carroll area, looking for some sandwiches and I'm so glad we found this place! I had the tuna and my wife had the floppy. The bread is crunchy and fresh! The sauce and toppings were perfect! Can't wait to come back and try another one. Staff is super friendly too!",5.0
"After recently having a great sandwich at Court Street Grocers (which is actually on Court Street) and also getting a craving for the amazing brownies at Baked around the corner from here, I was very excited to come try out this new Red Hook location that serves heros.This much smaller shop also has a much smaller menu - 7 sandwiches to choose from (one of which is only available for breakfast from 8 - 11 AM), and three special sandwiches.They mostly sound pretty great, but I went with the two best ones: the Smoke Thief ($11) and the Italian Combo ($9). The Smoke Thief has some really juicy pulled pork and some great vinegar slaw. There is also BBQ sauce slathered on there, which makes for a slightly messy yet very excellent and satisfying sandwich.The Italian Combo was also awesome - all the meats you know and love, arranged very neatly in a delicious, compact hero. As most people are complaining, it's a bit on the pricy side (which brings to mind The Bomb Sandwich from Sal, Kris & Charlie's in Astoria, which is at least 4 times as big for a few bucks less), but that's the premium you should expect to pay these days for a sandwich made by a guy with a beard in Brooklyn.Next time I need to go to Baked or Ikea, I'm definitely coming back here to try the Steak & Eggs Hero.",4.0
Pepe makes the best sandwiches in Red Hook and he and the rest of the staff are always super friendly. This is by far my favorite place to get lunch and the breakfast sandwich is also a fav. I only wish they were open later than 4 so I could eat more sandwiches.,5.0
"I used to work in the area, and would come in every few weeks for the incredible breakfast sandwich. (It's also quite the bargain.) Over those months I became friendly with Pepe, who is a wonderful person (and makes a GREAT sandwich). Sadly, most of the sandwiches I have enjoyed have been seasonal specials (lamb meatball was especially memorable). Most significantly is that I came in a few weeks ago for Cheerwine, for a stocking stuffer. The shop was sold out, but a manager offered to drive to Cobble Hill so I could buy a few bottles. It was an incredibly kind gesture, and the resulting joy will cross the state's borders.",5.0

"Red Hook has been crying out for a gourmet sandwich shop for a while, and Court Street Grocers delivers. Sure, you can get a $3 bagel around the corner on Van Brunt, but you really should treat yourself to a breakfast hero for a couple of dollars more here, or one of their insanely delicious rolls. It's friendly, has a local owner, is clean and the food is top notch. Salmon your fixie half a block and pay them a visit.",5.0

Pulled pork. Pulled pork. Pulled pork. This hero shop is amazing and worth stopping there if you are any where near it.
