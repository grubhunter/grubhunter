"Can't here on a quiet Sunday afternoon, the place had some tables occupied but wasn't particularly busy. We ordered some lamb shishkebab and liver shishkebab, fried potatoes with mushrooms, samsa, and achichuk salad.The achichuk (chopped tomatoes with onions) was well prepared and tasted fresh. The samsa was some of the best I've had in any Uzbek place, not overly greasy, generous amount of meat inside and very fresh.The shishkabebab was soft and delicious and not overly burnt.Overall the food was great.",5.0
"Even though I can eat for four people, a solo trip wasn't ideal to test the vast offerings here, so consider this missive a preliminary one. I didn't have any salads, which seemed big and colorful at a nearby table. Like S&P or Moody's, I'll place the rating on review for an upgrade.I got the fried potato with mushroom and onion appetizer. This was huge. I liked it but it would have worked better as a communal starter. The lamb rib kabab was juicier than the regular lamb kabab. My standards have been altered by a couple of knockout Uzbek joints in NYC; those at Chayhana Salom didn't win the taste test but were fine on their own merits. I enjoyed the red sauce.",4.0
"OMG I came here for dinner today and the food was so so delicious. I would come here more often if I'm in the area, but unfortunately, it's a bit out of the way for me.This is also my first time trying Russian food, and I think I've been missing out on this really amazing and underrated cuisine. For someone who has been paying a lot for food, I definitely appreciate the affordability of this place. Most dishes are under $10 you will not leave hungry because the portion sizes are very fair. My table ordered 4 things to share and it only came out to around $40 including tax (NOT BAD AT ALL!) The staff here is also very nice and customer service was excellent! Our table ordered a few things so I will go over them in more details. 1) Kutabi- this is a grilled pastry filled with either spinach or beef. We chose the beef because everything else we ordered already had meat in it. This was eaten with the yogurt. I thought it was okay...There wasn't anything that really stood out for me. I really do like the fact that the pastry was very light almost fluffy! I love that melt in your mouth texture 2) LAGMAN- Oh my GOSH! This had to be my favorite new dish. Lagman is a beef noodle soup in a vegetable broth. It was so flavor packed in each bite that I don't even know how to describe the taste! It was definitely really delicious and homey, which was exactly what I need on a cold snowy day like today. I thought the broth would be very heavy, but it's actually very light and easy to eat. I enjoy it very much and would probably order it again. 3) Manty- these are dumplings filled with chopped lamb and onions. We decided to go with the steamed ones instead of the pan fried ones. Honestly to me, they tasted almost like an asian dumpling because the texture and taste of the dumpling skin is very similar to that of a Chinese dumpling (Russia and China being on the same continent and all - that cultural diffusion though). The filling was different for me because I've never had a lamb dumpling before. It was flavored just right!! I guess it was pretty good but next time I'd opt for something else a little outside of the box. 4) Last but not least, the KEBABS!! - We ordered 3, beef, lamb and ribs. I'm pretty sure that for the ribs they used lamb but correct me if I'm wrong. OMG these were to die for. The meat was so tender, especially the lamb. It was just cook perfectly. The beef was cooked medium rare which I really appreciate because I've eaten a lot of bad kebabs in the past. Lastly the ribs meat just slide off the bone! They were all pretty tasty but I think I like the lamb kebabs the most!!! So make sure you check it out.",5.0
"The food was very good and we enjoyed ourselves. I really enjoyed the beautiful full pot of tea. It really set the mood to slow down and enjoy our meal. We ordered the mantou and felt it was a little greasy, though. I loved the sauce that came with it.The pilav was really different from anything that I've experienced. I wish that I could have eaten more, but I was stuffed. We took leftovers home, so know that the portions are generous and the cost was really affordable- I love Brooklyn!They have a large TV and were playing a futbol/soccer match and another customer was sitting and enjoying the game complimented by a pot of tea. The restaurant looks newly renovated and is brightly colored- it is very clean. Most of the tables seated four, but I imagine that you could easily accommodate a larger group. There are lots of great shops in the area, so you can stroll around and buy a little bit of everything from the groceries there.",4.0
"Very delicious Uzbek food.  We had two appetizers -- the samsa and the fried liver cubes.  I can highly recommend both.  For entrees, we had the plov and the fried lagman.  On reflection, perhaps it was unwise to order two starches, but both entrees were great!  The lagman noodles were wonderfully chewy.  The plov rice was very well seasoned.  Service is friendly, and  everything is served  on lovely china.   We saw some interesting skewer dishes being delivered to other tables and want to return to try them!The one discordant note was the adjoining table at which was seated a party who had apparently read about Chayhana Salom in the NYT.  The head of the table was a ""mansplainer"" who, of course, ordered for the table.  The restaurant is mere steps from the Sheepshead Bay stop on the Q line.",4.0

"I love this place. If you want some authentic, excellent, delicious Uzbek food, this is where to go. I have not ordered for takeout from here, and have only been here twice. On both occasions it was with a friend, and we ordered way too much. I don't have any particular recommendations, because we ordered blind on both occasions: a soup, a hot appetizer, two entrees, or some combination thereof. Every dish we got was excellent. I can't get the people whinging about the place. One point: be sure to ASK for the kompot -- traditional beverage -- because I don't think it's on the menu, and sometimes they are all out. Oh yeah, and get a tea as well. I wish I had the food vocabulary to go into some exquisite descriptions etc. etc. etc. - I don't. It's just bloody delicious. Love this place.",5.0

"I am kind of confused by the 4.5 star ratings for this place. Let me start at the beginning about my experience, and where it all started to go down the tubes.1. Order took 1:30 hours to be delivered, attempted to call the place over 10x without a response (may be they should invest in a call waiting). 2. I ordered specifically NO ONIONS due to my allergy, but what do I get? I get a dinner full off ""delicious onions"". I could not eat 85% of my order. NO BREAD, NO SIDES, NO UTENSILS, AND MY SNAPPLE WAS MISSING :(3. The food was OK quality, I've had much better.4. Delivery man tried to charge me for my order twice.As you all can tell, I am highly disappointed and this will be my first and last time ordering from this spot! I do NOT recommend!!! The only reason they are getting the ""2 stars"" I gave is because the Samsa was good.",2.0

"I had been dying to try this place, and finally after a long run on the boardwalk decided to stop in. You can't miss the bright green and red awning outside on sheepshead bay road. Of course there is street parking out front but to the right where the road divides there is a pay for parking area. The place is tiny and homey with a total of 9 areas to sit, mostly 4 tops but some 6. I was seated promptly and started in on the menu. Which was both in English and in Russian. I started my meal with some hot green tea and the bread. It was warm and toasted and delicious.For dinner I tried the Plov and the lamb samsa. I wasn't able to eat all of it but had dinner for the next day. The plov was wonderful, heavenly, seasoned well, and the rice very soft. The lamb samsa was nice and tender, not overcooked, and well seasoned. The waiter was very friendly, checking in frequently but not too much that it became bothersome. He spoke very good English and was easy to understand. At one point even the chef stopped by the table to say hello and asked if I enjoyed my meal.  The answer: definite yes.Any time you are in Brooklyn and looking for Uzbeki food, definitely stop in here. You will not be disappointed!",4.0
"I don't know anything about Russian (or Uzbek) food. I'm not even sure what we ordered, my lady did the ordering. But it was all incredibly tasty. I had something with lamb and rice in it, something with potatoes in it. Both things in a pastry-type bread.  I had another dish, but I don't remember what it was, but it was so tasty.... As you can read, I have no idea what I'm talking about, but, if you think of it, what better critic can there be than someone who goes in there totally blind and unknowledgeable.

The Reviews are FAKEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!With 10 other same style cuisine restaurants in the area who do not come close to this amount of reviews and this amount of stars is just simply beyond me.

As you can see by my reviews I have a good heart and If a place of business forces me to leave anything below a 3 star review means they left a nasty impression on me. Not one of my partners or co workers said anything good about this place. I was the moron who suggested it based on its outstanding reviews out of nowhere I knew it had to be a FAUX!!!! The delivery took over an hour and the place is down the block from us. literary a 3-4 minute walk. Food was taste less. Chicken was to dry and flavor less and the salads were not sliced or mixed properly. Tomatoes tasted like rubber. As if no effort was put into making the food and preparing the dishes.STAY AWAY!,1.0

"This place is good for a fast meal after work. A few of their dishes would make a decent workday lunch. I would stick to traditional Uzbek dishes and avoid anything thay sounds like the chef's creation. For example the Chayhana salad is advertised as having tongue. Well, it had a homeopathic dose of the stuff. Can it be so hard to source enough tongue? The salad was also bland. Add mint to the yogurt sauce, and we may have something. Get the lulya kebab. Now THAT was delicious! The shurpa soup was great, except my bowl had a huge piece of boiled carrot and two tiny pieces of lamb most of which was fat. The broth was delicious, but would it be so hard to make sure each bowl contains meat and properly portioned vegetables? The kebabs were decent, but nothing one can't make at home with a charcoal grill. These were served with a yogurt sauce, and this is yet another sticking point. The sauce tasted like diluted sour cream (which is NOT the problem). The problem is that it adds nothing to the dish. Where is the cumin? Mint? Paprika? Something to add a dimension to the food!Finally, the famous Uzbek tea, for which my expectations were high, was weak. That's all I can say about it. Please put more leaves in the pot. How much does bulk green tea cost? Certainly not enough to skimp on it! The service was fast and courteous. The place has a clean decor, although I would go for a more cozy layout with soft ottomans and low tables to create a far eastern charm.",2.0

"Read some previous reviews before trying this place and I agree....there is a lot of fat used in the cooking.   I got over it quickly.  The food was, for the most part, delicious.

A chicken kebab was our poorest choice.   To me it tasted sour.  But the owner checked it out and said it might be the spice that I'm not used to.  In any event, she removed it from the check.  I will definitely return, but the kebabs will not be in my order.",4.0

"We came here as a group and the restaurant was very welcoming and friendly. Immediately they set up our table and their service was fast and uninterrupted. We ordered three dishes and shared it among ourselves. Our first dish, Uygur Lagman ($9), was a hand-pulled noodle dish that was served in a tomato-based broth with chunks of seasonal vegetables and beef.  Their noodles were a bit chewy and eggy but it tasted perfect once we added the warm tomato broth and mixed it thoroughly before eating.We also tried their Manty ($6.50) dish, which were steamed dumplings filled with chopped lamb and onions. Unfortunately their dumplings were okay as chunks of lamb fat were found in the dumplings which made it a bit unappetizing. Lastly we ordered their Lamb Kabobs ($4 each) and I have to say their kabobs were absolutely delicious. The four pieces of lamb cubes was marinated perfectly and matched very well with a side dish of their thinly sliced red onions in vinegar. Moreover the meat was not only tender, moist and soft but it was also savory and delightful. Since I don't live nearby, I'm not sure if I would venture back here but if you're around the neighborhood, I would suggest checking them out, especially if you fancy ethnic  cuisine. Lastly, this is a BYOB restaurant so you can't really beat that!!!",5.0

Definitely worth the trip from Manhattan.",4.0
"Went here with three others after reading the Times review of this place. We got ordered quite a few dishes and here are some highlights:Samsa - these guys know how to do their samsa right. Perfectly baked with just the right amount doughy-ness in the crust. Chicken samsa was excellent, but the pumpkin looked excellent as well.Korean Carrot salad (not on the menu), is excellent and available if you ask for it. It's a pretty small portion, but make sure you get some of the lepyoshka bread to mop on leftover juice.Plov - wait, where did they get yellow carrots? This is the real deal, folks. Not quite as oily or cumin seed-laden as as other places, but that can be a good thing. Ask for a few slices of pepper to add some kick to the dish.What held me back from giving 5 stars was that their lepyoshka bread was a bit small. Manti was pretty standard but didn't blow me away and plov meat (though tender) could have used a bit more char and additional spice. Overall, it was a great experience. Staff were extremely friendly and could accommodate all our requests. You can tell by the decor and even the plates/utensils that they give attention to detail. I'll be back to try the dimlama, samsi, and wash it all down with some green tea.",4.0

"Had their food over a year ago and it was great, but they have disappeared off Seamless a while back, so when I saw them back on today I was quite excited... Placed an order... 10 mins later and no confirmation - I call them up. The number is busy. I keep calling for 10 minutes straight - the number is still busy. I am pretty hungry, but I can't order elsewhere cause these guys might still come through and then I'll have two orders on my hands. So I call up Seamless (20 minutes have elapsed from the original order at this point) and now I am on hold for 15 minutes (it's Friday night so they are busy, too). So then I speak to a guy who puts me on hold for 5 minutes (reasonable) trying to get a hold of Chayhana, then comes back and tells me to do what I have to do, cause he can't get through, and if the Chayhana delivery guy shows up - turn him away.So, I just wasted 40 minutes. If Chayhana can't handle the volume - don't make yourself available on Seamless! Or call them back and tell them you are unable! Or, at least, get a second line so you people can get through!

"Not all Uzbek restaurants are alike.While it's always entertaining and instructive to see the two distinct groups of Uzbek restaurants: those  owned by Bukharian Jews in Rego Park compared to the predominantly Muslim ones in Brooklyn, most of these can trace their roots to the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. So, it was interesting to find one that claims to represent the cuisine of Tashkent.Tashkent is known as ""the city of bread"" to residents of nearby lands, and so I was thrilled to find a different version of the turban shaped Non common in the city's Uzbek restaurants. ""Our Non is called: Patr, and it is much smaller, denser and with more chew than the other Nons in the city"", explained the server to me. I really liked Patr, but hope that restaurants in the city will be able to showcase the 20+ different versions of Non/other breads common in Uzbekistan.Beyond Uzbek staples like Manti (steamed dumplings with lamb), Chuchvara (fried dumplings), and Achichuk Salad (onion and tomato salad), Chayhana Salom also has other interesting variants that reflect Tashkent cuisine, though some are only in name. Of the latter: Varaka (crispy pastry filled with thin sliced lamb) is essentially the same as Chebureki; while Khamir Khasip (steamed dough stuffed with meat and rice) also has cousins in the city's restaurants. The Tashkent variants featured include: 4 different kinds of Samsa (a crisp version with any of lamb, chicken, pumpkin fillings) and a softer version. Their ""Tashkent Plov"" is cooked slightly differently as well and includes both yellow and red carrots in addition to a boiled egg, and the sticky rice dish is somewhat sweeter than other versions of Plov.The more interesting dish on the menu is the ""Organic fried Cornish hen ""Ugolok"" style"" that takes 30-40 minutes of preparation, and is served with garlic and Coriander. Similarly, I've liked the Uygur Lagman as well, and while researching its history learned that the noodles were featured only in Uzbek soups (ergo, Lagman Soup) till the Uygurs migrated westward from China after persecution in the 19th century. As a result, the Uzbeks also started featuring a new dish, that had noodles served separately from the sauce, which had a different consistency from the soup, a dish they called Uygur Lagman. Their Kebabs/shashlik are fantastic, and some of the best and smokiest versions in the city - though I would prefer if they featured more cumin. These are what bring customers back to the restaurant, and I've seen repeat customers in my two visits alone. Service is courteous, fluent in Russian and surprisingly competent in English which isn't common at least in the Uzbek restaurants in Queens.However, I'm not sure that I agree with their name. ""Chayhana"" is a term common across Central Asia for tea houses: where people come to sit, drink tea, and talk. No such time extravagance is possible at Chayhana Salom, as was made abundantly clear to me when the cashier (not the uber polite servers) brought me the check before I was done eating, as there was a reservation for my table.",4.0
"We came here as a group and the restaurant was very welcoming and friendly. Immediately they set up our table and their service was fast and uninterrupted. We ordered three dishes and shared it among ourselves. Our first dish, Uygur Lagman ($9), was a hand-pulled noodle dish that was served in a tomato-based broth with chunks of seasonal vegetables and beef.  Their noodles were a bit chewy and eggy but it tasted perfect once we added the warm tomato broth and mixed it thoroughly before eating.We also tried their Manty ($6.50) dish, which were steamed dumplings filled with chopped lamb and onions. Unfortunately their dumplings were okay as chunks of lamb fat were found in the dumplings which made it a bit unappetizing. Lastly we ordered their Lamb Kabobs ($4 each) and I have to say their kabobs were absolutely delicious. The four pieces of lamb cubes was marinated perfectly and matched very well with a side dish of their thinly sliced red onions in vinegar. Moreover the meat was not only tender, moist and soft but it was also savory and delightful. Since I don't live nearby, I'm not sure if I would venture back here but if you're around the neighborhood, I would suggest checking them out, especially if you fancy ethnic  cuisine. Lastly, this is a BYOB restaurant so you can't really beat that!!!",5.0
"Great food for the price. They serve only Halal meat, the portions are big, and the waiters are friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Uzbek meal.",4.0
"Just had lunch there and the food & service was great! The Ali-Baba salad was wonderful, pumpkin samsa was good, meat pastry was wonderful & lagman was great! The kebobs (we got lamb & lulya) were okay and big, but I wasn't crazy over it honestly. Either way, I'll be back!",4.0
These guys are great and the food is amazing and ALWAYS high quality. Love the place and have gone back multiple times. Luckily there's always space there too. They include a 10% service charge but everything is so good we always leave an additional 10-15 % tip. THANK YOU!,5.0
"Delicious, inexpensive and filling. Lamb was excellent.  It's hard to pick a favorite dish. We had the fries lagman which were very tasty and had great texture. The plav with lamb was outstanding. The lamb filled steamed dumplings were excellent. And the baked lamb-filled pie was perfect. We picked up a bottle of wine down the street and had a great dinner. Definitely worth the trip from Manhattan.",4.0
"Went here with three others after reading the Times review of this place. We got ordered quite a few dishes and here are some highlights:Samsa - these guys know how to do their samsa right. Perfectly baked with just the right amount doughy-ness in the crust. Chicken samsa was excellent, but the pumpkin looked excellent as well.Korean Carrot salad (not on the menu), is excellent and available if you ask for it. It's a pretty small portion, but make sure you get some of the lepyoshka bread to mop on leftover juice.Plov - wait, where did they get yellow carrots? This is the real deal, folks. Not quite as oily or cumin seed-laden as as other places, but that can be a good thing. Ask for a few slices of pepper to add some kick to the dish.What held me back from giving 5 stars was that their lepyoshka bread was a bit small. Manti was pretty standard but didn't blow me away and plov meat (though tender) could have used a bit more char and additional spice. Overall, it was a great experience. Staff were extremely friendly and could accommodate all our requests. You can tell by the decor and even the plates/utensils that they give attention to detail. I'll be back to try the dimlama, samsi, and wash it all down with some green tea.",4.0

"Had their food over a year ago and it was great, but they have disappeared off Seamless a while back, so when I saw them back on today I was quite excited... Placed an order... 10 mins later and no confirmation - I call them up. The number is busy. I keep calling for 10 minutes straight - the number is still busy. I am pretty hungry, but I can't order elsewhere cause these guys might still come through and then I'll have two orders on my hands. So I call up Seamless (20 minutes have elapsed from the original order at this point) and now I am on hold for 15 minutes (it's Friday night so they are busy, too). So then I speak to a guy who puts me on hold for 5 minutes (reasonable) trying to get a hold of Chayhana, then comes back and tells me to do what I have to do, cause he can't get through, and if the Chayhana delivery guy shows up - turn him away.So, I just wasted 40 minutes. If Chayhana can't handle the volume - don't make yourself available on Seamless! Or call them back and tell them you are unable! Or, at least, get a second line so you people can get through! Highly disappointed, because the food - at least a year ago - was great, but now I have a bad taste in my mouth, so when in the neighborhood and looking to eat in - I'll walk down two blocks closer to Emmons.Be mindful when ordering online!",1.0

We were thinking it might not be enough, but once the plates started coming in, it wouldn't fit on the table. All the appetizers were devoured within minutes, they ranged from crispy to deliciously fried. By the time the main dishes arrived, we were almost full, but we managed to scrape the entire plate. Then spent another hour or so chatting, and then it was time to close and the bill came, it was an amazing $65 and change, and we were thinking how cheap the food is, and on top of that it was delicious, the service was nice, the decor was good, sitting was comfy, restroom was clean.

"Chayhana Salom had the disadvantage of being the second stop on a Sheepshead Bay double-header with Cafe Glechik across the street. I was trying to make the long journey out to these parts worthwhile, but the net result was that I wound up stuck in a chair for nearly an hour after the meal, trying to decipher Uzbek pop videos, stomach bulging out of my mid-section while attempting to digest copious about amounts of meat.None of this Chayana's fault, except for that the unusually large menu of Central Asian choices left far too much temptation to over-order. Uzbek cuisine, if not exactly on every corner, is pretty well represented in southern and eastern Brooklyn, enough that there's room to make comparisons on the individual offerings of the restaurant rather than the cuisine itself. We focused partially on food not easily found elsewhere in the city. We started with a mash-up of a soup, the chuchvara in laghman sauce. As the name suggests, the red oily accompaniment for the ubiquitous noodle dish of the Steppe was used here as a slightly sour base for small dumplings. These chuchvara were slightly smaller than the average pelmeni and tasted roughly the same. The soup isn't as spicy when served over pasta and had a flavor not too dissimilar from solyanka, a workaday soup popular in Greater Russia.We also nibbled on a chicken samsa, a common dish here filled with an uncommon protein, and also some pretty straightforward manti. Everything was done well and there were a wide variety of dishes available - not a guarantee at a small family run establishment like this. Let me dial that praise up a bit - I think this is the best Uzbek restaurant in the City at the moment. I'm ready, after just one visit, to hand over the crown from the long-time champion, Cafe Kashkar.

"I really enjoyed this unique restaurant. To start, I love this neighborhood, by the water, built up, very ethnically diverse. The restaurant is situated on a busy street filled with commotion. This restaurant had three tables when we came in, so this isn't the most popular. I have never had food from Uzbekistan before, so I thought this would be a treat. The decor was very nice, with a pleasant, modern vibe. Service, a bit slow, and not the greatest at English. We started off with two Kutabi, or pastries stuffed with ground beef and spinach. These were really good. The pastry was light and the beef was seasoned well. They also gave us some bread to start, which tasted like it was made back in Uzbekistan. We also shared a Lagman soup, which was a pretty large portion. The broth was interesting and the noodles and beef were quite nice overall, but I would suggest ordering more hot appetizers since those were really delicious. I had the Plov ""Tashment,"" or lamb over rice pilaf with red and yellow carrots. The lamp was quite bland and very dry, but the rice was seasoned well and the carrots were really interesting. It also came with a little quail egg, which was cute and surprisingly yummy. Next, we got Khamir-Khasip, which is dough with meat and rice in a red sauce. This was very impressive, although a bit small for an entree. This is a recommended dish. We also needed to get one of their kabobs, so we split a lamb kabob. It is served on a huge metal skewer (it is very sharp) and is served really hot. It is the best bargain, since there is so much meat. The lamb was maybe the best I ever had. It was seasoned beautifully, cooked perfectly, and was so juicy and delicious. Come here if you are craving something a little out of the ordinary.",4.0

"Best meat stuffed grape leaves I have had in NYC!   Tucked away on a depressed street in Sheepshead Bay, this restaurant is like stepping into another world.   With Tashkent tourist tschatshies , Gilt edged china, Russian language TV and friendly waitstaff with not a lot of English (ordering was a game of point and mime)  Chayhana Salom is an immersion experience. Google translate helped me ask for lemon!The food was worth the 45 minute ride from the UES.   Everything we ordered was perfect from the lamb filled Samsas , the delicate Sigars, to the Pilaf and wonderful desserts( we tried one and brought the two others home!) But the grape leaves were the best.  I have eaten them all over the US ethnic restaurant world  and these are by far among the best I have ever had.  I brought two orders home and had them for breakfast this morning.There is a reason Chayhana Salom is a NYT Critics Choice, the  quality, flair and portions of home made food are good enough to rival any you will find in NY.  With the added benefit of a stroll along the water you will feel as if you have been on vacation.",4.0

The best staff ever. Real authentically Uzbek homemade food. Nice people. Officiant waters.  The owners an chef are really nice.Not expensive. Clean. Quiet.We spend couple of hours celebrating with elder parents and grandparents.Were happy.Will cone again and will recommend for friends and family members.With love from Bronx (Tatarstan originated);)),5.0
"I took a group of friends here since none of us had had Uzbeki food before.  It was really early in the evening and not busy.  The owner/chef came out of the kitchen to chat with us and offer suggestions for dishes since we weren't familiar with any of it.  She was really friendly and very helpful.We tried some baked meat stuffed pies, some steamed meat dumplings, a dish of hand pulled noodles with accompanying meat and veggie stew, and a marinated fried hen.  We also got a pitcher of iced tea flavored with dried fruits and spices that was delicious and reminded us of homemade applesauce.Everything was delicious and reasonably priced.  I think the group as a whole liked the hand pulled noodles the best, but my favorite dish was the steamed dumplings.  I plan on making this place a regular stop on my shopping trips to Brooklyn.",5.0
"To go with the great food, bring along Vodka and mix with their special fruit punch or go to the Bodega on the right and get Baltika Dark for $1.50. Whatever you drink go here and eat Uzbek/Russian food. Great hangover dish is the potatoes and mushrooms dish. Kutarbi for appetizersThe fried lagman was one of the best hand pulled noodle dishes with such amazing flavors. Enjoy watching the kitschy Uzbek MTV.",5.0
"Best meat stuffed grape leaves I have had in NYC!   Tucked away on a depressed street in Sheepshead Bay, this restaurant is like stepping into another world.   With Tashkent tourist tschatshies , Gilt edged china, Russian language TV and friendly waitstaff with not a lot of English (ordering was a game of point and mime)  Chayhana Salom is an immersion experience. Google translate helped me ask for lemon!The food was worth the 45 minute ride from the UES.   Everything we ordered was perfect from the lamb filled Samsas , the delicate Sigars, to the Pilaf and wonderful desserts( we tried one and brought the two others home!) But the grape leaves were the best.  I have eaten them all over the US ethnic restaurant world  and these are by far among the best I have ever had.  I brought two orders home and had them for breakfast this morning.There is a reason Chayhana Salom is a NYT Critics Choice, the  quality, flair and portions of home made food are good enough to rival any you will find in NY.  With the added benefit of a stroll along the water you will feel as if you have been on vacation.",4.0
"I've been here a couple of times now and they are great. The food is delicious and the portions are very reasonable. The price is excellent and the service is good as well. Their kebabs are very flavorful and never overcooked. The salads are fresh and delicious.It is helpful if you speak russian because it makes it easier to communicate with the staff, but is by no means a requirement. The menus are in both english and russian so nobody should have any trouble.",5.0

"Ordered their plov Tashkent and lamb samsa. Both were delicious! This place is, quite strangely, empty more often than not. Even on weekend evenings when most of the Japanese restaurants in the area are packed to capacity, this place struggles to fill half its tables.

I took off 1 point for smaller than in most places amount of salad for ($6.00), sub-par Rib kebab and needing a bit more meat in Plov Tashkent for ($8.00) .

"One of the better Uzbeki restaurants I've been to.

"Would've rated 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. Came to visit family from out of state and this restaurant is close by and we wanted try something new. This is the first time we had this type of food so I don't have anything to compare to. But it tasted good and tasted better than I expected. We tried all the pastries and the lamb kabobs. They all tasted great. The pastries were a bit greasy as mentioned by some reviewers. We placed a order for pick up and was told over the phone that it would be 30 minutes and was told that the $5 coupon ""off any bill"" offered from yelp was for dine in only. We tried explaining that the coupon never mentioned anything about dine in only and it was bit hard to communicate because the person only spoke in broken English. We placed the order anyway thinking just show them the coupon when we go pick up the food. I was told that the order would be ready in 30 minutes. After 1 minute, she called back and ask if I still wanted to place the order and I told her yes. After 5 minutes maybe less she calls back and said the food is ready. The timing was off by about 24 minutes. I'm 100% sure she said 30 minutes because I asked twice. After we arrived to pick up and showed them the coupon, they still tried to refuse it and said it was dine in only. After few minutes of talking they finally honored it. The food is very reasonably priced and tasted very good. If it wasn't for the miscommunication I would definitely rated it 5 stars.",4.0
"As an admitted Manhattanite who rarely travels off the main island, I was concerned when my friends suggested a Brooklyn restaurant. However, I had the greatest time at Chayhana Salom. The food was crazy good and definitely worth the trip. We had a party of 6 and the staff was great. We ate family style and I tried pretty much everything on the menu. I think my favorite was the Fried Chuchvara. Each of the kabobs we ordered were very moist and tasty. I'm always concerned about dry kabobs, but you won't find those at Chayhana!  Also, the prices were great! I think the total bill was about half of what we would have paid in Manhattan.I will definitely be making the trip again!",5.0

"I tried this place because of the startlingly high reviews, although the service was mediocre, the kebabs were great! Being that we are not uzbtek we ordered some kebabs, a samsa and a permuda based on the reviews. The waitress was fairly unwelcoming, saying things like, ""oh that's it? What do you want to drink? No bread?"" First off, water was not given to us right away and second I did not see bread listed anywhere on the menu (Which costs 1.50 for a circle of bread btw) AND the water tasted really weird....My brother and I got lamb filling for the samsa and permuda, the samsa is hard flaky pastry shell where as the permuda was a soft pastry skin. To me (an avid pastry fan) these items did not particularly stand out, the filling tasted the same for both of them as well. The kebabs were the best!! We tried beef, lamb, ribs, chicken and luyla (ranked in order of deliciousness). The lamb kebab wasnt as good as anatolian gyro down the block. The luyla turned out to be ground lamb mixed with onion and garlic.In conclusion, I would definitely come again for the kebabs... probably for take out since there is an additional 10% service charge and it was difficult to get a waiter/waitress to assist us.Notes: 1)Samsa does not come with lamb, chicken and pumpkin; you have to choose one of those options.2) There is a service charge equivalent to 10% of the bill3) Water tasted really weird",4.0

The place is BYO so we brought some vodka and pomegranate juice (excellent, though dangerous, mix, by the way).We started with samsas and two other appetizers that were all superb. Perfect spices and fried taste plus the best yogurt sauce I've ever eaten. For the main course, I had Tashkent Plov (pilaf with lamb and quail egg) while my friends had Manti (meat dumplings) and Laghman (fried noodles). Everything was unique and astounding.

One beef, one greens, both crispy outside, hot and lightly but tastily filled. This was followed by the khanum, thin-skinned dumplings filled with shredded potatoes and onions and topped with tomato sauce. They had forgotten our order of sigar, rolled pastries with feta and greens, but when we asked about them, they were apologetically rushed to our table. Also delicious, though maybe not the best way to close the meal given their fried heaviness.",4.0

"First came here when I moved into the neighborhood, and was waiting for the landlord to show so I could get into my new digs. Needed to kill some time and eat some food, and I'm always up for something new. This place was close and had good reviews, so I gave it a shot. First thing I had was the Ugyr lagman, which is a pile of handmade noodles with a delicious sauce. Cleaned the plate with the very pretty bread they offered me, it was just that good.Couple weeks later I decide to try out the deal, and try a few more things on the menu. Ordered out this time, got the Lagman (Noodle) soup which was very good, but a bit oily. Got my first skewers, which were great, as well as dolmas and the plov. (Feed myself for a few meals, right? Maybe not. I just kept eating. Probably will get two servings out of this.) The skewers were simple, but well done, as skewers should be. The dolmas were delectable, I do love grape leaves, and the plov that everyone raves about was good, but lacking the complexity to make me rave about it like the rest of the reviewers.All in all, I will be back.",5.0

"Nice interrior, as expected Uzbek themed. Food is decent. However Lagman was without anise, and Samsa was a bit burnt on the bottom. But overall, very nice, cozy restaurant.  Just don't sit by the door in cold weather. *When getting a check read it carefuly. They add service charge (tip) automatically.*",4.0
"Great Uzbek cuisine in unpretentious, but clean and decent surroundings. Try they soups (the portions are big) and plov. To add atmosphere, naive Uzbek music clips are playing on the TV. Everyone is speaking Russian, but it should not be a problem. One more sign of the authenticity of the place is that they don't serve alcohol except for beer.",5.0

"This place is great! It's BYOB and there are plenty of markets nearby to pick up something to drink. The owner and servers were very friendly and made the experience here delightful. We got the samsa, beef and spinach pastry, feta salad, and pickled veggies to start. Everything was really good, especially the pickled tomatoes! We had the plov, lamb kebab, uygur langman and bread. We finished the meal with the chak-chak. I recommend all of it! Really unique and a great dining experience!",5.0
"I am not a huge lamb fan and we managed to order about 6 lamb dishes out of our total of 9 dishes, so that might be why Chayana Salom isn't getting 5 stars. I give them major credit for making lamb dishes that i ate, even enjoyed, but after a while I couldn't take any more lamb (note to the wise, I'm pretty sure not all lamb dishes are marked as such and the ""meat"" ones are often lamb)! So next time, I'll read the menu more carefully to ensure a more balanced meal. The assorted pickled vegetables were fabulous!",4.0
"What a great surprise. Saw the excellent reviews and was cautiously optimistic. The food is home cooked and so tasty. Price was excellent and the staff were very friendly. The owner/chef came over to say hello and offer suggestions for the next time we come, which I will be doing for sure.",5.0

"First came here when I moved into the neighborhood, and was waiting for the landlord to show so I could get into my new digs.

"This was my first experience with Uzbek food and it turned out well.  The place is nicely decorated, clean, well lit, and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The waiter patiently described what each menu item was since there was not an English explanation written.Although the potato dumpling appetizer was filling, 4 hefty pieces, they were somewhat bland.  However, the Plov, which was like a rice pilaf with meat, was very good.  Even better was the Laghman, a chewy noodle dish with a very tasty sauce.  Did not try any desserts since I was full by that time.Definitely a pleasant experience dining here.",4.0
"This place was phenomenal. Had a (birthday) dinner for 25, which they handled flawlessly, with maximum attentiveness and minimum pushiness, a problem at some other places where Russian is the lingua franca. Not to mention it cost what a dinner for five would cost at a place half as good in Manhattan, and we hauled home two huge bags of takeaway. Not that this is a valid comparison, as the food at Salom is both singular and expertly prepared. (And it's BYOB!) I have been to other Central Asian places in south Brooklyn, but this one wins. The crowd was a mix of Americans and us Russian speakers, vegetarians and meat-eaters, gluten-frees and gluten-fuls, and everyone waddled off blissed and grateful. The kutabi, the samsa, the manty, the plov, the dimlyama -- it was all finger-lickin'. It's a pleasure to post about a place that just rocked it. Thank you, Salom!",5.0
"Had a Sunday lunch here and left home happy and full. This place is BYOB so we had a bottle of vodka with us. We ordered  Lagman and Mastava soups which were both delicious followed by kebabs: beef, chicken and beef liver. The kebabs were outstanding! The meat was tender and juicy and went so well with fresh red onions in vinegar. The service was attentive and fast, the place nicely decorated and clean.  Definitely going back to try many other dishes on the menu.",5.0
