"My friends and I came to this restaurant as a party of 9, ready for a night out in a friendly, homey atmosphere. We were blown away by the service and food at this place, and will certainly be back. I feel like the people working there need to know how much we appreciated their stellar service and enthusiasm. We knew we would have a wait, as it was a Saturday night and the place is pretty tiny, but the staff showed us to the ""chef's table"" area, which is literally in the kitchen where you can watch the pizzas come out of the brick oven. There are cookbooks on the walls and it is very clean, and we were promptly served drinks. I tried a friend's gin cocktail and it was definitely tasty and strong. I felt like I was in my family's kitchen - we were even introduced to the (I think) grandson of the man who originally built the brick oven that they use today! It was built back in the 1800s!When we were seated, the table was comfortable and accommodating, and I noticed the nostalgic decor - schematics for the original structure on the walls and pieces of pinball machines hung up as art. What was really nice was that the staff gave us two Caesar salad's on the house because of our wait! And they were delicious! Heavy on the dressing with finely crushed, salty bacon. The pizza is incredible. I'd compare it to Roberta's in Bushwick for the crispy and light texture. My favorite of the night was the pepperoni - the meat tasted of quality and it was even a little spicy. Everyone at the table went crazy for the hot chili oil too, which I'm sure is great, but my tastebuds can't handle the spice!Finally, the price was super reasonable. Nine people, five pies, and like three drinks each and everyone paid about $35. Worth it. Go to Pizza Moto!",5.0
"Honestly, it baffles me that this place has such high reviews.  I don't know what is coming out of this kitchen...but it is certainly not pizza.It's not even that it isn't neapolitan pizza specifically..it's just not pizza.  The dough is both incredibly thin and incredibly chewy at the same time. You go to pick up a slice (except for the bacon oil pizza which I'll get to in a moment) and the thing starts drooping because the thickness of the dough is almost like paper.  I don't understand what they are trying to accomplish here other than ruining pizza.The bacon-fat rosemary pizza was the oddest thing I've ever seen.  I love bacon fat and I love rosemary, but I just wasn't sure what I was eating.  I picked up the first slice to bite into it and it was, once again, thin as a cracker, but, instead of being crispy, it was chewy.  And when I say chewy, I mean chewy to the point of being tough...I had to gnash my teeth to get the dough to separate itself from the rest of the pizza.  To make matters worse, when we sent back the first pizza (bacon oil rosemary) and asked them to make us a traditional neapolitan pizza, but to make sure the dough was a little bit thicker, it feels like they made it thinner on PURPOSE as if to say, ""yea, whatever, this is how WE do pizza.""  Look, guys, that may be how you ""do it,"" but it isn't pizza!There's a lot of hype behind this place, but this is not pizza.  Being both a Sicilian-American and a New Yorker...I have to say, ""Don't even bother.""",1.0
"First and foremost, why are you coming to a pizza place? For pizza.  Pizza moto's pies are terrific. Absolutely perfect crust - the right amount of seasoning, chew, char...perfection. Best margherita pie we've had in ages; the sauce was ideal.  The clam pie was more or less devoid of clams, but it was still a winner.We had some other dishes to try out the non-pizza offerings. All were more than skip-worthy. The bacon with kimchi was fine - weirdly adorned with edamame, and something about hot kimchi does not make sense to me at all.  The fried artichokes were pretty darn bad - the yuzu ""aioli"" was more of a super sweet lemon curd. Gelatinous, overly sugarly, poorly cleaned (had several barbs and hard outer leaves, which are really unpleasant going down) and over fried baby artichokes. Not a winner.That said, the pizza was a hit and the place is easily accessible by the B61 bus. The staff were nice and the seating accommodated a family easily. We will definitely return, but next time, we'll just stick with the main event and avoid the other dishes.",5.0
I was dying for wood stove pizza and heard about this restaurant so decided to try it out!  The evening started off lovely when we were escorted into the kitchen to wait for a table.  How unique!   We got to see meals being cooked behind the scenes. While waiting they brought us a fried lasagna which had a little taste. The signature drinks were lovely. We started with a short rib appetizer which had potatoes. It was soooo  incredibly small especially since we were told it was for two people and cost $20!!!!. It looks like one short rib chopped up into pieces . The upside was that it was delicious.We had a variation of the Pizza up on the board. It was a four cheese pizza with bacon and we added pepperoni instead of an egg. Unfortunately through the pepperoni was overly salty and I ended up taking most of the pepperoni off.,3.0
"A few weeks ago, someone was telling me that they thought most pizza was basically the same. If those words ever come out of my mouth, I want someone to whack me with a pizza peel. All pizzas are not created equal. Feel the crust between your fingers. Taste the gooey cheese. See how the different toppings and flavors all meld together. Some places do it better than others. Pizza Moto is one of those places.Pizza Moto is the new kid on the block. They've been around Smorgasburg, but at the time of this writing, their brick and mortar location has only been open for 7 weeks. Our waiter informed us that the location used to be a Papa John's. So quality begets quality, I suppose.Anyway, Pizza Moto has a few small tables, and a big family style table in the middle. They take reservations of parties of 5+, so if you're only 4, give me a call and I'll be there in 10 minutes.There are a few interesting cocktails on the menu. I had a rye cocktail that came with a beer for mixing. Someone else at my table ordered a cocktail that came with a mini bottle of bitters on the side.As far as the food goes, they have a ton of appetizers and starters. Our waiter recommended the fried broccoli with lemon curd, and told us we were definitely going to order another one after we finished the first. He won that bet. You want to order that as a starter. Trust me.We also got the porchetta stuffed with smoked oysters and nori. Honestly, there was a 70% chance we ordered it just because of how exotic it sounded. However, there wasn't much of the oyster flavor, but the porchetta was cooked til tender with just the right amount of fat.So I've gone 7 paragraphs without mentioning the pizza. I swear, it wasn't on purpose. Just for that, I'm going to write ""pizza"" in capital letters so people skimming this review will be able to find it:***THE PIZZA***There were five of us, and the pizzas are 12 inches, so our waiter recommended ordering 4 of them (a lot of math, I know). We ended up ordering the last four on the menu:1) Green tomato salsa, jalapeno, fontina, fresh mozz, pecorino2) Winter greens-pistachio pesto, castelvetrano olives, ricotta, fresh mozz3) Clams, cream, roasted garlic, bacon, potato, parsley, fresh mozz4) Eggs in hell: tomato, bacon, chili, soft cooked egg, fresh mozz, pecorinoThey were all great and had their merits. My favorite was the green tomato salsa pie. It was the spiciest of the bunch (even though our waiter told us Eggs in hell would be). The green tomato salsa added a nice tang, and I can never turn down three different cheeses.Also worth mentioning is the eggs in hell. It basically tasted like breakfast. With oozing eggs, bacon, and two types of cheese. Definitely something I would eat at breakfast, or brunch... or lunch... or dinner... or late at night.The clam pie was also pretty good. The potato added an extra layer of texture and helped offset the other strong flavors.All the pizzas had thin, crispy crust with the right amount of burnt. I love that they just go overboard with all their cheese, and aren't afraid to experiment with toppings. I like a good old fashioned slice as much as the next guy from Brooklyn, but you gotta travel outside your comfort zone once in a while (and I'm not talking about Red Hook).",5.0
"I really didn't think it would be that good. Really. I've had pizza everywhere, including in Rome and I've always concluded that they were all the same. However, pizza Moto got their crust down to perfection as well as their generous service. Here's what happened:We walked in as a party of 5 on a Friday night with no reservations. Of course there was no seating so they situated us in a waiting table located in the back with the kitchen. It was pretty neat because we could watch all the magic happen in the kitchen. We were told it would be an hour wait for the table and so we ordered some drinks while chilling in the kitchen. About 30 minutes in, the host came back and told us that the table they were going to give us was taking a long time to eat and we were allowed to order at the table were sitting at in the kitchen. Awesome! It was extra kudos points for me that they took into consideration our waiting time because most places wouldn't care enough to accommodate us at that level. Nevertheless, the feast begins.We ordered 3 appetizers and 3 pizzas. Let me list them:Warm tinned sardines: yeah, sardines. But wait here me out. It had great presentation with the sardines still in the tin. There was slices of toasted baguette and home made butter on the side that you could make a small bite with the sardines and it tasted a lot better than I thought.Fried broccoli: how can fried broccoli be that good? What made the dish would be the lemon curd sauce that they had on the sideGuinzaglio: came with a side of chili oil. The presentation made it seem very asian inspired but the taste was not (talk about a curveball). The beef shank was tender and the noodles were freshRoasted & fresh mushrooms: they did not skimp out on the mushrooms. It taste lighter than I would have thought and the various types of mushrooms made itClams: my favorite. Came with a wedge of lemon and a spritz of lemon took the pizza to the next level. The clams and cream was a good comboEggs in Hell: not bad but it was my last pizza for the night and the first 2 pizza set the bar so high and this one just tasted like regular pizza. The egg was a nice touch but I wish there was more yolk.We can't forget dessert now. My friend was eyeing one of the chef whipping fresh whip cream for other diners on their dark chocolate olive oil cake and he must try it. He was right and the whip cream was so light and fresh (and I hate whip cream). Their hospitality did not stop there when the same chef came over and gave us a free dessert: biscuit tortoni, an almond semifreddo. This dessert actually tasted even better than the olive cake.Would we come back here? Absolutely. The pizza here is by no doubt gonna to be a showstopper in the Brooklyn pizza scene. Their service is also a step above many other pizza joints and we will see ourselves patroning here again.",5.0
"A very good pizza place! The crust and bottom were nicely crisp. I could use more cheese on the margherita though ($14). The clam pizza was also good but some more sauce would have enhanced the flavor for me ($19).The tin of sardines ($8) was delicious. I usually stay away from sardines because I hate those ""edible"" bones that I don't like to eat, but there were none of those in these meaty fillets! A must order!The smoked trout cesar ($15) was a mountain of romaine with not a lot of smoked fish. But it was dressed very well. Another item  not to be missed.The hostess was great and a pro at using their yelp pos system. Super smooth and they are able to take your number down if they don't have room for you to wait in the kitchen.Our server was good. He was definitely very busy but we felt an adequate level of service despite that. Some of the tables are spaced very close together but the whole place isn't that big so you just have to make do with the space you have.",4.0
"We had a fun evening at Pizza Moto. Not every dish is delicious, some are too salty, the tomato-less pizza's aren't the best, but we might come back to try some other specials and have another margherita. It is not a place for ""connoisseur's pizza"" (go to Lucali for that), but the wait staff is cool (in the good way of the word) and prices are fair.",4.0
"Overview: Great little pizza place that serves real Italian style pizza in a wood-burning oven, and great cocktails. We brought our young daughter, and there were many kids in the room, for which Pizza Moto seemed a bit unprepared. [An unanticipated 45-minute wait (We were told ""20 minutes"" when they seated us in the back, then 40 minutes into our wait we were told ""5 minutes"" longer) and somehow we were expected to manage our child's hunger without an offer of any appetizer whatsoever, not even a slice of bread, as we waited in the back with other families and our child who eventually showed tears, she was so hungry with the delicious sights and smells. ]We sat in the back at the chef's table alongside a couple from Windsor Terrace, a family from Munich, Germany, and another family with two kids who live in Manhattan. People travel to Pizza Moto. That's a testament to how good the pizza is here.It was nice to view the activity in the back. Okay, it was a little impressive.Once we were seated, I was constantly bumped by waitstaff even though I pulled my chair *all the way in.*Food: Eggs In Hell. YES.  Cheese with mushrooms also delicious, but EIH was the more creatively flavorful pizza. Clam and cream pizza, we hear, is also very good.Drinks: Red Right Return. Other Half Forever Eva IPA.Dessert: Biscuit Tortoni, Dark Olive Oil Cake, w/ freshly whipped cream.Summary: Exceptional pizza, with timing/waiting issues. A few little service tweaks, and this will easily be a 5 star experience!",4.0

"Went with 4 friends and we had a pretty cramped table in the corner. It's a cute atmosphere but it's in a really quiet out of the way location under a bridge. We ordered the fried broccoli to start, which was very good. Both the flavors and the textures balanced nicely. I'd recommend splitting this appetizer between 2-3 people. Between the 5 of us, we ordered 4 pizzas, which was a good amount of food for us. We had the mushrooms, pistachio pesto, clams, and ""eggs in hell."" I thought that the mushrooms and pistachio pesto were average, but the clams and eggs in hell ones were fantastic -- would recommend. The best part of the meal was the olive oil chocolate cake, a must in my opinion. We also had the maraschino cherry almond biscuit & ice cream dessert, which was really strong in both flavors. I wasn't a huge fan but my friends seemed to love it. I'm not a huge pizza lover, but this place is pretty solid. I probably wouldn't go back because I live really far from this area of Brooklyn, but if it's convenient for you, do try it out!",4.0
"We went here around 7:15 on a Thursday, and had no trouble getting a table, there's a fair amount of seating for a small place. It started to fill up as we ate, though! Funny location, under the highway, but I'm sure it's very up-and-coming. We decided to not go crazy (we weren't starving!), and ordered the tomato, meatballs, fresh mozz, roasted onions, pecorino pizza for $18. It came out fast (the bread/chip/whatever it was that they gave the table was great! It was sort of like a giant, fancy cheeto - which is a compliment) and was piping hot. The meatballs were sliced, for ease of eating and everything was great. The crust was almost sweet, which I'm into when it comes to pizza. Perfect textureI can definitely see myself going back, as long as it doesn't start to get too crowded or crazy.",4.0
"Located in quite possible the worst spot in the history of restaurants. However, don't let that deter you. Pizza Moto is located directly under the BQE on the Fort Hamilton Parkway. My husband and I got here around 6Pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty full, but we were seated right away. It is VERY small and many people had to wait. You can not make reservations, so anticipate having to wait (or try to get there right when it opens). We split the fried artichoke with lemon curd appetizer. It was DELICIOUS! So good! I ordered the margherita pizza and my husband ordered the eggs from hell pizza. Mine was good! The sauce was a little off, but not in such a bad way. Like maybe a little too much oregano? Not enough garlic? But still tasty. My husband throughly enjoyed his. We split the olive oil chocolate cake, which was nice but a little dry. I didn't really think it was worth the calories. They aren't open during lunch time, which kind of blows, but isn't the end of the world. I would come back!",4.0
"For some reason my review of their beloved mobile wood burning brick oven pizza business has transferred over to this listing for their first brick and mortar location. I still feel as though their trailer pulled mobile business that gained much momentum over the past few years is still one of my favorite pizzas in the city and deserves much praise. There actual location, not so much. Did the city really need another pizza place or upscale hipster casual restaurant? No, definitely not. Pizza Moto made a name for themselves by being a business that was unlike anyone else around, there actual location just falls into the bandwagon with everyone else. Cliche's aside I was quite disappointed with my experience here. The individual pizzas are bigger and more expensive than what I've come to expect from Pizza Moto at mostly $14-19, beers are mostly in the $7-8 range and glasses of wine and cocktails are in most part around $12, all of which are pushing the limit of one could charge at a casual pizza place under the highway in an obscure industrial area of RedHook/Gowanus. They certainly didn't make up for the prices in quality or service either. The margherita pizza came without basil, one of the staples that makes that type of pizza so good. I was told they didn't have basil because it wasn't in season. Really? I can go to the super market and get basil as well as just about any worth while pizza place, it's also something you can grow at home on a window sill, just look at DiFaras. The pepperoni tasted like kielbasa and the overall flavor of the pizzas fell short. The doughy and fluffy crust was pretty good but lacked any real crispiness or char to it. As far as service goes we were never asked if we wanted another drink and our table was cleared off and was being prepared for the next guest before our coats were even on. We just felt a bit rushed even though there was no line of people waiting to get in and even though we hadn't been there long at all. With so many great pizza places in the city to go to, there's really no need to make a return trip here. Though I will still likely throw down $10 or so for one of their pizzas if I'm ever at a food fair and I see their mobile cart.",3.0
"We were a party of four at 9pm on a Friday night, two coming from Gramercy and two from Harlem. What an incredible gem! Warm waitstaff, excellent ambience, and oh my goodness the pizza!! We ordered some fabulous dishes to share to start -- broccoli with the brightness of lemon that was both surprising and successful. And we ordered three pizzas. The crust was heaven -- melted in our mouths. I especially loved the pizza with winter greens-pistachio pesto, castelvetrano olives, ricotta (which they make themselves).It was an amazing meal and I'm absolutely looking forward to going back!",5.0
I love pizza and if you do too you know there are some pretty good pies in BK.  I have to say that this was solid.  Good sauce to cheese ratio and the crust wasn't too soggy. We got the mushroom pie (sauteed shrooms and raw shrooms shaved on top) plus a Margherita.  The place was packed at Friday @6:45ish.  They have a cute and small waiting area in the kitchen where you can get drinks delivered to you.  Overall great addition to the pizza scene in BK/NY.,4.0

well id like to really review this place when I've actually eaten here which I didn't even get to do. I came in right when it opened for the night with a friend and my 2 year old and they ONLY HAVE ONE HGH CHAIR for the whole place and it was already spoken for! my little one was squirming as we sat and waited for the hostess sh$&show to settle. since it had just opened a girl was trying to make sense of the 3 tables with kids who came in at once and then her manager came in and was so embarrassingly awful to this girl...it was downright uncomfortable. so we left. good thing we live a short walk from here! If i had shlepped with a toddler to this kind of ugly creepy part of the hood (it's fine!) I'd been pissed!hopefully I'll get to try again when they have it together.,1.0

And, they know the food. There is also an excellent wine, beer, and cocktail selection. The owners built this place themselves, literally every last piece of it. It is warm, inviting, and an oasis to step in to. They played good music, that you could hear, along with being able to hear your friends, and the other light noises of the restaurant. If you're lucky you may even catch one of them watering their rolling garden out on Hamilton Ave... if you're like me, you'll get the sense that Brooklyn was just made better.",5.0
well id like to really review this place when I've actually eaten here which I didn't even get to do. I came in right when it opened for the night with a friend and my 2 year old and they ONLY HAVE ONE HGH CHAIR for the whole place and it was already spoken for! my little one was squirming as we sat and waited for the hostess sh$&show to settle. since it had just opened a girl was trying to make sense of the 3 tables with kids who came in at once and then her manager came in and was so embarrassingly awful to this girl...it was downright uncomfortable. so we left. good thing we live a short walk from here! If i had shlepped with a toddler to this kind of ugly creepy part of the hood (it's fine!) I'd been pissed!hopefully I'll get to try again when they have it together.,1.0
"Went here with my son and daughter for my b'day. The pizzas were fantastic!!! We had the one with meatballs and the one with clams and bacon--both excellent. The cocktails were great too. We had no wait time at 6:45. It gets crowded pretty fast though. A bit tricky to find, but once you do you won't forget it!",5.0
"I was already a big fan of Pizza Moto from their mobile set up at Center Stage and Shmorgasburg, so I had high expectations for their brick and mortar restaurant. I was blown away by the whole experience!The space is gorgeous, the service was on point and the menu was just incredible. Not your typical pizza restaurant selections. Obviously the pizza was amazing, but I was blown away by the fried broccoli, agri dolce chicken and the chocolate olive oil cake!Perfect place for a date, birthday or a family dinner. I'll be going back soon and spreading the word about this place!!",5.0

place was real cool.... glad to see the area is coming back.... nice little spot...with the old fashioned refurbished oven which makes PIZZA ... price was OK.... Got complimentary glasses of wine....waited about 50 minutes for table.... but it was worth it.... cool crowd... they need another rest room and need to move the bar to the back..... for more tables.... otherwise it was a fun night..lively crowd.,4.0

"My god, I have died and gone to pizza food truck heaven!Went to the Bell House this weekend for ""Beer for the Beast"" and Pizza Moto was there with their food truck.I should have known I was in for trouble when I smelled brick oven awesomeness while walking up the block to the venue. Now I live on pizza, and I was worried my nose was smelling more than my eyes were seeing.  Silly me, was I in for a surprise.Had my first slice of Margarita, and literally turned right back around and went back online again!  Had my second slice of mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes and literally got right back on line again.Between the perfect charred edges to the freshness....there was no way of beating this slice.",5.0
"Best bartender ever! Grayson was absolutely perfect, incredible service. Don't sleep on the fried broccoli so good. Not sure how they made a caesar so good but they did. Pizza obviously awesome. So glad they've landed in a permanemt location, get in before you have to wait outside for hours!",5.0

"I was excited to try the sit down restaurant after enjoying their pizza at the Atlantic Antic.  We were a party of 4 on a recent (chilly) Sunday night.  I noticed when we walked in that everyone in the place had their coats on. I blamed it on the cold but there was a blast of air and the waitress said if the door to the basement was open, the cold air came rushing in. She shut the door for us and it got better....until the kitchen staff left it open again 5 minutes later.  My husband got up several times to shut the door himself.  Anway, it was freezing out. They might want to get space heaters for the next cold snap, though.  On to the food...we ordered the fried broccoli and the Caesar salad, both of which were excellent.  The key lime sauce with the broccoli is odd but still delicious.  Then we waited for our pizzas. And waited. And waited.  The waitress told us it would just be another minute.  They finally arrived. And were cold.  Not just not hot - they were cold. I ordered the Angry Egg, the others ordered the carbonara pizzas.  Oof.  Cold pizzas and topped with uncooked runny egg white.  I asked the waitress if we could send them back and have them cooked.  She disappeared for a minute, came back and said ""that's the way they cook the eggs."" I said I would like my pizza hot and the egg cooked. She disappeared again and returned with the manager (owner?) who gave me a lecture on the sous vide cooking technique.  I have had sous vide before. The egg was raw.  They need to work on the technique.  I told her raw egg was gross and she said that was just my opinion, but she did offer to redo the pizzas without the egg since I was clearly a philistine who had no appreciation for sous vide cookery.  We all agreed that would be best, the pizzas went back and after another wait, new pizzas appeared. These were hot, eggless, and edible, but not stellar.  Our waitress never reappeared and we finally flagged down another waiter to request our check.  All in all a bummer of an experience.  I had high hopes but I'll stick with Franny's for expensive pizza. They at least know what they're doing and I've never had a lecture, let alone a cold pizza there!",2.0
"Amazing food, and I liked the pizza so much I went back a week later to see if they could cook anything else. Holy S---!

"We had the fried broccoli, Clam pizza and pistachio pesto pizza, plus the chocolate olive oil cake for dessert.  Everything was freaking delicious.  the clam pizza tasted like the ocean, sweet and creamy...  the sauce under the fried broccoli knocked me out.  The Service was spectacular.  It's a lovely cozy space, way out of the way for some, but well worth it.  This place is a gem.  GO GO GO GO GO!!",5.0

Really stunning meal at Pizza Moto.  This is much much more than a 'pizza place' The food was both creative and heartily satisfying - including one of the best tartare I've had anywhere.  The pizza of course was delicious and the consistency and thinness of the tasty crust defies physics.  Can't wait to go back for the whole fish!,5.0

"OMG this pizza is heaven. The pizza truck was at Summer Stage in Central Park. I ordered a slice of sausage and then proceeded to eat my husband's piece when he when his back was turned- I know, I know, shameful. The pizza had a lot of cheese and plenty of sauce.  The balance was great so I didn't have huge bites with only sauce and bites with only cheese. Their cheese stayed soft and stretchy and had a great flavor. The sauce tasted authentic. The crust was very thin, but stayed crispy. I am not a crust person but ate this entire slice, crust included.  I am now going to track down this truck ASAP to try other kinds of pizza.",5.0

"I cannot believe how good this place is on every level.  The food, much of which they cook in a 100+ year old wood fired oven, is insane.

"If you're looking for amazing pizza in the Carroll Gardens/Red Hook area, skip the ridiculous lines (and velvet ropes) at Lucali and head straight to Pizza Moto.

The staff is very friendly and the space is comfortable and stylish. Such an exciting addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
Pizza Moto is a fantastic restaurant with the best Caesar salad I've ever had plus the pizza is inventive and blew my mind. My favorite slice in the city.,5.0
"i was lucky enough to score an invite to the soft opening of PizzaMoto's (literal) brick-and-mortar spot in Red Hook, and was blown away by the food - both the pizza and the sharing plates. Like my fellow reviewers, i've had the delicious personal wood-fired pies at Smorgasburg in the past, and the restaurant executes that same addictive chewy-but-crisp charred-crust pie flawlessly! We started with drinks at the bar (pro tip: order the Over Under - it comes with its own individual minibar-sized bottle of bitters! Adorable and more importantly, perfect + delicious on a chilly autumn night) and then moved to a table to eat. We went for the highly-recommended Clam Chowder Pie - expert balance of creamy, savory, and beautifully smoky. But we were really curious about the non-pizza offerings here, so we started with the broccoli and lemon curd, which was perfectly crispy and sweet-salty-tangy - i'd almost order this for dessert. We asked our server to recommend a wine, and she came back with an exceptional Primitivo. Tasted like a $55 bottle, came in at maybe $30? JACKPOT.  i personally can't resist a Caesar salad when i see one on a menu, and Moto serves theirs with smoked trout and a super crisp crouton...dust, i guess?... which is GENIUS because it means every bite has a satisfying crunch without big clunky traditional croutons. Generally, i'm not drawn to beef tartare (i mean, who knows what kinda beef is back in the kitchen, you know?), but another patron was raving about the meatball tartare crostini, so we decided to try it and it was FANTASTIC. Sashimi-grade chopped beef subtly seasoned with ""meatball"" herbs, and delivered on thin crisped toasts. Finally, we got the pancetta over beans and hominy, fired in that same wood-fired oven, and it was the perfect autumn meat dish. Herby, savory and tender pork, crisped at some of the edges, on top of fresh lima beans and hominy, which made a light broth (maybe some pork drippings in there too?? it was soooo good), so we requested some bread to dunk in the sauce. The staff graciously obliged, and we were brought the MOST INCREDIBLE chunks of sourdough bread i've ever tasted. Dense, chewy, fragrant, and so so so fresh, and i am not certain this is even on the menu (yet)!1 bottle of wine became 2, so, time for dessert. We shared the chocolate olive oil cake (souffle?) with buttermilk whipped cream and OH MY GOD EAT THIS IMMEDIATELY. Light AND rich, not too sweet and subtly tangy, rich chocolate and cool, silky cream. We ordered a 2nd portion with our mouths still chewing the first bite, and both were decimated in less than 2 minutes.The management and staff all made our party feel warmly welcomed, and we were perfectly attended to: everything came in a timely and expert fashion, but no one was hovering over us. The dining room feels cozy, but super cool and relaxed, and really convivial. Though all the tables were occupied with animated folks, it never got too loud. The best part? The pristinely restored wood-fired oven, clearly visible from the dining room. It made the dining experience feel like one big dinner party at someone's lovely home in front of a fireplace. And there's  chef's table option in the kitchen to be closer to the cooking action. Highly, highly recommended, especially given the dearth of great eating in this neighborhood! i've already made 3 more reservations here so i can take all my friends. :)",5.0

"We had the best time at Pizza Motto. First of all, it's beautiful--really elegant and homey and you can tell that a lot of heart and soul went into the art and the tables and even the bathroom. The waitstaff could not have been nicer. We have a toddler with food allergies and the waitstaff accommodated these easily and they were sure to let us know what foods were not okay for him.  They have a full bar and a great cocktail and wine list but I went with the traditional old fashioned, which was delicious. (and strong...) But most of all, the food was AMAZING.  We had the winter greens pizza and the buffalo mozzarella pizza and they were both fantastic. As was the smoked trout caesar.  There is also fish at a reasonable price on the menu, and we're coming back for that, for certain. Oh! We got to go into the kitchen and see the oven (super exciting for the toddler) and there is also a chef's table there...We are really happy this place is in the neighborhood. Charming, delicious, reasonably priced and lovely people. I hope they're around forever.Jennifer",5.0
"Already a fan of Pizza Moto's mobile pizza, I was bowled over by the pies now coming out of their wood-burning, restored 19th century oven in the new bricks and mortar restaurant under the BQE. The clam pizza wipes New Haven's signature offering off the map. Every pizza crust is chewy and charred to perfection, filled with bright tastes, smoky Benton's ham or bacon, woodsy mushrooms, creamy eggs - whatever the choice. But, I never go without ordering the crispy chicken agrodulce because it is the best tasting chicken in the NYC region. Creamy, caesar salad complemented by house-smoked trout is a must, as is the roasted and raw fall vegetables charmed by Brooklyn's artisanal Salvatore ricotta. If I have room for dessert, my fave is the biscuit tortoni 'cause I love  ceamy almond semifreddo with the amaretto crunch. Wines are reasonable and cocktails are fun. Such a  homey and funky decor - hand-crafted by the owners with spirit, warmth and charm. Brooklyn just got another food star in its firmament.",5.0

"My fiancé and I split a margarita pizza while at the Greenpointe Flea Market. Brooklyn pizza is always good and Pizza Moto is no exception! The pizza was cooked quick and inside a portable, wood-burning pizza oven. The crust was thin, but not fragile while the cheese was melted just enough without being greasy. A definite ""not miss"" in the BK.",5.0

"The idea of mobile, wood-fired pizza is fantastic!  You decide to spend your day at an outdoor event, and maybe you want something fresh tasting and gourmet as opposed to the standard fried, greasy options you typically get. PizzaMoto solves that problem deliciously. My beau spotted those pies from a mile away while we were at the Fort Greene Flea this weekend. They looked way too good to pass up, so we kept it simple and ordered ourselves a Margarita pie. The pizza was very good with a thin, crispy charred crust and fresh tasting toppings. It's not your average fest food, its better and definitely worth a try at your next outing.",4.0

"World class food... the verde pizza was a revelation; the clam & bacon pizza was to die for. Fried broccoli was surprisingly decadent.  And the semifreddo was easily the most delicious dessert I've ever had.  The cocktails are killer, too. This is fine dining without the precious ritual. Sound level & acoustics are civil; decor is full of detail & love.  PizzaMoto is the best.",5.0
"We had the best time at Pizza Motto. First of all, it's beautiful--really elegant and homey and you can tell that a lot of heart and soul went into the art and the tables and even the bathroom. The waitstaff could not have been nicer. We have a toddler with food allergies and the waitstaff accommodated these easily and they were sure to let us know what foods were not okay for him.  They have a full bar and a great cocktail and wine list but I went with the traditional old fashioned, which was delicious. (and strong...) But most of all, the food was AMAZING.  We had the winter greens pizza and the buffalo mozzarella pizza and they were both fantastic. As was the smoked trout caesar.  There is also fish at a reasonable price on the menu, and we're coming back for that, for certain. Oh! We got to go into the kitchen and see the oven (super exciting for the toddler) and there is also a chef's table there...We are really happy this place is in the neighborhood. Charming, delicious, reasonably priced and lovely people. I hope they're around forever.Jennifer",5.0
"Already a fan of Pizza Moto's mobile pizza, I was bowled over by the pies now coming out of their wood-burning, restored 19th century oven in the new bricks and mortar restaurant under the BQE. The clam pizza wipes New Haven's signature offering off the map. Every pizza crust is chewy and charred to perfection, filled with bright tastes, smoky Benton's ham or bacon, woodsy mushrooms, creamy eggs - whatever the choice. But, I never go without ordering the crispy chicken agrodulce because it is the best tasting chicken in the NYC region. Creamy, caesar salad complemented by house-smoked trout is a must, as is the roasted and raw fall vegetables charmed by Brooklyn's artisanal Salvatore ricotta. If I have room for dessert, my fave is the biscuit tortoni 'cause I love  ceamy almond semifreddo with the amaretto crunch. Wines are reasonable and cocktails are fun. Such a  homey and funky decor - hand-crafted by the owners with spirit, warmth and charm. Brooklyn just got another food star in its firmament.",5.0
Really good thin crust pizza... especially for a mobile brick oven.  Holy cow!  This is going on one of my favorite pizza destinations list.Margherita Pizza - yelp.com/biz_photos/yl5B…,4.0
"My fiancé and I split a margarita pizza while at the Greenpointe Flea Market. Brooklyn pizza is always good and Pizza Moto is no exception! The pizza was cooked quick and inside a portable, wood-burning pizza oven. The crust was thin, but not fragile while the cheese was melted just enough without being greasy. A definite ""not miss"" in the BK.",5.0
I had PizzaMoto at the Brooklyn Flea and it was delicious! The pies were cooked quickly and the tomato sauce was extremely fresh. This was by far the best food I sampled while at the market. A small Margarita pie was $10.,5.0
"The idea of mobile, wood-fired pizza is fantastic!  You decide to spend your day at an outdoor event, and maybe you want something fresh tasting and gourmet as opposed to the standard fried, greasy options you typically get. PizzaMoto solves that problem deliciously. My beau spotted those pies from a mile away while we were at the Fort Greene Flea this weekend. They looked way too good to pass up, so we kept it simple and ordered ourselves a Margarita pie. The pizza was very good with a thin, crispy charred crust and fresh tasting toppings. It's not your average fest food, its better and definitely worth a try at your next outing.",4.0

"PizzaMoto was at Central Park SummerStage for Comedy Central's event.I tried their pizza towards the end of the night, $5/slice. Price was probably jacked up because of the event.I had a really burnt pizza which masked the taste of the tomato sauce and cheese. No bueno.",2.0

"I was pretty generous with my original 3 stars. I have to agree with Johnathan E who said ""Maybe if included a brief back massage or some tax advice.""   I am doing my update now because The owner of Pizza Moto had sent me a nasty message which shows no understanding of customer service. I have received messages from other owners who apologized for substandard service and food and offered perks and better customer service the second time around. Contrary to other reviewers opinions I never said an Asian man could not cook pizza. My husband  is Chinese and makes the best food of any cuisine I have had which includes pizza. I just do not like the posing and claims of being New Yorkers  when they are transplants and the owner admitted it. I am not against people moving here from else where as long as they admit it and don't try to pose.  My pizza was  soggy so it doesn't matter what nationality the chef was. Soggy is soggy in any nationality. I am also updating my review because Yelp HQ took down one of  my pictures of it  and said it was flagged.

Maybe they don't have the capability to generate the necessary heat in their mobile ovens that real fire brick ovens do,  Whatever the case, the crust has texture problems and is less than perfect.  Thin, only slightly crisp, and a tad too doughy.  It may looked charred but it doesn't taste like a nicely charred crust as say you get at Lucali's.  The ingredients were fresh but nothing special.  Sauce pretty good.It's just not possible to create wonderful brick oven pizza in a moto oven.  At least not on the level of the elite pizzerias in nyc.However, if you're at an outdoor food festival or at the flea market, it's pretty awesome to see a mobile brick oven pizza place that serves A-OK pizza...hence 3 stars.  whoever compared this to di fara's has no taste buds.",3.0

But the real challenge, I would soon learn, was rotating the pies constantly, methodically, and restlessly in the special oven they escort via trailer. Yes, the type of trailer you hitch to the back of your car. That is their whole operation! You see, the oven is half-full of burning timber, the other half is pizza, and managing these two is quite the skill.In conclusion, Pizza Moto better get a storefront soon because I'm about to chase this place all around town until they do.",5.0
"I'm from LA, so when I visited NYC this past weekend, I went all over Manhattan and Brooklyn looking for the epic NYC pizza people rave so much about. How odd that I found this pizza in the Williamsburg Flee Market. Pizzamoto was not only the best Pizza I had in all of NYC, but it was very likely the best pizza I have ever had. I highly recommend this pizza who visits NYC, and doesn't want to feel like they missed out on the NYC pizza one can't find anywhere else.",5.0
"I was meeting my friends at the Flea at 1:30 so I tried not to eat much that morning to leave room for all the goodness I knew was coming. But my ""I'll just have a few baby carrots"" turned into ""how the freak did I just eat a whole bag of carrots..."" so I arrived less then hungry. But I waited 3 weeks to get my Pizza Moto and I was going to eat that pizza whether I wanted to or not.In most edible situations I believe cheese is the most important element, but not so with pizza... with pizza I'm all about the sauce. So, as I forced that first bite into my unwilling mouth, I was nearly overcome by the zip of the tangy and sweet tomato sauce that looked so sparse on the puffy crust yelp.com/biz_photos/yl5B… The punch of the sauce is matched by the chewy pillowing sourdoughy crust yelp.com/biz_photos/yl5B… and although my pizza did not get a dusting of parm since it was the last pizza of the day, it just means next weeks pizza will be even better! yelp.com/biz_photos/yl5B…",5.0

"Since there is always a huge line for their pizzas, it is fresh and hot. I only had a plain slice, but felt that it was overrated. It is a light doughed pizza, but the tomato sauce they used was underwhelming- like it tasted canned.",3.0
"I was pretty generous with my original 3 stars. I have to agree with Johnathan E who said ""Maybe if included a brief back massage or some tax advice.""   I am doing my update now because The owner of Pizza Moto had sent me a nasty message which shows no understanding of customer service. I have received messages from other owners who apologized for substandard service and food and offered perks and better customer service the second time around. Contrary to other reviewers opinions I never said an Asian man could not cook pizza. My husband  is Chinese and makes the best food of any cuisine I have had which includes pizza. I just do not like the posing and claims of being New Yorkers  when they are transplants and the owner admitted it. I am not against people moving here from else where as long as they admit it and don't try to pose.  My pizza was  soggy so it doesn't matter what nationality the chef was. Soggy is soggy in any nationality. I am also updating my review because Yelp HQ took down one of  my pictures of it  and said it was flagged. I also agree with Jeff L that the reviews are way too generous. I mean you guys haven't had pizza before? It wasn't awful just not great and it was soggy.",2.0
"These reviews are way too generous.  Yelpers need to toughen up and stop giving 5 stars willy nilly.  People will be disappointed.  Don't chase around a mobile trailer...that's why we have delivery!There are literally two dozen SPECTACULAR pizza places in NYC and this is not one of them.  It's ok...if you're giving them an extra 2 stars for them being mobile fine...but the pizza is just alright.  I'm focusing just on taste and not the fact that they are mobile.The problem is that despite it being thin crust, they have a problem with their dough not being cooked right.  Maybe there's too much excess flour that isn't rolled out properly given the large outdoor crowds and cramped space. Maybe they don't have the capability to generate the necessary heat in their mobile ovens that real fire brick ovens do,  Whatever the case, the crust has texture problems and is less than perfect.  Thin, only slightly crisp, and a tad too doughy.  It may looked charred but it doesn't taste like a nicely charred crust as say you get at Lucali's.  The ingredients were fresh but nothing special.  Sauce pretty good.It's just not possible to create wonderful brick oven pizza in a moto oven.  At least not on the level of the elite pizzerias in nyc.However, if you're at an outdoor food festival or at the flea market, it's pretty awesome to see a mobile brick oven pizza place that serves A-OK pizza...hence 3 stars.  whoever compared this to di fara's has no taste buds.",3.0
"In defense of Pizza Moto: it truly is truckin' good pizza regardless of the pizza makers' age, hair color, ethnicity or whether or not they've hit the 10 year New York mark. People get pretty uptight about their pizza here. There's plenty of mediocre junk out there lacking love.  This isn't an example of that. Perhaps a pie here or there isn't absolutely perfect-get over it! It's edible right? I'm psyched to eat their wood fired pies made with great ingredients and by pizza enthusiasts.",4.0

My friend and I decided to split the pizza since we saw the serving sizes passing us by.  After about a 30 minute wait in line and another 10 minutes for our pizza to be made (we ordered a salvatore which was mushrooms, oregano, ricotta and mozzarella, drizzled with olive oil and two iced teas for $18), we nearly died after digging into our first bite!My friend and I inhaled that sucker in 10 minutes but it hit the spot.  Probably one of the best pizzas I've had in ages!",5.0

As I watched the dough being rolled out, dressed in fresh tomato sauce and then topped with mozzarella, basil, a heavy dose of pecorino and a drizzle of olive oil, the incumbent pie was slided into the housemade wood-fired oven. Talk about freshness! When that baby came out, the crust was super thin, so if you're into Chicago style, you might be disappointed, but to me, that just means no guilt for eating more than one. The cornicione was nicely blistered and charred, so don't cut your mouth. Be patient and steady. However, the Parmesan made the pizza a bit salty, which I could do without. I don't know how much it would cost to buy a whole pie or if that's the best pizza out there, but I would rather spend my hard earned cash on this local business than to a chain restaurant.",3.0
"Easily the best pizza I've ever had, ever. Had the pesto pie at Smorgasburg and it was unbelievable.  The crust is simply the perfect carbohydrate.

"Went to the NYC Food Film Festival and gave Pizza Moto a look.  I had one of their specialty pizzas called the Fun Guy which was a pizza made with smoked mozzarella, tomato sauce, fresh basil and mushrooms. I also had their taste of Pizza Moto special which was a crostini rubbed in olive oil and garlic topped with goat cheese, hazelnuts and a drizzle of honey. The latter dish was $3 and the Fun guy cost $9.00. As I previously had stated I love how Pizza Moto takes great care in constructing their pizzas. The pizzas are made to order so you have to wait a little bit while they create it. The prospect of fresh basil on their crisp pizza crust and mushrooms sounded very enticing. Unfortunately, I did not think the Fun Guy was executed very well. While the pizza crust was crisp it tasted like it had an excess of flour brushed on it. I understand that dough is prepared before hand so a lot of extra flour is needed to be spread on the dough prior to cooking so that the pizza retains its consistency for cooking throughout the long day. Nevertheless, in cooking much of that floury, dusty texture remained with the pizza which created disappointing textural experience. The pizza itself tasted ok but the basil was somewhat wilted and the mushrooms did not add very much. The flavors of the Taste of Pizza Moto all complemented each other nicely.  The crostini was perfectly charred to get nice crispness and charred flavor without getting any burnt flavor. The flavor of the goat cheese was nicely complemented with the sweetness of the honey and the bite of the raw garlic.

I finally tried this after always seeing people eating it at BK Flea. Me and the bf split the Margherita pizza. Overall it was a great pizza - super thin crust and delicious flavors.

And it could've used a tad more than a couple sprigs of basil for even more flavor. All-in-all it's definitely worth trying!,4.0

I finally tried this after always seeing people eating it at BK Flea. Me and the bf split the Margherita pizza. Overall it was a great pizza - super thin crust and delicious flavors. The only thing was that for the first couple bites of each slice you could basically only taste cheese since the middle of the pie was so thin. And it could've used a tad more than a couple sprigs of basil for even more flavor. All-in-all it's definitely worth trying!,4.0
