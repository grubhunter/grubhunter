"Looking on Yelp for some tasty local places to eat, I came upon this five star Vietnamese restaurant. Being Vietnamese myself, and being in New York for the first time ever I had pretty high expectations for the quality of food. When I walked in I immediately felt charmed by the small restaurant, with its local art displayed on the walls, the small loft seating area, the visible kitchen along the back wall, and the friendly staff. Minh himself was there! My praises are endless for him!So when it came time to order I was a little surprised, I had no idea this was Vietnamese-American fusion. Nevertheless, they had a simple menu, choose between a ""Big Bowl"" or a sandwich. You had many options to customize, and a whole table of house made sauces. I chose a big bowl with the given veggies, no egg, and smoked salmon added on. No regrets whatsoever there, I LOVED IT. I came absolutely starving and it was healthy, hearty, and satisfying. The flavors reminded me of home, and yet the ""fusion"" part of it didn't distract from the flavors I've loved my whole life, it only added to them in such a unique way! The sauces, by the way, were probably the highlight of an all around FABULOUS meal. You genuinely will not have such a delightful array of sauces offered before you at any other place. I also feel I should mention I came with a friend who wasn't hungry, but after seeing how much I was enjoying my meal she had to go and get herself a bowl as well!After the meal I felt compelled to compliment the chefs! They were so friendly and talkative, the conversation went beyond just the food. I also learned the rice medley is changed weekly, the pickled vegetables being done daily, the sauces being varied almost daily, and the menu being updated and improved always. I was so impressed by the passion and love being put into the food. It really shows. I wish I wasn't just visiting New York! I would definitely be a regular here.",5.0
"How is this place not more well known?  I could eat this kind of food all the time.  It's healthy, it's fresh and it has rotating veggie toppings to have you coming back for more.The rice bowls (technically 'grain bowls' I think) are delicious and a great value for your money.  Portions are plentiful and will leave you satisfied and potentially with leftovers. Tried the smoked salmon, beef bacon and seitan toppings, all of which were good, particularly the beef. Also enjoyed adding the pickled coffee egg which gives a bit of funkiness to your meal.The selection of homemade sauces is the best part. Try the turmeric spicy sauce and coffee hoisin!",5.0
"Super fresh and delish. My husband had a rice bowl with smoked salmon, his brother a rice bowl with pork, and I had one of the specials: lamb borscht pho that had fresh kale, scallions dill and perfect beets. The veggies are undoubtedly fresh and it's clear the chef and kitchen make everything with love. Veggies change every day. We'll come back and try the sandwiches but anything on the menu is worth it. Healthy food. Serious flavor.And the sauce bar is brilliant. Today's sauces included the usual -- (coffee soy) hoisin, nuoc cham, sriracha, sambal -- with more creative options: super spicy turmeric, super spicy coconut, cilantro vinaigrette, etc.Gigantic portions. Come hungry.",5.0
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had: smoked trout. Superfresh. Cheap. Nice location a great service. I love their veggie bowls too :),5.0
"We don't know how to categorize this restaurant, truly.  We came because reviews were amazing and pics look great!  We also wanted some Viet food and the name was in Viet so we said, ""Let's go!""  Location is off the beaten path of Williamsburg venturing into East Williamsburg/Bushwick area.  The place is small but open and the people are laid back and welcoming.  We checked out the small menu and notice that really two items were ""Viet,"" the sandwich and the iced coffee.  Everything else didn't really seem Viet.We ordered the big bowl with 2 eggs and smoked salmon (good idea but not Viet).  The bowl was actually grains, not vermicelli like we had thought.  We also got the Vietnamese sandwich, which was very enticing.  First taste of the sandwich was greeted by the familiar pickled daikon and carrots, along with some pate, mayo, and ham.  The ham was weird to me because it was American style ham and not Viet style.  So that lost my interest.  The big bowl was huge!  Lots of grains, veggies, and salmon.  The two of us could barely finish the bowl, actually, I don't think we finished the bowl at all.  There was much to eat and most of it was very refreshing and clean tasting.  That's the nice thing about the food, it tasted clean and light, unlike typical Viet food that's heavy.  All in all, if we didn't come craving Viet food, we would've been fine.  Sadly, we wanted Viet food and this was not the place for it.  Come for a culinary experience that's different from the norm, but don't come looking for bun or banh mi.",2.0
"Super fresh and bold flavored sandwiches and big bowls here. Had the two egg big bowl with smoked trout. It's a medley of pickled root veggies, ginger, grains, kale and more all topped with perfectly fried eggs. The sandwiches are killer. Insanely delicious focaccia bread with richly flavored meats and the usual banh mi suspects. Small goods sections with sauces and dried goods was a treat. Snagged some fried onions and real deal fish sauce to round out the pantry. Get here!",4.0
"Really hope the owner reads this and address to his employees. We love local business like Nha Minh because it brings so much joy to our community. We want to support local owners. But when the owner himself is not there, the experience is not the same. I come here often and noticed this pattern. Some employees were dismissive and act burdened when customers make orders. After we placed the order this morning, 20 minutes have passed and we were still waiting. There was one customer ahead of us. Two employees cooking. I asked if our order was being made, she said no, because she was busy. The other one was walking around the kitchen. We had to go, and since she never cooked our food, we canceled. I'm a cook myself. I care about what I do: cooking and feeding people. Her attitude was disappointing. If this person didn't want to be at work that early, don't make the owner and customers suffer. That's not fair for the business nor the customers. She just didn't want to cook. Let someone who cares about the food and the business cook then. Nha Minh is located in a very industrial part of Bushwick. I bike out here to eat the delicious and healthy food, enjoy the friendly ambiance and the corky music they play. It's really a little oasis in this big noisy city. The chef and his staff care about what you eat. So their food is prepared with quality ingredients. I always get a sandwich and a bowl. It is not traditional Vietnamese. The bread is very crunchy, good amount of pickled carrots and radish, thin layer of liver pate, and thick slices of ham. It's tasty and satisfying. I don't feel heavy after eating the whole sandwich. The house made sauces complement the rice bowl. The multigrain rice is topped with green veggie (today is Swiss Chards), beets, jicama and radish, also a veggie patty. You can add ham, beef bacon or smoked fish. The cafe has steady stream of customers but never feel loud or crowded. The place is inviting so you don't feel like you have to eat fast and leave. Also a great place for local musicians to play their music. We need more small eateries like Nha Minh. I hope they are here to stay!",1.0
"I love the iced vietnamese coffee. The food is healthy, the portions are big. I loved their sauces. But as someone who is not big on rice, my only complaint is that I wish they served a vietnamese sandwich that was either grilled pork or chicken--as is standard in most vietnamese places. If they wanted to mix it up they could even do tofu. I am not big on ham and pate and I hate tempeh and sietan--to mushy and gross for a sandwitch. At first I thought maybe they just didn't serve pork at all, but there's bacon all over the menu so I am just confused. Might also be cool if they served some type of soup.",4.0
"I'm always skeptical about Asian fusion or new age Asian food, especially Vietnamese food. It just feels like there's something about the classics you just shouldn't mess with. That being said this is one of the two places where I didn't just enjoy new age Asian food, but totally welcome it. Nha Minh is set in a no frills part of greenpoint next to some workshops on a street that I would want to walk at night, but the food is amazing. I had the #2 veggies grains and smoked trout bowl. I hit it with some familiar sauces: traditional Viet fish sauce and a hibiscus plum sauce. Absolutely amazing food. The best part was that it had similar flavors to foods I used to eat when I was a kid, with the pickled cabbage and rice. Yet at the same time it was totally new. I will definitely be back to have some of their sandwiches and coffee. Note to self: share the bowl with someone next time, I'm in the dreaded food coma right now.",5.0
"I hate it when people say they want to keep a spot from blowing up so they can keep it all to themselves, but this is that place for me. That is selfish though, so instead I signed up for Yelp so I could review it. It's that good!Yummy, rotating, grain and veggie bowls with the most amazing sauce selection ever seen: sour apple tomato sauce, coffee hoison, ginger, just to name a few. The bowls are huge, delicious, super healthy, and even better with an add-on pickled egg! I've yet to try the sandwiches because the grain bowl is so good, but can't wait to try the ""Smoked Salmon,"" and the ""Vietnamese."" This is hands down my favorite spot in Brooklyn to adventure to solo. I post up in the little loft spot with homework or a book, eat good and bliss out. I never mind a little walk to get to a good spot, but for those that do it is definitely worth the extra travel time! I hope Nha Minh is able to stay around for a long, long time.",5.0

"So excited to see a new restaurant open up in this neighborhood. It's so hard to find a good restaurant open for lunch. Most places open at 5pm. It's a small, comfy hidden gem in E. Williamsburg. My coworkers came here for lunch; after seeing all this rave about the ruce bowls, we decided to order the rice bowl and another coworker order The Classic Sandwich.The Rice Bowl is packed with healthy rice (it has a lot of different types of grains), pickled veggies (radish, carrot, red cabbage), steamed veggies (chinese broccoli), a starchy cake of some sort (i thought it was fish cake but it wasnt- looks like a sweet potato cake to me) and you can choose if you want any more add-ons (egg, meat). I added breaded chicken breast. The chicken was moist and flavorful. They also have a lot of different type of sauces you can top on, heard they change it up all the time. I think of it as a healthy vietnamese version of a bimbimbabThe Classic Sandwich - I didn't try it but my coworker said it was good, flavorful. However, it didnt come with any veggies. I think you can add veggies with an additional cost but we forgot to ask...It would've been nice if there was veggies thrown in the mix, other than that- it was a nice and filling sandwich.The Vietnamese Iced Coffee- SOO good and strong. It's french-pressed iced coffee with (I'm only guessing) condensed milk. Just what I need to continue my afternoon at work. All in all, we enjoyed our lunch, would definitely come back!",5.0

"Great food for such good value. Most dishes are under $10, with lots of healthy options. There were your standard pastries, but I opted for the rice bowl with a fried egg and vegetables. The vegetables were a variety of red and green pickled cabbage, carrots, daikon, and stir fried bok choy, . I love pickles of all kinds so this was totally up my alley. The rice was a red rice with some sort of micro quinoa which added a great texture. There was also a variety of really interesting sauces availablle to try. I don't remember what they were, but one had ginger, one had star fruit, one was some sort of sangria-like medley sauce, and the last one I don't remember. But it was really interesting to try a bunch of them. They have a really artisanal flavor, but they're really humble in appearance (the flavors are handwritten on plastic squeeze bottles). The space is clean, bright, with rotating art shows. Definitely coming back!",5.0
"It's definitely a good healthy option for this weird, out of the way, little Williamsburg neighborhood, but not quite a destination spot.  The friend had a smoked salmon + grains bowl with added soy egg, and I had the Vietnamese happy meal (Vietnamese banh mi sandwich + Vietnamese coffee).  The space is simple and airy with great natural light, so you just feel so good sitting there, with your bowl of grains and veggies and a sandwich filled with crisp pickled vegetables. But the flavors weren't that extraordinary.  The friend said the grains were good, but was uncertain if smoked salmon was the best topping for it. I tried a bite of the soy egg which was some strong, vinegary stuff, so may be a bit surprising for those unaware.  The ciabatta type bread for the banh mi was nice and crispy, but the ham just made me miss the classic headcheese that is usually used for these sandwiches, and too thick to allow me to taste the pate.The owner/chef explained that they were trying to do more American Vietnamese, and that is definitely clear in the types of ingredients and style, but I guess it's really not the place for mi (punnnnn) as I just need a harder Vietnamese flavor punch in the face.",3.0
"what a wonderful surprise. It's easy to overlook this spot- the street view is very humble and the location is industrial. But when you go inside, great vibe, great art, and excellent food. One of the few places in this part of Brooklyn that I feel is still what I love about NYC- fun, innovative, good price, and unassuming. Highly recommend!Also the chefs sometimes change basic ingredients, for example as with the rice bowl, they change the grains and veggies they use to spice things up and keep things new.",5.0
"I saw this place had excellent reviews, and since I live close by I wanted to see what the hype was about.This place is super cozy and the food is very fresh and absolutely delicious. I feel like I'm putting good things into my body but also deeply enjoyed the mix of flavors in the bowl. I do wish the food was priced lower because once you add a protein and drink to your bowl it can easily add up to $15 which I think is a stretch regarding how simple the ingredients are. That being said, I'm definitely coming back for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!",4.0

"Delicious food from a highly ambitious chef. This slightly-out-of-the-way but thoroughly charming spot (with high ceilings, a wood beam loft with extra seats, and a mini-market of interesting foodstuffs) punches way above its weight with some of the most innovative asian food I've seen this side of Momofuku. The rice bowl was delicious (if not slightly overpacked with some gratuitous additions), and their sandwich one of the finest I've ever had. Perhaps most impressive (and revealing of Nha Minh's aspirations) was the chef's collection of homemade sauces, which you're encouraged to liberally apply across anything you order. I can't remember all of them (salmon skin comes vaguely to mind, as does a raisin and parsely vinegrette), but they were as additive to the meal as they were inventive. After offering my compliments to the crew visible behind the kitchen counter, I grabbed one final thing - the best Vietnamese iced coffee I've ever had (strong and the perfect amount of sweetness).

You can also dress it up with unique and delicious sauces that are made in house. The building is clean and refreshing to have a seat and enjoy your meal. I would recommend this spot basically to anyone.",5.0
"This place is all-around pretty great. Food is solid. Complaints: their coffee is definitely not Oslo and it's advertised as Oslo. Whatever coffee they are selling is super bitter and has a completely different flavor profile from any Oslo blend I've had and I've had them all, at Oslo and brewed in my own home. I also think the things in their fridge and shelves are upcharged to an almost criminal degree. I know how much they're paying for some of those drinks and snacks and they're definitely breaking some ethical up-charge boundaries on more than a few items. Finally, DUDE. $10 dollar card minimum is nuts and I'm pretty sure your credit card company would be unhappy to find out you're breaking their rules.",3.0
"This place is great for a delicious, healthy, and quick meal.  I had the rice bowl which was filling and gluten-free.",4.0
"Tasty and healthy (if you want it to be). I love the grain bowls and the rotating vegetables included in them.  My favorite additions are the amazing coffee soy egg and the smoked trout (those in a different mood can go for ham or beef bacon) It's best to eat in and try out all the different sauces you can put on the bowls like coffee hoisen, coffee teriyaki, Apple cider vinegar and a bunch of other combinations Fred (the chef and owner) has thought of that you never would have. This place is new and he is continuing to expand the menu as things get rolling. They just added a bunch of Bahn Mi sandwiches that I hear are great (haven't been able to tear myself away from the bowls) Bonus star for presenting art and music (Sunday brunch music every week). This is what Williamsburg is supposed to be like!",5.0
"Fresh, healthy, and delicious. Great ambiance once you get inside!Edit: I normally get the bowls, which are fresh, healthy, and delicious (see above). Got a couple sandwiches this weekend... SO BOMB. My only complaint is that I didn't order more. Roommate was full after his, I was craving more stomach space to fit in more sandwich.",5.0
Everything about this spot is great. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Fresh ingredients with new items popping up on the daily.,5.0
"I went to Nha Minh for brunch with a couple friends and split a few dishes:Egg Salad on Seaweed Rice CakesChicken Liver PatéBreakfast Bowl with Fried Egg, Pickled Curried Egg, and Sliced Pork ShoulderAll were delicious and highly recommended. If you're in the mood for something out of the ordinary that's hearty and satisfying, this is the place.",5.0
Delicious new lunch spot. The menu is limited but whatever they serve you will be amazing.,5.0
"The bowls are healthy and delicious. I had a pork stew. Fresh, tasty and filling. Fred the chef makes some crazy creative combinations and his own homemade condiments. I'm a fan of condiments for sure. Also he does some wacky combos with eggs... Try the Oslo Egg. The coffee ROCKS. A new gem in a neighborhood off the beaten that will be crave worthy. Keeps me coming back. Yum!",5.0
I actually played a jazz gig there and had some food and it was excellent.  Very fresh and tasty.  Super chill vibe and will be back again.,5.0
"Thank Fred and team this place arrived to this spot! Very needed in the area. Flavorful (and abundant) rice bowls, crisp tasty sandwiches, early breakfast, beer/wine. On top of that, they are always planning events: live music and exhibitions. Very friendly, overall charming vibe.",5.0

"Nha Minh is a neighborhood gem. Laid-back atmosphere, awesome food and plenty of cool art to enjoy. I've been here twice so far and Fred has delivered both times. Healthy grains + veggies + protein choice + egg(s) make for a perfect, filling bowl. The house-made butter (I got chive) has been a pleasure to cook with. Definitely on my list of go-to's.",5.0
