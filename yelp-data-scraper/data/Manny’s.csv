"Really loved this charming cafe/restaurant. I was glad to have found a highly rated cafe that was opened Sunday night in Bushwick, but was even more swepped away by the charm/embracing waitress and cashier. They were so warm even when they told us that we couldn't bring in a puppy. We ordered salmon with mango sauce with spinach and chicken beasts with coconut rice. It was delicioys!",4.0
"""Ehh""I stopped by here on a saturday for a quick breakfast and I was juuuuuust ok. I got a two ingredient omelet with a salad and a cafe au lair and there really was not much to right home (or to yelp about). The service was OK but nothing really stood out about the place. Maybe I will come back in the spring to experience the ""backyard"" or maybe I will have a better culinary experience during lunch/dinner.",3.0
"If you enjoy watching garbage hipsters eat and are excited for the harried staff ignore you as you wait for a table for what seems like forever, then this is a great place to feed yourself. The food is good, but they're so understaffed that it takes forever to get to actually eat it. It would be faster to just take the subway to somewhere else than to actually dine here.",3.0
"Great place. Had the portobello burger and the BLT panini and enjoyed them immensely. The environment is quite and enjoyable, the prices are reasonable, and the food taste great! I'd certainly recommend this place!",4.0
"Great local coffee shop/restaurant in Bed Stuy. It was walking distance from our Airbnb residence in  Brooklyn. We came in around 11am and it was busy it the place is really small! Not much seating in the front of the house, back of the restaurant has a small outdoor patio with around 10 tables. It is a little confusing at first, I thought maybe we just had to order at the counter and then grab a seat but they actually do have table service. Counter ordering is for to-go. We ordered a couple coffees, a blueberry muffin, and a bacon egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich to share, which came with potatoes. Everything was cooked well, came out fairly quick, and was satisfying. If we weren't on vacation I could definitely see us coming back to dine here.",4.0
I've come to this place a few times and have always enjoyed their food. My last visit was a couple of days ago and I had the salmon burger with fries. It was so good. The burger was nicely seasoned and the fires were crispy but not burnt.I also ordered a cold pressed juice but was turned off by the label (after I purchased the damn juice of course) that mentioned it contained active bacteria and it shouldn't be consumed by young children and old adults - see my image for the full verbiage.I'll continue to frequent this place when I'm in the mood for healthy options in Bedstuy.,3.0

"I love Manny's! It is a sweet local restaurant that has a fairly extensive menu and friendly service. I go any time of day, alone or with a friend, and always have good food. They are also really affordable, so tip those friendly servers well! They even have an outdoor space to eat in when it's warm, and that's really lovely. The french toast and pancakes are well-portioned and fluffy, and all my friends who order the steak and eggs love them. I didn't want to write this review because I almost don't want Manny's to get too crazy. But I love walking there and getting breakfast!",5.0
"Manny's now has a backyard and has switched to table service so review is as of this change.Ambiance: I think the switch to table service is a good one.  Although it does kind of reduce the neighborhood vibe as a place you could come, hang out and get some work done (maybe Kava Sheetbl is your place now), the space feel less chaotic for reasons I cannot quite explain.  The backyard is a great addition and Manny's did an excellent job getting the woodwork set up - it feels cozy but well-executed.Service: I think the change has also made service an easier proposition for the staff.  It could just be my expectations of timing lengthen when I sit down and order versus ordering at the counter but my food seemed to come a bit quicker than I had remembered.Food/Coffee: No noticeable difference in quality.",5.0
Update- I really think they shouldn't offer table service. During the weekends they pretty much forget about you and I've had to ask multiple times for things and had to get my own silverware. I just don't think they're equipped to offer table service. There's also no where to wait for a seat. Things would run smoother if you simply ordered yourself and sat down. Adding another star because I've tried some more things on the menu and there are some real stand outs - love the chicken panini. LOVE. Put some hot sauce on it. Trust me. And I love the Mac n cheese! Also great servers. I ordered a wrap that came hot when it said cold and was just all around not my thing and the waitress was so cool about it and really helpful. Love all the staff.,3.0
Trying to recover from the coldest day in NYC history. This Cali boy made his match with the elements of true winter weather. With that said I needed a quick thing to eat help keep warm so we went to the nearest breakfast place just down the street:). Once I saw the words Banana Pancakes I was sold!!! Fluffy and huge portions that makes portions in LA seem so small. Service was good I enjoyed the cakes and also enjoyed some coffee with it. I'll be back but maybe when everything melts first OMG burrrrrrrr!!!,4.0
"I love it here! I come here to study, relax and just read..I love that there's a place like this right down the block! The servers are so nice and always check on you...the muffins are amazing as well as the guava/cheese croissants. Usually places like Mannys don't have actual food and if they do its subpar..everything I've tried is pretty good! Hanger steak included! Also--their treats are made fresh everyday and after 6pm they only $1.75 instead of the usual $3.50! Great cafe!",5.0
"When this place first opened it was a blessing to the neighborhood. Their blue plate special was a common staple if me or my fiancé didn't have time to cook. Now it's apparently under new management and everything has gone down hill. The food has become subpar but $2 more than it once was. My biggest issue with this place is the veggie burger. They used to make this amazing veggie patty but now have just replaced it with a portobello mushroom cap. However, the menu still has the original patty printed as available. It's been 4 months (at least) and there has been no correction. The waitress didn't even correct the menu change for me when I ordered it and I had to send it back (which I hate!). I would have given this place 1 star but did give it 2 for its amazing pastry and croissant options. Shame on these ""new owners"" for ruining what once was a diamond in the rough.",2.0

It's a great place to come, sit and read a book or study because the environment is conducive for clear thinking and it's located in the heart of Bed-Stuy. Their staff is awesome!

"I was just staying in the area for a few days, but I needed a place to grab lunch and wanted to give Manny's a try after reading great Yelp reviews. I headed in on a scorching Monday around noon.

They placed a big jug of water on my table just for, and I gratefully drank the entire thing! It was so hot out! I ordered the roasted chicken panini--it came topped with swiss, bacon, avocado, arugula, and a mustard vinaigrette. It was really, really tasty! The place definitely feels like a coffee shop, and I have mixed feelings about the table service, but from what others have said, it has added value to the place. I would definitely recommend lunch at Manny's!",4.0

":( I really don't like to write bad reviews, but I had a pretty awful experience here for brunch with regard to both service and food quality. 1. It took about 45 minutes to get our food. I don't typically get that worked up about wait time, as it is New York City. But it was long enough, with no update as to the status of our food, that we had to ask. It was also concerning as there were not many other people waiting for food. 2. When my ""veggie burger"" came, it was not what was described on the menu. The menu listed the veggie burger as a pattie made of lentils, carrots, etc. I was very surprised, then, when a large portobello mushroom pattie appeared in front of me. When I brought this to the attention of our server, she acted not surprised and said, ""Oh yeah- we changed it."" I happen to HATE mushroom burgers, so this was a substantial  issue for me. 3. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict. At first sight, it looked fine. But after cutting into the yolk, it was fully cooked....

I ordered the 2 eggs with turkey bacon and Spanish on 7 grain bread which was good BUT it definitely needed Salk and pepper... I probably should have added cheese as well but I was going for a healthier breakfast. Okay so then there is the orange juice that is freshly squeeze that has a warning label stating that since the OJ is unpasteurized it contains harmful bacteria that would be harmful to children and people with weakened immune system.. Which I guess is also true if you ate or squeezed your own orange but geeze-umTHE KICKER AND WHY I GAVE THEM 3 STARS: is bra is they need a heater above the door. It's too cold and the place is too small for the front door to be flying open and all that cold air flying in and you had nothing to combat it. ALSO at 10 in the morning (like 25 degrees out) they have the back door wide open moving chaired from the back and out the front door - having both the front the back door bringing in cold air for like 20-25 minutes I would absolutely go back and pick up breakfast but I won't be sitting in until it gets warmer out.",3.0
"Manny's makes me wish I never left this hood back in '04. Do I need to move BACK?All the reasons to live in Brooklyn can be found here. The owner who is passionate about his regulars, because he cares about putting out the best stuff in the hood he lives in. It's everything you wish you could find in Manhattan, but never will because the city is just too impersonal now. And that's why we love BK. The bearded guy behind the counter ( Manny?) is off his rocker in every good way you can think of... He will remember your name, what you like and probably banter with you about random stuff that is borderline cray, but clever enough that you engage. He's the dude we all want at our neighborhood joint, because not only is he a character, he's also sincere and makes you feel at home. The offering are hard to find in the area. Good ingredients married to each other in harmony equals a party in your mouth. From the pastries (donuts from Dough), great sandwiches and daily specials, I never get bored here. The coffee keeps me awake and the music he plays keeps me smiling and happy even after I've inhaled his food. The joint is urban, cozy rustic. Is that a thing? Great place to chill.

But today, I've been hungry, then I went to Manny's, thinking I could survive to everything now...And honestly, that was the right choice. Not only the place is really nice, the people working here are cool (the guy taking orders is fun and smiles all the time, even during rush hour), but also the food is EXCELLENT. You have a very large range of dishes, and everything we tried in here is absolutely delicious. The pastries are great, from doughnuts (provided by Dough) to croissants and pains au chocolat (those are well cooked french pastries, TAKE THAT Georges-André, Manny's ain't a french restaurant but they have a larger and better range of french products).I went to NY 10 times, and I ate the best classic burger in here today! I'm not saying I've been surprised by anything in it, I'm saying that everything in it was delicious! The bread was great, meat cooked as I ordered AND tasted very good, fresh salad, tomato and pickle, and the homemade fries were just perfect.I had an OJ, fresh squeezed, was good too (provided from another company).My GF got an Omlette with potatoes, salad, tomato and onions, everything was perfect.All that cost only $21...  This place is gonna be our favorite restaurant in NY from now on (with Saraghina, just few blocks away).GO!

I really enjoyed the brunch at Manny's . The food is well seasoned and the staff was delightful. If you're in the neighborhood definitely check them out. I wish they served cocktails.,4.0

"The food here is always jam packed with flavor and aesthetically pleasing. You can't go wrong with anything you order!The ONLY reason I'm not giving the full 5 stars is because they aren't consistent with being open, and they can take an usually long time to prepare your order sometimes. I find it very cruel to introduce someone to the magic of Manny and then not be readily available when you need your fix. OPEN UP MANNYS, I NEEEED YOU! Where was I? Oh, yes, the food is great and you should eat here... But you have to catch them while you can. Drooool.",4.0
"Listen... This place is awesome. I am new to the Bed Stuy area and this has become my go to spot. The cafe/restaurant is nice, clean, and spacious with a patio. The food is delish and reasonably priced. In addition the customer service is awesome and not like your typical NYC cafe. Great place to get work done and have a bite to eat.",5.0
"Very quaint spot, much needed in Bedstuy and I can walk there form my house so that's a plus The feel is like rustic tavern type. You can get on your laptop, do some work and get good food. I ordered the 2 eggs with turkey bacon and Spanish on 7 grain bread which was good BUT it definitely needed Salk and pepper... I probably should have added cheese as well but I was going for a healthier breakfast. Okay so then there is the orange juice that is freshly squeeze that has a warning label stating that since the OJ is unpasteurized it contains harmful bacteria that would be harmful to children and people with weakened immune system.. Which I guess is also true if you ate or squeezed your own orange but geeze-umTHE KICKER AND WHY I GAVE THEM 3 STARS: is bra is they need a heater above the door. It's too cold and the place is too small for the front door to be flying open and all that cold air flying in and you had nothing to combat it. ALSO at 10 in the morning (like 25 degrees out) they have the back door wide open moving chaired from the back and out the front door - having both the front the back door bringing in cold air for like 20-25 minutes I would absolutely go back and pick up breakfast but I won't be sitting in until it gets warmer out.",3.0
"Manny's makes me wish I never left this hood back in '04. Do I need to move BACK?All the reasons to live in Brooklyn can be found here. The owner who is passionate about his regulars, because he cares about putting out the best stuff in the hood he lives in. It's everything you wish you could find in Manhattan, but never will because the city is just too impersonal now. And that's why we love BK. The bearded guy behind the counter ( Manny?) is off his rocker in every good way you can think of... He will remember your name, what you like and probably banter with you about random stuff that is borderline cray, but clever enough that you engage. He's the dude we all want at our neighborhood joint, because not only is he a character, he's also sincere and makes you feel at home. The offering are hard to find in the area. Good ingredients married to each other in harmony equals a party in your mouth. From the pastries (donuts from Dough), great sandwiches and daily specials, I never get bored here. The coffee keeps me awake and the music he plays keeps me smiling and happy even after I've inhaled his food. The joint is urban, cozy rustic. Is that a thing? Great place to chill. Oh, great restroom too. Bonus. Manny, I love you and your joint. In about ten years, there will be a dozen copy kats in the area, but you will be the legend and I hope it will still be my home away from home.",5.0
"This may sound strong but I love to get lunch here before going to the Brooklyn Children's Museum which is only a 4 minute drive away.  Their Roasted Peruvian Chicken jasmine rice & salad for $7.95 special is so delicious!!! Also their Cappuccinos come out so pretty with an artsy design with with the froth, you can't help but enjoy your coffee even more.",5.0
"Good food, good coffee, and good vibes. Service? Sub par. I've been into Manny's dozens of times. I'm almost always satisfied with my order, but never satisfied with the service. I've gone into Manny's to order iced coffee to go, and have waited 15 minutes before getting my coffee. I've stood in line for 10 minutes before anyone has even asked me if I've been helped. I once ordered a chicken sandwich with salad instead of fries and got a chicken wrap with fries.The service game needs to be severely stepped up here. Otherwise a solid joint with good coffee and good food. I avoid Manny's on days I'm in a rush.",3.0
"Just went there again today , order a sandwich they seems very stressed the French people that work inside the kitchen were yelling at everyone .However once my sandwich was ready The lady that made it gave it to one of the older French guy with the gray hair . And he was so stressed so I saw him take the  sandwich and throw it on the wall , and then take your paper bag and put it for me to take it !!!!!!!!!!! He didn't saw me seeing that !!!

"So sad when a neighborhood gem turns to coal. Alas, thus is the case with Manny's. I've been here a million times since my last 5 star review, and service has been inconsistent, but more on the poor end. I hesitated to write this because I tend to enjoy the food, but enough is enough. Today, like many other days, I put it in a simple egg sandwich order, and waited 40 minutes to eat. My friend and I were orders 21 and 22. Twenty minutes after placing our order, I hear them call order 25. Did I miss something? Nope. Only after flagging a waitress, was my order put on the grill. Unacceptable. The cashier/front person actually just told me that the kitchen was managing out of order. When our order finally came, 40 minutes later, of course it was messed up. Food was good, but not what we ordered. And did I mention that I came to satisfy a donut craving? Yep, and they didn't even have donuts today!I got a chocolate chip cookie instead, and as I was about to bite into it, I saw a walnut just in time. Yep, the cookies labeled as chocolate chip, actually have nuts in them. The cashier gave me another cookie at no cost, but wtf! Who doesn't label nuts?Lots of my coffee shop pals have stopped coming here for having to deal with the same nonsense. If you care about your time, customer service, or life (nut allergies) go somewhere else.Sorry Manny's, we're done.",2.0
"The Interior is really nice, I could imagine sitting there for hours on a rainy day, but the patio is so cute too. Even though it was quite crowded, the staff was relaxed but super quick and friendly. We had a brownie: OMG DELICIOUS !!

Just hasn't been the same for the past few months.  My order is always wrong now  ( had to send a breakfast sandwich back twice the other day because it wasn't even close to what was ordered and paid for ) And now that they have switched to full table service  it takes way longer to get my coffee then it would if I just stood in line  ( and you can't easily see the food options in the case so you miss some great choices).  Plus the waiter insisted that a latte was the same as a ice coffee and argued with me about it when I tried to explain this was not what I had ordered and a ice coffee is very different then a ice latte until the counter person had to step in & told him I was correct. Mistakes happen but arguing with me was unprofessional   .. It's just lost some of the charm  and quality it had   I'm holding out hope they fix it.,2.0

It's a small place so it can get a little crowded depending on the time you go. They now have an out door patio which is great for warm summer days. The service isn't always the fastest, but I see that they have some new servers so it should be getting better. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area.",4.0

The staff is super nice, but in my experience, not that efficient. It's the kind of thing that's frustrating to watch. I don't go inside anymore. Great food. Great baked goods. Solid coffee. The ordering at the restaurant experience here is just not for me. Not surprised to see it closed (and then reopened) as management definitely needed to take a look at how it's working in there. When half the orders are getting to my house wrong, you have to ponder the mechanics. It's a salad and an espresso. That said, their Cobb Salad is great. Salmon lunch box - A #1. I miss out on the Dough donuts because I don't go inside (you can't order them weirdly). Whatever. Manny's is great.",4.0
Came here for lunch today and had a STELLAR meal. I got the salmon burger (w pickled ginger oh hell yes) & Brooklyn Sunrise juice and the boo got a BLT & an iced americano.

"It's a really quaint little cafe/restaurant. I didn't go for brunch, but I went for dinner, and the food was really good! The prices were really reasonable for what they offer. I had their hanger steak panini, and it was absolutely delicious (not too extravagant, and not too simple)!There really wasn't much of a wait staff (there was only 1 server going around), but tit wasn't busy so it wasn't bad at all. Food took around ~20 minutes to come out after ordering (so it's a little longer than what it should be for what we ordered), but it's not a big deal.They have a back area with a great ambiance.

"Took my little ones for a Valentines Day brunch. Loved the decor immediately when we walked in. Even though it was cold and snowing at the time Manny's was warm and very homey feeling. Sadly, I was immediately off out by one of the workers. During my whole time there I asked this person three questions to be answered very abruptly and rude. As if I was bothering him. The most annoying was asking him for a knife a him proceeding to point to their location at the top of the wait station as he walked by the knives and me.  It would've been way too much to simply hand me a knife. Ordering:I order two turkey burgers for me and my kids. Of the things listed that would be on the burger I told them sans one topping for the kids and asked if there's any mayo put on the burger expressing mine and my daughters disdain for mayo. Lady at register tells me ""Nope, no mayo""get the burgers and both have huge glops of.........spicy mayo. Which is too spicy for kids. So asked for another turkey burger with just the patty and cheese, no sauce or any other toppings for the kids. Burger comes out with the same sauce with no spice. I mean at this point my kid is not hungry anymore, I'm a little baffled so we just get it wrapped to go. I mean I did have to pay for the third burger after all. I also found a piece of paper on my burger as I was chewing but was assured it's just the wax paper used to separate the patties. Because you know that's ok it's just wax paper.

"I am soo disappointed in what this place has become. I used to go here everyday for breakfast and lunch. The food quality is sub par, portions have changed, taste is gone. The brand of coffee must have been changed as well. The staff just cant get it right as well. I order one lunch special and had to choose sides 3 times because they kept coming back saying they do not have the item. The wait for my takeout order was well over 20min and when i opened it up the steak panini had literally one thin slice of steak that missed half the bread it was so small. The post Mike era has destroyed this place. They dont even have the doughnuts anymore. Unfortunately i will not be returning to this once great place.",1.0

"Went to this place hoping to get lunch after working a 24 hr shift. Patrons seemed chill and staff initially friendly.

The cashier went to check and the rude ""head chef"" comes over and is quite nasty. I just moved in around the corner and hoped to make this my go to place. Guess not.",1.0
"Great food- everything from breakfast to lunch and dinner dishes.  When paying, they have a weird tipping screen with a set of 5 options for tip amounts.  It really makes the point that full tipping is expected, which is odd when you are buying take out and even the people who stay aren't getting table service.  I don't know any other places with the same set up, but it doesn't detract from how good their food is.",5.0
"This place is very reminiscent of Mac's Landing... WITH MORE OPTIONS AND OUTDOOR SPACE!  The ambiance is neighborly, warm and rustic.  The food is reasonably priced and the menu offers many options.  So far I have tried the turkey burger, salmon burger, ""fresh"" fries, and side salad.  ALL were tasty and carefully prepared.  Portions are generous without being obnoxious.  There is also always a barista/baristo on hand.  Service is friendly and inviting.  They do accept both card and cash.  THIS PLACE IS SERIOUSLY AN INSTANT NEIGHBORHOOD HIT!!!",5.0

"This place used to be great, now it's really upsetting. Seems like they've taken a quantity over quality approach, no one working is really paying attention or caring about your order. There used to be a super pleasant guy running the show over there, he's been replaced by a bunch of jokers.",3.0
Got my lunch here yesterday & it was horrible. The long wait to receive my lunch after ordering should have been a hint of what I was in for. The broccoli smelled to bad to even eat.

I wanted to eat somewhere local and looked up a few place and came across Manny's. The reviews were pretty good so I decided to try. I met my boyfriend and we made the stroll over for an early dinner. The place is small and cozy with backyard sitting. It was pretty humid so we decide to eat inside. We were seated in a corner table but to my dismay there's a shelf above the seat which I sat and ended up hit my head. Smh I would recommend that area not be used for seating .The waiter offered me immediate attention. He was very courteous and said he meant to warn me about it . I wasn't hurt thou thank God. We were moved to a different table. We placed our orders. I have been dying for a Cobb salad so I opted for that and he had the chicken salad wrap with fries or salad option he had the salad. When the food arrived it looked amazing my salad looked like a work of art. It was delicious all the ingredients were fresh . He loved his chicken salad wrap and salad  also. We were well satisfied plus the menu gives you a wide variety of selections. I will definitely return. I want to try their salmon and kale /barley salad next time.,4.0

"This is a great little spot that makes some tasty vittles.  I like the mix of options from ordering something little but savory to something that can fill you up like a burger & fries. Haven't tried the desserts yet, but they get their donuts from Dough. That's a good thing addition. Here's some simple improvements to make it even better.  Please place a curtain or a second door for the entry door.  It's unbearable every time someone open the door the temp drops by 15o.  The fries were tasty but cold not even warm.  Can't bring me cold french fries and think I'm not going to know a star off.  Also, the chairs or tables are too close.  It's uncomfortable to move or sit when the person behind can't breath because your chair is pushing up on there's.  I will be back great spot again.",3.0

"This was my first time eating out at a restaurant in Bed-Stuy. Four adults and a baby went there yesterday for lunch. While the place was packed, we found the staff to be patient and pleasant to deal with. I hope this continues..Our group ordered two classic burgers and two lunch specials.

A great end, to a great meal at a very friendly setting.",5.0
Soooooo that roasted turkey wrap was bomb thank god I'm off today because I'm going back for that pumpkins thyme soup....they have very healthy and tasty food and not greasy of fried so glad to have them back now only if they could lower the prices LOLOL,3.0
"Literally everything on their menu, glass case, jars, kitchen is delicious - no joke. Don't hesitate to step out of your comfort zone when ordering because you're guaranteed to  like it. Highly recco the donuts, burgers, chicken sandwich, brussels sprouts, carrot cake, and cheesecake.",5.0
"Wow. I couldn't be happier that this place just opened up. I just moved here and was pretty sad at the lack of coffee shops in the area but now Manny's is open! There is not one thing about this place I don't like. Coffee is great, food selection is on point and the customer service is amazing. The people behind the counter are so welcoming  and happy. I am beyond ecstatic that this place is here. It's really a great spot, 100% recommended!",5.0
I wanted to eat somewhere local and looked up a few place and came across Manny's. The reviews were pretty good so I decided to try. I met my boyfriend and we made the stroll over for an early dinner. The place is small and cozy with backyard sitting. It was pretty humid so we decide to eat inside. We were seated in a corner table but to my dismay there's a shelf above the seat which I sat and ended up hit my head. Smh I would recommend that area not be used for seating .The waiter offered me immediate attention. He was very courteous and said he meant to warn me about it . I wasn't hurt thou thank God. We were moved to a different table. We placed our orders. I have been dying for a Cobb salad so I opted for that and he had the chicken salad wrap with fries or salad option he had the salad. When the food arrived it looked amazing my salad looked like a work of art. It was delicious all the ingredients were fresh . He loved his chicken salad wrap and salad  also. We were well satisfied plus the menu gives you a wide variety of selections. I will definitely return. I want to try their salmon and kale /barley salad next time.,4.0
"Great breakfast place.  Outside seating made for a great Saturday morning.  Fried eggs, scrambled eggs & French Toast - the roasted tomato with basil was super.  Definitely a place to remember Brooklyn.",4.0
LOVE this place!!Places like this make me wonder how in the world Starbucks Coffee still exists. The baristas here know what they are doing and the drinks here are Razzle Me DAzzle me awesome!! And don't get me started on the pastries and food! Sooo yummy!!I love you Manny's!! Don't ever leave me!!,5.0
"This is a great little spot that makes some tasty vittles.  I like the mix of options from ordering something little but savory to something that can fill you up like a burger & fries. Haven't tried the desserts yet, but they get their donuts from Dough. That's a good thing addition. Here's some simple improvements to make it even better.  Please place a curtain or a second door for the entry door.  It's unbearable every time someone open the door the temp drops by 15o.  The fries were tasty but cold not even warm.  Can't bring me cold french fries and think I'm not going to know a star off.  Also, the chairs or tables are too close.  It's uncomfortable to move or sit when the person behind can't breath because your chair is pushing up on there's.  I will be back great spot again.",3.0
Second time here. Talk about a hidden gem deep in the heart of Bedstuy!  The food is fresh and delicious. The environment is super cute. Friendly staff.  I think I've found my new favorite eatery.,5.0

"This was my first time eating out at a restaurant in Bed-Stuy. Four adults and a baby went there yesterday for lunch. While the place was packed, we found the staff to be patient and pleasant to deal with. I hope this continues..Our group ordered two classic burgers and two lunch specials. (The baby nibbled out of all are plates.) I had the Peruvian chicken washed down with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, all awesome. For dessert, we shared their poppy seed and chocolate doughnuts.

"First off Service is Super friendly, Mike will remember your name after your first visit. Plus they have Doughnuts from Dough (oh how I love that place). Food is pretty tasty and fresh another huge pro, its right down the block from my house. I will say the only con is it is a Little bit pricey. Spent about 30 for breakfast for 2 with tip. I love the food though so I will be back!",4.0
"I just stopped in for a quick lunch and it was a wonderful experience! They have great menu with FRESH vegan options. Reasonably priced, chill place. The backyard looks awesome for warmer days!!! I'll be back!",5.0

"I've stopped into manny's twice. The first time I had a burger with bacon, the second time the hangar steak panini. Both times I felt sick after eating here, which I understand may be situational so I'm going to give then a third try strictly based on the fact that there's not much else around the area-this time avoiding their beef. I was also disappointed by the complete lack of quality service! Counter staff moved slowly and was less than inviting....I get the laid back BK vibe but a lil pep in your step and a smile goes a long way in the service industry.",2.0
"Was trying to find a new brunch spot over weekend with my boyfriend and scrolled through some great reviews for this place. Once I walked in there was a great vibe and adorable outdoor seating. We were immediately seated and given menus and water. There were two waiters running around but somehow kept passing our table.. And every other one. It was nice morning so I wasn't bothered. It took a while for our order to be taken and even longer for our food to come out. I really shouldn't be complaining though because a table across from us had arrived before and hadn't even been served food by the time we left. They were pissed! The waitress kept apologizing and guaranteeing them food (that I don't even know actually arrived). It was hard to watch. Come to find out it was the first week of the out door seating and hosting service. I have to give it to them, the food was awesome. They serve Dough Donuts and coffee and great brunch! I might stop by this summer after they have gotten in a flow with service!",3.0

"Went to Mannys for coffee and didn't get the best customer service. The first time I went in to get coffee I was served by a nice girl. In and out. Very simple. The second time I went back and ordered the same thing and noticed the price went up. Addressed it with the gentleman that was working at that time and he told me you wasn't charged for the syrup last time. ""Maybe that girl liked you!"" So I went in to say that flattering but it still causes confusion and frustration for the customer. So I handed him the funds and as he was counting out the change I put my hand out to accept it, then he threw it down on the counter. Wow. I thought okay this is not the right coffee shop to be. Lol. So my taste buds got the best of me and I decided to go back (the dough donuts are good) were I had to wait over 15 minutes for hazelnut coffee that they didn't have... No hazelnut.  so I called today, got the manager on the phone and told her why I don't come to that coffee shop. She did apologize, but it came off as ""this is how it is "". She told me that if I didn't want to come back basically she was okay with that. I would think that she would say ""Hey, we want your business..what can we do to change your view about us?"" She wasn't nasty, she was nice about it.. Which is why I feel somewhat guilty writing this review, but sometimes things like this need to be posted so that they can get the picture. I work hard for my money... And I tip as well. I'm not asking for somebody to give birth to my first child here. Just basic respect and good customer service. So as much I as hate to say this, those dough donuts are not worth it. Besides their coffee prices are too expensive anyway.",1.0
