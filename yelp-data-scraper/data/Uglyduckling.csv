I had brunch here on Easter Sun.The french toast was delightful and I will be returning soon.The atmosphere is very laid back and contemporary.We enjoyed our meal at the bar with Mike as our bartender.,4.0
"I was sad to hear that the Mac and cheese with lobster was no longer on the menu, sigh. I had the ugly duckling sandwich which is really chicken and waffles with bacon and fried poached egg. I guess I arrived on a good day because the food was delicious. And soo filling. The fried were tasty and my sandwich was good. My fried had the chicken and waffles and she enjoyed it. My dish did not come with syrup but that chipotle mayo sauce. I was not a fan of it. I used some of my friends syrup and completed my meal. I would come back here to try something else on their menu, probably for dinner next time around. The service from the waiter was good.",4.0
"Ok I just left this place. Came in at 215 &sat at the bar for brunch.There were 4 of us. We took about 5 minutes to decide what we wanted to order. We each ordered a entree and an order of deviled eggs to start.I had a mimosa & it was delicious. My boyfriend had the ugly mary & it was the best bloody mary we both have ever had.Here is the problem. This place has been open for some time now & should know how to handle a full house on a Sunday for brunch. Your bar is in Carrol Gardens !!!! You will have people coming in constantly!!!We waited 1 hour for our food!!! Sat at 2:15 and didnt get our food untill 3:25!! Parties of 2 that arrived after us got their food before us. I'm sorry but an hour wait for brunch food ? Yes the food was delicious & Yes the bartender kept the drinks flowing, but That is just too long to wait for some chicken and waffles. Anddddd our appetizer came at the same time as our food. I dont understand why simple deviled eggs could not come out before our food since we did ask for it as a starter...Those that were seated at tables got their food much quicker than we did and I dont know if it is because we were sitting at the bar or If the kitchen was short staffed but for me personally, there is no excuse. For the horrible wait , I have to take a star away.",3.0
"Great place for a casual Brooklyn brunch with a fun gastro pub atmosphere. Chicken and waffles here were delicious- waffles had the perfect balance of light, soft, and crispy, and the chicken was very tender. I also really enjoyed the Roasted Pear & Goat Cheese Salad. Service here was very friendly and fast, and there was no wait for brunch on Saturday at 1 PM. There's definitely nothing ugly about this awesome Brooklyn spot!",4.0
If you need grease after a night out of drinking or you just want to stuff your face with something delicious and terrible for you; come here and get the cheddar waffle fried chicken sandwich with bacon and a fried egg; drizzled with maple syrup. It comes with a side of French fries too. I dare you to eat the monster with your bare hands. It's delicious; just do some push ups after.,4.0
"Its not about how you look on the outside but what you have on the inside that counts. I love the name of this place and how it pays homage to a building that was deemed one of the city's ugliest buildings. Inside, this craft beer bar is quite the opposite, Wrapped in wood and low hanging laps I find it rather elegant. Taps galore from some of the best breweries around and a great menu to pair them with. PRO TIP: beer and some live music after work",4.0
"Uglyduckling has got some of the best brunch we've ever had.  This is a great and popular spot on Smith that we've been wanting to try for some time.  We were happy to be able to get a table with minimal wait so we went right to ordering the Ugly duck eggs with pulled pork and chicken & waffles.  Definitely two of the more popular dishes as we saw a lot of people ordering the same things.  Only issue we had was how long it took them to get us the menus after being seated.  We waited almost 10 minutes just to get some water so I got up myself to get the menu, and that's when they came over.  It didn't seem so busy that they couldn't bring over the menu as the patrons are being seated, but it turned out they had a limited amount of  copies so we had to wait for the menu.  Anyway, after finally getting the menu and putting in our orders, we also had some coffee while waited and admired the intimate decor of the place.  There is a surprising amount of beers of tap so the bar was a popular spot as well.  We didn't have any beers this day.  After a decent wait time, our meals came out.  The chicken and waffles plate was huge!  The chicken was nicely seasoned and fried without it being greasy or messy.  Even while sitting on top of the waffles, there was no oil that dripped down to make the waffles soggy, this was very nice.  It was served with a boat of gravy on the side so you dip and drown as you wish.  The other plate was the smoked ugly with pulled pork. This is basically an eggs Benedict with pulled pork instead of ham.  We were also very happy with this dish.  The pulled pork was on top of toasted English muffins and topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  The whole thing tied together so well with just the right flavors and meat quantity.  The pulled pork was a little sweet, and not in a bad way, mixed with hollandaise and runny egg was amazing.  The plate was presented with a small salad and some home fries to ensure nobody leaves hungry.  Everything about it tasted wonderful! Uglyduckling is worth a visit for any meal of the day, not just for brunch!  We loved it here and will gladly return in the future.",5.0
Great spot! Excellent food and good drinks! Had the burger with fries! The garlic aioli was perfect touch.,5.0
"Beware of the overinflated Yelp reviews! Came here for brunch and was a disappointing experience from start to finish. Should have known something was up when I stepped off a bustling Smith St and into a dead cafe with music blaring just enough decibels to be annoying. Food: they didn't prepare the French toast yet (which is strange an hour after opening) so had to order something else but ordered the Benedict dish, chicken and waffles and the burger instead. The only bright spot was the chicken and waffles - average at best but when compared to their bland, soulless excuse for a burger and the cobbled together Benedict it becomes sublime. Service: Sloppy and lazy. I'd understand if the joint was packed but the place was empty and our waitress couldn't have seemed more apathetic (or hungover). Zero refills offered for water or coffee. To top it all off was overcharged an extra dish - for the French toast that ""couldn't be prepped in time""Atmosphere: came for brunch but feel like this place would be a much better bar. Great selection of beers if only the wait staff made the place feel more inviting. Smith St is a bustling and competitive street especially for eats with this high of a price point. Skip this place for brunch and go literally anywhere else. You, your wallet, and your taste buds will thank me later.",2.0
"No, Uglyduckling doesn't have 1 duck dish on its menu- but that's ok. My friend and I came here for early Tuesday dinner specifically to eat chicken and waffles. The powdered sugar-sprinkled waffle was doughy and the fried chicken was crispy and hearty. This felt like a traditional no-frills c&w meal except for the spicy aioli. I totally get many c&w dishes come with a splash of heat. Don't get me wrong I embrace spicy flavors but in this case, if mixing sweet with savory is the name of the game, I'd much rather drench my plate with maple syrup than a creamy spicy mayo-based sauce more applicable for frites.On weekdays, Uglyduckling opens at 4pm- instead of embarrassing yourself and trying to open a locked door like we did at 3:58, check if the foliage has been placed outside the entrance once you arrive. We were delightfully surprised by the free three-beer sample on Tuesdays of which they have ~30 varieties on draught to choose from. The waitress was very nice!",4.0
"Brunch only review I got to a birthday brunch incredibly late. I hate being 'that' person, but i was. I frantically texted my friend to get seated and let the staff know they can order for me. I crossed my fingers that they would seat the group without me. And you know what ; they did. How amazing is that? Not many places do, so I really appreciate that accommodation.I only ordered benedict eggs with pulled pork, but was pretty happy with it. The eggs were runny, the English muffin was crispy, there was a lovely amount of pulled pork, a small side salad and some crispy potatoes. The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star dish, is the amount of sauce on the pulled pork and the hollandaise wasn't flavorful enough. I did come away full with my order though!So I came into the restaurant with some baked goods. Hoping to enjoy some cake with the girls, I tried to secretly ask the waitress if it would be ok to have them there. Pleasant as can be, they checked with the manager /kitchen and they (yet again) accommodated. Since I didn't bring candles, do you know what they did? THEY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT CANDLES. For four cupcakes. What kind of amazing service is that??Thank you all for helping to make my friend's birthday a great one!",5.0
"This is my favorite place to brunch in the city. I came in two weeks ago and when I came back in today, both the owner (Dennis) and the bartender (Candace) remembered me - and my name - and my whole story (where I live, what I ordered, what neighborhood I just moved from, etc). It's hard, in this city, to feel ""home"" anywhere; it's always so lonely, even amidst a sea of people. There's a reason I come back here --- not only is the food INCREDIBLE and the draft beer selection exceptional, but the vibe in this space is positive and easygoing and those who work here go the extra mile to make me, the customer, feel appreciated. I can't say enough good things. Go here.",5.0
"I was trying to go to Cafe Luluc down the street for brunch but it was packed and they have no idea how to form a line so I came here instead. First customers in that place for about twenty minutes but they were still busy opening so we didn't get any extra attention. In fact they forgot part of the order. Anyway, the chicken and waffle was incredible. Glad I didn't wait for Luluc.",4.0
"I absolutely loved everything about this place! The service, food, and ambience was great for brunch. I ordered the French toast with a side of bacon. The French toast was absolutely amazing! The bacon was cooked to perfection. The portion was substantial for the price. I also had a drink that I can't remember the name of but it was made with gin. The drink was so refreshing and nicely made. I will definitely come back here. My waiter provided excellent service. Overall, this place exceeded my expectations.",5.0
"I was disappointed in this restaurant. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were not crispy, nor was the chicken. The  food came out as if it was cooked and then nuked in a microwave. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich that came with fries. I must say the fries were excellent; they were  the best thing we tasted. Bloody Mary was decent ( really small though ) and the Hawaiian coffee was a nice way to warm up. Ambience is nice, beer list is decent, the food was mediocre- will not come here again.",3.0
"This one time we tried to go to Smorgasburg in BK, only to realize we had arrived there on the wrong day. Womp womp.

The sad part was some basic beeyotches that sat next to us complained the entire time about their meal and their experience (I believe an exact quote was: ""I didn't know the salad would have this much lettuce""), so as we were quiet and polite, we were totally ignored by the staff, who was doting on this harem of haters.  Next time, maybe the manager could have handled this situation so that we could have had refills and service in an appropriate time frame.",2.0
"I was satisfied with this meal!Initially I wanted to try another brunch spot, but calling ahead I was told the wait would be up to an hour and I was getting hangry. Yelped a few spots and came across Uglyduckling and I'm glad I did! Walking in, no one really greeted us and we had to go up to ask for seats (which was one negative point.) There were two tables of two along the way that were VERY close to each other, it almost seemed impossible to get in there. (The one next to the wall seemed like a very claustrophobic area.) I asked if we could sit toward the other wall because it was out in the open so he gladly picked up an extra chair for me. There was some football game going on so at one point fans were cheering super loud and it scared the bejeezus out of me.Anyways, on to the food. I almost always get eggs benedict when I go for brunch because that's the only time I can get it and I love it!! I got the Eggs Ugly Duck, which on their website says it has lobster, but on the menu in the restaurant it was lump crab. They give you a side salad and some home fries on the side. I don't like home fries but my boyfriend ate almost all of them so I guess they were good. The salad was meh, not enough dressing, ate one leaf that tasted okay but ate another leaf that just tasted like a leaf with no dressing which is unappetizing to me. The benedict itself was quite tasty! The hollandaise sauce was spot on, the poached egg was runny, the bread wasn't too hard to cut but wasn't soggy and they gave a generous amount of lump crab! My boyfriend got the Smoked Ugly, we split our dishes, and this benedict was also really good! This one had more flavor, due to the pulled pork, and was obviously more meaty which he enjoyed more. I thought they were both delicious and I think it depends on what you're food mood is that day and which one would suit your tastebuds at that very moment so I would definitely recommend both.For a drink, I got the lemonade which was actually very yummy! There was a balance of sweet and sour, I can't handle sour things too well so I like when my lemonade is on the sweeter side. However, they put so much ice that after 20 minutes of having my drink it was so diluted I didn't even want to drink it anymore.",4.0
Great woodsy interior with giant chalkboard beer menu and 20-some odd taps.  Servers were all VERY friendly.Had the chicken & waffles plus Irish coffee.  The portions are generous and I was seriously stuffed - we delayed our shopping plans because it was so good.This is one of my few 5 star ratings because it well surpassed my expectations.,5.0

The eggs and the salad were both delicious. Just as we were finishing our appetizer, our meals came out. I had the ahi tuna burger with fries.

"We came in a little tipsy to the Ugly Duckling after seeing one of the last Daily Shows. One of the last good ones anyway. Seating was easy to get but the place seemed vibrant. The owner was strolling around and checking on everyone, and you get the feeling that this place deserves to succeed.The menu is diverse and healthy.

"The Good.-The fried chicken and waffles. I was initially concerned when our server came out to confess that they'd only be using chicken breast that evening, but the flavor was excellent.

Nothing too crazy, but a solid appetizer, well-executed.-The Stevens Point Nude Beach wheat beer I had. Never seen it on tap anywhere, had to order it,* thoroughly enjoyed it. -The beer selection. With around 30 taps and plenty more in cans, you should be able to find something you like.The Bad.-The beer list. It's very oddly organized. Some of the beers are listed only by the brewery: Which Sam? Which Abita? Which Captain Lawrence? And some are only listed by the name of the brew (i.e. Sweet Action). There are also no prices; I was told, ""Most of them are $7, but some aren't."" This is easily fixed, but it should be fixed. -The pricing. Again, it's a bit strange. The chicken and waffles are quite affordable (I think it was $17), but the Uglyduckling salad was $14. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice salad, but it's priced like a main when it's not substantial in the least. Throw some meat, cheese, nuts in there and we can talk.The Ugly.-The fact that these minor hiccups make me want to talk about what a beautiful swan I hope Uglyduckling turns out to be.

"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch because we were in the neighborhood and saw it had 4.5 stars. My food came out cold and I had to wait for it to come back out while my boyfriend ate his meal, which was pretty annoying but I understand that sort of thing happens at a busy restaurant. I expected them to maybe comp one of our drinks for the inconvenience, but they did not. The main reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the food wasn't very good. The burger was over cooked and the pulled chicken eggs Benedict was dry and kind of flavorless. Our waitress was friendly and the drinks were good but I doubt I will be returning.",3.0

"Came here for a birthday brunch-making rsvp was a breeze and they were so accommodating with the changes i had for a party of 7 on 8/23/15.usually restaurants aren't really flexible with seating and time, especially when running late and on the weekends. but because it was  the weekend and trains were horrendous as well as traffic; we were all running late. not only did they seat us without our full party- and completely understood our situation, they were also so freaking sweet! so bombdiggity!the full staff was so friendly and it was truly a warming atmosphere. being in the hospitality industry i feel like we don't often receive warm smiles or gestures, which i understand- it's tough, tiring and busy. but despite how disoriented and a hot mess my group was because we were all rushing to get there, they made sure we were comfortable since we step foot inside. they were patient as we chatted away, trying to decide what to eat  as we waited for one more guest to arrive before making our orders. they did not rush us which i loved! it was fairly busy but not packed to the point it was hard to breath but still busy. i love this neighborhood and i love this place, it's just so cozy. my friends were psyched about ordering booze for brunch of course, i had the eggs ugly duck, which is eggs benedict but with lobser. NOM NOM NOM! it came along side with some greens & home fries. OH HAIL YASSS. i was contemplating on this dish or their chicken and waffles, but how can i NOT order eggs benedict for brunch- it's my fav! it did not fail me, super yums. my friends all seem to enjoyed their food as well, a good number of us had the eggs ugly duck. they also enjoyed their boozy drinks. staff was also attentive to make sure we had everything we need as we pigged out and chatted out. i even did some ice breaker games there and made my friend drink water out of a baby bottle for the rest of the brunch, and you know what? no judgement, weird looks or questions asked, they just let our table chat away and enjoy ourselves. often times, in other places  especially for brunch when they're busy- when they want us to hurry up and leave they would constantly ask us if everything was okay and if we were done if we want the check...etc- but not at  uglyduckling, they are just awesome cause they gave us time to chat and didn't rush us but still made sure we had the stuff we needed as well as tending to all their other happy guest.places like these is a gem. i'm a party pooper saw them prepare my cupcakes. the staff is just so darn awesome. sang happy birthday with my friends! aside from the food- i feel like what perfects an atmosphere is the people who serve there- thank you uglyduckling staff. i would come here again and again and again. p.s. i just noticed my friend wrote a review based on the same day here too, holy cow you guys went out to get candles for the cupcakes?!?!?! YOU GUYS ARE A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL OF AWESOME. thank you for making my birthday so memorable :) the reason why i love being in hospitality is because of people like you- this was not just a brunch- made me totally want to go beyond in the future for people i encounter too just like you did for me. seriously dude, thanks uglyduckling staff xoxo",5.0

"Have you ever gone out to eat and the experience of trying a new restaurant and chatting with friend made your day?Well, eating at the Uglyduckling was such an experience. Although the place is a bit small, it's just right for a small group or brunch/dinner between great friends. The Uglyduckling is a restaurant nestled on a block filled with many other great eating options but what makes UglyDuckling so great is everything about it. Once you arrive, you will be greeted by a friendly wait staff and a restaurant ambiance that that will make you feel as if your eating in your own home. As for the food, I enjoyed the amazing French toast, stuffed with an amazing filling that I can't recall right now but the whole dish came together very well. Especially with the fresh fruit that garnished the dish. I so enjoyed my meal and my very good friend did as well. He enjoyed a plate of very well seasoned chicken and waffles. I will, recommend UglyDucking to my friend and others.",4.0

We were seated immediately and attended to by a sweet guy and great busboys. I ordered an open-faced omelet with delicious fresh veggies and amazing, crispy potatoes. Yum! My friends enjoyed their benedicts/chicken & waffles, it was clean plates all around by the end of the meal. We saw the owner chatting with people, and helping out when needed -- really the staff just seemed to enjoy working there.Yes, it's a little pricier than some places nearby, but I think it's worth it for the experience and higher quality food.",5.0
"Came here for brunch and super impressed with this place. The interior finish sports a industrial rustic with class -- the entire glass storefront opens to the street on nice days.

I tried and loved the empire cream ale; it was a crisp aromatic golden ale with a cream top.For brunch, I got the Eggs Ugly Duck, which was an eggs benedict with steamed lobster! I always liked a spin off of classic eggs benedict and the ugly duck does it well. It also comes with a salad and some delicious seasoned potatoes! My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffle that came with spicy aioli sauce, which was also very good. We liked that it wasn't a bready fried chicken, though the waffle was a bit soggy for my preference. The waiters were all super friendly and attentive! Overall, it was a pleasant brunch experience that I would definitely recommend to others.",5.0
"I've wanted to check out Uglyduckling ever since it opened, and finally had a chance to. It's hard to stand out on Smith Street due to all the other restaurants, but Uglyduckling has done a good job. The space is part of the old MTA building that's now next to Lululemon, so it has super high ceilings, and painted brick walls. Looks great. They also have 30 beers on tap (nothing too crazy, but some good local crafts).Their menu is also pretty extensive. Whether you want to eat by land or by sea, they have several options. Don't be fooled by the name though; they actually have several vegetarian options that sounded great. But of course, that's not why we came here.The Ugly poutine (provolone, duck confit and sweet BBQ) was solid. Not your typical poutine, to say the least. The BBQ sauce goes well with the duck, but don't expect something reminiscent of Canada. The fries were bit soggy, likely due to the deep bowl they were served in, but still good.My friend and I both got Uglyduckling burgers. Sadly, they've changed their menu a bit (either permanently or for the week I was there). Their website still lists their namesake burger has having a fried quail egg and pork belly. The one that was available when I went (first week of September) instead included fried cheese (I forgot what kind) and grilled onions on top. Not quite as adventurous, but it was still a damn fine burger. The breading on the fried cheese (I forget what kind it was) added some nice texture (kind of like when you get the Shake Shack burger with a fried mushroom on top). I got mine medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. They offer three condiments (ketchup, mustard and mayo) and the burger tasted great with any of the three.Since we ordered the poutine, we didn't want to overdo it with the fries, and they allowed us to make a substitution for any of the other sides, without additional charge. My buddy did the grilled veggies (squash, cucumbers, and possibly other gourds). I did the sweet potato hash, served with kale. Delicious, but totally defeated the purpose of not getting fries. Definitely worth it. Only complaint was that the sides were a bit oily, so it made the veggies seem a lot less healthy.Service was great. Our waitress made some great beer recommendations (and gave us samples in fancy glasses). Also, I left a bag on the ledge behind our table, and when I came back looking for it two hours later, our waitress popped out of nowhere and handed it to me. Can't beat that!All in all, Uglyduckling is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and I'll definitely be back. Hope to try the duck confit sandwich for lunch.",4.0

"Charming new restaurant in Cobble Hill! Great ambiance and decor - I love the wooden planks on the walls and the amazing craft beer selection.

"I think Uglyducking is awesome all around, but perhaps especially to watch college football when you aren't a college student.  I called about an hour before our game was about to start and asked if they could set a table up for five, any time between then and the game.  They told me they would have a table to us by kickoff.  When we arrived we saw our table set up in a prime watching location, so we went over and sat down.  Within a minute we were warmly and enthusiastically greeted, the TVs were changed to NBC and we were asked what we were drinking for the game (and no judgment from the waiter when I eschewed their top notch beer list for numerous gallons of prosecco over the next four hours).Food was just perfect, and they had something on the menu for everybody.  When three more friends showed up, they had no problem pulling up a table and adding a few chairs.  The night was seamless (except for the painful Clemson loss).  Most of all, the restaurant staff really made it a fun evening for us by keeping the drinks flowing and sharing in highs and lows.  They were flawless.Takeaway, this place is perfect for guys' nights, girl's nights', parents, your cousin and his friends in college, and everybody in between.  Great job making a comfortable place to spend a night out.",5.0

Two words. Ugly Mary. This was one well made bloody mary that packed a punch. The pimento cheeseburger and crispy french fries were also nicely done. The pimento wasn't overwhelming and a nice addition to the perfectly cooked burger. I'd forgo the lackluster  chicken and waffles though. Fun atmosphere with plenty of TVs to watch a game. I'll be back to try one or a few of their 30 draught beers.,3.0
"The chicken and waffles are everything yelp says they are. There is nothing I can say that other reviews haven't already, except that I stopped here Saturday evening with a friend, and am still thinking about that perfectly crisp chicken and super soft waffle on this unfortunate Monday morning. My friend got the mac + cheese with bacon and also loved her food. We both ordered cocktails (Hurricane), and loved the flavor and how much of a kick it had. That's not what I'm here to talk about though. I've logged into yelp after all this time to praise this place for its service. I haven't had service as wonderful as this in ages. The place was busy, but we were seated right away. Our server, Kate, was friendly, funny, and really helpful. Besides her, there was another woman whose name escapes me who also checked in on us every so often. But not only were the servers super attentive - the busser cleaning off the table next to us ALSO checked in and asked how everything was going with our meal, and if we needed anything. We constantly felt taken care of, and like our patronage mattered, which doesn't always happen in busy places with a reputation like the Uglyduckling has. Also I should mention that they were handling a very large group for a birthday gathering at the time, and it was wonderful to see them taking care of not only the group, but every single customer in the joint. There wasn't a frown to be found in the entire establishment. Especially not at our table. If you feel like the prices are steep at all, believe me when I say that the service + food more than make up for it. For service alone, I'd come back here. For ambiance and decor, I'd come back here. For the delicious food I have yet to try, I'll *definitely* be coming back here. Thanks for a wonderful way to cap off a Saturday shopping trip, Uglyduck!! Writing this review has been a great Monday morning pick-me-up. You are a gift that keeps on giving. x",5.0

"I've been here a bunch of times and my experience has been varied,  although never poor.  The bar tenders and waiters are knowledgeable,  nice,  and a pleasure to chat with.  The ambiance is excellent with open glass frontage. The food is Inconsistent.  Sometimes good,  other time less so.  Go with the simpler dishes to avoid complications,  and enjoy the company of the excellent staff and friendly customers.",3.0
"I think Uglyducking is awesome all around, but perhaps especially to watch college football when you aren't a college student.  I called about an hour before our game was about to start and asked if they could set a table up for five, any time between then and the game.  They told me they would have a table to us by kickoff.  When we arrived we saw our table set up in a prime watching location, so we went over and sat down.  Within a minute we were warmly and enthusiastically greeted, the TVs were changed to NBC and we were asked what we were drinking for the game (and no judgment from the waiter when I eschewed their top notch beer list for numerous gallons of prosecco over the next four hours).Food was just perfect, and they had something on the menu for everybody.  When three more friends showed up, they had no problem pulling up a table and adding a few chairs.  The night was seamless (except for the painful Clemson loss).  Most of all, the restaurant staff really made it a fun evening for us by keeping the drinks flowing and sharing in highs and lows.  They were flawless.Takeaway, this place is perfect for guys' nights, girl's nights', parents, your cousin and his friends in college, and everybody in between.  Great job making a comfortable place to spend a night out.",5.0
"""A"" Rated. Staff was very pleasant, service was great. Food was excellent. Deviled Eggs with bacon is a must try. Had the pimento cheese Burger, it came with Sweet and Potato shoestring fries which was a nice change up from the norm. Nice beer selection as well. I would definitely recommend and will patronize again...thumbs up",5.0
"Came with my best friend and stepson food was delicious. Chicken and waffles are tender and juicy. Not a wide variety of choices but decent menu . Drinks are pricey but affordable wish the mimosas were unlimited would of got more my girlfriend and I had two each. The waiter and hostess were very attentive, and patient as we took a while to figure out what we wanted. The atmosphere was comfy the building had a woodsy cabin feel like i was in the Montauk having brunch by the lake. (minus the lake) lol. Overall it was a lovely Sunday brunch would definitely come back.",3.0
Two words. Ugly Mary. This was one well made bloody mary that packed a punch. The pimento cheeseburger and crispy french fries were also nicely done. The pimento wasn't overwhelming and a nice addition to the perfectly cooked burger. I'd forgo the lackluster  chicken and waffles though. Fun atmosphere with plenty of TVs to watch a game. I'll be back to try one or a few of their 30 draught beers.,3.0
"The chicken and waffles are everything yelp says they are. There is nothing I can say that other reviews haven't already, except that I stopped here Saturday evening with a friend, and am still thinking about that perfectly crisp chicken and super soft waffle on this unfortunate Monday morning. My friend got the mac + cheese with bacon and also loved her food. We both ordered cocktails (Hurricane), and loved the flavor and how much of a kick it had. That's not what I'm here to talk about though. I've logged into yelp after all this time to praise this place for its service. I haven't had service as wonderful as this in ages. The place was busy, but we were seated right away. Our server, Kate, was friendly, funny, and really helpful. Besides her, there was another woman whose name escapes me who also checked in on us every so often. But not only were the servers super attentive - the busser cleaning off the table next to us ALSO checked in and asked how everything was going with our meal, and if we needed anything. We constantly felt taken care of, and like our patronage mattered, which doesn't always happen in busy places with a reputation like the Uglyduckling has. Also I should mention that they were handling a very large group for a birthday gathering at the time, and it was wonderful to see them taking care of not only the group, but every single customer in the joint. There wasn't a frown to be found in the entire establishment. Especially not at our table. If you feel like the prices are steep at all, believe me when I say that the service + food more than make up for it. For service alone, I'd come back here. For ambiance and decor, I'd come back here. For the delicious food I have yet to try, I'll *definitely* be coming back here. Thanks for a wonderful way to cap off a Saturday shopping trip, Uglyduck!! Writing this review has been a great Monday morning pick-me-up. You are a gift that keeps on giving. x",5.0
"Fair pricing for fairly good food. I got the shrimp tacos which were pretty delicious. The only downside was that they forgot about our table which ironically enough was the largest party there (four people). Forty-five minutes later, we finally got our food and it was amazing. That might have been our hunger talking though. They knocked off 10% off our bill in the end and we walked out appeased.",4.0
"UglyDucklingNY: Brooklyn: Cobble Hill6:30pm Thursday 22 October 2014Four StarsAfter a 4 hour wait in Brooklyn criminal DWI part, I needed some comfort food. I sat at the end of the bar. It was happy hour but beer didn't really appeal to me. There was low volume reggae music playing which was not out of place for the place. There are four flat screen tvs and about 30 taps. I asked for water three times which would have upset me but the Bartender recognized the mistake and introduced himself to me. After this, my customer service was great. I had the chicken and waffles. The boneless chicken was good but not really chicken and waffles to me. The breading was well seasoned and crispy but the lack of chicken skin was disappointing. The inside was moist and tender. The waffle was okay - it wasn't very crispy but had good flavor. They served it with mildly spicy aioli and maple syrup. The sweet and creamy made a good combo. I asked for hot sauce. No franks but sriracha. I mixed it in with aioli for the perfect amount of heat. I also had a bulleit rye on the rocks.

"My husband and I came here over the weekend for late lunch when it wasn't busy at all. I like the look and the atmosphere, though the TVs confused me a bit since it has the generic-y hip, decent-restaurant decor and vibe. We ordered the Ugly Mary and a beer flight. They were out of one of the beers we requested, but no biggie--they have lot of options and a menu full of great descriptions. For some reason, which was never disclosed to us, our drinks took close to 20 minutes to come out. I know it wasn't the server's fault, but I would've appreciated a quick word about it since I kept seeing her bring drinks to other tables. I can only speculate. The bartender did look a little slow-moving and was distracted in conversation. The burger was good, just a tad overcooked (well done when I'd requested medium). The fries were off-the-chart fantastic! They were a thin and crispy mix of regular and sweet potato fries. Still dreaming of them now. The chicken and waffles were ok. My husband said he thought the waffle was better than the chicken, which is something I've never heard him say before. There were lots of large bones and not a ton of meat, but he enjoyed it anyway. With all the other options in the area I might not come back just for the food, but I'd stop in for a drink or to try some new beers...with a side of fries, of course!",3.0

It's kind of pathetic that we didn't make in time given the brunch there ends at 5 p.m., but oh well. We weren't that interested in their dinner menu, so we wandered around for a bit and ended up here. I know Uglyduckling also does brunch, but this review is for their dinner menu. It was a great experience!It's kind of smallish, but it wasn't terribly busy when were there, so it was fine. The decor was plain, but in a good way. It had a nice homey feel. We were greeted immediately by who I can only assume was a manager there. He was really friendly and enthusiastic. In fact, when we were seated at a wobbly table he immediately fixed it for us. Our server was also great (I think her name might have been Sommer?). They have a great selection of beers, but were out of the one that I initially ordered (unibroue la fin du monde from Canada). She brought me a sample of another one that she said was similar (Boulevard Tank 7 from Missouri). I've never had either so I can't compare, but the sample she brought me was delicious and I went ahead and got a pint of that.We ordered mac n' cheese to start. Now, I LOVE mac n' cheese in general! And this was some fantastic mac n' cheese. The pasta shells could've been cooked a little better, but they weren't bad. The cheese sauce was phenomenal! I could have been happy just eating that.I ordered the Pimento Cheese Burger. It was ok. The aioli was really tasty, the bun was pretty good, but the patty itself was just eh. I ordered it medium rare, and it was quite juicy in the middle (maybe a little too bloody, but it was ok), but the edges were dry and overcooked, and seasoning was a bit bland. It did come with some great fries though. They were a mix of sweet potato and regular and I liked dipping them in the aioli that came with my girlfriend's meal (she doesn't like anything spicy), which also happened to be the same thing that was on my burger. My girlfriend got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffle, which she enjoyed a lot. Overall, it was a great experience.

"So we had the Ugly Duckling in our sites for some time now and stopped in for brunch. Place was packed but after a short 10 minute wait a few tables opened up and the experience begins. Nice atmosphere and huge tap beer selection.Pros; chicken & waffles were great. Crispy chicken no bones over a super light waffle. Nice maple syrup and slightly spicy sauce was good accompaniment. Big hit. Second dish was steak and eggs. Although delicious a bit disappointed in amount of sliced hanger steak in the order.Cons; I like to mop up the egg yolk with some bread...no bread, seriously!!! You do French toast, burgers, scallop sandwich,,,no bread, really. Second was it was around 3pm and asked if we could have an order of poutine since it was a highly talked about item. No we don't serve that during brunch only dinner. So to round off our experience because dining and especially brunch should be an experience,They could have exceeded our expectations by getting bread and asking if they could make an order of poutine to satisfy a guest request. Yes they were busy but we gave you an opportunity to generate more revenue but no way. They didn't even ask the kitchen even when you will begin serving it in 2 hours anyway, at least make an effort. It always mystifies me why wait staff simply don't introduce themselves. So simple and welcoming yet no one does it anymore.

"I went here last night for dinner. Pretty quiet in there and was greeted by an extremely dry waitress. Not that I expect a waiter to be this bubbly, hyper person, but she was like REALLY DRY, and seemed like she just didn't care. Meh, whatever I am here for the food. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and my girlfriend got the chicken and waffles. Food came out super quickly which was nice because we were starving. The mac and cheese was ok. No bread crumbs on top, no flavor, just lots of cheese. Once I added some pepper to it it was better. My girlfriends chicken was ACTUALLY RAW. She tore a piece off and the chicken wasn't cooked AT ALL inside, even though the skin was crispy. Understandably we had to send it back. We waited for a while for them to bring out the dish again, although this time instead of two pieces of chicken, she got one (WTH?). The chicken had a decent flavor to it although another piece would've been nice. The waffle was soft, and not toasted like one would like. Overall food was blah, service was blah. Beer was good. Would definitely not go back.",2.0

"This is a newcomer to the fine array of Smith Street eateries.  I tried it on New Year's Day for a late lunch/early dinner and enjoyed their special sweet potato and chorizo beignets which were more like hush puppies than beignets.  They were tasty morsels and a perfect blend of sweet and savory.  Their signature fried chicken and waffles was a little pricey ($16) for what it was but good to know they used boneless thigh meat for both taste and convenience.  There was a hint of spice in the chicken which was intriguing but not overwhelming.  The waffles were perfectly done in the Belgian style.  The spicy aioli it came with worked better with the beignets than the waffles.  Their version of poutine took a turn from the traditional cheese curds and was instead made with melted provolone which somehow worked with the ample pulled barbecued beef which smothered the perfectly hand-cut French fries.  There was a lot of flavor and protein in the poutine which could either be a shared appetizer or an entree.  The food however is just a nice backdrop to the extensive beer selection including their own Ugly Ducking ale, lager or pilsner.  Go to U.D. with no expectations for healthy eating but be surprised with the interesting vegetarian offerings including sautéed kale and bean burgers.  Our server was a little slow but par for the course since it was a holiday and a little busy.  She was pleasant enough and I was more fascinated by how she was able handle the heavy dishes and still carry off her low back black dress!  U.D. felt more like an upscale sports bars with the games playing on the screens than a hipster hangout.  The cuisine and craft beer make it a cut above the average sports bar though.",4.0

Very shortly after that night was present and I invited my dear friend to step out.

"We had a 11 person group and the staff was more than accommodating. The bar had an awesome selection of local beers with most on tap. I had the Manhattan and it was perfect!

"Had dinner at Uglyduckling tonight with friends, really great experience.  All of us got the ahi tuna burger which was really fresh, cooked just right and served on a delicious roll with great fries and sides.  The kale side dish was amazing, great flavor and texture.  And of course we had many beers, a few of which were among the best beers we have ever had.  Loved it, will be back.",5.0
3.5 stars! Staff is well mannered and patient. The beer selections are smashing. The burgers are delectable. The chicken and waffles... a disappointment. Little under seasoned and dry... and some of the saddest waffle I've had in a while.,4.0
"I went here last night for dinner. Pretty quiet in there and was greeted by an extremely dry waitress. Not that I expect a waiter to be this bubbly, hyper person, but she was like REALLY DRY, and seemed like she just didn't care. Meh, whatever I am here for the food. I ordered the Mac and Cheese and my girlfriend got the chicken and waffles. Food came out super quickly which was nice because we were starving. The mac and cheese was ok. No bread crumbs on top, no flavor, just lots of cheese. Once I added some pepper to it it was better. My girlfriends chicken was ACTUALLY RAW. She tore a piece off and the chicken wasn't cooked AT ALL inside, even though the skin was crispy. Understandably we had to send it back. We waited for a while for them to bring out the dish again, although this time instead of two pieces of chicken, she got one (WTH?). The chicken had a decent flavor to it although another piece would've been nice. The waffle was soft, and not toasted like one would like. Overall food was blah, service was blah. Beer was good. Would definitely not go back.",2.0
This place is amazing. customer service is great. The decor of the restaurant is really cool. Grear for a late date. Food is really tasty. Seasoned just well. Might have to make this my new hangout.,5.0
"This is a newcomer to the fine array of Smith Street eateries.  I tried it on New Year's Day for a late lunch/early dinner and enjoyed their special sweet potato and chorizo beignets which were more like hush puppies than beignets.  They were tasty morsels and a perfect blend of sweet and savory.  Their signature fried chicken and waffles was a little pricey ($16) for what it was but good to know they used boneless thigh meat for both taste and convenience.  There was a hint of spice in the chicken which was intriguing but not overwhelming.  The waffles were perfectly done in the Belgian style.  The spicy aioli it came with worked better with the beignets than the waffles.  Their version of poutine took a turn from the traditional cheese curds and was instead made with melted provolone which somehow worked with the ample pulled barbecued beef which smothered the perfectly hand-cut French fries.  There was a lot of flavor and protein in the poutine which could either be a shared appetizer or an entree.  The food however is just a nice backdrop to the extensive beer selection including their own Ugly Ducking ale, lager or pilsner.  Go to U.D. with no expectations for healthy eating but be surprised with the interesting vegetarian offerings including sautéed kale and bean burgers.  Our server was a little slow but par for the course since it was a holiday and a little busy.  She was pleasant enough and I was more fascinated by how she was able handle the heavy dishes and still carry off her low back black dress!  U.D. felt more like an upscale sports bars with the games playing on the screens than a hipster hangout.  The cuisine and craft beer make it a cut above the average sports bar though.",4.0

"So randomly I bought the living social deal for the ugly duckling just hoping that it would save me one night from boredom. Very shortly after that night was present and I invited my dear friend to step out.

I would recommend this spot for a night out with friends, even a game night would be ideal.",5.0

It was tender and had the right balance of sweet and savory. We also had the chicken and waffles, served with pure maple syrup and a spicy aioli. I LOVED this dish. The chicken was boneless, tender, and seasoned perfectly (which is apparently a secret blend of spices). It was a generous amount of chicken paired with an equally generous waffle.

A bit disappointed after reading the raving reviews here. Staff are really nice and friendly though. We ordered eggs ugly and smoked Benedicts and all our eggs are over cooked - not runny at all.

"Chicken & Waffles!!!!They were everything chicken and waffles should be. Chicken: light, crispy, well- but not over seasoned, fresh out of the fryer. Waffles: airy, fluffy, pretty perfect density. Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Both paired well with the other and were equally tasty in either the syrup or the sriracha/mayo dip. It was cool to be able to get both sweet and savory on the same plate. Also, I was a little fatty and had the mushroom kale risotto. It was risotto-y. Lots of shrooms and it remained hot as hell to the last bite, which I was very pleased with considering I destroyed the chicken and waffle first. I was way too excited to begin eating and burned my mouth, but I can blame no one but my crazy workout beforehand which left me ravenous with hunger. Can't wait to try more of their menu!!

"Went here with the family for dinner on our last night in New York.This place left much to be desired.First, I want to say that the only item in the pictures on their Yelp page that they still have is the chicken and waffles. (Which is what I ordered and it was delicious!) When I asked the waitress about it she said, and I quote, ""Yeah, yelp lies. We don't have that stuff anymore and we haven't for a while."" No big deal, but those pictures were part of the reason we decided on this place, so it was mildly disappointing.They do have a magnificent beer selection and their cocktails and sangria are on point.Why the two stars, you ask?When we got there, we were one of 3 tables in the whole place, and there were a couple people at the bar. We were sat promptly and ordered our drinks and some appetizers.The beer samplers and appetizers came out pretty quickly, and were pretty good....but that is where the good stops.We ordered our food pretty quickly after we sat, but after 40 minutes, and watching multiple tables be sat, get their food, pay and leave, before we got our food, we got a little concerned. My question is....why didn't our waitress notice and check on our food? She was MIA, we kept trying to get her attention, but to no avail.So we mentioned something to the guy who appeared to be the owner and he went in to the back to check on it for us.The kitchen manager came out immediately and told us that he was sorry and that they were having trouble with their printer in the kitchen and he would get our food out as quickly as possible. It did come out pretty quick after that, and everything was going great...till my sister found a long hair in her fries, before she had even eaten a third of her food.At this point we were running a little late (which isn't completely the restaurants fault but they certainly didn't help), but in an effort to speed things up, my dad had already paid the bill. The manager did nothing but apologize for the hair, he didn't offer to take it off the bill, or bring her another one...nothing.Because we needed to go, the rest of us got our stuff wrapped up to go.I understand that sometimes places just have off days, so I wasn't going to even write a review about it until I just went to eat my leftovers and was surprised to find none of my leftover chicken, which I had about half left, in my container. They did give me a whole waffle, instead of the little less than half that I had left....but they took my chicken...why?Not that I live in New York, but for anyone who does, I wouldn't recommend this place. Like I said, every restaurant has their 'off' days, but this was just too many things that could so easily go wrong again.",2.0

Solid beer selection. I tried the duck poutine and it was good although I'm not sure I'd call it a poutine. It has a kind of sweet gravy which was strange. But still good. It's also a nice spot to watch sports. Lots of TVs.,3.0
"Very lovely place to eat. We went mid afternoon for something stronger than lunch but lighter than dinner. I had the chicken and waffles,descrumptious!!!! My friend had, mistakenly, received salmon on a bed of spinach, which she thankfully ate and enjoyed. Great manager, Kevin.  We will be back!  I ate too fast to take a picture, maybe next time maybe not. Yum.",4.0
I have been here a few times and this place never disappoints.  Never to crowded and the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  There menu is fantastic and I have recently tried a deep fried cod which was fantastic.  Great beer selection and sports on TV.Look no further for brunch or lunch in this neighborhood.,4.0
"Went here with the family for dinner on our last night in New York.This place left much to be desired.First, I want to say that the only item in the pictures on their Yelp page that they still have is the chicken and waffles. (Which is what I ordered and it was delicious!) When I asked the waitress about it she said, and I quote, ""Yeah, yelp lies. We don't have that stuff anymore and we haven't for a while."" No big deal, but those pictures were part of the reason we decided on this place, so it was mildly disappointing.They do have a magnificent beer selection and their cocktails and sangria are on point.Why the two stars, you ask?When we got there, we were one of 3 tables in the whole place, and there were a couple people at the bar. We were sat promptly and ordered our drinks and some appetizers.The beer samplers and appetizers came out pretty quickly, and were pretty good....but that is where the good stops.We ordered our food pretty quickly after we sat, but after 40 minutes, and watching multiple tables be sat, get their food, pay and leave, before we got our food, we got a little concerned. My question is....why didn't our waitress notice and check on our food? She was MIA, we kept trying to get her attention, but to no avail.So we mentioned something to the guy who appeared to be the owner and he went in to the back to check on it for us.The kitchen manager came out immediately and told us that he was sorry and that they were having trouble with their printer in the kitchen and he would get our food out as quickly as possible. It did come out pretty quick after that, and everything was going great...till my sister found a long hair in her fries, before she had even eaten a third of her food.At this point we were running a little late (which isn't completely the restaurants fault but they certainly didn't help), but in an effort to speed things up, my dad had already paid the bill. The manager did nothing but apologize for the hair, he didn't offer to take it off the bill, or bring her another one...nothing.Because we needed to go, the rest of us got our stuff wrapped up to go.I understand that sometimes places just have off days, so I wasn't going to even write a review about it until I just went to eat my leftovers and was surprised to find none of my leftover chicken, which I had about half left, in my container. They did give me a whole waffle, instead of the little less than half that I had left....but they took my chicken...why?Not that I live in New York, but for anyone who does, I wouldn't recommend this place. Like I said, every restaurant has their 'off' days, but this was just too many things that could so easily go wrong again.",2.0
Went one Friday on a living social deal.  Surprisingly good. We had the chicken and waffles and the salmon with spinach salad.

"Wow!!! Thank goodness for a great bar in this area. I had the lobster sandwich and it was amazing( I got talked into it but I'm very happy about it).

Fries were good but not outstanding. No ifs no buts service was first class. Food arrived quickly and was hot. Prices were very good - The ugly duckling burger which includes a quails egg and pulled pork on top was 10 dollars which is very good value. Dessert menu small but appealing.

"Came here on a Friday night with the bf.  We've been meaning to check it out since it opened... mainly since we live around the corner.  I thought the decor was nice-- the place looks great.  I personally like the wood & exposed brick.  They have a decent beer selection.  Sure, there are places with better selections, but I wouldn't go so far as to call their options ""mass market swill.""  The menu isn't incredibly imaginative but we thought it was done well.  It's just slightly fancier takes on traditional bar food... but I guess that's exactly what a gastropub is supposed to be.  We had the steak & one of the burgers for the dinner.  Both were cooked well.  To start we had the poutine & chips and salsa/dip.  Okay, I would have actually called the poutine ""disco fries,"" but it still tasted good.  The corn salsa & bean dip were also tasty; the tortilla chips were homemade but the portion was a little small.  The microgreens garnish was a bit corny but otherwise I thought everything was fine!  (I can't comment on the much-discussed chicken & waffles but someone at the table next to us got it & I thought it looked great.)Yes, the TV tuned to the Weather Channel was odd, but seeing as how I'm not a sports fan I guess I didn't really mind.  I certainly watched the Doppler radar more than I did the Yankees game.  (That being said, it's a decent place to have a beer & watch a game, if that's your thing.  There were 4 or 5 large TVs.)I wasn't bothered by the crowd as much as some other reviewers.  Old?  I mean, sure, the crowd was a little older than Boat Bar.  But bridge & tunnel??  I've been living in this neighborhood for a few years now & I've yet to see the B&T crowd!  I guess the patrons just weren't hipster-y & pretentious enough for some. The service was very friendly, if a little slow, but they were busy that night so I wouldn't hold that against them.   My only complaint is that they took too long to turn on the air conditioner on what was a very humid night.  But I'm sure they won't make that mistake again. I don't know why people found it ""weird"" that the staff were recruiting customers from off the street.  I think it's pretty common & acceptable practice for a new business.  And in fact, I was greeted on the street by one of their hostesses a couple weeks back & she gave me a card for a free beer, which I thought was a nice touch.  It's what motivated my bf & I to go, so I wouldn't have called it ""weird.""Oh & I thought the place was pretty affordable.  We got two beers, two starters & two entrees & the bill only came to $66 (we didn't even redeem our free beer card).  The burger was only $10.  Some reviewer found that to be ""overpriced"" but maybe she's new to NYC... $10 for a burger (plus homemade chips) is not bad at all.  It's only a few bucks more than Shake Shack down the street & that's fast food!!So not a bad time at Uglyduckling.  They're not reinventing the wheel & they have a few minor kinks to work out, but I thought it was a decent-enough addition to the neighborhood.I'm puzzled by some of these bad reviews though.  I actually find it ""weird"" that some of the bad reviewers are singling out the positive reviews as shills, when they each only have one review to their name.  It appears like they have some sort of vendetta against the business owners.  Either than or they're just really pretentious assholes.  Or both.  And no, I'm no shill myself.  I have no affiliation.  I thought it was a nice enough business.  I wouldn't travel out of my way to go here, but since I live around the corner I'd probably stop by again.  It's a nice neighborhood spot but definitely not a destination for trendy foodiots.",4.0

"GREAT new restaurant in Cobble Hill! Great outside and inside decor - Cool gatstropub restaurant vibe with an amazing craft beer selection. Good place for everything- a date, meeting friends, even a family dinner (i was there with my hubby and baby).The owner, manager, hostess, and waitress were extremely warm and accommodated my pouty 15month old. They came over to make sure everything was okay multiple times-not in an annoying way; just a ""is everything cool and can we do anything more for u way"".We shared the pork belly and sweet corn fritters as an appetizer. Comes with a mango(?) jalepeno same that is not hot at all.  Weird sounding combo but very yummy. A perfect guy appetizer for your hungry date (who happened to be my husband , in this case!) . He had the chicken and waffle and liked it a lot. A little different from your typical soul food menu item- a bit crispier and maybe need some powdered sugar (?) for presentation.

"First of all, if you like beer, you'll like Uglyduckling! They have an enormous selection of craft beer with 30 drafts on tap and a handful of canned beers to boot. This is probably the most drafts Smith St. has to offer! They even have their own Uglyduckling draft, which was pleasantly balanced with deep flavor. Second, come hungry! The menu itself is plenty of reason to stop by with its creative take on classic American grub. My first time I tried the chicken and waffles, which were insane! This dish comes with a hefty buttermilk waffle, atop which sits the most succulent, crispy chicken I've ever tried. I tried the chicken by itself first, and it was so juicy and tender, with a spicy crust to give it that extra kick to perfection. And then I tried the chicken paired with the waffle and maple syrup: to call it amazing would be an understatement. It's the type of bite that makes you audibly exclaim, ""Oh wow"" in spite yourself and then proceed to shamelessly lick the plate clean. The second time I visited I tried the Uglyduckling burger, which was also fantastic! This burger comes with a generous patty, pork belly and fried quail egg. My medium rare order was perfectly cooked, and the burger tasted out of this world with the pickles. I'm excited to come back and try the pan seared scallops with risotto, and also the hummus plate, which looks like a work of art on their website.The place overall has a great vibe, with sophisticated filament bulbs drooping casually from the ceiling against gorgeous wood paneling for walls. The decor is upscale, but it still feels comfortable to just relax at the bar and enjoy your meal, whether on your own or with friends. Plus, the owner is incredibly friendly and welcoming, and a great delight to chat with. I'll definitely be coming back for more beer, grub and good times!",5.0
"An amazing new spot in cobble hill. Warm, welcoming, clean ambiance. The food is fantastic and the staff are very friendly. They have 20+ craft beers on tap. I couldn't recommend it more highly. I'm now a regular.",5.0

Would give 4.5 stars if I could ! Great experience- amazing food (risotto and burger especially)! Wish I could describe the creaminess of the risotto but you should taste for yourself. Burger was cooked perfectly and bar service was on point. Brandon the chef is amazing and very personable- came by to meet all the patrons!,4.0
"We went on Sunday night and had a great time. Our bartender, Steve, was a very charming host. The beer selection is quite good, particularly the draft offerings. The Left Hand Brewing Milk Stout was absolutely delicious.",4.0

"First of all, if you like beer, you'll like Uglyduckling! They have an enormous selection of craft beer with 30 drafts on tap and a handful of canned beers to boot. This is probably the most drafts Smith St. has to offer! They even have their own Uglyduckling draft, which was pleasantly balanced with deep flavor. Second, come hungry! The menu itself is plenty of reason to stop by with its creative take on classic American grub. My first time I tried the chicken and waffles, which were insane! This dish comes with a hefty buttermilk waffle, atop which sits the most succulent, crispy chicken I've ever tried. I tried the chicken by itself first, and it was so juicy and tender, with a spicy crust to give it that extra kick to perfection. And then I tried the chicken paired with the waffle and maple syrup: to call it amazing would be an understatement.
