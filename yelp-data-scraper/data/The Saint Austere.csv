"Really great little spot. Came here in a Thursday night with my team of 7. Easy RSVP on open table one hour before. First thing we notice: the lack of noise...we were actually able to enjoy the laid-back hip-hop and hear each other speak. An NYC restaurant where you don't have to yell to keep the convo going? Unheard of!The food was excellent. Get the polenta board, it's delicious. Octopus was tender and accompanied by flavorful cherry tomatoes and potatoes. Special Brussel sprout salad was also very good.The service tho....really cool reaction to my allergy. They made me my own polenta dish with mushrooms since the tomato sauce on some of the accompaniments came from a can. I felt special! Will definitely come back next time I'm in east willy.",5.0
"Food here was okay:-Broccoli Rabe - Meh.  Under salted, rubbery eggs.  Dunno why everyone raves about these.-Cheese was okay.  Really tiny portion.-Mushroom toast was okay.  Texture felt soft and mushed together.-Patatas Bravas was the one thing that was AMAZING.  Perfectly salty, leaving you continuously licking the salty delicious from your lips.  And the crispy shallot bits, just the perfect amount of spice that's cooled ever so slightly by the creamy aioli.  SO GOOD.Ambiance is really nice.  Came here on a Thursday night, and it wasn't crowded at all.  Really chill and they place Brooklyn hip hop jams.  Lots of communal tables and bar seating, cozy and casual intimate vibes. Server was very attentive and knowledgeable.",3.0
"Spontaneously decided to come here on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised. Karina, was very knowledgable about the wine list and made an awesome recommendation. We decided to try the Chef's Tasting Menu and it did not disappoint, every dish was delicious. It included the Broccoli Rabe (3/5); Grilled Octopus (4/5); Creamy Polenta (6/5); Cavatelli (5/5); and the Roasted Organic Chicken (5/5).I am personally not a fan of polenta. (It reminds me of kasha/porridge that I had to eat as a child.) But this sausage polenta is a game changer! The grilled Octopus had an interested kick with the roasted lemon. The Roasted Organic Chicken was unbelievable. The Chicken was juicy, and was served on top of a mushroom risotto. They started playing Slaughterhouse right when I was having dessert, which made it that much better. I had the tiramisu with the chocolate granita. It was super light, and the granita was very refreshing. This place was awesome, and I can't wait to come back!",5.0
"Located conveniently in the heart of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This restaurant serves up some really good delicious food. The interior is very lovely. Candle lit, dimmed, small, cozy, and warm. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted warmly and were seated right away since we made a 6:30 pm reservation. Our lady waiter also greeted us very kindly and asked us if we have been to this restaurant before. We told her, it was our first time. She welcomed us and told us in detail about the menu. Very helpful. The menu is pretty simple and all on one page. They also have a good list of alcohol on their drinks menu. All dishes are meant to be shared, so everything is portioned size.For starters we had the Rhode Island Oysters, Broccoli Rabe, The Creamy Polenta, and The Crispy Farm Egg.1. Rhode Island Oysters were fresh, juicy, plump, and briny. Very refreshing. 2. Broccoli Rabe comes with anchovy, parmigiano, boiled egg. This was absolutely delicious. Broccoli Rabe is usually bitter, but it gets balanced out with the saltiness from the anchovy and parmigiano. The boiled egg also provides a nice softness to the Broccoli Rabe. One of the best Broccoli Rabe I have tasted. One of their signature dishes according to the restaurant. 3. The Creamy Polenta has sausage and cipollini on top. The polenta was melting in my mouth. The taste was just incredible. It was so smooth, creamy, a little savory, and almost sweet as well. I was amazed. I almost wanted to lick the plate. 4. The Crispy Farm Egg has wild mushroom, fingerlings, and prosciutto. The egg was runny on the inside and it oozes out as soon as you cut into it. Nice crisp on the outside. I like the saltiness from the mushroom and prosciutto. Everything compliments well with the Egg. It was good. Our next round of dishes we decided to go with some pasta. We had the Spaghetti allo Scoglio and the Tagliolini. We were given the option to half size the 2 pasta dishes, so we can try out both dishes without having too much pasta. 5. Spaghetti allo Scoglio has littleneck clams, rock shrimp, calabrese chilies. I was not expecting the sauce to have the kick in spice, but it was actually good. Not overpowering. A nice plate of pasta. 6. Tagliolini has chantarelle & royal trumpet mushrooms. I liked this pasta dish the best because it has mushrooms. The pasta was very flavorful and delicious. For our dessert round, I was disappointed to hear that they did not have any nutella zeppole for today. We both ordered the Tiramisu and the Olive Oiled Cake with creme anglaise7. The Tiramisu was very yummy. I'm not huge on coffee, but I enjoyed every bite of it. 8. The Olive Oiled Cake was very moist and the creme anglaise made extra yummy. Overall the food was fantastic and delicious. The environment is a lovely place to dine at. The service was welcoming, friendly, attentive, and informative. I'm definitely coming back here again, especially to get that nuttella zeppole and try out different dishes.",4.0
"PO. LEN. TA. If there's one thing you take away from this review, make it the polenta. It's seriously THAT good. Order it. I've always considered polenta more of an underwhelming side dish, but at The Saint Austere, it is absolutely the crown jewel of the place. And with good reason. I can't recall exactly what our server said about the preparation of dish, but I do remember that from start to finish, it's about a 12-hour cooking process. All that TLC is apparent once you take that first bite. The polenta is smooth and creamy, but not at all heavy. And when paired with the sausage and a wee bit of the oil/sauce, it makes for the absolute perfect bite. Hands down, best polenta dish I've ever had. This dish by itself made the trek from Astoria worth it.As for things non-polenta related, let's break down the rest of the evening. Arrived about 15 minutes late for our reservation (F U G-train) on a Thursday night, but apparently we didn't need one. The place was fairly empty, which is surprising given how highly touted this place is on Yelp and how awesome the food really is (which we learned after the meal). The interior is cozy without many frills. A large wood-topped bar takes up the majority of the space, but there are a couple of stand-alone tables in the back. Chill hipster jams playing in the background (It's Williamsburg. Duh) also worked in setting the atmosphere. All together, I really dug the vibe. Before the food, we each ordered a cocktail. I went with a sazerac. No complaints. Well made, gave me that boozy-kick I was looking for. While they do offer larger plates here, both of us tend to gravitate to tapas-style dining, so we ended up ordering three other items, along with the Creamy Polenta,  from the ""Small Things"" section of the menu: Broccoli Rabe, Wagyu Steak Tartare, Fritto Misto, and Creamy Polenta.Broccoli Rabe - Very solid. The saltiness of the anchovy really worked to cut through the bitterness of the veg. And the sliced egg was a nice accompaniment that added both creaminess and a contrast in texture to the dish. Wagyu Steak Tartare - Fairly run of the mill. The dish looked beautiful and tasted fine, but I wouldn't order again. The flavors were just a bit muted to me. Good, just not great.Fritto MIsto - Bonkers good. In my opinion, almost as memorable as the polenta. The seafood was fresh and tasty, and the crust was perfectly light and very crispy. The accompanying flavors of the lemon and fried thai basil leaves (I think?), put the dish over the top. The service was more than on point. The servers were really patient as it probably took us around 30 minutes to figure out what we wanted to order. On top of that, they are ninjas at topping off water. Everyone was friendly the whole night and checked on us frequently. After tax and tip the final bill came out to $85. I consider this such steal given the booze and all the food we ordered. The price point to food quality ratio is the reason why The Saint Austere is no-brainer 5-stars for me. Yes, the polenta is amazing, but so is almost everything else about this place. Will be back again. AND SOON.",5.0
"I would like to start this review by saying my boyfriend and I really wanted to like the Saint Austere. It had stellar Yelp reviews and we loved the décor when we first walked in. Unfortunately, everything was downhill from there.Upon walking in, we told a waitress we wanted a table for two. She kindly told us that the matre d' would be right with us. Unfortunately ""right with us"" dragged on for 10 minutes as we awkwardly stood in the middle of the restaurant unsure of where to stand. We were then told it would be a 15 minute wait, which was fine with us and we were seated quickly after. We were both hungry, so we decided to do the tasting menu with wine pairings. ________First Course Broccoli Rabe with anchovies, parmigiano, boiled eggs: The broccoli rabe was slightly undercooked which gave it a tough bitterness. The stalks were fibrous and cooked unevenly. The eggs were well cooked but unseasoned and boring. As a combination, the dish had an unappetizing aroma and messy presentation.Cauliflower with confit tuna, bagna cauda: I don't know how this dish ever made it on a restaurant menu. It was essentially cooked cauliflower with a can of tuna-in-oil opened and dumped on top. The aroma was awful and the flavor combination was disgusting. We each ate one bite. I'm confused as to who thought this was a good idea.1st Wine pairing: A very slightly sparkling white with a crisp finish. A decent, interesting wine that worked well to wash away the taste of the first dishes.________Second CourseCreamy Polenta with sausage, cipollini: The polenta was very fine and creamy, which gave it an unsettling gooeyness. The sausage was plain and not married to the polenta flavors, i.e. two ingredients thrown into the same bowl without any real connection. The sausage oil was also drizzled on top of the polenta along with the sausage, so the entire dish was disjointed and greasy.Housemade tagliolini with chanterelle and royal trumpet mushrooms: An entirely innocuous dish, but the pasta was unevenly cooked. Frankly, this dish was only inoffensive inasmuch as it was uninventive. With $10 worth of ingredients and 30 minutes, anyone could make this dish at home. I liked it more than my boyfriend, but only because I really love mushrooms. 2nd Wine pairing: A passable Iberian red.________Third course Pork loin with cannellini beans, mustard sauce, and brussel sprout: The pork loin was served sliced over the beans and mustard sauce on a piece of bread. The brussel sprout was added on top like a garnish, but seemed to have no real place in the dish other than adding color. The pork was dry and the bean-mustard combination had a mealy texture and earthy flavor.  The dish would be improved by an acidic or tart element. The biggest disappointment was that the pork was improperly trimmed, so some slices had a slimy slab of soft fat over gristle instead of a delicious, crisped fat.3rd Wine pairing: A light, semi-dry red that paired poorly with the fatty, dry pork.________Fourth courseTiramisu with dulce de leche and espresso granita: This dessert was the only item on the tasting menu that tasted like it ""met par."" The mousse was delicious and the granita was well-crafted. However...4th Wine Pairing: A chardonnay-based champagne that was very bubbly. A disastrous pairing with this dish, as the acid and alcohol instantly curdled the mousse. Taking a sip after a bite of the tiramisu filled our mouths with a persistent spoiled taste. Texturally, the aggressive carbonation was also a mismatch.________Food overall: 2/5Wine pairings overall: 2/5Service: 3/5Décor: 4/5Our waitress was very kind.",2.0
"Like many reviewers before, I will sing the praises of The Saint Austere. The tasting menu for two (listed below) was one of the more perfect complete meals I've had in a long time. Filling, flavorful and at a good value ($60/pp with wine pairing). Service was great and big ups to our waitress for not being annoyed with our wine substitutions as we were fairly picky that night. She was knowledgeable not only with the product being served, but also on the alternatives being offered. You know about most of the menu items below, so I will only add that the chicken is actually really, really good (juicy and crispy) and the top of the homemade tiramisu could be scraped off and sold in small baggies on the street, bc it's incredibly addicting. Do it!First Course:Grilled Octopus (w/ pee-wee potato.pimenton.roasted lemon) &Broccoli Rabe (w/ anchovy.parmigiano.boiled egg)Second Course: Creamy Polenta (w/ sausage.cipollini) &Cavatelli (w/ baby meatballs.pork sugo.pecorino)Entree:Roasted Organic Half Chicken (w/farro risotto.grilled maitake.salsify.porcini jus)Dessert:Housemade Tiramisu(w/ dulce de leche mousse.espresso granita)Bonus: I got to make multiple Wu Tang references during dinner bc of the 90's hip-hop soundtrack. Smiles all around.",5.0
"Very nice down to Earth place serving great Italian fare. This is the kind of place if Hipsters invaded Italy. The salami platter was very good and for $18, it had a generous serving of meats. For $8, you can select up to two cheeses. The spicy sausage creamy polenta was very good. Not too spicy and had a lot of great flavor. The spicy clam and shrimp spaghetti is very good but it's on the spicy side. The kind of spicy that produces a slow burn that doesn't go away fast. The Nutella zeppole looked good although I didn't eat it. The orange dipping sauce was tasty though.",4.0
"I made reservations for Rus' birthday dinner at The Saint Austere and left feeling really proud of myself for finding this romantic, yet affordable restaurant. And Rus was impressed too!I made reservations for 9:30p (the first time slot available on OpenTable) but when we arrived, it was actually only half full, so we were seated right away! Maybe just call ahead instead of making a reservation.The servers were extremely attentive throughout our entire meal, offering explanations of menu items and recommendations. We shared the creamy polenta, the crispy farm egg, grilled octopus, steak tartare, the mushroom tagliolini, and the tiramisu. To drink, Rus got the sour beer and I got the mezcal cocktail. The mezcal cocktail is so good! Not too overpowering, went perfectly with the meal.Don't pass on the creamy polenta or the tartare. They were both delicious and very generous portions. The crispy farm egg was also tasty, nicely fried on the outside with a runny yolk. The best part of Saint Austere is definitely the ambiance. It's not too dark, but lit by candles. Perfect backdrop for a date and not too heavy on your wallet. I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"New favorite Williamsburg dinner spot! We came here on a blustery winter night in the middle of the work week and were greeted by some of the most friendly wait staff I've had in New York. The bartender was courteous, our waitress explained everything on the menu and had great conversation skills, which I always appreciate.But regardless of the wait staff, come here for the tapas! Glorious, glorious tapas. A really solid variety. As I'm sure everyone else recommends, get the polenta board! I'm pretty sure it rotates, but when we had it, it came with a pork ragu, trumpet mushrooms, sausages, balsamic braised cipollini, and meatballs. To DIE for, I can't express that enough. The patatas bravas, a tapas classic, were also delicious because SRIRACHA MAYO, what else?Cool, chic and sophisticated atmosphere. Simultaneously casual, with a classy dining twist.",5.0
"Good wine selection. Amaaaazing prosciutto. Like the best prosciutto I've ever had in my life, including time spent in Spain! I love the vibe in there, the decor was so nice. Love that chandelier! It's an awesome date spot. The butternut squash dish was amazing. I wasn't a big fan of the cheese we ordered but I'll be back for more prosciutto for sure!",4.0
"I don't know if this place is packed every night but it should be. Luckily, I went here on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving so there was plenty of space for my party to walk in and get seated immediately. The ambiance is really intimate, dark, and romantic. The art along the wall is amazing and great conversation starters - I would imagine this is a perfect first date destination! Now onto the good stuff...FOOD:Cheese Board: It will come as a surprise that I'm giving this place 5 stars even when I wasn't too impressed with the cheese board. The cheese we chose were relatively mild and I was hoping for something more unique. We chose 2 out of the 4 options so perhaps we just got unlucky. There wasn't anything bad about the cheese, but nothing too special either. The accompaniments on the board were lovely - jams, spreads, and breads, all goodies. ((Their menu changes frequently so I kept all my descriptions general))Creamy Polenta with Sausage: AHHHHHHH it's so good I just want to shout it from the rooftops! Literally that's all you need to know - just go get this and be happy about it! Homemade Pastas: We tried one of their pastas that was stuffed with beautiful mushrooms (chanterelle, truffles, etc.) and a cream based sauce and it was amazing! As I'm writing this out, I don't see it on their menu online so I'm guessing it's gone. However, this dish was so good, I would venture to say that all their homemade pastas are on point. Mixed Bag menu items: We ordered a very fall festive vegetable dish that had squash and sweet potatoes and other goodies that also seems to have fallen off the menu. It was well prepared, a good portion, and felt very healthy and organic. I'm guessing their menu is dependent on seasonal dishe so keep that in mind when ordering veggies!CONCLUSION: I will be coming back here frequently and recommending it to everyone!!",5.0
"I have a lot to say about The Saint Austere, but I must lead with this: I have always been very open about my dislike of polenta. It's not that I don't like the taste, I've just always considered it a complete joke of a food. It's this weird slop of cornmeal mash that's not grits and not oatmeal and not potatoes and not any kind of starch that seems at all appetizing to me. Who knows when/where/why this aversion developed, but I clearly have a lot of feelings on the matter. Above all else, The Saint Austere receives the rare five star review from me because it convinced me - and the convincing process was far from easy - that I can not only tolerate polenta, but I can really really like it if I allow myself to.I'll rewind a bit. I came here on a Thursday night for dinner around 7:30. We had a reservation, but we certainly didn't need one - the place was basically empty. Why, I have no idea. I'm not complaining. The space itself is pretty minimalist. There's a large bar and several communal tables in back. Very conducive to the shared plates experience. The warm lighting with candles aplenty makes for a slightly intimate vibe. We were told immediately upon sitting down that all of the food here is meant to be shared. Hallelujah!! While some people get weird about sharing food, I get weird if people *won't* share their food with me. Moocher extraordinaire in grade school. I own it. So my tip here is: if you/your friends are not into this style of dining, probably not the best place to come. But you'd be really missing out and that would be very disappointing. Anyway, the two of us were on board, so we were in the right place.On the drink front, they've got a good list of the classics here - and well done classics they are. I went with The Last Word, which is one of my go-to gin drinks. Perfectly executed - zero complains. Now onto the main event...We ordered:-Fritto Misto: shrimp, squid, whitting, lemon (A)-Broccoli Rabe: anchovies, parmigiano, boiled eggs (A/A-)-THE Polenta: sausage and cipollini (A+)-Wagyu Steak Tartare: shallots, capers, dijon vinaigrette (B+/A-). -Fritto Misto was fantastic, especially with the extra bit of lemon. The seafood was just lightly fried and it came with what appeared to be crispy basil - I honestly don't know. Whatever it was, the herb was quite spicy (in a good way) and was a fantastic compliment to the more mild flavors of the seafood.-I was quite impressed with the broccoli rabe, actually. I've never had it prepared in this way, and it was incredibly yummy. I'm not sure if pairing hard boiled eggs w/ broccoli rabe is typical, but I found the combination very nice. The creaminess of the eggs paired with the juicy, bitter and slightly salty broccoli just worked. -THE POLENTA: I wish I could remember the spiel they gave us about how they cooked it word for word. The explanation alone was pretty remarkable. Something like...it cooks over night, it's re-whipped everything three hours with butter and heavy cream....I don't know. The point is, their polenta is their signature dish, and they're clearly incredibly proud of it - for good reason! We both remarked that it was somehow light and heavy at the same time, which must have to do with TSA's technique. The polenta I've had in the past is super grainy - like cream of wheat-esque. NOT the case here. This polenta is creamy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth blissful. I'm a health nut, so it honestly took me a few bites to feel fully comfortable indulging, but man, am I glad I did. By the end of the meal I was freely dipping bread in this bowl of goodness. The sausage on top made the dish as a whole pretty salty, but I still enjoyed it immensely (if you couldn't tell). This whole dish was one big innuendo, in the very best way. -Wagyu steak tartare was good, but nothing special. I appreciated it, though, because it made our meal quite balanced. The flavors (coming from the capers in particular) were unlike those in our three other dishes - that as long as it being a cold preparation made for a nice fourth plate. Service: A++. Not much to say here, but we were checked on frequently for food and drink orders, our food came out quickly and water glasses were refilled with supreme efficiency. They nearly broke both of our bladders. To close this odyssey of a review, I just want to highlight two things:1. The the flavor and texture profiles of the dishes here are top notch. The presentation alone is beautiful, but overall I just really appreciate how well the ingredients in each dish complemented each other. They all had a purpose - and a great one at that. 2. I rate a lot of bars/restaurants based on a ""bang for your buck"" scale. We paid $70 for two cocktails and four plates. The food was scrumptious and the portions were generous - for a tapas/shared plates joint, this bill really ain't bad.",5.0
"Perfect date night spot.Staff is wonderful, helpful, funny & there really care about what you want to eat or drink and make sure you glass is always full, what to pair together and how much you enjoyed it. Great people!Try all the cheeses you won't go wrong, small palmful portions & the meats are great too. Come with sugar walnuts, dates, pickled relish & grapes. Can't beat it ! Polenta is def.the MUST try like every other reviewer requested. You won't go wrong and you lick up that bowl after. Even dip the delish over toasted sliced bread and they give you as much as you like. I don't know how anyone can just not eat bread it's everything! Stack bar. Lots of wine choices. Oysters.Pastas are very good too.Perfect tapas style place with sweet staff & lots of booze to go with it.Great dessert choices. The Check wasn't even bad at all neither! Go for it!",5.0
"Fabrizio is a wonderful host. He introduced us to the menu and style of serving. The staff is helpful, courteous and friendly. We had the polenta board with varied toppings that we could have eaten all night long!  Creamy, sweet and flavorful. Frito misto was good but salty. Grilled octopus was disappointing. Usually love it but this was cold and slightly tough but chick peas and tomatoes were delicious. Broccoli rabe with eggs was very yummy. 1/2 roasted chix was moist and flavorful. They made the spinach cavatelli with tomato sauce for us and it was al dente and good.Both the Nutella Zeppoles and the tiramisu were worth the calories. Wine prices were pricey. All in all would definitely recommend and return.",4.0
"You can't go wrong with anything here at this local tapas spot.We were lured by the $1 happy hour oysters. But the creamy polenta platter, broccoli rabe with anchovies, and green pasta really were amazing. I could have eaten a pot of the polenta itself. Portions are small, so order a couple to share. I'd definitely recommend The Saint Austere for good food and drinks to share tapas style",4.0
"It was alright; generally enjoyable but some hiccups. My boyfriend and I came last night at around 8pm and they told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait and they'd call us. They didn't call us so after about 50 minutes we came back and she explained she had given our table away because we didn't answer. We didn't have a missed call and they did have the correct number, so we were a little unsure of what happened. They said it would be another 20 minutes but were very apologetic about the mix-up so gave us some sparkling white wine on the house and kept giving us updates about the table, which was nice. The other thing was before 8 there is an oyster happy hour and we just missed it. They were going to save us some oysters (which was so nice) but they ran out when we came back. Sad.We sat at the bar (most of the restaurant is actually the bar area) and we had the asparagus with prosciutto, the spinach garganelli and the half chicken. They also gave us a complimentary order of polenta with sausage. The sausage on the polenta was great, the rest pretty fatty (I let my boyfriend eat that). The asparagus with prosciutto tasted OK but wasn't the best quality, and the prosciutto was cotto instead of crudo which was weird. The spinach garganelli my boyfriend deemed acceptable and ate but I didn't think was very good-- it was kind of puny and unappetizing to look at and the sausage or whatever was in it had no flavor. As for the chicken-- it was probably the best thing but it wasn't great because of the sauce they covered it with. It was cooked well and I ate it happily but every bite was really sweet because of this sauce-- almost like a polynesian sauce. They were generally pretty friendly and the whole staff was working really hard, so I would give it another chance if I were in the hood, there wasn't a wait, and it was oyster happy hour.",3.0

I've never had it prepared in this way, and it was incredibly yummy. I'm not sure if pairing hard boiled eggs w/ broccoli rabe is typical, but I found the combination very nice. The creaminess of the eggs paired with the juicy, bitter and slightly salty broccoli just worked. -THE POLENTA: I wish I could remember the spiel they gave us about how they cooked it word for word. The explanation alone was pretty remarkable. Something like...it cooks over night, it's re-whipped everything three hours with butter and heavy cream....I don't know. The point is, their polenta is their signature dish, and they're clearly incredibly proud of it - for good reason! We both remarked that it was somehow light and heavy at the same time, which must have to do with TSA's technique. The polenta I've had in the past is super grainy - like cream of wheat-esque. NOT the case here. This polenta is creamy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth blissful. I'm a health nut, so it honestly took me a few bites to feel fully comfortable indulging, but man, am I glad I did. By the end of the meal I was freely dipping bread in this bowl of goodness. The sausage on top made the dish as a whole pretty salty, but I still enjoyed it immensely (if you couldn't tell). This whole dish was one big innuendo, in the very best way. -Wagyu steak tartare was good, but nothing special. I appreciated it, though, because it made our meal quite balanced. The flavors (coming from the capers in particular) were unlike those in our three other dishes - that as long as it being a cold preparation made for a nice fourth plate. Service: A++. Not much to say here, but we were checked on frequently for food and drink orders, our food came out quickly and water glasses were refilled with supreme efficiency. They nearly broke both of our bladders. To close this odyssey of a review, I just want to highlight two things:1. The the flavor and texture profiles of the dishes here are top notch. The presentation alone is beautiful, but overall I just really appreciate how well the ingredients in each dish complemented each other. They all had a purpose - and a great one at that. 2. I rate a lot of bars/restaurants based on a ""bang for your buck"" scale. We paid $70 for two cocktails and four plates. The food was scrumptious and the portions were generous - for a tapas/shared plates joint, this bill really ain't bad.",5.0
"Perfect date night spot.Staff is wonderful, helpful, funny & there really care about what you want to eat or drink and make sure you glass is always full, what to pair together and how much you enjoyed it. Great people!Try all the cheeses you won't go wrong, small palmful portions & the meats are great too. Come with sugar walnuts, dates, pickled relish & grapes. Can't beat it ! Polenta is def.the MUST try like every other reviewer requested. You won't go wrong and you lick up that bowl after. Even dip the delish over toasted sliced bread and they give you as much as you like. I don't know how anyone can just not eat bread it's everything! Stack bar. Lots of wine choices. Oysters.Pastas are very good too.Perfect tapas style place with sweet staff & lots of booze to go with it.Great dessert choices. The Check wasn't even bad at all neither! Go for it!",5.0
"Fabrizio is a wonderful host. He introduced us to the menu and style of serving. The staff is helpful, courteous and friendly. We had the polenta board with varied toppings that we could have eaten all night long!  Creamy, sweet and flavorful. Frito misto was good but salty. Grilled octopus was disappointing. Usually love it but this was cold and slightly tough but chick peas and tomatoes were delicious. Broccoli rabe with eggs was very yummy. 1/2 roasted chix was moist and flavorful. They made the spinach cavatelli with tomato sauce for us and it was al dente and good.Both the Nutella Zeppoles and the tiramisu were worth the calories. Wine prices were pricey. All in all would definitely recommend and return.",4.0
"You can't go wrong with anything here at this local tapas spot.We were lured by the $1 happy hour oysters. But the creamy polenta platter, broccoli rabe with anchovies, and green pasta really were amazing. I could have eaten a pot of the polenta itself. Portions are small, so order a couple to share. I'd definitely recommend The Saint Austere for good food and drinks to share tapas style",4.0
"It was alright; generally enjoyable but some hiccups. My boyfriend and I came last night at around 8pm and they told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait and they'd call us. They didn't call us so after about 50 minutes we came back and she explained she had given our table away because we didn't answer. We didn't have a missed call and they did have the correct number, so we were a little unsure of what happened. They said it would be another 20 minutes but were very apologetic about the mix-up so gave us some sparkling white wine on the house and kept giving us updates about the table, which was nice. The other thing was before 8 there is an oyster happy hour and we just missed it. They were going to save us some oysters (which was so nice) but they ran out when we came back. Sad.We sat at the bar (most of the restaurant is actually the bar area) and we had the asparagus with prosciutto, the spinach garganelli and the half chicken. They also gave us a complimentary order of polenta with sausage. The sausage on the polenta was great, the rest pretty fatty (I let my boyfriend eat that). The asparagus with prosciutto tasted OK but wasn't the best quality, and the prosciutto was cotto instead of crudo which was weird. The spinach garganelli my boyfriend deemed acceptable and ate but I didn't think was very good-- it was kind of puny and unappetizing to look at and the sausage or whatever was in it had no flavor. As for the chicken-- it was probably the best thing but it wasn't great because of the sauce they covered it with. It was cooked well and I ate it happily but every bite was really sweet because of this sauce-- almost like a polynesian sauce. They were generally pretty friendly and the whole staff was working really hard, so I would give it another chance if I were in the hood, there wasn't a wait, and it was oyster happy hour.",3.0
"This place was amazing.  My friend and I went and did the 4 course chef's choice with wine pairings.  Didn't love all the wines but all the food was so delicious.  Waitress was very helpful describing the food and the wine.  Vibe was super relaxed and not gonna lie, loved all the hip hop playing in the background.  Sometimes I need a little hipster vibe in my life and this satisfied that!  Go here!!",5.0
"This is one of my favorite places anywhere. There is absolutely nothing not to like about The Saint Austere, and so many things to love. An abbreviated list:1. They make a perfect old fashioned. They even char the orange peel.2. Right when you grab a seat at the bar, they'll give you the best olives ever.*3. The creamy polenta with that sausage and cipollini onions. Yes.4. Everything else on the menu (wagyu tartare!).5. They do dollar oysters for happy hour. 6. A great wine list, and knowledgable recommendations.7. The service is so on point. Friendly, considerate, genuinely hospitable.8. Last time I was in, they were playing exclusively hip-hop (because there ain't no half-steppin'. The good hip-hop,** though._____________*I love them so much, secrets were divulged. Apparently they are actually sautéed with garlic, rosemary and chili. **Wu-Tang. Nasty Nas. Tribe. The Mighty Mos. Big Pun. They even have a stack of cassettes behind the bar (MC Serch, Run DMC, and others I couldn't see because I'm old and blind) just for the street cred.",5.0
"Everything was good. Don't get the cheese plate, the portions are tiny. The waiting staff was vey attentive. A bit to attentive at points.

The food wasn't everything I was anticipating it would be and having been the one to recommend the restaurant of choice this time, my foodie status is now somewhat compromised. Thanks. To give it a fair shot, we ordered just about everything. The stand outs- the bone marrow (as long as you dressed it with all of the fixin's provided), polenta board and the cavatelli pasta (although the meatballs on the latter two dishes were overcooked and puck-like including the rubber taste). The not so special- the grilled octopus. Though the meat had a nice char and was tender, I wasn't diving in for seconds nor was anyone else. For such a small piece, you would think it would have been devoured. The bad and ugly- the pork chop. I have no idea what they were thinking with the beans and blue cheese combination and the brussel sprouts were boiled to the point where the dish looked putrid.  Additionally, I was unimpressed with the broccoli rabe as well. The breadcrumbs were a nice touch, but I may have over appreciated them because they sopped up some of the goop from the abundance of dressing. The ambiance was quaint and warm, not overcrowded or loud. I would come back for a cocktail and some bone marrow at the bar.",4.0

"Met up with my friends for dinner here. Didn't help that traffic to get to Brooklyn was pretty ridiculous and we were all pretty hungry.

It felt like the only seasoning the chef love to add is salt. From the salad to the pork, everything was overly salty. I didn't really enjoy my meal for the most part. The spaghetti was fine but nothing spectacular (You want good spaghetti or Italian food, I highly recommend Luigi's in Floral Park going towards the Long Island). I honestly thought this was going to be a great place considering so many high review marks but the food really left me underwhelmed and craving to gargle my mouth to rid of the salt. I'm not sure whether that was just bad timing on our part or not. Most people find food really delicious when they're hungry, but two out of the three of us thought it was overly salty. My other friend was fine cause she loves salt but admits that she had better food. We also had the Tiramisu which was alright. That was probably the only dish that wasn't salty.Decor: It's a very small but long place. We sat all the way in the back near the kitchen. It has a nice bar/intimate atmosphere. It has a classic brick Brooklyn feel and kept decoration very simple and doesn't stand out too much.Overall, I might be willing to give it another shot if someone who actually been there convince me to go back.

It has a classic brick Brooklyn feel and kept decoration very simple and doesn't stand out too much.Overall, I might be willing to give it another shot if someone who actually been there convince me to go back. That evening left me very unsatisfied with my meal. The service was great and there was a good selection when it came to alcoholic beverages (Beer, Wine, Spirits).",2.0
"Ate here for dinner recently. The food was very good but I was really disappointed with the portion sizes. I understand it is a tapas bar but I ordered a larger portion plate and it was still basically a small appetizer. I ordered another item and my total was near $50 and I wasn't even close to being full. Prices are way too high. Other than that the atmosphere is very nice, the service was good, and the place is in a good location. Worth checking out if you are splitting with multiple people.",3.0
"Fact #11: What do you mean? You really wanted to like this place, you woke and thought, I really want to like this place.

"This place has all the makings of a restaurant I normally wouldn't like. Pretty expensive? Check. Small plates format? Check. A really popular spot that doesn't have much space? Yep! That would normally be three irredeemable strikes but this place overcame my prejudices and then some!First of all, the service is top-notch. Right before we were about to be seated, the Health Department barged in for a routine, unannounced inspection, which shut down the kitchen indefinitely. The staff couldn't have been nicer about the situation. Even as they prepared to lose a ridiculous amount of Friday night business, they graciously suggested some other great restaurants in the area. We felt so bad for them, though, and decided to stick it out.Lots of people filed out after the inspection began, which created some space at the bar. At that point, I'd say the kitchen stayed closed for only another 30-45 minutes or so. In the meantime, we chatted with friendly bartenders and a couple of pretty cool people at the bar. The wait was definitely worth it. We started out with an order of Brussels sprouts and creamy polenta, both of which were out of this world. We also got the Octopus, which was just as good and easily shareable between two people. These were traditional small plates portions, with the octopus being a little bit bigger than the first two.We loved all of the above but the real star of the show was the oxtail cavatelli off of the ""big things"" menu. This is a much smaller selection of dishes on the menu that are pretty close to standard entree portions. It was simply the best pasta dish I've ever had in my life. My boyfriend agreed after just a small taste and I ended up sharing a little more than I would have liked :/His dish off of the ""Big Things"" menu was the only thing we tasted that I wasn't crazy about -- their ""beef cheeks"" special. It was cooked perfectly but it came with an orange-y sauce that I wasn't crazy about. Also, it was about twice as much as my pasta ($40 vs. $22) and we both agreed that the pasta was way better.

The vegetables and mushroom were perfect additions.What we ordered but could have done without:The Cauliflower: not well seared, so it came off a bit soggy.Meatballs: a bit dry and not very flavorful.

"11:45pm, newly arrived in New York and lost in Brooklyn trying to find dinner. After the hotel concierge sent us to a recommended Thai restaurant that turned out to be more of a club than a restaurant, I found The Saint Austere in Yelp, one of the few restaurants within walking distance that would be open past midnight. I called to confirm a reservation was not needed. The guy (unfortunately, don't know his name) who answered was friendly and said that they could accommodate us with no problems. 25 minutes and 1.5 miles later, we made it to SA, and was greeted by the same gentleman who I spoke to on the phone. Again, he was very friendly and accommodating regarding seating, having us choose wherever suited us best. The two servers who tended to us were equally friendly and helpful.We ordered the Polenta Board ($20), Grilled Asparagus ($12?), Half Grilled Striped Bass ($22), Homemade Cavatelli with Veal Ragu and Leeks ($22), Tiramisu ($8), and the Nutella Zeppoles ($8). The flavors on the Polenta Board were fantastic. The bass was also good but extremely salty as I don't believe it came with anything to offset the saltiness. I was informed they only had half an order of the Cavatelli left and if I would like to substitute another half order of a different pasta, that would be fine. I chose the Bucatini Cacio e Pepe (parm, black pepper, pecorino). While the Cavatelli was good, the Bucatini was not. It came out looking like a plate of plain pasta, no visible black pepper or cheese, with a barely noticeably sauce. What it lacked visually it also lacked in the flavor department. It was palatable when paired with the bass. Both the tiramisu and zeppoles were also good although the orange creme for the zeppoles had no orange flavor.Ambience is great, staff even better, food seems to be hit and miss, and portion size pretty small for certain dishes (zeppoles 3 count, bass). Good for an intimate dinner paired with wine, not so great for hungry travelers.",4.0

"HM.  This was one of those reviews that I wanted to process thoroughly before writing.I had decided on The Saint Austere for my birthday dinner way in advance, just a nice and small gathering of good friends.  I contacted the business via Yelp, and immediately got a response from Jacqueline.  She was very accommodating with my party size and dietary restrictions, 3 in my party are lactose intolerant.  We worked on a menu; I chose what fellow Yelpers had tried and recommended in their reviews.  I had been abroad for close to a month, and when I returned, I also received a follow-up on my reservation.  I was pleased with the attention paid to my reservation.The night I arrived at the restaurant, I was a bit shocked to discover that 9 of us would end up on one table with 4 on the other, whilst sharing a table with another party.  This was a major miscommunication error.  When I was informed that there would be tables next to each other via email, I was not aware the tables would be parallel to each other, and not adjacent.  I have had other restaurants warn me of separate tables, but they would be in the same line of sight, just separated by a gap.  Because of this, a few of my guests were immediately put off and didn't feel like they were part of the celebration.  This made my night of hosting a little more difficult as I was constantly maneuvering between the tables to make sure my guests felt welcomed; it was a small restaurant, and at times, I got in the way of the serving staff.Moving on to the food, as I had mentioned, was an 'All-Stars' $40 prix fixe menu based on reviews:Broccoli RabeCreamy PolentaGrilled OctopusSteamed MusselsPappardelle with meat sauceRoasted Organic ChickenTiramisuI added the meat & cheese boards for an additional $9/person.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the various cuts of meat and pate.  I disliked almost all of the cheese selection, which I was very surprised by since I am an avid fan of cheese.  We also decided on 3 dozen oysters- I thought the oysters were small, but passable.Based on my own personal preferences and my guests', I found that the food was a mixed bag.  Some people liked items that I thought were poor executions, others disliked the dishes I preferred.  Only a few thought all the dishes were pretty decent.  The ones I liked included the polenta, broccoli rabe, and organic chicken.  The octopus was tender, but tiny- we had to split 2 tentacles between 4 people.  I did not like the fennel and onion sauce that accompanied the mussels, which were also small.  The pappardelle meat sauce was too subtle- I needed more of the veal & pork to come through.  The chicken was where we had issues.  The chicken I had was tender and juicy; I typically don't order chicken at restaurants because they err on the dry side.  I took a chance on it because of its rave reviews.  I was not disappointed in its texture.  I was then told by guests on the other end of my table that their chicken was still alive and ""bucking away.""  One of my guests was pretty disgusted by the fact that it was bleeding onto her plate.  Jacqueline took my friend's dish away.  Since I didn't see the chicken with my own eyes, I wasn't going to review it here.  However, because I don't waste food, I brought the leftover pasta and chicken home.  While I was reheating the chicken, the bones were revealed to be almost ENTIRELY red.This really got me annoyed.  I was annoyed that my guests were unable to eat it, and annoyed that the whole chicken was not removed and recooked to the proper temperature.  In this day and age of food-borne illnesses, I don't see how any restaurant can afford to serve under-cooked chicken.  Lastly was the dessert- I cannot even tell you how many tiramisus I've had in my life.  The tiramisu I had here ranked the lowest on my list.  And I will explain why.  It's made with a dulce de leche and fit into a mason jar with espresso granita sprinkled on top.  I didn't mind the mixture so much, but it did lack a balance between the cream and pastry.  The granita was poorly done; since the chef chose to make the granita more on the icy side, they really had to highlight a stronger espresso taste.  It didn't happen because it wasn't consistent; some icy bits had a slight espresso taste, while others were just comprised of plain water.  It was quite the disappointment.This was the most controversial dining experience of my life- I have never had so many people disagree on the quality of food here.  If I judged solely based on service, I would probably give it a 4.5 rating.  I never saw any of the waitstaff slacking; they worked extremely hard the whole night. And so these 3 stars are really for their effort to provide for our tables.  The rating really suffered in the food department; I can see the potential, but the food definitely needs more TLC.",3.0
"I was very surprised to have been disappointed. I recently had a meal at a French restaurant in East Village where I paid $15 for a huge appetizer of super fresh, super perfect grilled octopus. For the same $15, the grilled octopus here was a portion of 2 1/2 pieces. The ""dulce de leche mousse"" for the tiramisu had the texture of melting ice-cream, it was not the mousse texture that I know or like. The ""espresso granita"" on top tasted like a snow cone without any flavor added. The brussels sprouts were perfectly crisp and cooked to perfection. Maybe I was there on an off night, but I couldn't believe it was so....blah...compared to the other reviews.",3.0

"HM.  This was one of those reviews that I wanted to process thoroughly before writing.I had decided on The Saint Austere for my birthday dinner way in advance, just a nice and small gathering of good friends.  I contacted the business via Yelp, and immediately got a response from Jacqueline.  She was very accommodating with my party size and dietary restrictions, 3 in my party are lactose intolerant.  We worked on a menu; I chose what fellow Yelpers had tried and recommended in their reviews.  I had been abroad for close to a month, and when I returned, I also received a follow-up on my reservation.  I was pleased with the attention paid to my reservation.The night I arrived at the restaurant, I was a bit shocked to discover that 9 of us would end up on one table with 4 on the other, whilst sharing a table with another party.  This was a major miscommunication error.  When I was informed that there would be tables next to each other via email, I was not aware the tables would be parallel to each other, and not adjacent.  I have had other restaurants warn me of separate tables, but they would be in the same line of sight, just separated by a gap.  Because of this, a few of my guests were immediately put off and didn't feel like they were part of the celebration.  This made my night of hosting a little more difficult as I was constantly maneuvering between the tables to make sure my guests felt welcomed; it was a small restaurant, and at times, I got in the way of the serving staff.Moving on to the food, as I had mentioned, was an 'All-Stars' $40 prix fixe menu based on reviews:Broccoli RabeCreamy PolentaGrilled OctopusSteamed MusselsPappardelle with meat sauceRoasted Organic ChickenTiramisuI added the meat & cheese boards for an additional $9/person.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the various cuts of meat and pate.  I disliked almost all of the cheese selection, which I was very surprised by since I am an avid fan of cheese.  We also decided on 3 dozen oysters- I thought the oysters were small, but passable.Based on my own personal preferences and my guests', I found that the food was a mixed bag.  Some people liked items that I thought were poor executions, others disliked the dishes I preferred.  Only a few thought all the dishes were pretty decent.  The ones I liked included the polenta, broccoli rabe, and organic chicken.  The octopus was tender, but tiny- we had to split 2 tentacles between 4 people.  I did not like the fennel and onion sauce that accompanied the mussels, which were also small.  The pappardelle meat sauce was too subtle- I needed more of the veal & pork to come through.  The chicken was where we had issues.  The chicken I had was tender and juicy; I typically don't order chicken at restaurants because they err on the dry side.  I took a chance on it because of its rave reviews.  I was not disappointed in its texture.  I was then told by guests on the other end of my table that their chicken was still alive and ""bucking away.""  One of my guests was pretty disgusted by the fact that it was bleeding onto her plate.  Jacqueline took my friend's dish away.  Since I didn't see the chicken with my own eyes, I wasn't going to review it here.  However, because I don't waste food, I brought the leftover pasta and chicken home.  While I was reheating the chicken, the bones were revealed to be almost ENTIRELY red.This really got me annoyed.  I was annoyed that my guests were unable to eat it, and annoyed that the whole chicken was not removed and recooked to the proper temperature.  In this day and age of food-borne illnesses, I don't see how any restaurant can afford to serve under-cooked chicken.  Lastly was the dessert- I cannot even tell you how many tiramisus I've had in my life.  The tiramisu I had here ranked the lowest on my list.  And I will explain why.  It's made with a dulce de leche and fit into a mason jar with espresso granita sprinkled on top.  I didn't mind the mixture so much, but it did lack a balance between the cream and pastry.  The granita was poorly done; since the chef chose to make the granita more on the icy side, they really had to highlight a stronger espresso taste.  It didn't happen because it wasn't consistent; some icy bits had a slight espresso taste, while others were just comprised of plain water.  It was quite the disappointment.This was the most controversial dining experience of my life- I have never had so many people disagree on the quality of food here.  If I judged solely based on service, I would probably give it a 4.5 rating.  I never saw any of the waitstaff slacking; they worked extremely hard the whole night. And so these 3 stars are really for their effort to provide for our tables.  The rating really suffered in the food department; I can see the potential, but the food definitely needs more TLC.",3.0
"I was very surprised to have been disappointed. I recently had a meal at a French restaurant in East Village where I paid $15 for a huge appetizer of super fresh, super perfect grilled octopus. For the same $15, the grilled octopus here was a portion of 2 1/2 pieces. The ""dulce de leche mousse"" for the tiramisu had the texture of melting ice-cream, it was not the mousse texture that I know or like. The ""espresso granita"" on top tasted like a snow cone without any flavor added. The brussels sprouts were perfectly crisp and cooked to perfection. Maybe I was there on an off night, but I couldn't believe it was so....blah...compared to the other reviews.",3.0

"Mmmm-mmmm! Pretty much agree with everyone. Polenta and broccoli rabe were amazing in terms of flavor and texture. I kind want to ding them for half a star, though, because they felt a bit too greasy/rich, especially as they started to cool.  We also had the croquetas and meat sampler plate (both delicious but not super memorable) as well as the striped bass stracci, which was unique and yummy!

"This restaurant is as true to its austerity as it is to its divinity. The waitress, like the restaurant, hid something Italian in the back; later we would find she is such a fitting analogy for the cuisine: born in Italy and raised in New York. The Williamsburg locale is simple with a long bar that meets 3 or 4 long family style tables next to the kitchen that even at 11pm hums away quietly, churning out handmade spinach cavatelli with a veal ragu that makes you realize the austerity in the aesthetics is to deny you any pleasure before you ascend into heavenly swells of ecstasy. We yelled at each other, we laughed with the waitresses, and most of all we felt like family. Thank you for a perfect Father's Day outing.",5.0
"We came here by chance as the bar down the street was crowded. I'm glad we did. We are started with their special orange gin cocktails which were refreshing and smooth.

"Was doing some errands in Williamsburg during the day so I figured to try a new restaurant in the area. Browsing through yelp and found the reviews of this place were more than decent, so decided to try it out. The restaurant weren't huge but it's roomy enough. The lighting was dim, heat was blasting and the liquor collection seems etiquette. For a Friday night, the place was pretty empty... only a group of 3 sitting at the bar and a couple in the back. Took a quick glimpse of the menu and noticed even though the selection weren't huge but there's definitely something for everyone.My wife and I were pretty hungry and were too lazy to pick each dish, so we decided to go w/ the ""Chef's Tasting Menu"" that's posted on the wall. The tasting menu is 40.00 per person and it consists of 4 courses (including Dessert).  They said although the tasting menu is fixed but if there is something in particular you would like to try, they are more than happy to accommodate.  For drinks, we took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the Bottled Sparkling Dark & Stormy and it was delicious. We ordered 2 other drinks but I can't recall the name of them but they were also good. For appetizers, they served Broccoli Rabe & Fritto Misto. The Broccoli Rabe was light and very tasty. The combination of the cheese, egg white and vegetables was just right. The Fritto Misto was pretty simple, deep fried calamari, but when you pair it with the Broccoli Rabe, it didn't feel too greasy. For entrée they served the Housemade Cavatelli and Creamy Polenta.  The cavatelli was quite good, very flavorful and cooked just right. The polenta, what can I say... it's creamy, it's tasty, it's something I would come back for. The final course was the Roasted Organic Chicken. The chicken was extremely tender, juicy and was cooked just right.  It was perfect. For dessert, they were going to serve the Tiramisu but we decided to try their Bread Pudding instead.  Surely, they didn't disappoint. It was very good. To sum it all, we enjoyed everything but we especially liked the Creamy Polenta & Roasted Organic Chicken. Will definitely come back for more.",4.0

The menu and wine list is perfectly designed for sharing. I love that they offer half-size wine bottles. I was told that the polenta is their speciality and the chef was very nice to present a sample plate for me to try. It was so creamy with great flavor. I recommend it.I also ordered the grilled octopus. The octopus was amazing but the lentils they are served with lacked flavor. Solution: carry a small bottle of Pink Himalayan salt in your purse ...

"I'll be frank, I'm not a ""small plates"" kinda guy. I do like the concept of sharing things family style, but it seems like in New York, ""small plates"" or ""tapas"" is another word for ""let's give the customer as little as possible and charge up the wazoo for it."" The Saint Austere is definitely guilty of that, but, since the food is just so darn good, I'm reluctantly okay with it. A couple of my Brooklyn friends swear by this place, and I was a bit skeptical at first, but I will say, it did live up to the hype. So to be clear, this is NOT the place to go if you're looking for a heavy meal. They definitely have hearty offerings, just not hearty portions.With all of that said, the best dish (and the only dish I would come back for) is the polenta. Oh man, that polenta. If you just gave me like 10 bowls of that, I would be good for awhile. It actually comes in a pretty small bowl, so 10 bowls actually seems like the right amount. The buttery polenta comes with a bit of sausage and herbs mixed in, for just a perfect texture balance. Seems like such a simple dish, but they execute it perfectly. Just wish there was a bit more of it. Okay, dead horse beaten. The patatas bravas are definitely worth a try as well. I like to mix the Sriracha and the mayo to get a spicy, creamy texture with the crispy potato. Service here is pretty attentive and friendly, and they definitely give good recommendations. The atmosphere is just comfortable, whether or not you have a small or large party. Beer and wine selection is pretty limited, but the ones they usually have available are pretty high quality and delicious. Come for a light meal with a small group of friends. And tell the owners that the polenta portion should be bigger. Hopefully they listen!",4.0
"Absolutely loved my experience here! I made a reservation for 4 on a Sunday evening at 715 PM. We got there around 6:50 and they sat us right away. The place was kind of empty but its small and filled up fast within 20 min of us sitting down so definitely make a reservation to be safe.The service was super friendly and attentive. I don't think any of our glasses were empty the whole time and when my bf went to the bathroom his napkin was refolded nicely.

It's simple, tasteful, and cozy. I loved the decor and it was very homey which is perfect for the type of food they serve.Now the FOOD. Phenomenal. Since it was a Sunday they have a ""Red Sauce Sundays"" which is $35 per order. We also wanted to try a couple of the small plates so we only ordered two orders of the red sauce sunday for the four of us. We also ordered the broccoli rabe, polenta, the meat plate, and a cheese plate with the Tetilla and Buche de Lucay. This was definitely enough food for all four of us without being too full at the end. I'm not much of a pasta person but i LOVED the Schiaffoni which was basically long rectangles of perfectly cooked pasta rolled up and covered in their homemade sauce. The meat and cheese plates are fantastic and their pairings are both creative and delicious! The surprising front-runner was also the broccoli rabe. This was unlike any other broccoli rabe I've ever tried. It was somewhat creamy with bread crumbs, boiled egg, and anchovies. The boiled egg had a pretty prominent flavor so if you're not into that then this dish may not be for you but I really enjoyed the creativity and thought this dish was fantastic. Last but not least, the tiramisu....by FAR the best tiramisu I've ever had. The espresso flavor is subtle (which i prefer) but the creme and granita (i guess this is like a salty ice shaving? idk but its the bomb) together was amazing. I could eat this dessert for days.

Since it was a Sunday they have a ""Red Sauce Sundays"" which is $35 per order. We also wanted to try a couple of the small plates so we only ordered two orders of the red sauce sunday for the four of us. We also ordered the broccoli rabe, polenta, the meat plate, and a cheese plate with the Tetilla and Buche de Lucay. This was definitely enough food for all four of us without being too full at the end. I'm not much of a pasta person but i LOVED the Schiaffoni which was basically long rectangles of perfectly cooked pasta rolled up and covered in their homemade sauce. The meat and cheese plates are fantastic and their pairings are both creative and delicious! The surprising front-runner was also the broccoli rabe. This was unlike any other broccoli rabe I've ever tried. It was somewhat creamy with bread crumbs, boiled egg, and anchovies. The boiled egg had a pretty prominent flavor so if you're not into that then this dish may not be for you but I really enjoyed the creativity and thought this dish was fantastic. Last but not least, the tiramisu....by FAR the best tiramisu I've ever had. The espresso flavor is subtle (which i prefer) but the creme and granita (i guess this is like a salty ice shaving? idk but its the bomb) together was amazing. I could eat this dessert for days. Also a plus - Parking was easy in the area for anyone that's thinking about driving!",5.0
"Going on Yelp when you're hungry is just a terrible idea. Unless you're already on ""restaurant row"" and surrounded by yummy options at every turn... reading reviews about decadent meals is just torture. The sad leftovers, and browning vegetables in your fridge will only look less appetizing and you'll quickly be on your way out to indulge in a five-star dinner. For me and my roommate, Saint Austere was that dinner last night.My roommate and I wandered off to find this place after we both spent a very long day working from home, looking to get some fresh air and indulge in a meal that didn't get delivered on a bicycle. This quaint little bar has long wooden tables, but was empty enough on a Monday night that we had a corner all to ourselves. I wanted wine, but my roomie wanted beer. This limited my options, since most of the wines that I wanted to try are only available in bottle. Bottle prices were $40-60, but I wasn't in the mood to down a whole bottle by myself. I settled on a German rose that was quite delicious and not too light to be paired well with the food we ordered.We started with a trio of cheeses: one Buche de Lucay (French Goat cheese); one Tomme de Savoye (another French variety, but from a cow); and the Pecorino Rossellino (an Italian cheese made from sheep's milk). All came on a wooden plank with appropriate garnish and adornments of grapes, candied walnuts, or a fruit spread, with toasted bread- which was a little burnt, but we will let that slide. Total cost: ($9)My roomie got the roasted bone marrow ($7) which was supposedly like a thick buttery-cheesy textured bread. Also, the grilled octopus ($13). Being that I'm a vegetarian, I didn't try either of these but I heard that both were delicious. It also gave us something to talk about, in that I could joke around that my dog loves bone marrow and perhaps the two of them could share an appetizer next time. :)I had the suppi al telephono ($9), which was like a tomato rice ball with 3 in an order. These were okay, but I'd probably skip that one next time. I also had the fried artichokes ($9) which were a delicious way to eat your vegetables! It came with a creamy dipping sauce that was kind of tart, and along with the onion straws and fried lemon zest (never thought of frying that!) it made for a rich, flavorful appetizer.We split the tiramisu at the suggestion of the server, who was attentive and knowledgeable. Our water glasses were never empty, and he brought fresh napkins and silverware between the courses. The dessert was very cold, almost like the base layer of rum had been sitting in the back of a cold refrigerator. We ended up letting it sit for a minute which solved the problem. The mousse and cake layers were heavenly. Despite the rich decadence of the prior courses, we cleaned the plate on that one. All in all, a very positive experience. Exactly what we needed after slaving away indoors on a beautiful day.",5.0

"The Filmmaker and I had a lovely dinner here. The service was excellent and the ambiance was cozy and intimate. The Filmmaker is vegetarian and the staff kindly and graciously accommodated us by tweaking recipes with non meat options, such as mushrooms.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese and another flat pasta dish with bits of fish and delicious roasted tomatoes (and meat for me).  The server recommended an excellent beer pairing with our meal.  The establishment gifted us with the house speciality -polenta- as a starter. EX-CEP-TION-AL. We ended the meal with what looked like doughnut holes stuffed with NUTELLA!  Sooooooo good. A delightful night with a beloved friend.",4.0

"YAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSS!!!! I took my boyfriend here because I read the reviews and I'm new to the Buswick/Williamsburg area. We went on a night that was pretty packed so waited for a couple minutes. NBD, they asked us if we wanted to put in a drink order so I ordered a Dark and Stormy while the boyfriend ordered the Old Fashioned... FIRST OF ALL- This place puts so much care into their drinks, you can imagine how much care they put into their food. Their D&S is bottled and carbonated on site, their Campari is aged in a french oak barrel. These things make such a difference in the taste and experience of drinks and I wish more people cared this much. Needless to say, we didn't order just one of these delicious drinks... we ordered... several. Everything here is made for sharing, which makes it an amazing date spot or a place for 3-5 friends to gather. Since it's a little more intimate, I think anymore than 5 is uncomfortable. Oh, I should also mention that we went back exactly a week after our date with some friends. I just HAD to. On to the meal(s)-Brocoli Rabe- This was something everyone told us we could not miss. The rabe was accompanied by anchovies, parmesean, and eggs. The combination sounds odd but the bitter rabe, with the salty anchovies and parmesean, was perfectly balanced with the creaminess of a medium boiled egg. This is the dish that has me coming back because I feel like I'm eating something relatively healthy but incredibly delicious at the same time. Patatas Bravas- We went to Barcelona and enjoyed several versions of this dish- It's basically fried potatoes with Mayo and Sriracha, although in Barcelona we wished it was this spicy. As delicious as it was, it was my least favorite because I kept accidentally eating the paper that was on the bottom...WHAT!? It looked like potato skin... -_- Creamy Polenta- And creamy indeed it is. I don't think it needed the pork ragu at all. Both were amazing together, but they would have definitely help up on their own. We licked the bowls clean and wished we had more. Grilled Octopus- The boyfriend and I had some delicious Octopus in Europe and we were taken back to those amazing moments once we tasted this one. Although it was a pretty small portion for the price, the meat was tender and there was a great char to it. Another dish I wish we had more of. Steamed Mussels- Spicy, tangy, garlicky, aMAHzingness- that's all I remember of that but it was yummy. Try it! Tagliatelle- My friends thought it was a bit salty but I love that so I didn't mind. For some of these items we got them from a tasting menu. I think I would have chosen to order it anyways. I wish that the noodles were handmade because I think that a fresh pasta would have held up better to the flavorful sauce. Roasted Organic Chicken- This was another thing off the tasting menu. I don't typically order Chicken because it's something I make a lot of at home. However, this chicken was such comfort food. The garlic jus it came with was a game changer. It was tender, moist, and well seasoned. Something I would easily order again. Tiramisu- Have you ever had a dessert that just blew your mind? (cue explosion sound effects). How can something be so decadent yet light, satisfying yet not heavy? Please meet TSA's Tiramisu. It has all the elements of boring tiramisu with a twist. I think the most important element of their tiramisu was the Espresso Granita. Instead of soaking the lady fingers in that, they top the dessert with this and it makes it cool, light, and refreshing. It's the perfect thing to end a meal with. I should know because I had it end my meals twice. Summary- Go there. You won't be disappointed. If you take a girl there, you will definitely score some points. Get the drinks, get the broccoli rabe, get the tiramisu. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"Was looking for a place in Williamsburg that was close to my friend's art gallery and was participating in Dine-in-Brooklyn week. Glad I found Saint Austere. The food was phenomenal. The Broccoli Rabe was done like a cesar salad, great twist. The Creamy Polenta was terrific. Lots of kick to it. The cavatelli was yummy. Shredded pork, mixed in well with sauce, pasta and a meatball. Not the biggest fan of Tiramisu because I don't like coffee but I enjoyed every bite. They serve oysters that looked real good. Next time I come back I'll be sure to get some.",5.0
"Yesterday my friend and I ate here. We went around 7pm on a gorgeous night in BK. They had a table reserved for a party at 830pm but said we could use it until then. The ambiance is fantastic, muted lighting, hanging small chandlers, and a large bar. We sat in the back and ordered some cocktails. We settled on a negroni and the watermelon gin drink. For food we ordered patatas bravas, cauliflower with tuna, pork ragu croquettes, and the roasted organic half chicken. The negroni was stronngggg but delicious. Our waitress even gave us a order of the polenta on the house. I was so happy she did because it was delicious. It was creamy and perfect, my great aunt from Italy would have approved. The croquettes with fat and served with ricotta. Crispy and delicious. The patatas bravas were actually sliced and a bit fried with shiracha on them. I had not had patatas bravas that way- it was a welcome change! The cauliflower offered a completely different taste compared to everything else on the table. The tuna was fresh and worked well with the pan fried cauliflower. Last served was the half chicken. At this point we really didn't need it but obviously since it was already there we had to  eat it. It came in a peach lavender glaze and was served with trumpet mushrooms. De-lic-ious. Our bill was around $100 after tip so a bit of a splurge but totally worth it.",5.0

"This place is quite small with limited seating, but I managed to come early on a Saturday evening and get a seat at the bar, which filled up really quickly! I ordered a couple of drinks throughout my meal - I particularly enjoyed the watermelon infused gin, which had a strong but pleasant rosemary smell and taste and a touch of cayenne. When you sit down, they give you a little bowl of popcorn - quite salty, but that didn't stop me from finishing it all. For my meal, I ordered a half dozen oysters - they are only $1 each for Happy Hour, which is 6-8pm from Monday-Saturday! Not the best or most plump oysters but satisfying nonetheless. Only one needed a tad bit more cleaning. Next, I had the wagyu tartare. They give you A LOT of tartare! Texture and taste were really great - the tartare is filled with capers, which I really like, because the capers give the tartare just another depth of flavor. The accompanying bread pieces could have been a bit thicker. I was still a bit hungry after the oysters and tartare, so I asked the server if she liked the pork ragu croquetas or the grilled octopus more. She said the croquetas were quite heavy and a substantial portion, so she would recommend the grilled octopus, especially since I had just eaten a large amount of meat. Good choice! This was probably the best octopus I have ever had. The texture was absolutely amazing - it reminded me of juicy grilled chicken breast. The char on it was also really nice. For dessert, I had the lemon poppyseed cake with blueberry compote. This dessert was decent enough, but it wasn't anything super special. I probably should have gone with the tiramisu instead. The servers/bartenders were all really friendly, and my water glass was never empty. I really enjoyed my meal. I would definitely come back and recommend this place!",4.0

I saw that the polenta was the thing to try but they have a new polenta board thats larger, meant for sharing and has different ""toppings"" including sausage, mushroom (my favorite), grilled leek, meatball and some kind of pulled pork. Definitely recommend getting it!!! We also tried the special - short rib rigatoni - and it was amazing. Fritto Misto is definitely worth trying and if i had to say my least favorite that we tried was the wagyu steak tartar, only cause I thought I could use a smidge more flavor.

When you sit down, they give you a little bowl of popcorn - quite salty, but that didn't stop me from finishing it all. For my meal, I ordered a half dozen oysters - they are only $1 each for Happy Hour, which is 6-8pm from Monday-Saturday! Not the best or most plump oysters but satisfying nonetheless. Only one needed a tad bit more cleaning. Next, I had the wagyu tartare. They give you A LOT of tartare! Texture and taste were really great - the tartare is filled with capers, which I really like, because the capers give the tartare just another depth of flavor. The accompanying bread pieces could have been a bit thicker. I was still a bit hungry after the oysters and tartare, so I asked the server if she liked the pork ragu croquetas or the grilled octopus more. She said the croquetas were quite heavy and a substantial portion, so she would recommend the grilled octopus, especially since I had just eaten a large amount of meat. Good choice! This was probably the best octopus I have ever had. The texture was absolutely amazing - it reminded me of juicy grilled chicken breast. The char on it was also really nice. For dessert, I had the lemon poppyseed cake with blueberry compote. This dessert was decent enough, but it wasn't anything super special. I probably should have gone with the tiramisu instead. The servers/bartenders were all really friendly, and my water glass was never empty. I really enjoyed my meal. I would definitely come back and recommend this place!",4.0
"delicious food, cozy and a perfect date restaurant! i loved all the food here, particularly the broccoli rabe and creamy polenta.  we just ordered a lot of small plates, and everything was perfect.  from the prosciutto and cheese to the tiramisu (with iced espresso granita on the top), i loved it all. wanted to try  the $1 oysters but didnt seem to go with the rest of the food. though i enjoyed my gin cocktail, i think wine goes better with the food! overall a great experience.",5.0

"Had dinner here in a group for 4 tapas style! Staff was really great, and made some great recommendations. The had $1 oysters til 8pm wich was awesome! I saw that the polenta was the thing to try but they have a new polenta board thats larger, meant for sharing and has different ""toppings"" including sausage, mushroom (my favorite), grilled leek, meatball and some kind of pulled pork. Definitely recommend getting it!!! We also tried the special - short rib rigatoni - and it was amazing. Fritto Misto is definitely worth trying and if i had to say my least favorite that we tried was the wagyu steak tartar, only cause I thought I could use a smidge more flavor. Either way, definitely want to come back!",5.0
"Excellent - three of us & we did the tasting menu with wine ! Amazing dishes for such a reasonable price. Interesting wines , and the dessert  was paired with a French sparkler ! For each course we each  served a different item that we all shared. Tartare delicious, creamy polenta we devoured and a butternut squash melange with fried fresh herbs and dates that surprised us all. The Berkshire pork perfectly cooked topped with baby arugula and shaved parm. I could go on , but I'm getting hungry. Check this place out. (Generous wine pours also )",5.0
"I love this restaurant.  It is the perfect place to unwind mid week.  They have an insane oyster happy hour, the food is incredible, the crowd is non existent, and the service is perfect!  The staff is very knowledgable about their menu and wine list and helped us pick the best meal!  The must try is the polenta.  Best polenta I've ever tasted.  And that's no exaggeration.  I will definitely be returning!",5.0

We cannot wait to go back and try some more delicious menu options! The place is small, but cozy, chic and plays great music.",5.0
"Had dinner there last weekend . I really wanted the food to be as good as the service. First and foremost, the service was great. Waiters were extremely attentive. As for the food... The chicken liver pate was good, the fried seafood was good as well. The grilled octopus was blend and the meatball dish tasted like tomato sauce, nothing special. I really wanted to like this place because the employees are so nice but unfortunately the food doesn't live up to expectations",3.0
"Outstanding, food was fun and tasty.  I'm not a fan of polenta, but this place could change my mind - it is a must get.  Other standouts were pork milanase, fritto misto, bucatini, broccoli rabe...hell, everything we had was great.  We shared all plates which were nicely presenting on cutting boards or in cast iron.  The staff was friendly and professional - keep things fun and moving.  Go and enjoy and great night of food",5.0
Creamy Polenta was amazing. Got a really good buttery taste. Patatas Bravas with the sriracha and mayo was a good combination instead of the usual ketchup. What's even better is the pan that it comes with. The grilled octopus was cooked good with the tomatoes. Also had the Tiramisu with espresso granita. Coffee on top of coffee. That was good! The Nutella Zepolles was also good. Kind of reminded of the Ferrero Rocher chocolate candy. Then came the Fried Ice Cream. Usually used to the tempura batter for ice cream but they actually fried ice cream with white bread. Kind of reminded me of an arepa but with ice cream. Now that was interesting. Overall I would definitely come back try some more stuff on their menu. Definitely a good place to go for some good food.,5.0
"HOLY POLENTA!!! Came in with three friends for dinner. Got there in time for happy hour, so we enjoyed some $1 oysters and then proceeded to have our minds blown. Restaurant was packed, but we still got outstanding personable service start to finish. Had the patatas brava, rabe, meatballs, octopus, fritto misto and of course TWO servings of the polenta (tasted it, immediately ordered a second). Our waiter helped us choose a good bottle of wine. We left very happy and full, a perfect dining experience. Will 100% be back, can't wait to try the nicely priced tasting menu!",5.0
"Great food, $1 Oysters (6-8pm), good wine list, charming venue, perfect price. We were staying next door and were so pleased to find this local treat. We had...- 12 oysters- Broccoli Rabe- Warm Butternut Squash- Creamy Polenta- Steamed Mussels- Porkbelly CroquetasPerfect amount of food for 2 hungry people, the Creamy Polenta was a stand out! The Croquetas comes in a serving of four - they are super rich / tasty, but I could only eat 2, so make sure you have a helper. Would definitely go there again.

"3.5 stars.Very cute tiny tapas place in Williamsburg.Oysters: really fresh, but they should improve the sauces that come with them... they're quite mediocre.Broccoli rabe: simple n yet delicious, with a creamy end to it.Creamy polenta: creamy indeed, delicate balance w strong sausage taste... very little, though.Grilled octopus: amazingly tender, very simple but outstanding.Roasted bone marrow: gd but, again, very little. There was barely any.They even had one of my fav reds in the world: Rosso di Montalcino!So why only 3.5 stars? Manhattan prices & portions in Brooklyn.We spent almost 90 bucks and got up hungry, and finished dinner somewhere else. NOT good. For what they charge, they could be less stingy and give a little more food. They didn't even bring any bread.

Oysters are a good deal, and seemed fresh enough.What's bad?1. The food! We had ordered an assortment of 'tapas' which were all very sub par and very overpriced - the Porkbelly croquets had little shavings of meat in them, barely one tiny bit of meat a piece, and mostly consisted of potatoes. They were not good, just tasted like big deep fried lumps of starch with no meat. Owner stinginess? who knows.2. More bad food- the Steak Tartar was a whopping $14 and basically wasn't real steak tarter. We were served a tiny pile of half cooked pieces of beef. With two sad pieces of toast. 3. More bad food - Endive Salad - Just tasted like a random array of greens with some type of tasteless crunchy substance. Also overprices for what it was and not tasty at all.4. Butternut squash - was the only item that tasted ok, but was also extremely oily. Nothing to write home about.The check came out to be around 90$ for a really unsatisfying and sub par meal.

"It goes without saying that I'm all about eating out in Manhattan... but if you've paid any attention to the dining scene around town in the last 18 months or so, it's pretty clear that a paradigm shift is in the works with restaurants like The Saint Austere calling Brooklyn home. Manhattan will always be king, but BK is making some serious strides to becoming the foodie borough of NYC.The Saint Austere does tapas right. Plenty of seasonal fare (butternut squash, root vegetables, broccoli rabe, hearty bone marrow, etc...) with proper portions and a very unoffensive price point. In these bitter cold winter months, there nothing quite as satisfying as their creamy polenta with sausage and cipollini. That dish alone is worth the trip on the L to Grand. The service is friendly and casual, and somehow despite the cozy nature, there seems to be a bar stool available for any twosome that swings by. If you're rolling deep, it might be worthwhile to avoid peak dining hours... but if you have 2-3 in tow, you should be set. Pair your night's selections with wines from around the globe or a hard-to-find beer made by a monk - it's as perfect a tag team as The Bushwackers.",5.0

"My taste buds are happy...St. Austere is a non-traditional tapas restaurant.  What I mean by ""non-traditional"" is the food can best be described as ""new American"" done tapas style.It is not a large space, but the staff (kitchen and waitstaff) do an amazing job with what they are working with.  The menu is kept small, allowing for the staff to maximize their time and space while maintaining each dish's unique flavor and texture.  There was no point at which I felt I was eating the same variation of a different make.Everything was a favorite: the broccoli rabe had a lovely texture a light and smooth creaminess;the creamy polenta was a heartier dish with a bit of kick from the light spice and ground meatthe grilled octopus was done really nicely: tender, full of texture, and the potatoes, capers and tomatoes added a nice balance to the dishthe steamed mussels were also good, with light cherry tomatoes adding additional flavor.Wine and beer selection were adequate.Service was extremely attentive without being overbearingAtmosphere was nice, quiet on a late Wednesday nightTips:don't come here if you are ravenous and looking for belly fillersdon't come here with a large partydon't come here so i don't have to wait in linecome here for a light meal, good food and fun with one to three friends on a non-weekend night",5.0
"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We had no reservations and walked in around 7:30p. They said it'd be a 25 - 35 minute wait and took our number so we could go to the bar next door and have a drink.  They called within 20 minutes and had our table ready to go. There was a large group (~20 people) which was taking up half the restaurant so I wonder if there would have been any wait at all if they weren't there.The atmosphere screams Brooklyn and is very well done. You'll sit at long communal tables, so you're close to your neighbor.The service and food were fantastic. We had 2 different cheeses, grilled octopus, steak tartare, and a pasta dish with pork ragu. The octopus itself was delicious, though we weren't crazy about the sauce they added. Everything else was great. They also brought us a complementary dish of their homemade polenta which was as good as all of the others. I'd highly recommend this place for dinner.",5.0

"Every time I got to a place that W picks, I am not into it and we all were going to go to Flushing, but we ended up going to Brooklyn and F and W wanted to come here.They are regulars here and F probably wanted to come here because of the oysters.F got a dozen of oysters and the other dozen, W and I shared the appetizer.Their mignonette was just okay, the garlicy one didn't win me over, instead I just did cocktail sauce with extra horseradish. The other dark mignonette, couldn't really even tell with this one.W and F got their own Creamy Polenta - it was really good, but the sausage and the pool of sausage grease would not work well with me if I tried to eat this whole thing by myself. I can't stuff with too much oil, but if you can, this dish was really nice.Steak Tartare - I love a good steak tartare and I got this and unbeknownst to me, W and F do not eat raw meat. Okay, great, so I get to eat this dish by myself. But when this dish came out, I saw the greyness of the meat. It was not raw, it was like cooked a bit and the chopped of meat was not diced as fine as I would have preferred my tartare to be. It was really chunky and I wouldn't mind this if it tasted good, but this dish was a no go for me. I haven't had a bad steak tartare, not that I could recall, but this one has made the list.Grilled Octopus - eh, did nothing to my taste buds. I'll stick to Le Pescadeux braised octopus.Braised Short Ribs - again, not my favourite and for me it was just lackluster.Tiramisu - good and strong. You can taste liqueur. Bread Pudding - I want to say this dessert had a really nice surprise hidden inside. Chunks of chocolate and I am not a fan of chocolate, but this dessert actually won me over. It was really good and I do love bread pudding.Overall, I was not amazed by the food here and I judge this solely by if the food here did something to my taste buds and my taste buds didn't dance here.However, I do love the bread pudding and it I can handle it, I definitely would do the Creamy Polenta.",3.0

"Well I hate to admit it, but I've done the yelp world a disservice. I've eaten at The Saint Austere close to 20 times now, and have yet to let the world know how absurdly amazing this place is. (No exaggeration on the 20 visits)Every item on their menu is cooked to perfection, and I promise you that they have yet to serve a dish that I didn't absolutely love. If you think I'm being extreme, try the polenta, which they apparently slow cook for 3 hours. (Just had to ask)Try the broccoli rabe.Try ANY of their pastas. (Chef Sam Diaz is a magician back there).Try ANY of their cocktails or their beautiful wine list.But most importantly, support a family owned business that's run by a brother/sister whose passion for their restaurant is unmatched. One of their main focuses is providing 5 star service (which I think most of you will agree is getting harder and harder to find these days), and I've always left feeling I received exactly that. Do yourself a favor and at least try this place for yourself. I can guarantee it won't be the last time you're there...or your money back! Well, not exactly, but you get the point :)",5.0

"I came here on a late night with a girlfriend.  We were in the mood to stay in Brooklyn, but wanted to wine and dine (on cheese.)  We were walking around and stumbled upon this place.  It was quiet and emptying out when we got there.  Loved their long wooden cafeteria/picnic style tables.  It's rustic and charming; not pretentious at all.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a selection of cheeses.  I'd come here again to try their other wines and cheeses.",3.0
"Went here for dinner on Saturday night. What an awesome spot! My dining companion had called ahead and was told to come in the earlier part of the evening, because it tends to get crowded.When we showed up, all of the back seating was taken because of some birthday party (it's annoying when people hold large parties in tiny restaurants, but whatever), but luckily there were plenty of bar seats open.  The bartender and servers were totally cool and took care of us the whole time (something not common in hipster Brooklyn!).And the food was amazing! Consistently delicious and well paced, well portioned courses. We ordered the polenta, patatas brava, bone marrow, and cavatelli. YUM. The polenta was one of the best I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who prefers polenta grilled, not runny. Creamy, buttery, flavorful, with delicious sausage. Patatas were nice and perfectly crispy, although I wasn't as impressed with the mayonnaise/siracha combo. Cavatelli was hearty and comforting. And the Bone Marrow....well, I am a huge fan of bone marrow...can't go wrong with that one!

"My taste buds are happy...St. Austere is a non-traditional tapas restaurant.  What I mean by ""non-traditional"" is the food can best be described as ""new American"" done tapas style.It is not a large space, but the staff (kitchen and waitstaff) do an amazing job with what they are working with.  The menu is kept small, allowing for the staff to maximize their time and space while maintaining each dish's unique flavor and texture.  There was no point at which I felt I was eating the same variation of a different make.Everything was a favorite: the broccoli rabe had a lovely texture a light and smooth creaminess;the creamy polenta was a heartier dish with a bit of kick from the light spice and ground meatthe grilled octopus was done really nicely: tender, full of texture, and the potatoes, capers and tomatoes added a nice balance to the dishthe steamed mussels were also good, with light cherry tomatoes adding additional flavor.Wine and beer selection were adequate.Service was extremely attentive without being overbearingAtmosphere was nice, quiet on a late Wednesday nightTips:don't come here if you are ravenous and looking for belly fillersdon't come here with a large partydon't come here so i don't have to wait in linecome here for a light meal, good food and fun with one to three friends on a non-weekend night",5.0
"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night. We had no reservations and walked in around 7:30p. They said it'd be a 25 - 35 minute wait and took our number so we could go to the bar next door and have a drink.  They called within 20 minutes and had our table ready to go. There was a large group (~20 people) which was taking up half the restaurant so I wonder if there would have been any wait at all if they weren't there.The atmosphere screams Brooklyn and is very well done. You'll sit at long communal tables, so you're close to your neighbor.The service and food were fantastic. We had 2 different cheeses, grilled octopus, steak tartare, and a pasta dish with pork ragu. The octopus itself was delicious, though we weren't crazy about the sauce they added. Everything else was great. They also brought us a complementary dish of their homemade polenta which was as good as all of the others. I'd highly recommend this place for dinner.",5.0
"SERIOUSLY delicious food, fantastic service and staff, and a great vibe.I've been two or three times.Try their frozen espresso creme brulee - you won't regret it.",5.0
"Every time I got to a place that W picks, I am not into it and we all were going to go to Flushing, but we ended up going to Brooklyn and F and W wanted to come here.They are regulars here and F probably wanted to come here because of the oysters.F got a dozen of oysters and the other dozen, W and I shared the appetizer.Their mignonette was just okay, the garlicy one didn't win me over, instead I just did cocktail sauce with extra horseradish. The other dark mignonette, couldn't really even tell with this one.W and F got their own Creamy Polenta - it was really good, but the sausage and the pool of sausage grease would not work well with me if I tried to eat this whole thing by myself. I can't stuff with too much oil, but if you can, this dish was really nice.Steak Tartare - I love a good steak tartare and I got this and unbeknownst to me, W and F do not eat raw meat. Okay, great, so I get to eat this dish by myself. But when this dish came out, I saw the greyness of the meat. It was not raw, it was like cooked a bit and the chopped of meat was not diced as fine as I would have preferred my tartare to be. It was really chunky and I wouldn't mind this if it tasted good, but this dish was a no go for me. I haven't had a bad steak tartare, not that I could recall, but this one has made the list.Grilled Octopus - eh, did nothing to my taste buds. I'll stick to Le Pescadeux braised octopus.Braised Short Ribs - again, not my favourite and for me it was just lackluster.Tiramisu - good and strong. You can taste liqueur. Bread Pudding - I want to say this dessert had a really nice surprise hidden inside. Chunks of chocolate and I am not a fan of chocolate, but this dessert actually won me over. It was really good and I do love bread pudding.Overall, I was not amazed by the food here and I judge this solely by if the food here did something to my taste buds and my taste buds didn't dance here.However, I do love the bread pudding and it I can handle it, I definitely would do the Creamy Polenta.",3.0
Very busy tonight especially for a Tuesday. Service suffered a little but the food is worth the wait . Broccoli rabi appetizer is always good but the new addition Brussels sprouts was delish but esp. for honey lovers. Oxtail ragu pasta was very good as well.,4.0
"Well I hate to admit it, but I've done the yelp world a disservice. I've eaten at The Saint Austere close to 20 times now, and have yet to let the world know how absurdly amazing this place is. (No exaggeration on the 20 visits)Every item on their menu is cooked to perfection, and I promise you that they have yet to serve a dish that I didn't absolutely love. If you think I'm being extreme, try the polenta, which they apparently slow cook for 3 hours. (Just had to ask)Try the broccoli rabe.Try ANY of their pastas. (Chef Sam Diaz is a magician back there).Try ANY of their cocktails or their beautiful wine list.But most importantly, support a family owned business that's run by a brother/sister whose passion for their restaurant is unmatched. One of their main focuses is providing 5 star service (which I think most of you will agree is getting harder and harder to find these days), and I've always left feeling I received exactly that. Do yourself a favor and at least try this place for yourself. I can guarantee it won't be the last time you're there...or your money back! Well, not exactly, but you get the point :)",5.0

"The chef's tasting menu is also superb. Ask for the polenta. The best desert I've had in my life. Worth coming to Brooklyn especially for the Lemon Tart with Strawberry and Rhubarb compote and macadamia streusel at Saint Austere, Grand street, Brooklyn. Divine!! 6/19/14",5.0
"I came here on a late night with a girlfriend.  We were in the mood to stay in Brooklyn, but wanted to wine and dine (on cheese.)  We were walking around and stumbled upon this place.  It was quiet and emptying out when we got there.  Loved their long wooden cafeteria/picnic style tables.  It's rustic and charming; not pretentious at all.  We ordered a bottle of wine and a selection of cheeses.  I'd come here again to try their other wines and cheeses.",3.0
"Went here for dinner on Saturday night. What an awesome spot! My dining companion had called ahead and was told to come in the earlier part of the evening, because it tends to get crowded.When we showed up, all of the back seating was taken because of some birthday party (it's annoying when people hold large parties in tiny restaurants, but whatever), but luckily there were plenty of bar seats open.  The bartender and servers were totally cool and took care of us the whole time (something not common in hipster Brooklyn!).And the food was amazing! Consistently delicious and well paced, well portioned courses. We ordered the polenta, patatas brava, bone marrow, and cavatelli. YUM. The polenta was one of the best I've ever had, and this is coming from someone who prefers polenta grilled, not runny. Creamy, buttery, flavorful, with delicious sausage. Patatas were nice and perfectly crispy, although I wasn't as impressed with the mayonnaise/siracha combo. Cavatelli was hearty and comforting. And the Bone Marrow....well, I am a huge fan of bone marrow...can't go wrong with that one! Definitely needed more bread to sop up that rich, fatty goodness!This place does get crowded and people start queuing up behind you, so keep that in mind if you're trying to have a quiet dinner, go early.

"Went here with a group of 8 for a birthday party. Through the reservation process our host was incredibly patient and accommodating, and very helpful with menu planning. We shared a family style 9 course meal that was absolutely stunning. We left happy, bellies full, and a bit drunk. The meal would have been a steal if we didn't keep ordering bottles of wine.  Everything was tasty.

"4.5 starsMy two friends and I decided to have our birthday dinner here together. Our party of 15 took up more than half the restaurant, but they were very accommodating and didn't rush us at all. Their beer selection is pretty nice. I liked their organic pale ale, but they ran out early in the night :( Their maple pale ale on tap was decent. FYI some of their bottled beers are big enough to fill up two glasses.We did a prix-fixe/family style meal for $35/person. My favorite dishes were the creamy polenta (hands down the best dish of the night), the patatas bravas which came with sriracha sauce, their broccoli rabe, and their meatballs. I wasn't a fan of their endive salad, their pork belly croquettas, or their beets. For dessert, we had delicious espresso tiramisu. I would definitely consider coming back here, even if it was just for the service. They also have $1 oysters during happy hour, which is always a big plus in my book!",4.0

"I have become a regular at Saint Austere over the past year or so and every time I go, I fall more in love with the place. They have such a strong overall sense of how to run a restaurant and it is apparent in every drink, every hospitable gesture and of course every bite of food. Their creamy polenta with sausage and cipollini is absolutely magnificent and is consistently perfect. The Broccoli rabe is also VERY delicious as well as the frito misto. Entrees such as the cavateli with oxtail ragu, butternut squash Malfatti  and the organic roast chicken (half or whole) are all SO good! We've done the chef's tasting menu also and it's a very good deal and gives you a really great spread of the menu. If you are dessert person (which I am not usually but I can't leave this place without getting this) get the tiramisu with tres leche cream and espresso granita... It's unnaturally delicious. In a nutshell, I love this place because it's a warm, inviting, neighborhood conscious restaurant in  a town where you don't necessarily see that every day and they're food is top notch delicious! Lovely wine list, great cocktails (really great). Would love a bite more in the beer area but I'm not complaining, they kill it on every other level so it's not a biggie whatsoever.",5.0

The polenta was creamy delightfulness -- and still good without the sausage! (I had the meat on the side.) The broccoli rabe was my favorite; the mix of cheese and anchovies made of a delightful mix.

"NOTE: 4.5 STARSWhat a treat this place was.  There are a bunch of very unique eateries in the East section of Wiliamsburg if you know where to look.  The Saint Austere is one of them and probably the cream of the crop.  Coincidentally, I learned about this spot at the Yelp Summerfest last year in Red Hook.  I sampled their polenta (I think I had two servings) and I fell in love.  I was happy to discover that this place was a five minute walk from my crib.My girlfriend and I picked a late Saturday evening to give The Saint Austere a whirl.  Around 9pm or so.  We didn't realize how small it was when we stepped inside.  It's long, dim and narrow.  The bar was packed solid, the window seats were spoken for and there was a special gathering happening in the back.  We knew we were gonna be waiting a while.  In all, I think we waited about 20-25 minutes.  We could have left and ate elsewhere but it smelled way too good in there. We were in it for the long haul.  The bartender recognized our patience and was kind enough to give us a glass of wine each on the house while we waited.  Nice touch.  We were also the only ones waiting.Eventually two seats at the end of the bar near the front door opened up.  We anchored there and proceeded without hesitation to order the chef's choice five-course prix fixe with the wine flight pairings. Four dishes and four wines for each of us without the pressure of having to choose anything. Just bring it all out.  We were ready to do WORK.  And we ended up loving every minute of that decision.  I had white anchovies, polenta, broccoli rabe (a *must* order) and a cheese plate.  My girlfriend had little neck clams, meatballs, bronzino and a cheese plate.  Sorry I can't remember the wines we got.  But they kicked ass (especially the reds).  Such a great meal all-around.  By the time we were eating it was later in the evening and nobody else was really coming in for food so we got to take our time and enjoy.  The music was courtesy of a mix of random Pandora stations, but great selections: Nas, Ghostface, Hall & Oates, James Brown, Morrissey, Depeche Mode and more.The only reason I had to deduct half a star is because it's rough to go during prime time on the weekend due to the size.  It's a crap shoot in that aspect.  It's a popular spot that is still building a great rep.  You'd have to make it an early or late dinner if you don't want to wait long or go on a day early in the week (it's perfect for dates).  But you will be treated royally once you grab a chair and pony up.",4.0

"Came for a friend's birthday and had a wonderful time.Service was out of this world.  The woman who took care of us owns the place (with her brother the chef) and I'm telling you, I was beyond impressed!We were a large group and she was able to pour wine, order-take, expedite, clear plates, describe dishes, and even provide individual checks (which *she* offered to do) all while chatting, smiling, oh, and handling every other guest in the restaurant.  Not a hint of showing how overwhelmed she might have been.  I've spent ages in the service industry (as had many in our party), and she gets a gold medal as far as I'm concerned.I've lived in the area for a long time and this used to be a spot called Wombat, but it's gone through quite a makeover.  The decor is lovely, rustic, romantic, cozy.Wine list is really top notch.  Beautiful glassware as well.  (Buying a nice bottle of wine and getting clunky glassware can be somewhat off-putting.)Food was delicious.  I'm a vegetarian and was planning to lay low and not expect to eat much at this family style birthday dinner, but our host must have mentioned there were vegetarians in our group.  The kitchen prepared one portion of nearly every one of the dishes ordered as a beautiful veg-friendly option.  So thoughtful!  This is really not that complicated, but as a veg you're often made to feel like you're just ruining everyone's good time by preferring not to eat meat.  These folks proved it can be a simple and easy practice to modify dishes in this manner.  Excellent, excellent customer awareness.Dessert was de-lish as well!A slight con is that is small and so with a group that size, it was loud.  We weren't really talking that loudly, but it just created a lot of volume.  If I were coming as a couple or small group, I might have opted for a seat at the bar or in the front to avoid the noise.  I think anything over 6 ppl would feel noisy.  It's not a major disclaimer, just something to note.All in all a great neighborhood spot I'll be visiting again.  And soon!",5.0
"This is a great bar, chill with a slight upper crust feel, but it's a bar. The 5-stars is mostly for the food. The food here is awesome, but the plates are small (the bad part). Doesn't really fill you up meal-wise, but it's sooo delicious! The drinks are good. They have a variety of unique beers.We checked it out for Cinco de Mayo. They had a fruit sangria, but the best was he beer cocktail. Also as a special, they had $3 tacos, shredded pork, beef tongue and fish. We had the tongue and the fish they were super delicious...now if only they'd keep these tacos on their menu.",5.0
"Cute and cozy spot in Williamsburg. Great for a date night or getting together with friends. 5 people shared the meatballs, mussells, polenta, shrimp pesto, bolognase and mushroom pastas. All the food was delish but the wait staff was a little misleading when letting us know the portion sizes. The meatballs, mussels, and polenta were all great appetizers but they told us that 1 plate of pasta would feed two people and that was not the case. I could have easily eaten a whole pasta dish on my own. Be aware that if you are big on dessert their choices are very limited. Overall the food was delicious and I would definitely return.",4.0
"I love this bar - great ambience, awesome staff and great drinks but when I ate there for the first time a couple of days ago I was thoroughly disappointed. We asked the waitress for recommendations and she said their signature dishes were the polenta and broccoli rabe so we ordered both, we also got a half portion of cabanara and the meat balls. Well the polenta was ok on the first bite but it soon became sicklily with all the cheese and oil and we couldn't finish it. The broccoli rabe arrived and seemed to taste just like the polenta - covered in a sickly cheesy sauce that was heavy, fatty and had huge clumps of salty cheese in it. The meatballs were meh and the cabanara was the worst i've ever tasted. It came with a poached/raw egg on top which was neat but when we mixed that into the pasta, all we could taste was egg yolk and the whole dish was luke warm. No subtlety of flavors to be found in any of their dishes, no complimentary flavors like sweet, salty, spicy...everything was bland and masked by a cheesy sauce. I haven't given up on this place as there are still lots of other many items and i love the staff, but wasn't impressed with our dinner that set us back $90.",2.0
"We enjoyed everything we ordered! The octopus, the bone marrow, the polenta, the fried artichoke and can't forget shavings of fried garlic,the cauliflower and tuna. We will be back.",5.0
"Spanish tapas + gastropub + $1 oysters = a worthwhile trip out to BK!Really lovely small plates at a non-Manhattan price point.  We ordered the pork belly croquetas (good, but the pork belly is ground up and totally incorporated into the croquette, so expect flavor, but not much by way of texture), butternut squash, eggplant caponata, and bone marrow.  Oh, right.  And a plate of aggressive cheeses.  Adored the rustic plating and solid portion size.The oysters do (questionably) run out, so be sure to get there early if you're looking for some affordable bivalves.",4.0
"This place offers great service and a reasonably priced tasting menu. What more can you ask for. Its on grand avenue so those stinking hipsters on bedford probably haven't ruined it yet but this is one of the best dining experiences I have had in BK. Its a bit small and if you got a big party make reservations. You should make reservations regardless but I think you can walk in if its not busy. The staff is very nice and they got great taste in music! So you can place a regular boring dinner order or you can do the smart thing and do the tasting menu. Its $40 frickin dollars and you get 4 courses including dessert. They have a wine pairing which was an additional $30 dollars. I'm kinda glad that more restaurants in NYC are doing tasting menus. Its shocking that NYC had to catch up with other foodies places like Montreal and Philly in that regards. Because we rolled in 9 deep and got the tasting menu we tried a bunch of different plates. The first course had the broccoli rabe, endive salad, and polenta. All very good. The next course had the steamed mussels and meatballs. Order the steamed mussels. It was the best steamed mussels I have ever had and I don't like seafood like that. The sauce was spicy. The meatballs were great but I think meatball shop (NOT THE BEDFORD LOCATION) has them beat. The main course was the papperdelle and hanger steak. The hanger steak was absolutely delicious. Never had papperdelle before but i love short ribs. I will order both again next I go. They have a cool drink menu. They will make anything you want. The staff again were so nice and the vibe of the place is real chill.",5.0
"My husband and I went to St. Austere without a reservation on a Monday night at 6:30pm and were seated promptly. The items on the menu all looked so good, it was difficult to select from! Also, there was a $1.00 oyster happy hour from 6-8pm so we got eight from PEI. From the menu, we had the Broccoli Rabe, Patatas Bravas, Grilled Octopus, Chicken Liver Pate, and Pecorino Rossellino, and a glass of a white wine (name's slipping me, but we asked the sommelier for a light white and it was great, with some carbonation). The chicken liver, pecorino, and patatas bravas were my faves! The broccoli rabe was tasty, but the cheese and egg yolk made it a little heavier than we were expecting. The grilled octopus was tasty as well. Oh - the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars however is that their Lemon Tart dessert was super dried out! It sounded interesting because the waitress mentioned ""we have a lemon tart served warm"" which got me excited as most tarts I've had at restos are usually warm temperature. I think it was either a super old tart or it was nuked too long because it was dry and rubbery ... =P Maybe dessert is not their cup of tea!",4.0
"Came here about a month or two ago and did the wine and food 4 course pairing ($50 per person) and it was just... WOW... Why the need for caps? Proceed:I know everyone here is raving about the Polenta. It's because it's true. I hate Polenta. My grandmother would make me eat it as a kid and it accomplished nothing but making me grow up with a severe and passionate loathing of it. I almost didn't touch it, I am that repulsed and averse to it. However, thanks to my fellow Yelpers I decided to bite the bullet and the result was, in one word: euphoria. My poor bf would try to speak to me and I'd just hold my hand up and close my eyes as I ate spoonful after spoonful. The creaminess... the cheesiness... it was... perfection. Or as I now refer to it: ""Polection"".The rest of the food was seriously bangin. The broccoli rabbe was amazing. It had boiled eggs in it that just hit the right spot. The pork belly justified my decision to give up vegetarianism (don't judge). The croquettes almost started a fight btw my bf and I. The wine pairings were great. I've been trying to hunt down their red ""lightly sparkling"" wine (they paired it with the polenta if I'm not mistaken. You must forgive me since I was in a Polection induced euphoria and some things are still blurry). I've been to I don't know how many wine stores in search of it since then and have been lied to every time. If I ever have to use the phrase, ""no it's not moscato,"" again I may need a lawyer. If I can't trust my wine guy who can I trust in life??? I know who: The Saint Austere.Seriously tho. Get the wine pairing. It was worth the extra $20 (food pairing is $30 sans wine but since when is anything sans wine better than anything with wine?). They definitely pour nicely. Phenomenal food, an excellent wine selection, and super friendly service. There's nothing more that a place needs. But to make themselves even more awesome they had these crazy paintings of a goat in glasses and a giraffe in lord knows what, amongst many others... I dare you to do the wine pairing and resist the urge to pose next to them in imitation. I double dog dare you.PS: Sorry this was biblically long. I blame the Polection.",5.0

"Tapas is a perennial favorite and, for people who enjoy dabbling in a multitude of dishes, it remans a cost-effective means by which to tantalize the taste buds in earnest, all at a reasonable price. And, at an establishment like The Saint Austere, all one wants to do is dabble in more dishes than one could possibly hope to enjoy without exceeding the maximum stretch capacity of your jeans. In short: It is our kind of place.We hopped over at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening and were welcomed by the friendly manager into a comfortable space that was not at all crowded since, apparently, the masses arrive between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Though the menu may not be as extensive as an institution like Traif, the same principle applies: the portion sizes vary (all explained by the staff) and there are dishes to satisfy most people's desires from indulgent porkbelly croquetas to a relatively healthy grilled branzino.After studying the menu and going through our usual ritual of debating the virtues of Dish X over Dish Y, compared to Dish Z, we settled on:-Warm Butternut Squash (brown butter shallots, dates, cauliflower, kale, proscuitto) which was well-balanced and flavorful. (4 stars)-Endive Salad (frisée, bacon vinaigrette, parmigiano tuile) which was light, surprisingly zesty and offset the heavier dishes, though it's probably not a go-to dish in it's own right. (3 stars)-Grilled Octopus (bacalao purée, pickled pearl onion, tomato) which we thought was good, but not amazing. I did enjoy the bacalao purée, though. (3 stars)-Half Roasted Organic Chicken, which was very tender and flavorful. (4 stars)-Tiramisu, which was exceedingly decadent. (4 stars)-The manager also informed us that the polenta was a signature dish of the restaurant and provided us with a free serving. While neither of us are huge fans of polenta, this was rather exceptional -- we'll certainly be back for more.Conclusion: All the items at this low-key establishment were very good, and we'll most certainly return to try the other delicious-sounding offerings. If it is sheer decadence you are after, perhaps Traif is the better destination though - if you are looking to diversify your flavor palate with items that range from ""reasonably healthy"" to ""heart-stoppingly"" indulgent - this may provide a more balanced approach to tapas in the neighborhood. With excellent staff, an unobtrusive ambiance, and very good food, this is certainly a restaurant on which to keep your eye.",4.0

"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Brooklyn, maybe even Manhattan. First let me start with the pastas- always homemade and absolutely amazing. My go to is the Cavatelli with Oxtail Ragu, but all our great. The service is always on point here (big deal in my book) always very attentive, friendly and warm. They play old school hip hop most of the time, which adds to the laid back neighborhood vibe. Big pours of wine. I highly recommend the Polenta, superb!. Shout out to the Sunday Supper that they just started doing as well. $35 for four courses. Cant beat that.",5.0

"Went here for my combined birthday dinner for a group of 15 total. Making reservations was simple. I emailed them and they got back to me within minutes! That said, the service here is impeccable! Even before the meal began, they were attentive and friendly. Then during the meal, they stopped by and checked on our water several times. When they saw that our beer glasses were empty, they were quick to ask if we wanted another one. Now onto the food, we had a family style meal (since it was a large group) for $35/person. There were several dishes served - crostino. endive salad, patatas bravas, porkbelly croquettas, creamy polenta, broccoli rabe, meatballs, housemade beet malfatti, and tiramisu for dessert. 1. Patatas Bravas (w/ sriracha drizzled on top and mayo on the side) - they were delicious, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but the sriracha is what made it memorable2. Butternut Squash Crostino - I found the butternut squash to be a bit bland, I wish it had a little more flavor3. Endive Salad - it was good, but not too flavorful as well4. Porkbelly croquettas (with chicken liver on the side) - the croquettes themselves were amazing, but I wish they contained a little more porkbelly on the inside. The liver by itself had a gamey aftertaste which I did not like, but paired with the croquettes - they were a perfect pair!5. Creamy polenta - orgasmic - can't begin to describe it. Just get it!! 6. Broccoli rabe - delicious as well, but nothing too special7. Meatballs - they were soft and fluffy, but were dry & moist at the same time. They were moist and not overcooked, but tasted like they lacked a little fat8. Housemade beet malfatti - i did not enjoy this dish at all. The texture of the beet was strange and the taste itself was lacking9. Tiramisu (with espresso granita on top) - can never go wrong with tiramisuOverall, the service made it an exception and memorable experience. I probably won't do the family style menu next time I come back. Now that I know which dishes I like and dislike, I'll stick with the polenta, rabe, and patatas bravas. FYI: they have a good selection of beer and their $1 oysters are amazing! Go for happy hour!",4.0

Patatas Bravas (w/ sriracha drizzled on top and mayo on the side) - they were delicious, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but the sriracha is what made it memorable2. Butternut Squash Crostino - I found the butternut squash to be a bit bland, I wish it had a little more flavor3. Endive Salad - it was good, but not too flavorful as well4. Porkbelly croquettas (with chicken liver on the side) - the croquettes themselves were amazing, but I wish they contained a little more porkbelly on the inside. The liver by itself had a gamey aftertaste which I did not like, but paired with the croquettes - they were a perfect pair!5. Creamy polenta - orgasmic - can't begin to describe it. Just get it!! 6. Broccoli rabe - delicious as well, but nothing too special7. Meatballs - they were soft and fluffy, but were dry & moist at the same time. They were moist and not overcooked, but tasted like they lacked a little fat8. Housemade beet malfatti - i did not enjoy this dish at all. The texture of the beet was strange and the taste itself was lacking9. Tiramisu (with espresso granita on top) - can never go wrong with tiramisuOverall, the service made it an exception and memorable experience. I probably won't do the family style menu next time I come back. Now that I know which dishes I like and dislike, I'll stick with the polenta, rabe, and patatas bravas. FYI: they have a good selection of beer and their $1 oysters are amazing! Go for happy hour!",4.0
"This place does a lot of things right hence the high ratings which is why a small group of us decided to try it a couple of weeks back.  We indulged in their $1.00 Oysters.  The first batch was great.  The second batch kept us waiting and by the time we got it the warm oysters tasted ""off"".  We all agreed that something wasn't right but didnt bother mentioning it (probably a mistake).That night my girlfriend got TERRIBLY sick.  Like BAD.  Her severe case of food poison lasted about a week.  When we called the restaurant and spoke to the owner she seemed concerned - mostly about defending the quality of her food.  We explained to her that it takes only 1 bad oyster and we wanted to let her know.  We also informed her that most of the gang we were with works in that hood and wont be coming back unless she personally invites them for a drink.  Not because they need free drinks but because we were all left with a bad taste in our mouths.  I gave her my girlfriends cell phone number in case she wanted to right the wrong (she assured us that she would call) but we didn't hear from her (surprising - as a business owner I would welcome the opportunity to make amends with an unhappy client).  Regardless, I had to add this review to YELP regarding the $1.00 Oysters.  Buyer beware.   Eat the Oysters at your own risk.  The owners dont care of the consequences as long as the bill is paid.",1.0

ive been to saint austere 2x now. solid food. the other yelp reviews are right for the most part. highly recommend the brocc rabe. oh ive never tasted rabe so well prepared. awsome! so flavorful. polenta w sausage was great. mushroom pasta was cooked perfect and tasted lovely. the patas bravas however was not impressive - potatoes were cooked well but the mayo and siracha just didnt make it special enough. meatballs were tender but lacked seasoning. cocktails were good but couldve been stronger. ordered their housemade porchetta as a meat cheese platter and altho it was moist i found that it lacked seasoning. maybe the bigger portion they offer as an entree would be better? i dont kno but will def go back. overall good experience and service was pleasant.,4.0

"A very quaint restaurant reminiscent of local hangouts in Europe. Came here with a few friends and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. They have a decent cocktails list that features their own home-made brew of a dark and stormy beer. Although it was very good, I hesitated in ordering another because of the price. A bit steep for an $11 price tag. The food is very good as each dish's ingredients are very well thought out. Also a plus that they were willing to work with our party's food allergies. I highly recommend the grilled octopus, although a very small portion. I also recommend the oxtail argue pasta. The mix of flavors was delicious as each piece of decadent pasta melted in my mouth.

"This is definitely one of my new favorite restaurants! The servers were very knowledgable about the menu and gave some amazing recommendations. I think every table around me must've gotten a plate of $1 oysters so definitely order that first because it takes a little bit of time to prep.My favorites:Broccoli rabe: This was definitely my favorite dish of the night and I could have easily eaten a giant bowl of this alone for an entree.Fried artichokes: These were cut up almost like onion rings so you have tons of nice crispy edges to dip into the aioli sauce.Roasted bone marrow: Bone marrow is tasty in itself but the lemony arugula-radish salad really helped balance everything out.Cauliflower: I've never thought about mixing cauliflower and tuna together, but it tasted so good!Grilled octopus: Simple and delicious.Branzino: We got the half order and it was more than enough for everyone to have a little taste.My not-so favorites:Creamy polenta: This was good but definitely couldn't compete with the dishes above.Cavatelli: This was a nice and simple dish as well, but it didn't stand out.Fontina fonduta: I didn't read the menu that clearly and didn't realize ""fonduta"" meant ""fondu""--I thought it would be a grilled bread topped with fried asparagus and pickled pearl onions. This was probably the one thing my table just picked at and didn't really eat much of.",5.0
"Last Friday night, on what must have been our twentieth time there, I turned to my boyfriend and said ""It just makes me feel good to patronize this place.""  The Saint Austere has served me so well time and time again, and I want to serve IT well.  Hence, this commendatory review (and perpetual vow to return).ALL-IN-ALL:Super food, dope atmosphere, and warm, knowledgeable owners (brother + sister!)WHAT'S PLAYING:Heartless Bastards, Black Keys, Jack White, Snoop Dogg, Leonard Cohen, Beck, Nina Simone, Alabama ShakesMUST EATS:Creamy polenta, olive crostino, patatas bravas, Italiano in Cuba (and pretty much, get the special if there is one)BOOZE:Their wine recommendations have yet to steer me wrong.  The brews are all specialty picks - mostly European.  Makes it fun to try something new every time!Come in just for a casual glass of vino at the end of a long day or for an adventure in cuisine with one of their affordable, well-orchestrated tasting events.  It fits as a go-to neighborhood bar, as well as a special occasion/intimate date spot.  It is what you make it - and Jackie and Fabrizio have made it easy to love.",5.0

"The Saint Austere never disappoints! The food is still fantastic every time especially the Broccoli Rabe! They did add a few changes to their menu such as the fried chicken (love) and the pork belly, which, is the best belly I've ever had. It was melting my my mouth and the skin was very flavourful!They also added fortified wine to their drink menu - Yay!If I still lived in Bushwick, I would be there every night.",5.0
"Yo, I'm like the super average dude, and this place, THIS PLACE, was phenomenal. Seriously, went here for a friend's birthday (my gf and some of her friends) and we had an awesome time. The bartender reco'd a tasty wine. It was well priced, but didn't taste cheap. Which I appreciate, cuz they could've screwed us over with something that tastes like Yellowtail, but they didn't. It was a semi-dry full body red, hints of a ton of different shit...blah, blah, blah...all of that, Bottom line=delicious. I drink a lot of wine, and I know good ones. This was one of them. Just ask, they're good at suggesting the right ones.Next, the food. Small plates. Not always my favorite, but these delivered portions that we shared between four people. The big plates, um, equally as delicious, and well worth our time and palettes. We had a bunch. Definitely try the POLENTA. It's not to be missed. Which I'm sure tons of other people will reco, so I'll add the MEATBALLS to the list. Why? Because I'm a dude, I like to get full, and they were delightfully soft, full of flavor, and swimming in a tomato sauce that would make an Italian grandmother proud.The chef came out to check on us, which is always a nice touch.

"Started with terrific $1 oysters and segwayed into the $35 tasting menu. The whole meal was delicious, particularly the polenta, the bronzino with caponata and the partially frozen tiramisu dessert. The food was exceptional, by far one of the best meals I've had in North Brooklyn.",5.0
"Great addition to the neighborhood. The wine selections they have are unique and seem to be well thought out. My bf and I sampled the patatas bravas (which I think was just a special that night), the polenta, fried artichokes and Goose Crostino. All of the food was delish, but the polenta and crostino were my favorites. The staff was very friendly as well. It's a small space, but well-decorated. I definitely plan on going back.UPDATE: I raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars based on sampling their tasting menu about a month ago. It was delicious and the wine pairings were phenomenal + the service was outstanding. All of that and it was a BARGAIN for the experience you get. I highly recommend that for a special occasion or romantic date out.",5.0
"I love love this restaurant, everything was well thought out. I feel so comfortable when I come in here. The owner Fabriceo ( i think that's how you spell it) is so wonderful. You can't tell this is what he loves and his sisters. He's so knowledgeable about his menu. Can't say enough great things about this place. My best friend gets made me swear not to take anyone there",5.0
"The owners are as friendly as their polenta is creamy.  I would replace my circulatory system with it's soft textured goodness if I wouldn't die of extreme deliciousness.  This place is class; great vibe, great selection of wine or draughts and always great people stopping in for a drink or some mortadella.  Great date spot and outstanding tapas!",4.0
"This is definitely one of my new favorite restaurants! The servers were very knowledgable about the menu and gave some amazing recommendations. I think every table around me must've gotten a plate of $1 oysters so definitely order that first because it takes a little bit of time to prep.My favorites:Broccoli rabe: This was definitely my favorite dish of the night and I could have easily eaten a giant bowl of this alone for an entree.Fried artichokes: These were cut up almost like onion rings so you have tons of nice crispy edges to dip into the aioli sauce.Roasted bone marrow: Bone marrow is tasty in itself but the lemony arugula-radish salad really helped balance everything out.Cauliflower: I've never thought about mixing cauliflower and tuna together, but it tasted so good!Grilled octopus: Simple and delicious.Branzino: We got the half order and it was more than enough for everyone to have a little taste.My not-so favorites:Creamy polenta: This was good but definitely couldn't compete with the dishes above.Cavatelli: This was a nice and simple dish as well, but it didn't stand out.Fontina fonduta: I didn't read the menu that clearly and didn't realize ""fonduta"" meant ""fondu""--I thought it would be a grilled bread topped with fried asparagus and pickled pearl onions. This was probably the one thing my table just picked at and didn't really eat much of.",5.0
"Last Friday night, on what must have been our twentieth time there, I turned to my boyfriend and said ""It just makes me feel good to patronize this place.""  The Saint Austere has served me so well time and time again, and I want to serve IT well.  Hence, this commendatory review (and perpetual vow to return).ALL-IN-ALL:Super food, dope atmosphere, and warm, knowledgeable owners (brother + sister!)WHAT'S PLAYING:Heartless Bastards, Black Keys, Jack White, Snoop Dogg, Leonard Cohen, Beck, Nina Simone, Alabama ShakesMUST EATS:Creamy polenta, olive crostino, patatas bravas, Italiano in Cuba (and pretty much, get the special if there is one)BOOZE:Their wine recommendations have yet to steer me wrong.  The brews are all specialty picks - mostly European.  Makes it fun to try something new every time!Come in just for a casual glass of vino at the end of a long day or for an adventure in cuisine with one of their affordable, well-orchestrated tasting events.  It fits as a go-to neighborhood bar, as well as a special occasion/intimate date spot.  It is what you make it - and Jackie and Fabrizio have made it easy to love.",5.0
"This place is great!  The wine list is unlike any I've seen in the area - eclectic selection both by the glass and the half bottle.  The polenta is friggin amazing.The owners are super helpful, knowledgeable and the service is on point. If you haven't gone yet, you should.  Right now.",5.0
"The Saint Austere never disappoints! The food is still fantastic every time especially the Broccoli Rabe! They did add a few changes to their menu such as the fried chicken (love) and the pork belly, which, is the best belly I've ever had. It was melting my my mouth and the skin was very flavourful!They also added fortified wine to their drink menu - Yay!If I still lived in Bushwick, I would be there every night.",5.0
"Yo, I'm like the super average dude, and this place, THIS PLACE, was phenomenal. Seriously, went here for a friend's birthday (my gf and some of her friends) and we had an awesome time. The bartender reco'd a tasty wine. It was well priced, but didn't taste cheap. Which I appreciate, cuz they could've screwed us over with something that tastes like Yellowtail, but they didn't. It was a semi-dry full body red, hints of a ton of different shit...blah, blah, blah...all of that, Bottom line=delicious. I drink a lot of wine, and I know good ones. This was one of them. Just ask, they're good at suggesting the right ones.Next, the food. Small plates. Not always my favorite, but these delivered portions that we shared between four people. The big plates, um, equally as delicious, and well worth our time and palettes. We had a bunch. Definitely try the POLENTA. It's not to be missed. Which I'm sure tons of other people will reco, so I'll add the MEATBALLS to the list. Why? Because I'm a dude, I like to get full, and they were delightfully soft, full of flavor, and swimming in a tomato sauce that would make an Italian grandmother proud.The chef came out to check on us, which is always a nice touch. My GF grilled him about his techniques, and he was super hospitable about answering questions.This place is a no-brainer.

"Living in the area I was curious for months about what kind of place this would be. I was excited for something new to open and i couldn't have left more pleased with The Saint Austere. My girlfriend and I went in on a Thursday night for some food and wine. There was a really good vibe going and we both were comfortable immediately.It is small plates and usually i am skeptical about the size of the dishes but i was pleasantly pleased with their size and heartiness. The bar is lengthy with plenty of seats, it also has a few tables in the back perfect for group seating. The ambiance is the opposite of cheesy which is rare to find these days. There's no lame gimmicks or mason jars used as glasses like everywhere else in the area.They offer around 15 different dishes each priced between $8 and $15. They have a variety of food from things like meat and cheese plates to a beautiful octopus dish that the people next to us ordered and it made us jealous because they were raving about it. (Unfortunately we were already full, next time) My favorite dish was the creamy polenta with spicy sausage. It had the perfect amount of spice. Put it this way, if you were at home you would definitely lick the sides of your bowl. We also ordered the broccoli rabe and little neck clams. The clams were plated beautifully and the toasted bread for dipping was a nice touch.For thirst they offer a broad selection of beer and wine. 4 or 5 beers on tap and a good amount by bottle. They have a large selection of wine by the glass and bottle as well.We spoke with the owners for a few while at the bar and they seemed really friendly and definitely knew what they were talking about when it comes to food and wine and pairing flavors. They even sent us out an order of the papas bravas (roasted potatoes with mayonnaise and sriracha) on the house.After a few hours of wine, beer and food we left happy and full with a new favorite place.

"Saint Austere is aiming to be a cosy bar that's a great place to have drinks....and when the fun gets a little too intense...it's a place you can dig into some seriously delicious and high-concept bar food. I've eaten at places like Alain Ducasse in Paris and Jean George in NYC and I've NEVER had a polenta like that the mouth-heaven you'll find here. It was a fantasy-come-true in your mouth. One of my friends actually suggested the dish was made with Unicorn horns. I kinda want to believe her. This Sh*t was magical. Don't share is all I can say. You won't want to. Seoul, the CIA grad Executive Chef was beyond rad. He is seriously someone to keep an eye on. He sent us fabulous patatas bravas that were spicy with just the right amount of mayonnaise, and then since we were celebrating a special birthday, we scored some meatballs. Thanks Seoul! These were light and airy, in a super-fresh tomato sauce. Additionally we ordered the octopus, the bone marrow (very unique, great presentation) the broccoli rabe and the tomato bruscheta (they were having an off night, bread was stale).  Anyway, to say the lease we feasted. And just when we thought we might be done, we decided to order MORE POLENTA. Like I said. Sharing this stuff is criminal, I think you see where I'm coming from.

"Delicious food and a well-polished ambiance without being too hipstery (ie: the staff are actually really nice to you.) I went with friends and sat at the bar. We had two bottles of wine - they have a great list by the glass and the bottle and were happy to assist in selecting. We ordered the fried artichokes, broccoli rabe,  pork belly, and a few cheeses. We had to wait a while for the food, and they brought us the polenta dish without charge to compensate.The broccoli rabe was just the right amount of bitter and garlic, and the pork belly was an ample piece of meat with tiny peach pieces and pecans. All the dishes on the menu were interesting without being overly fussy. I don't like dairy, but my cheesehead friends were agog over the polenta and probably would have licked the bowl if we weren't all pretending to be ladies and stuff.Bill was reasonable, but its tapas and the plates are small and I left hungry, but I would definitely return for a drink and a snack.

"Amazing, easily one of the best meals I have had in a long time.Got there with L at around 8 pm on a Friday night, and was surprised to find it relatively empty.  This made me a little nervous, but yelp reviewers did not steer me wrong, this place is awesome.We both got the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings.A 4 course meal with 4 different wine pairings for $50!?! What a deal!And on top of that, the chef prepares different dishes for each member of the party for each course, and they are meant to be shared.This is so ingenious, since we both got to try out such a big variety of dishes. Very much worth the price.First Course - Arugula Salad - delicious! there was candied orange peel and shave parmesan on top. Light and refreshing.Broccoli Rabe - easily my FAVORITE dish of the night! Cooked broccoli rabe tossed in a egg based dressing (like a traditional cesaer salad) with egg whites and panko flakes. So flavorful, definitely getting this dish the next time we come.Second Course -Steamed Mussels - YUM, I love mussels. The wine paired with this course is the same as the white used to steam the mussels, so they complimented each other nicely. We also quickly devoured the impeccably toasted bread sopping up the remaining soup, but the waitress promptly came over and offered to bring us some more. Talk about incredible service.Polenta - aaaah, the famed polenta everyone talks about. Definitely creamier and richer than any polenta I've ever had before., but not sure it's the best i've ever had. A little bit TOO rich for my taste.Third Course -Lasagna - what really stand out is the amount of basil used in the dish. I love basil so it was definitely a win for me. A good, homey lasagna.Duck Confit - incredibly flavorful, and very hearty. this dish alone would've made for an awesome dinner.Fourth Course -I think usually for the 4th course, they usually serve some sort of dessert or a cheese platter, but since we informed them that L is slightly lactose intolerant, they switched it out for a sample platter. So accommodating!Pork Belly Croquette w/ chicken liver dipping sauce - simply melts in your mouth, and the dipping sauce is perfect.Patatas Brava - fried potatoes covered in siracha with a mayo dipping sauce?? What more could you ask for??Fried Artichoke - also good, but was so full by this point that i was only able to eat a bite or two.Service was awesome, the staff was so sweet and on top of it.

"i can't say enough good things about this place. i went for the first time last friday, and then just had to go back to try the chef's tasting menu so i went again last night.the tasting menu for 4 is an insane amount of delicious food and wine. and at $55 per person, i don't think there's a better deal anywhere else. when i say insane amount, i really mean it. we actually had to skip the last course because we were all full to bursting (but they offered to pack it up for us!)i really think this is my new favorite restaurant. service is impeccable, menu is diverse, portions are good, and prices are more than reasonable. ingredients all taste fresh and the dishes are unique without being over the top. the polenta here, as everyone says, is pretty mind-blowing. but the dark horse was their porchetta, which is made in-house and might have surpassed the polenta, for me at least.go. bring some friends. do the chef's tasting. you won't regret it.",5.0

"Amazing, easily one of the best meals I have had in a long time.Got there with L at around 8 pm on a Friday night, and was surprised to find it relatively empty.  This made me a little nervous, but yelp reviewers did not steer me wrong, this place is awesome.We both got the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings.A 4 course meal with 4 different wine pairings for $50!?! What a deal!And on top of that, the chef prepares different dishes for each member of the party for each course, and they are meant to be shared.This is so ingenious, since we both got to try out such a big variety of dishes. Very much worth the price.First Course - Arugula Salad - delicious! there was candied orange peel and shave parmesan on top. Light and refreshing.Broccoli Rabe - easily my FAVORITE dish of the night! Cooked broccoli rabe tossed in a egg based dressing (like a traditional cesaer salad) with egg whites and panko flakes. So flavorful, definitely getting this dish the next time we come.Second Course -Steamed Mussels - YUM, I love mussels. The wine paired with this course is the same as the white used to steam the mussels, so they complimented each other nicely. We also quickly devoured the impeccably toasted bread sopping up the remaining soup, but the waitress promptly came over and offered to bring us some more. Talk about incredible service.Polenta - aaaah, the famed polenta everyone talks about. Definitely creamier and richer than any polenta I've ever had before., but not sure it's the best i've ever had. A little bit TOO rich for my taste.Third Course -Lasagna - what really stand out is the amount of basil used in the dish. I love basil so it was definitely a win for me. A good, homey lasagna.Duck Confit - incredibly flavorful, and very hearty. this dish alone would've made for an awesome dinner.Fourth Course -I think usually for the 4th course, they usually serve some sort of dessert or a cheese platter, but since we informed them that L is slightly lactose intolerant, they switched it out for a sample platter.

"Total surprise at how incredible this place is overall. Fabrizio (barman/owner/genius) really seemed to care about the food and our opinions on it.

Musical rotation skewed 70s-90s punk/alternative with some new rock as well. Perfect for me. (Sweet Afton comparison is spot on).Food: I can't say enough about how happy I was about St. Austere. Great wine, great beers, and the food was simple perfection. Try the ricotta, the fried artichokes (grab the lemon) and the polenta.  The tasting menu was perfect -- wintery and light at the same time. Service: We were at the bar and had a bit of a hook-up, so it was top-notch, but the other, less juiced in people got the same level of service. I recommend doing a tasting for two and choosing a wine or two (I went beer and was not disappointed) to go with it. If you are unhappy here, it is your fault.",5.0

I went to the yelp summerfest and this restaurant had a table giving out samples of their polenta.  This was by far the best dish at the event and the best polenta I have ever had.  The texture and creaminess of the polenta was excellent and it comes with a sauce of sausage and other yummy goodness on top.  The dish was perfect in every way and I wanted to just lick every drop of it from the bowl.   I am definitely planning a trip to the actual restaurant to try other items on their menu.,4.0

"Stopped in yesterday (Monday) around 10:30 for a lite supper and some wine and had a terrific experience. I will definitely be back.We sat at the zinc topped bar in front and ordered a few small plates and two glasses of wine. There are bar height tables in the back as well but we liked being near the front with doors and windows open to the street.The menu has small dishes organized by ""One bite"", ""Two Bite"" and ""Three bites"". These groups seem to reflect price more than portion size. FYI.The food was all prepared very well. The broccoli rabe with anchovies and pancetta was excellent. The rabe was tender and the anchovies cut its bitterness. The papas bravas used very nice fingerlings and pimentón (smoked paprika) with good texture. We also had the tartare of the day (snapper) and the italian-cuban sandwich which were both excellent as well. The sandwich didn't taste much different than a classic cuban; which is not a problem if you like that.The drink menu has a good selection of wine by the glass ranging from $9-$13.  My date had a glass of sangiovese which was very good; dry with mild tannins. I had a $13 chardonnay that didn't taste like a chardonnay. It had a light carbonation and was much brighter and more citrus-y than most chardonnays. Don't get me wrong. It was good. Just not what I expected.The service was very attentive and friendly. They answered all my annoying foodie questions and brought extra bread for the rabe's sauce when we asked. Granted we were the only people left at 11pm on a Monday but it felt as though they made an extra effort to be gracious.The jukebox in front was playing a weird mix of classic-rock ballads and post-electro pop (la roux followed by the eagles?).

"I must admit, having been a huge fan of Wombat (who previously occupied the space), I didn't want to like this place.  Finally went in after months of holding out, and now I cannot believe I waited so long.  Nice cosy atmosphere, diverse yet non-initmidating menu, and nice staff make it an easy place to hang out. I have to echo what most are saying about the creamy polenta- it is DELICIOUS.  As is the broccoli rabe, and the meatballs, which taste like they were made with love, which makes sense, considering the recipe belongs to the mother of the owner of the place.  We've already been back several times and have every intention of making it one of our regular spots!",5.0

"I used to come to this place all the time when it was ""Wombat""- another restaurant. So I was a little wary of what it would turn into after it re-opened. I was turned off at first by the way the menu was layed out (One bite, two bites, etc...) I thought ""$12 for two bites of food seems ridiculous.."" Don't worry, the portions are fair sizes for the price. I ordered the polenta with spicy sausage. It was so good. Very creamy, hearty and comforting. Not *too* spicy (could've been spicier) but the sausage and gravy had a wonderful rich flavor. Since they are new, they gave me Papas Brava on the house (fried potatoes with mayo and siracha) Also really good. Just the right about of salt and not mushy which they easily could have been. Good wine too. The menu is very meat heavy (bone marrow, veal sausages, meat balls) but apparently the broccoli rabe is supposed to be wonderful. They give you a lil bowl of pickled veggies before the meal rather than bread which I thought was a nice touch. They were yummy. There were slices of pickled garlic in there that were so good. Gotta try and pickle me some garlic. Anyway, all in all friendly people. Really good food. A fine addition to the neighborhood. I will be back. Often.",4.0

"Came here on a date last weekend because I had heard such great things and it definitely exceeded my expectations! We started with some oysters which were delicious! Then we shared the broccoli rabe, polenta, and deep fried artichokes. First of all the broccoli rabe could get even the worst eater to eat their veggies. And deep fried artichokes... need I say more? Not to mention they are served with a delicious aioli. The polenta stole the show though, probably the best thing I have ever tasted. It is creamy and full of flavor. It is topped with a great sauce and little meatballs. As if the food isn't good enough to keep me coming back again and again, the owners have to be two of the sweetest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. They even sent my date and out a great butternut squash and brown sugar crostini, it was the perfect end to a great dinner.

"Came here on a date last weekend because I had heard such great things and it definitely exceeded my expectations! We started with some oysters which were delicious! Then we shared the broccoli rabe, polenta, and deep fried artichokes. First of all the broccoli rabe could get even the worst eater to eat their veggies. And deep fried artichokes... need I say more? Not to mention they are served with a delicious aioli. The polenta stole the show though, probably the best thing I have ever tasted. It is creamy and full of flavor. It is topped with a great sauce and little meatballs. As if the food isn't good enough to keep me coming back again and again, the owners have to be two of the sweetest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. They even sent my date and out a great butternut squash and brown sugar crostini, it was the perfect end to a great dinner. I have already been back twice since, and found that the wine options are great as well!",5.0
