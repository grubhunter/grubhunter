"The staff was friendly and the pizza was delicious.I came in with a co-worker and we ordered the Tartufo Pizza (Truffle Cream, Gorgonzola, and Mozzarella). The flavors were not too overpowering and surprisingly light! My co-worker ordered a side of red sauce to go with it and it was an excellent choice.Definitely worth checking out.",4.0
"Friendly staff, cozy place, nice neighborhood, really nice food and awesome pizzas! We had a white pizza (i.e. no tomato sauce) and it was super good! The bread and crust was perfect and the toppings fresh and taste. Even the arugula (or rucola, as I'm used to call it in Europe) was crispy and tasty.Staff seated us immediately (no reservation), were very attentive and delivered the food immediately. Overall, a really nice experience - recommended!",4.0
"Excellent pizza! Definitely exceeded our expectations.  The crust was almost perfect and the pizza came out quickly.  Even more surprising was how fantastic the crostini is! I was expecting small, bland toppings on toasted bread but all four varieties were excellent and flavorful (especially the smoked eggplant!).",4.0
"I went on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30p to avoid crowds, and the place was empty. Margherita STG: it was supposed to have mozzarella di bufala and it didn't. The cheese was hard and not milky like it's supposed to be. When confronted, the waiter confirmed it ""was"" mozzarella di bufala. Absurd. Just look at my picture. Dellarocco: it was burnt, above and below. Just look at my picture. Nothing else to say, other that the ingredients weren't fresh, especially the sausage. I have no reason to ever go back. Felt like I was treated like a tourist.",2.0
Best Pizza ever. Love this place in the neighbor. The ingredient is very fresh and perfect size. The crust is amazing. Whatelse you would ask for pizza.,5.0
I can't believe I waited this long to try this spot. One of the few establishments in the neighborhood with truly delicious food. I was here with the b/f last Friday. I ordered the 4 flavor pizza and he ordered the 4 cheese pizza. Both were excellent. I'm excited to go back to have an entire zucchini pizza- SO delicious. Love the atmosphere and the service was on point. Reasonable wine prices. And what really puts the cherry on top is that the homemade tiramisu is made with mascarpone-as it should be- and it actually came dangerously close to my mother's. This will be a new date night destination. If you are in the neighborhood you have to eat here!,5.0
"I love pizza. I will eat pretty much any pizza, even frozen pizza is edible in my book.How unbelievably happy I was to discover Dellarocco's and it's a block away from my apartment. I ordered delivery ffrom them a couple of times and was like ""wow, this is good pizza"". Last week, I finally went with my daughter to celebrate an occasion and ate at the restaurant. It is a comfortable space, with very attentive servers. We ordered the Tartufo pizza which has mozzarella, Gorgonzola, shiitake mushrooms and truffle cream. We were both in heaven and vowed it was the only pizza we would ever eat again. The other notable menu item is the eggplant parm...it;s like no other -- truly the best I have ever eaten. We took what was left over, which was not much, and ate it cold the next day. It was that good.",5.0
"This is a great little pizzeria in downtown Brooklyn. I had the pie with prosciutto and arugula and you pretty much cant go wrong with that. I also started off with the meatballs. Great spot, great service and the pies came super fast.",5.0
"Love this place! The pizzas are absolutely delicious, best pizza in Brooklyn Heights. Great staff too!",5.0
I had a really good lunch here today. I started off with the spinach and goat cheese salad. My bf ordered the meatballs. Both were amazing and were much bigger than we were picturing because we weren't very hungry for our pizza. We ended up getting the four cheese pizza and overall that was good as well. I would have been full and happy with just the appetizers. Would definitely eat here again.,4.0
Been here a couple of times with the wife and kids. Pizza is seriously crazy good! Just like in Italy. Thin crust and imaginative delicious toppings. We loved everything we tried.Plus they are so incredibly family friendly. They were very courteous and accommodating as our two boys created one mini disaster after another.,5.0

"Visited Dellarocco's last after a brisk walk through Dumbo and BK Heights.  What's better on a cold night than some brick oven pizza?  This trip we started off with the same salad as before - Spinaci (spinach, goat cheese, mango cubes, pistachios and balsamic vinaigrette).  It's still $10 and still a fantastic salad.Next up The Salsiccia 'Red Pizza'.  Yeah yeah it's the same pizza I ordered the last time I went but why mess with something that's so good!?After we finished the delicious sausage pie, Hubs looked around the crowded dining room, and over at the table next to ours and said ""wanna order another pie?""  Pshh yeah I do.  For our 2nd we ordered up the Four Cheese option.  I told you in my first review I'd be back for a 'White Pizza'... it took me a couple months to get back but it was so worth the wait.  The Four Cheese is fantastic.  Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Provolone, Parmigiano and a dash of basil ($13).  Despite it not having any sauce it was so creamy, and this cheese combo was crazy good.  It was a little nutty but salty, and had a kick to it.  Crust was great, a little chewy but thin.  Hubs commented that the pizza wasn't heavy.  Our whole meal was really light - and we left with happy bellies.   Such a good meal!  Great service & atmosphere too. One of my new fav pizza spots in NYC, I'm totally loving Dellarocco's!",5.0
We were here for the Photoville exhibit and were hungirily looking for a nice place to eat. We got the margherita and Siciliana pizzas. The margaherita was not as good as I have had before but good nonetheless. I really like the Siciliana pizaa which my mom got. Will def go back if we are in the area.,4.0
"Cary C. took me here during my birthday week to celebrate. We got the gluten free White Pesto pizza to share. The portions were tiny but full of flavor; we debated getting another pie but opted to share dessert instead. Dessert was meh so I wasn't too thrilled w/ it.Dellarocco's interior design is really airy and spacious with generous gaps between tables to move around. We we seated near the ovens so it was very warm during our meal- an overhead fan might be a good idea to install near the kitchen. Bathrooms were clean and sufficient.Pizza was really delicious but super $$$ for the size. Brooklyn really has gone the way of the 1%.

I loved watching the pizza coming out while waiting for my food!The pizzas are on the smaller side so we got a few to share, plus the caprese appetizer, which was fresh and delicious. My favorite was the veggie pizza but the classic cheese was great, as well. I also enjoyed the Nutella dessert pizza at the end!The service was wonderful, as was the food. It's a little on the pricier side but that's to be expected for the quality, so I'll definitely be back to treat myself!",5.0
"It's a nice pizza, but not a great value, clearly geared towards the tourist crowd. The pizzas are thin crust and relatively small. Over three visits, the pizzas have been generally good but a little uneven. A little burnt one time, a little undersauced another time. Nothing major, but the kind of little things that keep you from making it a regular spot, particularly for the price. The meatball appetizer is divine but again pricey for what you get.",3.0

"Fact: I love Dellarocco's personal Neapolitan-style pies!Well maybe they aren't technically personal pies but I eat them as such... and I kind of hate sharing pies that are less than 16 inches in diameter. I've gotten into a horrible/amazing habit of going here after my long runs and just devouring one of their delectable pizza creations within 10 minutes. Oops.Just check out their menu and you will see that they have a pizza for everyone with an assortment of red pies as well as an impressive assortment of white pies. I always get the Arrabbiata pizza which comes with mozzarella, hot soppressata, fresh basil and spicy extra virgin olive oil. It's got a small kick which really just warms you up all over and tingles your lips. It really hits the spot.They also have some great appetizers (hello juicy meatballs!) and Brooklyn Brewery beers on tap plus a good assortment of wine. It's supposed to be a pizzeria and wine bar. Great hybrid. The space is also pretty casual nice (they combined two shops so there's ample space for groups of any size) and it is kid friendly. Management is great.Dellarocco's is definitely my new favorite pizza spot and a wonderful addition to the Brooklyn Heights hood! Go check it out!",4.0

Great pizza (every option sounded amazing) & loved the refreshing Avocado salad.

"My friends came here for lunch quite often during the school year and this place is great for accommodating large groups. The waiters are always nice, I remember earlier this year there was one that cracked jokes with us and was really fun to talk to. The margarita pizza and the Calzone Bianco are a little bland but it's good to tie you over for the day. Also, to be honest, I have a little bit of a crush on one of the current waiter.",4.0
"Perfectly lovely spot no matter the occasion.Very  impressive in all respects, from service to food to atmosphere. Pizza is delicious, and each time we've visited we've had to order an additional pie because we can't get enough. Despite the close proximity of the tables there have never been any claustrophobia or intrusions.Service is efficient and friendly.Quickly becoming a favorite.",4.0
"Good tasting pizza, of the ""artisanal"" kind and portions are perfect. But a little pricey!",3.0
"Excellent and apparently not very known by tourists, or perhaps it gets much more full in the evenings (I went for lunch with some friends who were visiting the city).Just great pizza. Good service, beautiful establishment.I want to come back to try all the vegetarian options both in appetizers as in pizzas.It's not inexpensive but very worth it.",4.0
"Wandering the oh so lovely streets of Brooklyn Heights one easily becomes famished. With nothing particular in mind redefined to stop in here after seeing the favorable reviews.  Good choice us! The pizza here is good, tasty and definitely worth a return visit. We had a traditional Margherita and a cheese-less Marinara , mmm , mmm.. On par with Motorino and the like.The space is pretty spacious and family friendly, what I expected from this neighborhood.Thumbs up on the pizza for this hungry girl.",4.0
"Fact: I love Dellarocco's personal Neapolitan-style pies!Well maybe they aren't technically personal pies but I eat them as such... and I kind of hate sharing pies that are less than 16 inches in diameter. I've gotten into a horrible/amazing habit of going here after my long runs and just devouring one of their delectable pizza creations within 10 minutes. Oops.Just check out their menu and you will see that they have a pizza for everyone with an assortment of red pies as well as an impressive assortment of white pies. I always get the Arrabbiata pizza which comes with mozzarella, hot soppressata, fresh basil and spicy extra virgin olive oil. It's got a small kick which really just warms you up all over and tingles your lips. It really hits the spot.They also have some great appetizers (hello juicy meatballs!) and Brooklyn Brewery beers on tap plus a good assortment of wine. It's supposed to be a pizzeria and wine bar. Great hybrid. The space is also pretty casual nice (they combined two shops so there's ample space for groups of any size) and it is kid friendly. Management is great.Dellarocco's is definitely my new favorite pizza spot and a wonderful addition to the Brooklyn Heights hood! Go check it out!",4.0
"Was initially planning on eating at Fornino close by on Pier 6 because their Yelp page said they were open.. They were not. Grr..Their website says each locations specific hours but they should clear that up on Yelp too, right? Luckily it was a nice day by the water. :D Well, to our rescue, Dellaroccos was a nice alternative. Bright, clean, & friendly. Great pizza (every option sounded amazing) & loved the refreshing Avocado salad. It was a nice lunch alternative to our main plan of sitting outside on Fornino rooftop because really our main focus was just eating good PIZZUHH!",4.0

"Nice pizzeria with great bar.  Although we were told they were individual, personal sized, the pizzas are large enough for 2 people to share.  The capricciosa pizza was our favorite.  We also ordered two salads to share-the avocado and spinach salads.  The dressing on the salad was too lemony which overwhelmed the greens and toppings.  The avocado was also under ripe.  Other than that, the ingredients were all fresh and the pizzas were very good.  Service was excellent with very attentive waiters who came around several times to refill our drinks.",3.0
Delicious eggplant parmesan (probably one of the best I have had) and pizza and great option for lunch in the area. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is pretty. Fun watching the guys in the back making the pizzas in the brick oven and I would highly recommend for a sit down brunch in the area.,5.0
One the expensive side for Pizza and portions are small.  Food is overall good.  Fresh ingredients and nice selection.  Place is also pleasant.  Please note if you order a calzone or meatballs ask for sauce - and extra sauce.  They give the smallest amount - and if you order delivery ask for two or three containers of sauce  - they are very small.  Which doesn't make sense considering it cost very little to make a red sauce.,3.0
"Great new addition to Brooklyn Heights...gorgeous space, awesome service (I can only speak to dine-in, not delivery), and really fresh brick oven pizzas. I had the Marinara pizza because that's what my date preferred, but I can't wait to try the Vongole white pizza!",4.0
"Dellarocco's is in the cutest and most quaint part of Brooklyn Heights, right by the park and three floor walk-ups. It is the perfect spot for either a first date or a family get-together. I've seen a lot of young families dining at Dellarocco's and I think it's a direct reflection of the neighborhood's demographics. And although the restaurant is just a few streets away from Court Street, it is on Montague Street, a particularly residential and quiet area. The restaurant staff is attentive and very sweet. They do not come by the table every 5 minutes, but they always seem to know when they are needed. I am in love with their bread. They make the bread on premises, and I think they infuse a little bit of olive oil and pepper into the bread while baking, so the end-result is absolute perfection! My boyfriend and I are in love with their meatball appetizer. One order comes with 4 decent-sized meatballs, drowning in a savory red sauce. It is nothing like we have ever eaten, and trust me, we have been through our share of meatballs, including the many Italian and meatball specialty restaurants scattered all over NYC. We had the Capricciosa. It was a bit salty for our liking. The artichoke hearts, olives, and prosciutto cotto (which looked and tasted a lot like thick Canadian bacon) resulted in a very salty pizza. We had to sift through some of the key ingredients to make a less salty, more tolerable pie. I do not recommend this certain pie, but the Brigante and Salsiccia are amazing!",4.0
"I've never actually eaten in Dellarocco's but have ordered delivery and take out from them many times. I currently work on a construction site down by the water and they've been very accomdating with regards to delivering. I just had to explain the situation to them once (""Hey we're under the BQE in a trailer compound"") and have had no problem since. The food always comes at the perfect temperature. Now for the food:Crostini: I was quite disappointed. The crostini arrived all crushed together. No big deal, I can understand that things happen in transit. But the toppings on each I found to be saltier than I expected or enjoyed. This was the only thing I've ordered from them I wasn't satisfied with.Wood Roasted Vegetables: This was delicious and a huge portion. The dish consisted of eggplant, peppers, onions and some squash or zucchini all lightly seasoned and a nice smokiness to it.Avocado Salad: So good! The salad is incredibly filling and fresh as a salad should be. The components are all balanced: avocado for creaminess, red onion for a fresh kick, orange and tomatoes for sweetness and the dressing for a tart note. The lemon vinaigrette just makes elevates it, one of my absolute favorite things to get.Quattro Gusti Pizza: I like how this is kind of a ""tasting"" of 4 of their pizzas: Margherita STG, Arrabbiata, Zucchini and Dellarocco. This has a bit of everything (tomato, cheese, veg, spice, smokiness) and my go to order.I've also tried their Siciliana, Tartufo and Bresaola pizzas and all were very good.

"I've been won over and plan to keep Dellarocco's in heavy rotation!On my first trip to Dellarocco's my husband and I were in the mood for salad. I ordered the Spinaci and he ordered the Bresola. First impressions are important, and the plating of the salads did not disappoint. The balance of the ingredients in each salad, as well as the dressing distribution, was outstanding. We both cleaned our plates and couldn't decide who had the better salad. These are well thought out dishes and very well executed. We returned and were temped to get salads again, but I was very much in the mood for pizza. I first discovered the restaurant because they serve gluten free pizzas. To me, someone who cannot eat gluten, good pizza is a dearly missed dish. I've been sampling various GF pizza options throughout this end of Brooklyn and I am convinced that Dellarocco's has the best GF crust! I was hesitant to order because of the $4 extra charge for GF dough, but i will pay it for pizza this good!After much deliberation, we ordered both the Capricciosa (a red sauce pizza) and the Dellorocco (a white pizza). Both pizzas were outstanding. The toppings were evenly distributed, the crust was crispy and crunchy without behind hard, and we were left pleasantly full with some leftovers to take home. My husband, who can eat gluten, agreed this GF dough was great. I can only assume that the traditional crust is delicious! 't had already decided to come back and try other options before we were done eating. Looking around the restaurant, we noticed how delicious the appetizers looked as well. Without a doubt we will be back and bring friends along. The only struggle will be to decide what to order next!",4.0
"Gluten free heaven! I am so happy to have found this place! The place is beautiful, service was friendly and warm, the GF pie was excellent! We chose the arugula and prosciutto.

"Gluten-Free Pizza? Great wine! I love this Place! I was looking for a place near my job that had gluten free pizza.

It no happens, I am not the only one, my boss is as well.I usually get the red pizza with prosciutto on it. I ask for arugula to be added because I like the flavor. AWESOME. The salami and cheese board is great as well. This place is a must when you want some pizza and wine.",5.0

Good wood fired pizza. This is Italian style pizza ie expect some burnt edges & great wood fired taste. The Pesto was really good service as well . The oven floor is not hot enough hence the dough could be stiffer but this is nit picking . I'd do it again.,4.0
"I think I saw this place on Unique Eats our something like that. Then I saw it on yelp and figured I would give it a try. Its in a great trendy neighborhood in Brooklyn Heights near the water so a nice long walk is recommended after eating here! The ambiance itself is a very laid back, small little spot with a trendy looking red brick oven behind the counter.My friend and I split the salami and cheese plate (there was no actual cheese on the plate but still very good). It had three types of prosciutto, these delicious green olives and this awesome foccacia pizza bread...SO delicious! Simple olive oil, sprinkled with sesame seeds and baked to a crispy yet chewy goodness. That alone was good enough for me! Almost filled up on that alone. Finally our pizzas came out. I ordered the 4 cheese white pizza with fontina, mozzarella, gorgonzola and parmigiano. OMG!! It was good, but I'm obsessed with cheese so I could be slightly biased! Each slice had a basil leaf embedded in the gooey goodness which really stood out. My fined ordered the red pizza (can't pronounce actual name and neither could she) with prosciutto, olives, mushrooms, artichokes and mozzarella. Looked amazing but I couldn't taste it as I was focused on my own plate. It makes you realize that Dominos, Pizza Hut, Sbarros and Papa John's are not real pizzas! It's not anywhere as good as the pizza I had in Venice...but close enough from New York. Will go back for the red pizzas next time.",4.0

"My boyfriend and I live just down the street from Dellarocco's, but hadn't given the place a try because I can't eat gluten -- so we typically assume that pizza is not an option for our dinners out (sad face). But after a long walk last weekend, we were famished, and did a quick online search for nearby restaurants where we could stuff our faces. And behold: that pizza joint around the corner has gluten-free crust! We knew we needed to check it out.And boy, are we glad we did. We dined at the bar on a Sunday night, and the place was bustling but not crazy busy. Wines were reasonably priced (we had a great bottle of Cabernet for $32), the appetizers (eggplant parmigiana and grilled veggies) were delicious -- eggplant especially was insanely good. And the pizza...oh my goodness...maybe it's because I rarely eat pizza or any bread-oriented food...but WOW. One week later, and I still think about it. Toppings? Fantastic, fresh, flavorful. Crust? Crispy, delicately flavorful with a nice char and soft chewiness. And, of course, sans gluten. Added bonus: when the bartender overheard that my birthday was the next day, she poured me a free glass of wine. Awwwww. If I had to come up with one knock against 'em, it'd be the weird overhead lighting...once you get settled, it's okay, but this restaurant is just begging for some dim, romantic illumination. Still, we'll be back -- Dellarocco's is the new post-long-walk-face-stuffing joint, and I'm so glad I gave it a try.",4.0
"The food here is really fresh and delectable. Excellent and truly underrated pizza with light doughey crust and flavourful sauce, plus whatever toppings come on each specific pie, amazing salads (spinach and goat cheese with mango and pistashios is my personal favourite), and a decently priced wine list. Desserts are not their strongest suit, but my standard for those is ridiculously high and in any event that's not why I come here. Service is good for the most part. The space itself is light and airy. It's not cheap but one feels that the ingredients and the quality of the food are worth it. Overall it's a good dining choice.",5.0
"After a very long but beautiful day in the Hamptons/Montauk, we ended our day in Brooklyn to catch the sunset and have some pizza. Goodness gracious, parking is overwhelmingly annoying; best of luck trying to get a spot in this neighborhood; took us about 45 minutes, but we did grab a spot less than a block away. It was about 8pm on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. Dellarocco's is very small, trendy but cozy and romantic at the same time. Good menu, good prices; we settled on the arugula salad, margarita red pizza and four cheese white pizza which we added prosciutto to. Wow! Pizza was great. We liked and polished off both pizzas entirely but our favorite of the night was the margarita. It was fabulous. A very very cute spot in Brooklyn Heights, friendly service and good pizza with fresh ingredients. This was my first time in Brooklyn and I highly doubt I'll be back, but if I should ever head back to this area, I would definitely come back here for pizza.",4.0

"We had an errand to run in DUMBO and decided to Yelp some nearby restos for a quick, casual bite around 5:30pm on a Saturday. Lo and behold, Brooklyn Heights had the answer. In a neighborhood that's a wasteland for good restaurants, this place especially stands out. Nice, simple decor with giant street windows, plenty of tables and a bar with an open kitchen (but no heavy smells, aside from the alluring baking pizzas).I am gluten free by necessity, and am always game to try a new place that offers gluten free pizza. This place is HANDS-DOWN the best gluten free crust I've had in the city by far. Chewy, slightly singed, and a surprising lack of sogginess after a few minutes, which is the sad downfall of most gf pizza. I kept it basic with a margherita - the sauce was tangy, just right. Mozzarella was fine, nothing special but not a hindrance. $4 extra for the gf crust that tastes almost like a real Neapolitan pizza is a small price to pay.We started with the woodfired veggies - zucchini, garlic, Italian eggplant, and peppers roasted to a slightly charred perfection, with flavorful EVOO. My husband got the Capricciosa regular crust pizza and an Ommegang, both he gave a resounding two thumbs up for the combo of toppings and the appropriately chewy crust.Wait staff was friendly and efficient. As I'm super pregnant, I was thrilled to see the restaurant is really kid-friendly in the late afternoon - this will make returning many, many times much easier for us!",5.0

"loved it! perfect pizza, great dough, not too think, not too thin. tasty sauce. and cooked just right. also, the restaurant actually gives you space to spread out a bit, not like other places that are too cramped. and the waiters do not push you out. I would return.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I live just down the street from Dellarocco's, but hadn't given the place a try because I can't eat gluten -- so we typically assume that pizza is not an option for our dinners out (sad face). But after a long walk last weekend, we were famished, and did a quick online search for nearby restaurants where we could stuff our faces. And behold: that pizza joint around the corner has gluten-free crust! We knew we needed to check it out.And boy, are we glad we did. We dined at the bar on a Sunday night, and the place was bustling but not crazy busy. Wines were reasonably priced (we had a great bottle of Cabernet for $32), the appetizers (eggplant parmigiana and grilled veggies) were delicious -- eggplant especially was insanely good. And the pizza...oh my goodness...maybe it's because I rarely eat pizza or any bread-oriented food...but WOW. One week later, and I still think about it. Toppings? Fantastic, fresh, flavorful. Crust? Crispy, delicately flavorful with a nice char and soft chewiness. And, of course, sans gluten. Added bonus: when the bartender overheard that my birthday was the next day, she poured me a free glass of wine. Awwwww. If I had to come up with one knock against 'em, it'd be the weird overhead lighting...once you get settled, it's okay, but this restaurant is just begging for some dim, romantic illumination. Still, we'll be back -- Dellarocco's is the new post-long-walk-face-stuffing joint, and I'm so glad I gave it a try.",4.0
"The food here is really fresh and delectable. Excellent and truly underrated pizza with light doughey crust and flavourful sauce, plus whatever toppings come on each specific pie, amazing salads (spinach and goat cheese with mango and pistashios is my personal favourite), and a decently priced wine list. Desserts are not their strongest suit, but my standard for those is ridiculously high and in any event that's not why I come here. Service is good for the most part. The space itself is light and airy. It's not cheap but one feels that the ingredients and the quality of the food are worth it. Overall it's a good dining choice.",5.0
"After a very long but beautiful day in the Hamptons/Montauk, we ended our day in Brooklyn to catch the sunset and have some pizza. Goodness gracious, parking is overwhelmingly annoying; best of luck trying to get a spot in this neighborhood; took us about 45 minutes, but we did grab a spot less than a block away. It was about 8pm on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. Dellarocco's is very small, trendy but cozy and romantic at the same time. Good menu, good prices; we settled on the arugula salad, margarita red pizza and four cheese white pizza which we added prosciutto to. Wow! Pizza was great. We liked and polished off both pizzas entirely but our favorite of the night was the margarita. It was fabulous. A very very cute spot in Brooklyn Heights, friendly service and good pizza with fresh ingredients. This was my first time in Brooklyn and I highly doubt I'll be back, but if I should ever head back to this area, I would definitely come back here for pizza.",4.0

"We had an errand to run in DUMBO and decided to Yelp some nearby restos for a quick, casual bite around 5:30pm on a Saturday. Lo and behold, Brooklyn Heights had the answer. In a neighborhood that's a wasteland for good restaurants, this place especially stands out. Nice, simple decor with giant street windows, plenty of tables and a bar with an open kitchen (but no heavy smells, aside from the alluring baking pizzas).I am gluten free by necessity, and am always game to try a new place that offers gluten free pizza. This place is HANDS-DOWN the best gluten free crust I've had in the city by far. Chewy, slightly singed, and a surprising lack of sogginess after a few minutes, which is the sad downfall of most gf pizza. I kept it basic with a margherita - the sauce was tangy, just right. Mozzarella was fine, nothing special but not a hindrance. $4 extra for the gf crust that tastes almost like a real Neapolitan pizza is a small price to pay.We started with the woodfired veggies - zucchini, garlic, Italian eggplant, and peppers roasted to a slightly charred perfection, with flavorful EVOO. My husband got the Capricciosa regular crust pizza and an Ommegang, both he gave a resounding two thumbs up for the combo of toppings and the appropriately chewy crust.Wait staff was friendly and efficient. As I'm super pregnant, I was thrilled to see the restaurant is really kid-friendly in the late afternoon - this will make returning many, many times much easier for us!",5.0
"Phenomenal! Just ordered a gluten- free pizza from them for the first time, having passed by the shop many times.  Funny that we can get gluten- free pizza in the hood, but no gluten free beer for blocks.  Sadly, Dellarocco's says they can't deliver beer....really happy to find such sophisticated gluten free nearby.  And I look forward to having a meal there with friends.",4.0
"This place makes good pizza! I would only dine-in though. I tried to have it to-go one time and it was soggy by the time I made it home. The bruschetta and zucchini pizzas are my favorite. The crust is crispy and thin, but not too thin. It's just right. I've tried most items on the menu and I felt all have been pretty satisfactory. I recommend the tartufo gelato or tiramisu for dessert.The restaurant itself is a cute little place. The staff is also very friendly.",4.0
"The other reviews aren't wrong; lovely service, deliciously thin / foldable pizza (where the only downside is that you might end up eating more than you had intended to), and peroni is on tap (hey I'm from London don't judge).

"This is by far my face local pizza joint (and I leave near GrImaldi's and Juliana's). Delishious pizzas! Really really good! And they do a gluten free crust for the glutards too, which I appreciated. I always get the porcini white pizza but love the buffalo marg too.",5.0

"In a word: Wonderful.I read the other reviews before I went and this place gets reviewed on the pizza. Trust me on this: It's the other stuff you really want to try. Such as the knockout caprese salad, um... on a stick. Or two sticks to be precise. It comes on skewers and there's olive oil should you wish to dip your caprese bits in there. I didn't think it needed it, the tomatoes were bursting with flavor and the cheese was soft and delicate. Perfection.I chased it down with an order of meatballs. Perfect meatballs and I swear I could taste Italian grandmother's tears in them. Four, in a big bowl slathered with red sauce (meatballs, not grandmothers).I had a chat with the staff and it turns out that much of the stuff they use to make your food is honest-to-goodness imported from Italy. Obviously you can't get the fresh stuff anywhere but from local sources but whatever they're doing works very well. They were all eating lunch and trying out new stuff that didn't look like it had made it to the menu yet. Excited to see where they take this place.The decor still has a sparseness about and there's almost that new restaurant smell about the place. It's wonderfully airy, modern, and bright.People love to moan about Brooklyn Heights being a culinary meh-land. Maybe they need to vote with their mouths and start eating at great places like this.",5.0
"From the street, the place looks like a clean and nice place to get pizza. However, our experience was a disaster: the wine was awful, the pizza was made with the same cheap ingredients (i.e. nothing fresh) than your average pizza joint.

We had the Dellarocco pizza (smoked buffalo mozzarella, broccoli di rabe, italian sweet sausage, red pepper, garlic). The pizza is very tasty, but it is definitely not your traditional pizza. The crust is very doughy. I liked it, but personally I prefer a thin, crispy crust. Toppings were...unmemorable. I'm eager to try another pie.",3.0

"I was excited when this place opened since a charming rustic restaurant seemed like a nice addition to the nearby Montague Street strip.It was $14 for a 12"" pie, with artichokes, prosciutto cotta, mushrooms and olives...a little expensive but I figured with the toppings it would be worthy. Not the case...I opened up the box to find a pretty sloppily slopped together pie. Mozzarella covered less than 2/3 of the pie, there were maybe 5 slivers of artichokes on there, a handful of olives, 10 matchstick-sized strips of prosciutto and a few mushrooms. The toppings were so measly and unevenly placed, I was kind of appalled. Plus the bread was a bit chewy.I also ordered their meatball appetizer...for $11 you get just 3 small meatballs that are nothing special. You are better off traveling to the Meatball Shop where you get 4 big meatballs for $7 that are full of flavor and freshness.",2.0
"Brooklyn Heights' rule of culinary mediocrity has a few exceptions, and Dellarocco's is now one of them.  Molto bene!  This is not, repeat, not Brooklyn style pizza.  It's Neapolitan, made by a real life Neapolitan (with a few Mexicans) spinning dough on their fingers and turning out some tasty pies.  Unlike the thin/dense/crisp crust traditional Brooklyn pizza, this is light, doughy, chewy, yeasty, with the occasional wood fired burn blisters.  Very good.  Buffalo mozzarella, high quality oil and meat, and delicious sauce. Bravo!Leave the gun, but take the cannollis.  Delicious mini/cigarette style Neapolitan cannoli.  Ultra crisp shells freshly stuffed with flavored ricotta cheese and sprinkled with nuts.Friendly, efficient service.  I still can't get over a good restaurant in Brooklyn Heights. I'm holding off on five stars until they do something about the unacceptably high noise level. I went late and it was only 2/3 full, but between the music and the customers conversing/shouting, and the blonde wood on the ceiling and everywhere else, it's quite loud.  Can't wait to try the good looking salads and calzones.",4.0
The five star review is for their GLUTEN FREE pizza.  I've been trying a bunch of different places in the city and this is by far the best GF pizza I've had so far.  Tastes like normal pizza!  My husband happily eats it and he isn't avoiding gluten.  Also really liked the meatball appetizer.  Great option if you're in the neighborhood and don't want the regular Montague Street choices.,5.0
"The pizza is solid.  While you can get much better within a half mile walk, this place is respectable for dine-in.The reason I give it 3 stars instead of 4 is the horrendous delivery/pickup options.  Oddest deliver hours ever (like no delivery before 5pm on a weekend - including football Sundays) and even worse, borderline impossible to order over the phone.  I believe out of 6 attempts to get delivery I have been successful once and even that order took about 5 phone calls back and forth to get everything squared away.  If this place is going to hog most of the sidewalk with 4+ bicycles it would be wise for them to USE them to actually deliver their product.Eat in and you will enjoy your night.  But if you're looking for delivered pizza in cold weather when Football is on, look elsewhere.  I would recommend Sosta.",3.0

I really appreciated that it was nice and cool inside despite being 90 degrees outside, a packed house and a wood burning pizza oven in the back.  All the food I tried was good and the staff was great.  The draft list was right up my alley with Peroni, #9, Six Point, Brooklyn Brewery beers, and a few others.I can't wait to come back and check it out after the official opening.",5.0

"My wife and I visit Delarocco's on what turned out to be their opening night. We had long patronized the card shop that was in this space previously and, although we were sad that the card store left after nearly 30 years in business we were excited when we saw the location was turning into a new eatery.We shared a pizza - the Arrabbiat which we had with basil added to it and it was delicious. The pie was cut into four pieces so we each had two and the meal was very satisfying. The pizza was of course hot from their wood fired brick oven and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. We also each enjoyed a glass of red wine.The only down side was there was only one white and one red wine offered by the glass. I found this surprising as they have a bar and I would expect people want a variety of wines available at the bar. The service was also a little slow when I first arrived but I'm guessing it was growing pains being that it was their first night of operation.Delarocco's is a short walk from where my wife and i live and we will definitely return.

"This is a nice addition to the neighborhood. i got the Capricciossa. The crust was very bubbly and a little too charred for my liking, however, it was nice and doughy. The meat itself was a little too heavy for my liking and I don't think I would order this pizza again (it was the server's suggestion). While the quality of the pizza is pretty good, there is something about the esthetic of the restaurant that is missing...it's like they haven't finished decorating. The walls are pretty barren and the decorations are very minimal to none. There was a decent crowd on a Wednesday night though. Before I began my meal, I was wondering whether this place would be a serious challenger for my favorite pizza place (Sottocasa, which is 10 minutes away) but it's definitely not. Sottocasa is still #1 in my books, but Dellarocco' s will have to do for nights that I don't want to leave Montague St.",3.0
Dellarocco's is a great pizza place with a pleasant ambiance and delicious pizza.  Finding good gluten-free places is a difficult task even in Brooklyn and NYC.  Finding the spot harkens me back to the days when I was not on a gluten-free diet.  You can barely taste the difference in a gluten-free pizza compared to a non-gluten free pizza!  My non-gluten free husband even thinks the gluten free pizza is outstanding.  The margarita simple yet divine is a great choice for those that want a great no frills option.  It's in a great area of Brooklyn heights in which you can look around and shop while you wait for a seat.  Definitely worth trying for all those GF-ers out there!,4.0
"So fabulous! The food was divine. With an amazing arugula salad, eggplant parm appetizer, and prosciutto and arugula pizza my two friends and I were content! That was perfect for a midsize lunch and the location and ambiance was so cute. Would recommend to anyone coming to new york",5.0
"Wonderful food. Really!  I don't think it's necessarily a ""foodie"" place but for the rest of us, every dish and every pizza I've had there has been delicious. The menu is medium/small which is a good thing because they don't try to make everything: they just try to make everything very well!  The price point is perfect.  My one complaint and I actually think this is preventing them from being a destination restaurant: The absolute WORST lighting.  The place is totally uninviting from the outside; you could easily walk by without seeing it. If you do see it, it's lit like a down-and-out bodega. once inside, you wonder why it's so dim, but not in a warm flattering way but in a: ""we're losing business and closing soon"" way.  I've never been in a place with creepier, weirder, more unpleasant lighting!  Fix it you guys!  Install 6 sconces on the side walls.  Your light is on the blue side; designers know it should be in the red/orange/amber family. Put in some orange or amber floor lamps. It's otherwise a great restaurant.",4.0
Delicious and quick to order. Crust is perfectly baked. Service is very friendly and prices are reasonable. Only downside is the lack of a delivery option.,5.0
"I walked in this place not expecting much, don't get me wrong it's pretty, nice decor, me and my friend ordered two separate pies that they have fancy names for, the pizza came and WOW!!!...awesome, five star pizza, love their toppings, sliced right at the moment, the pizza is super fresh, right out of the oven....Love the white pizza with speck and mine with olives....This place has taken pizza to another level, ......Salads are great, ...Place isn't cheap but believe me a good pie",5.0
"Tara was our waitress and she was great and very sweet. My mother and I shared a salad, it was huge and tasty! We also shared the bruschetta pizza-YUM!

"Since Dellarocco's arrival to the Heights, we've wanted to check it out, and last weekend we finally did. I really enjoyed their arriabiatta pizza as well as their white pizza with fennel sausage.

"This is a nice addition to the neighborhood. i got the Capricciossa. The crust was very bubbly and a little too charred for my liking, however, it was nice and doughy. The meat itself was a little too heavy for my liking and I don't think I would order this pizza again (it was the server's suggestion). While the quality of the pizza is pretty good, there is something about the esthetic of the restaurant that is missing...it's like they haven't finished decorating. The walls are pretty barren and the decorations are very minimal to none. There was a decent crowd on a Wednesday night though. Before I began my meal, I was wondering whether this place would be a serious challenger for my favorite pizza place (Sottocasa, which is 10 minutes away) but it's definitely not. Sottocasa is still #1 in my books, but Dellarocco' s will have to do for nights that I don't want to leave Montague St.",3.0
Dellarocco's is a great pizza place with a pleasant ambiance and delicious pizza.  Finding good gluten-free places is a difficult task even in Brooklyn and NYC.  Finding the spot harkens me back to the days when I was not on a gluten-free diet.  You can barely taste the difference in a gluten-free pizza compared to a non-gluten free pizza!  My non-gluten free husband even thinks the gluten free pizza is outstanding.  The margarita simple yet divine is a great choice for those that want a great no frills option.  It's in a great area of Brooklyn heights in which you can look around and shop while you wait for a seat.  Definitely worth trying for all those GF-ers out there!,4.0
"So fabulous! The food was divine. With an amazing arugula salad, eggplant parm appetizer, and prosciutto and arugula pizza my two friends and I were content! That was perfect for a midsize lunch and the location and ambiance was so cute. Would recommend to anyone coming to new york",5.0
"Wonderful food. Really!  I don't think it's necessarily a ""foodie"" place but for the rest of us, every dish and every pizza I've had there has been delicious. The menu is medium/small which is a good thing because they don't try to make everything: they just try to make everything very well!  The price point is perfect.

The skill level of the cooking staff is uneven, sometimes resulting in very good pizza, sometimes in a sloppy mess. But they are still new.

"Let me start with the good. Its a beautiful room; light filled, airy, austere but not cold. The waiter was excellent; quick and accommodating.

I don't expect everything to be Grimaldi's or DiFara's, but the arrival a new pizza place brings with it a hope for something authentic, tasty, and expertly executed. Pizza places in this town (and the foodies that sample them) are as pervasive as banks and drug stores. If you're going to open one, then please be sure to knock my socks off or at least serve something solid. The crust was limp and doughy; Neapolitan pizza should be thin crusted and crisp.

"This place was a total let down. We sat at the bar last Friday night and ordered a salad to share (spinach, goat cheese mango)- it was delicious, so we were excited for the pizzas... They were awful. I had the Margherita STG, and my husband had the Arrabbiata. ""Soggy"" doesn't quite explain it- it was almost soaking wet. We both ate half because we were starving, and let the bartender know that we didn't like our meals. The owners had been standing next to us and could clearly see that we were unhappy and then we watched the bartender explain the situation to them.

"Dellarocco's is a great addition to the neighborhood. It offers the pizza lover another variety of pizza that previously wasn't here. Although pricier than other pizza places in the area, it is way more than a pizzeria. It offers a great mix of appetizers, wood oven pizzas, desserts and a variety of beers.",5.0
"Great Pizza!  The flavors are to die for!  Staff very freindly.  I have to say, I noticed some staff eating behind the bar near the oven...not a fan of that.  Another small thing...  For some odd reason the menu does not list meat pizza's, I actually had to ask if they make pizza with meat on it.  It's $4 extra.  If I had not of asked I would not have known they serve meat on their pizza.  The sausage is a party in your mouth!  One more small thing..the water is served room temp. in wine bottles.  I'm a fan of water and ice, sorry.  Besides all that, it's my new favorite place!!",4.0
"Good pizza, but not so good for delivery. It has a nice char on the outside crust, but otherwise quite soggy.  i imagine if you ate it in the restaurant if would be better.",3.0
"$18 for a 4 slice pizza with sopressatta and mushrooms? And a bit soggy too. No thank you, I'll stick to Fascati and My Little Pizzeria",2.0
"Hot pizza+ceramic plate = soggy crust. Every time. Too bad, because the pizza itself is decent, especially the simple margherita. (not great, but pretty good) There's a reason every decent pizzeria uses metal platters - they keep the crust crispy. These folks apparently don't understand physics, so the effort spent in putting in a wood burning oven is undercut by the moronic plating. The skill level of the cooking staff is uneven, sometimes resulting in very good pizza, sometimes in a sloppy mess. But they are still new. They also don't understand wine, but happily there's a decent beer selection. They do understand salads-they're all very good, if rather overpriced. Overall, this is a pleasant place that could be much, much better if they paid more attention to the details.",3.0
"Let me start with the good. Its a beautiful room; light filled, airy, austere but not cold. The waiter was excellent; quick and accommodating. I had to send my montepulciano back; it tasted like it had been open for a few days. Now for the pizza - For the neighborhood, its relatively inexpensive and OK, but its definitely no great shakes. I don't expect everything to be Grimaldi's or DiFara's, but the arrival a new pizza place brings with it a hope for something authentic, tasty, and expertly executed. Pizza places in this town (and the foodies that sample them) are as pervasive as banks and drug stores. If you're going to open one, then please be sure to knock my socks off or at least serve something solid. The crust was limp and doughy; Neapolitan pizza should be thin crusted and crisp. The toppings were pleasantly simple (I had the STG), but it would be nice to have the choice of adding some toppings. So, was it terrible? Definitely not. But I wouldn't rush back either.",3.0

Very good pizza!  Amazing crust!!!,4.0
Great addition to the hood.  Not a slice joint. More of a casual date kind of place. Their oven isn't very impressive to look at but they turn out good pizza.,5.0
"This place was a total let down. We sat at the bar last Friday night and ordered a salad to share (spinach, goat cheese mango)- it was delicious, so we were excited for the pizzas... They were awful. I had the Margherita STG, and my husband had the Arrabbiata. ""Soggy"" doesn't quite explain it- it was almost soaking wet. We both ate half because we were starving, and let the bartender know that we didn't like our meals. The owners had been standing next to us and could clearly see that we were unhappy and then we watched the bartender explain the situation to them. They offered us dessert, but we honestly just wanted to get out of there. It was a little unsettling that at a new place the owners wouldn't want to address the problem.

"The pizzas we ordered had very good crusts: chewy, slightly smokey and not very thick.   The toppings offered are, for the most part, vegetarian friendly. While one pie is probably enough for two not very hungry people when coupled with an appetizer,  why deprive yourself? We had three pies and one appetizer for three people and finished every bit.  The caprese skewers were plenty big enough for three people.  Wonderful texture, but a bit bland.  Our pizzas were the margherita, the arrabiata and the four cheese.  My favorite was the four cheese as it was very strong and pungent.  The arrabiata was not as spicy as I would have liked nor did it have enough soppresata, but it was also quite good.  The margherita was ho-hum, not that special.  Try the spectacular tartufo!  The tiramisu: eh.  I like Lassen & Hennigs much better.  Its creamier and sweeter.  I will definitely go back to Dellarocco's.  A very nice addition to Brooklyn Heights.",4.0
A nice cozy place in Brooklyn Heights. I had an excellent pizza from a wood burning oven and a great argula salad which included shaved Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Friendly staff! Enjoy it after a walk on the Promenade!,5.0
"We LOVE this place.  Fantastic pizza.  Best crust we've had--a little crispy, a little chewy.  The sauce is totally amazing.  GREAT salads and roasted vegetable plate.  And the people working there are really lovely.  We desperately needed a place like this in the neighborhood and we are thrilled!",5.0
