"1.5 hour wait. But on the bright side, they had a great queue system where you receive a text and get real-time updates on their web portal for how much longer you have. We went to a bar down the street to kill time.When we finally got seated, the ambiance was nice but loud. This is definitely one of those ""will need to yell"" type environments. I got the gruyere schpätzle and venison sausage over red cabbage. The schpätzle was a little too cheesy for my taste. On the other hand, the sausage and cabbage came in a pretty healthy portion which I ended up using as lunch the next day. The aroma was intense, but the flavor was still bomb the following afternoon.If I'm ever back in the Carroll Gardens area, I wouldn't mind giving them another shot.",4.0
3.5 stars. Once again a case of my disappearing Yelp reviews so rather than wasting time rewriting will cut to the chase.  In my original review from when Prime Meats first opened (and was half its current size) I would have given 5 stars alone for their biscuit egg sandwich.  The biscuit was insanely big (size of a bagel) and would keep you filled for a day. Over the years the biscuit got smaller and smaller and smaller to the point I wouldn't recommend.  We actualltThat is the problem with their whole brunch menu. Portions are just too small. To top it off the Bloody Mary is an insane $14 and nothing special. We got the hash dish which was quite good but tiny and the gravy biscuit and eggs had clearly been sitting in kitchen for a while (see image).As for dinner it is fine but not amazing.  The wife loves their burger but for price there are better options out there. Sorry last review was way longer and more concise.,3.0
"Came here for dinner with a group of four.It's a big and noisy space but still manages to maintain a cozy atmosphere. Loved the decor and big skylight in the back room. Between the four of us we covered some solid ground on the menu. We started with the charred octopus which was perfect - a solid portion of meat full of flavor. I had the Amish chicken special (apparently an old menu item that they were excited to bring back for a night). Chicken was perfectly cooked.  Our group also tried the steak frites, the burger and the kale salad. Everyone left a member of the clean plate club. Always a good sign. Our waiter made excellent wine and beer recommendations based on what each of us were craving - next time we'll try the cocktails!",4.0
"I've always heard such amazing reviews of Prime Meats so I came here for dinner with a couple of friends. It's a German style restaurant/bar with nice wooden decor. We were seated right away and our waiter quickly came over with menus. Slight issue with our waiter. His accent was super thick and truly hard to understand what he was saying. E.G. he was telling us about this amazing ribs special and we were at the point of ordering it. One of us replied back something about the ribs, it took us about 5 minutes to realize he was saying shrimp. It would have sucked if we did order it because we don't eat shrimp. Ordered a bunch of dishes.. And all of them, seriously, all of them were so very fabulous. I was amazed at the burger I ordered. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. So juicy and full of flavor. The steak too, was ah-mazing. I absolutely enjoyed the vibe at the restaurant and the food was top notch. A couple of tweaks and they could definitely get 5 stars.",3.0
"I've been here a few times with my family and have never been disappointed. Yes, it's on the pricey side, but the experience is unique. The place itself is intriguing. Upon entering, you are greeted with a nice woody smell. The ceilings look like they have been preserved from when the place used to be a speakeasy. In the back, there is a nice natural light that comes in to the room. The waiters are also very nice and wear a cool uniform.I ordered the farmers breakfast and my dad had the biscuits and gravy with a side of the cheese grits. I was a little skeptical about ordering the breakfast, since past reviews were hungry and disappointed by the taste. My toast was a little burnt and unconventional, but it went perfectly well once dipped into the egg yolk. The bacon was thick cut and flavorful. My favorite was the sausage, which was sweet and had a lot of sage. My dad loved the cheese grits and his meal. We came here hungry for breakfast at 830 since no other amazing place was open for breakfast. No crowds or wait time. Just locals with their kids.",4.0
"My entire family has been loyal patrons for years . My sister and I meet monthly for our ""cheeseburger and glass of wine treat"". We brought a party of 7 in this Sunday for brunch. We had to wait  15 minutes for our drinks, then a 40 minute wait for our food. I figured it was late in the day so maybe they were busy. I've worked in the restaurant business and some days it just happens.        Our meals arrive and they are stone cold. I ask our waiter to address the issue and he takes away half the peoples plates, not everyone. A different waiter returns with Luke warm food , but it is all  cooked, raw to rare, not medium as we ordered. I was really disappointed. We will probably give it another chance, but I drive into Brooklyn from Eastern Long Island and this has always been a family favorite. Well, there are a ton of other cheeseburgers to be eaten in other restaurants.",2.0

"So it's been nearly five years since I first came into Prime Meats, and didn't order any prime meats. Since that day, I've rectified that mistake many times over, much to my wife's chagrin.*Today, however, I would like to simply tell you that you should come eat here...if, and only if you are OK with spending too much money on food and cocktails, as long as said food and cocktails are very, very good. Brunch is excellent. The Wagyu tartare is beautiful. The burger is Creekstone beef, and they treat it properly. Yes, $18 is entirely too much to pay for a burger (especially since it doesn't even come with bacon and cheese, each a $2 surcharge). But there aren't too many burgers that I would definitively call better than this one. I have also eaten the fries out of the crack in the table (I regret nothing), if that tells you anything.I would love to tell you that the $142 Dry-Aged Côte De Boeuf for 2 is also worth the expense, but I really find it pretty hard to drop that on a piece of meat. If you don't agree, I'll happily share it with you. _______________*She is not as much of a meat-eater as I am, and occasionally worries about unimportant details such as health, and living past your forties.",4.0
"Came here for a brunch for a post-bouldering meal with my bf. I ordered the steak and sunny-side up eggs and my bf ordered the platter which included two sunny-side up eggs, homemade sausages, and bacon. Of course, he had to order the extra side of bacon. Unfortunately the bacon was too cooked and it wasn't crispy or crunchy and didn't have much flavor left. I really liked the steak and eggs, but the steak was a small piece, but it was tender enough, had great flavor because of the chimichurri. The homemade fries which were actually cut up potatoes were good because of the herbs and butter. We also ordered the brunch punch, which was actually served in the old school punch cups, it was very smooth and tasty. I do want to come back and try their steak frites, in pictures it looks amazing.",3.0
"I stopped into Prime Meats on day while trying to pass the time while waiting for my table at Buttermilk Channel. And let me tell you, what a good choice. I was suffering from a severe hangover and needed something to cure my pain. The bartender was very knowledgeable and knew how to make a delicious drink. While sitting at the bar I watched the bartender create a rather large batch of their punch. He definitely knew what he was doing. I needed something to nosh on to help the cause. I ended up ordering a pretzel, great choice. Great exterior texture, soft and warm on the inside.

"I honestly cannot think of a single bad part of my experience at Prime Meats. I came here on a Friday afternoon on an unseasonably warm day off. Thankfully, even in October, they had their sidewalk seating available.I'm going to apologize in advance for the following pun, but let's get to the meat of the review - the food.I had read that PM actually has a great lunch menu, and that was definitely the case. I ordered their signature Prime Meats burger, which was a half pound of black angus on a sesame roll and a side of delicious fries. As always, I went with medium rare. It came a little closer to the medium side, but it was still amazingly delicious.If you like thick, juicy burgers, then you'll enjoy the Prime Meats burger. There are only so many descriptors that you can use for burgers before you start repeating yourself. But this was one of my favorite. Probably top 10 in NYC (and I've had some great burgers in my time). The patty was at least half an inch thick and the sesame bun was fluffy. Basically, if I could unhinge my jaw like a snake to eat this burger, I would have. But for us humans, it's still very manageable if you have an appetite.You can add thick cut bacon for $2 (you'd be a fool not to at that price), which I did. I asked for it on the side, which they gladly accommodated. The bacon is a bit on the salty side, so I did end up putting them on the burger for some more texture and meaty  flavor.Wonderful staff. Super friendly waitstaff and hostess. Even though I was sitting outside, they made sure to check on me and kept my water glass full.Hope to be back for dinner soon!",5.0

"Three years ago, just before Brooklyn became the playground for the rich that it is today, a handful of restaurants and bars opened that would eventually define what modern Brooklyn style is. Prime Meats is one of them.  Grim. Cozy. Wooden. With a touch of magic and the best steak frites in the city, Prime Meats has a lot of things going for it.The dark side of Brooklyn style, particularly when it comes to restaurants, is the often-aloof attitude that comes along with it. For the most part, Prime Meats is no exception, though our server did a fantastic job of juggling many elements that had gone awry beyond his control, such as: an extraordinary wait time for a cocktail (compensated by a bit of humor), a lengthy delay for food, (40+ min, compensated by a complimentary fresh pretzel while we waited). Another X factor to consider when choosing Prime Meats is the potluck of table selection. You'll either end up tucked away in a warm little corner or crammed shoulder to shoulder with a table full of lively locals. In other words, you're certain to have fun regardless of where you're seated, but your chances of romance hang in the balance.Is Prime Meats, worth the risks? The wait times? The aloof service? With food this good, absolutely.",3.0
"Despite having lived nearby for a few years, we visited Prime Meats for the first (and possibly last) time last weekend. My husband and I had heard such wonderful things from friends. And as very carnivorous eaters, we thought it would be a great place for dinner while our parents were in town. Sadly, that was not the case. This was one of the most unapologetically poor and slow dinner services ever!We were seated at 8:30pm and promptly placed orders for a bottle of wine and appetizers (salads), with our entree orders placed shortly thereafter. Around 9:15pm, we still hadn't been served our appetizers. Our server explained that the kitchen was a little backed up. We didn't think much of it. Saturday night in NYC, it happens. Around 9:45pm, our server came by to say our appetizers would be out shortly. They did. Because we were pretty hungry at that point, all of the small plates were devoured pretty quickly. Around 10:15pm, our server returned to update us that the kitchen was still very backed up. We were told that the chef wanted to offer us complimentary pretzels while we waited, but we declined, with our eyes on the medium-rare steak and pork chop prize.Shortly after, our server came by to say our entrees would be brought out in 3-4 minutes. And that our wine was available by the glass or bottle if we were interested. Again, we declined. Has our food actually arrived at that point, we would have very gladly gone for the second bottle.Our main courses FINALLY arrived at 10:30pm (2 HOURS after we were seated). At that point, we were all starving, but also too tired and frustrated to appreciate the food. Everyone at the table made half-hearted attempts to say they were enjoying the meal, but we all ended up having our plates packed up to go.At that point, our server asked if anyone was interested in dessert. Know your audience! Once she was out of earshot, my father-in-law joked that we'd have to stay the night at the restaurant to actually get served any dessert at that point.Once the bill came, we were all surprised that nothing had been comp'd as a mea culpa for the poor service. I was a server for many years and know that a round of comp drinks, desserts, or apps can go a long way when the kitchen's delays make for a slow dining experience. And if nothing else, it would have been nice for the manager or chef to come by to apologize in person.Poor/slow service aside, I thought the food was mediocre. Especially for a restaurant with MEAT in the name. Our steak frites were fine (but even better and cheaper at Clover Club up the street). Our pork chops were okay (but even better and cheaper at Colonie). The wine was fine (but you know ... wine at home the trick every time).Maybe it was just a really ""off"" night for the entire restaurant, kitchen, and staff, but it would take a lot of convincing for my husband and I to come back for a second service.",1.0

When we first got there, the server inquired several times about our order. She didn't wait until we put our menus down.

"Whenever i'm in Carroll Gardens or court street i'm going to make this my usual visit. Great establishment on a nice street corner that welcomes outdoor seating in the warm months and a nice old timey feel in the interior. I'm a particular fan of the bar seating as you'll see the bartenders mix up a great batch of cocktails and drinks.On this visit had the bloody mary which had the right spicey kick, ample horse raddish, alcohol and tomato balance. This summer day they also had a specialty cocktail punch. A refreshing grapefruit, strawberry, sprackling wine cocktail. Loved the serving cups as it gave it a nice old time charm. For brunch on this visit i would go with the biscuit sandwich. The sausage is in house ground and you can smell the wonderful spices and sausage mixture, eggs were cooked perfectly and the best part was the biscuit. Nice crunch with buttery soft center. Also had the asparagus crab appetizer which had lots of crab and a wonderful buttery bernaise sauce.Wonderful service, great food, and i felt welcomed. I'll definitley be back.",5.0

Basically, if I could unhinge my jaw like a snake to eat this burger, I would have. But for us humans, it's still very manageable if you have an appetite.You can add thick cut bacon for $2 (you'd be a fool not to at that price), which I did. I asked for it on the side, which they gladly accommodated. The bacon is a bit on the salty side, so I did end up putting them on the burger for some more texture and meaty  flavor.Wonderful staff. Super friendly waitstaff and hostess. Even though I was sitting outside, they made sure to check on me and kept my water glass full.Hope to be back for dinner soon!",5.0
"The service was excellent at Prime Meats. But even more noteworthy, was the delicious burger with the mouth-wateringly juicy patty! I asked for it medium rare. Not sure whether the Peter Luger burger tops this one, because I had it over a year ago, but I highly recommend coming here.",4.0
OMG all the food here is good. We got the sausage sampler and that was amazing.,5.0
"Three years ago, just before Brooklyn became the playground for the rich that it is today, a handful of restaurants and bars opened that would eventually define what modern Brooklyn style is. Prime Meats is one of them.  Grim. Cozy. Wooden. With a touch of magic and the best steak frites in the city, Prime Meats has a lot of things going for it.The dark side of Brooklyn style, particularly when it comes to restaurants, is the often-aloof attitude that comes along with it. For the most part, Prime Meats is no exception, though our server did a fantastic job of juggling many elements that had gone awry beyond his control, such as: an extraordinary wait time for a cocktail (compensated by a bit of humor), a lengthy delay for food, (40+ min, compensated by a complimentary fresh pretzel while we waited). Another X factor to consider when choosing Prime Meats is the potluck of table selection. You'll either end up tucked away in a warm little corner or crammed shoulder to shoulder with a table full of lively locals. In other words, you're certain to have fun regardless of where you're seated, but your chances of romance hang in the balance.Is Prime Meats, worth the risks? The wait times? The aloof service? With food this good, absolutely.",3.0
"Despite having lived nearby for a few years, we visited Prime Meats for the first (and possibly last) time last weekend. My husband and I had heard such wonderful things from friends. And as very carnivorous eaters, we thought it would be a great place for dinner while our parents were in town. Sadly, that was not the case. This was one of the most unapologetically poor and slow dinner services ever!We were seated at 8:30pm and promptly placed orders for a bottle of wine and appetizers (salads), with our entree orders placed shortly thereafter. Around 9:15pm, we still hadn't been served our appetizers. Our server explained that the kitchen was a little backed up. We didn't think much of it. Saturday night in NYC, it happens. Around 9:45pm, our server came by to say our appetizers would be out shortly. They did. Because we were pretty hungry at that point, all of the small plates were devoured pretty quickly. Around 10:15pm, our server returned to update us that the kitchen was still very backed up. We were told that the chef wanted to offer us complimentary pretzels while we waited, but we declined, with our eyes on the medium-rare steak and pork chop prize.Shortly after, our server came by to say our entrees would be brought out in 3-4 minutes. And that our wine was available by the glass or bottle if we were interested. Again, we declined. Has our food actually arrived at that point, we would have very gladly gone for the second bottle.Our main courses FINALLY arrived at 10:30pm (2 HOURS after we were seated). At that point, we were all starving, but also too tired and frustrated to appreciate the food. Everyone at the table made half-hearted attempts to say they were enjoying the meal, but we all ended up having our plates packed up to go.At that point, our server asked if anyone was interested in dessert. Know your audience! Once she was out of earshot, my father-in-law joked that we'd have to stay the night at the restaurant to actually get served any dessert at that point.Once the bill came, we were all surprised that nothing had been comp'd as a mea culpa for the poor service. I was a server for many years and know that a round of comp drinks, desserts, or apps can go a long way when the kitchen's delays make for a slow dining experience. And if nothing else, it would have been nice for the manager or chef to come by to apologize in person.Poor/slow service aside, I thought the food was mediocre. Especially for a restaurant with MEAT in the name. Our steak frites were fine (but even better and cheaper at Clover Club up the street). Our pork chops were okay (but even better and cheaper at Colonie). The wine was fine (but you know ... wine at home the trick every time).Maybe it was just a really ""off"" night for the entire restaurant, kitchen, and staff, but it would take a lot of convincing for my husband and I to come back for a second service.",1.0
"This is a really cute restaurant. We went with a few friends for a holiday dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We all got the steak frites which were delicious. The sauce that it came with was especially good. The frites were great, very crispy. The steak was very tender and flavorful.The service is just okay. When we first got there, the server inquired several times about our order. She didn't wait until we put our menus down. Also, it took a very long time for our meal to come out (not that I am complaining, the steak was worth waiting for). All in all a nice experience.",4.0
"We had lunch here today and the food was excellent, staff were friendly, and atmosphere was perfect.  It was a little pricey for the amount of food (small burger and piece of lettuce and quarter pickle with $15 chicken sandwich), thus 4 stars, but a very good experience.",4.0
"Whenever i'm in Carroll Gardens or court street i'm going to make this my usual visit. Great establishment on a nice street corner that welcomes outdoor seating in the warm months and a nice old timey feel in the interior. I'm a particular fan of the bar seating as you'll see the bartenders mix up a great batch of cocktails and drinks.On this visit had the bloody mary which had the right spicey kick, ample horse raddish, alcohol and tomato balance. This summer day they also had a specialty cocktail punch. A refreshing grapefruit, strawberry, sprackling wine cocktail. Loved the serving cups as it gave it a nice old time charm. For brunch on this visit i would go with the biscuit sandwich. The sausage is in house ground and you can smell the wonderful spices and sausage mixture, eggs were cooked perfectly and the best part was the biscuit. Nice crunch with buttery soft center. Also had the asparagus crab appetizer which had lots of crab and a wonderful buttery bernaise sauce.Wonderful service, great food, and i felt welcomed. I'll definitley be back.",5.0
"Wow......this place is truly incredible. I moved to Brooklyn 2 and a half months ago and every restaurant I've been to has given me tasty but VERY SMALL portions haha. But I knew a place with a name like 'Prime Meats' wasn't going to give me a roasted carrot for dinner. I took my mother here for mothers day. The staff was incredible, they all wished my mom a happy mothers day which was nice. They also helped my mom pick out some beer based on her taste. We didn't bother with appetizers because we were hungry, so we made sure to order dinner right away (which took about 35 minutes to get to us unfortunately, but it's ok) Here is what we ordered:Hampshire Pork Chop w/ yams: Cooked to absolute perfection, tasty, tangy, and has a nice slightly smoked taste. It was the best pork chop I've had in a long time. Yams were very rich and buttery. absolutely loved it. Pork Schnitzel: My mom ordered this, i hate schnitzel. But really enjoyed this. buttery, juicy, and amazing. The potatoes and bacon on the side were great too. Had a wonderful smoked taste to them as well. Amish Brined Chicken: Chicken is my least favorite type of meat. but this was cooked so well. perfectly seared to keep all the juices inside, perfectly seasoned, and had a nice hearty side dish. For dessert we had chocolate mousse which was so incredibly rich. Everybody really enjoyed it. As far as atmosphere, it is a dark lit cozy atmosphere, there was no A/C when i was there so be mindful of that. Most of the inside is lacquered wood which gives you the feel of a German beer hall or tavern. Definitely a wonderful place for an evening dinner. I can't wait to go back!!",5.0

"Concept: 5 starsFood: 4Service & Management: 2 starsTricky place to review. I love the concept: relaxed, spacious, throwback environment with great meat dishes and german touches like spaetzle. The giant cote de bouef for 2, when they get it right, is one of the best steaks you'll encounter and really fun to share with a friend. Unfortunately, the side dishes are half-hearted efforts, tasteless potatoes and a strange tomato salad. We live in the neighborhood and visit often, but we never know when a service disaster will strike. Last time, we arrived at 7:30. There were several tables open both inside and outside, with nobody else waiting, but they still wouldn't seat us for 20 mins. The hostess was intensely flustered and confused. We got our food after 9pm, later than we would have liked to consume a large, $125 steak. I've just never had the sense that anyone was really managing this place. On a brighter note, they have excellent drinks and a very good, fairly priced wine list.",3.0

"ok - I hate to do this, but I'm giving one star for a specific reason: this place needs to get kid friendly on the weekend and our mothers day meal wasn't great since there were no highchairs available (despite having asked for one in the reservation). I have been there several times early saturday and sunday, and there's always a mess of parents w/ kids there, yet they always a bit surprised by the needs of parents. But the biggest thing is that they just don't have enough high chairs Three times I've made reservations and asked for one. They never have it. Listen, if you're going to call me to confirm that I'm going to make my reservation, at least have the courtesy to say we can't request a high chair. Or you can just buy a few more - I'm pretty sure they're cheap. Today was mothers day and we thought we'd go here for a special meal before heading into Manhattan... Our kid is at that magical age (2) where he can't sit on a chair by himself and it's really hard to eat if I hold him on my lap. When we arrived the 2 high chairs they had were already taken and it made it kind of hard to have a chill mother's day meal. As we were finishing, one became available - but we were already wrapping up. To the management: if you're going to open at 8am on sat and sun, you're going to have a lot of kids - and if you have kids, then get enough high chairs. And even some kid friendly menus. Oh, and if you're going to serve on mother's day, there will prob be kids then as well. Just sayin.If you don't want kids, then just open at 10! And don't do mothers day!

They had to break the ice from a block because of some hidden hipster rule that you need to bring it back old school while checking their iPhones and each ingredient, god bless them like the ice must be taken from its raw form. The drink? It was alright, unless the ice was certified organic I don't taste the difference. The price? On the high side. Come here for the food. Pregame at home. The bathrooms are beautiful",2.0
"$$$$$$$  Extremely expensive  $$$$$$$$$We went for dinner - me with my very hungry friend from Milan that just wanted a good steak.We ordered - we waited - when the food came placed in front of us, we could not see a thing - it was so dark inside - I could not see my pile of sauerkraut, onions, bratwurst and pork belly...at all.My friend's steak was 5 small slices of steak - we hovered the candle above her plate to see it - the menu did not say five meager slices - she was extremely disappointed and for the price they are asking for steak...how about a steak, not sandwich meat and please change your menu, this is very deceiving - we felt completely cheated.I felt like I made a big mistake choosing this restaurant and I apologized to my Italian friend.Would we go back?Never.Yelp needs to add two more dollar signs to their listing.",1.0
"Had dinner here last night. Service was on point and food was great! I had the burger which initially came out with cheese (which I couldn't have) so it went back and a newly made burger came out ASAP. In the mean time I was able to try everyone else's food: the chicken was moist and delicious; steak frites were on point, and the whole fried trout was perfectly cooked...the wine was good, the beer was ice cold and served in just as cold steins! When I got my burger back (which should have been medium rare) was cooked slightly less than that and the bun was borderline burnt on one end. I enjoyed it nonetheless.

"Went to dinner here for the first time last night. Obviously, can't say that I am impressed. Firstly, our waiter changed 3 times and when we were given the check we had to sit around and wait about 10 minutes for anyone to remember we were still there. We actually for our coats, hats and scarves on and continued to wait. We eventually walked up to someone and just handed them our check and card. And no, it wasn't crowded so we should have been easy to remember. The food- burgers for entree and we got the Waygu beef tartar and Herb and Gruyere spatzle. The spatzle was delicious and everything else was average. Not worth the prices but that's Carroll Gardens for ya.

"Oh my god I love this place!My boyfriend was worried that the menu would be too meat heavy for me, but the salads are massive, fresh and scrumptious. The grilled octopus is amazing, the halibut and all the fish dishes are also delicious. I am one happy camper at this place.The food is thoughtful, perfectly seasoned and/or dressed, and very well balanced. The chef, Xavier, is a true jem. The cocktails are also fantastic. Dessert-wise I've only ever had the coconut cream pie and the flan because they are so delicious I haven't been able to order anything else. The flan is particularly notable- hands down the best I've ever had.

I rarely give places just one star but this one really deserves it. My boyfriend and I went there for brunch because buttermilk channel was packed. We didn't get 2 of the 4 things that we ordered. The food was very ordinary. The coffee was by far the worst that I have ever had (very biter). The waiter took our order and we never saw him again.  I was incredibly disappointed by the venue and the experience. The place has a lot Of potential and a nice layout but it definitely needs to work on the service.  There were also a lot of families and kids there. We had the griddle cakes which were okay and the eggs Benedict which came on a biscuit. The waiter actually confirmed that they came on an English Muffin... I guess that he was wrong. I got a salad on the side which consisted of 5 leaves with some hollondaise sauce on it (not great).,1.0

I originally ordered the poached eggs well done with smoked salmon, but that came out all runny and a definite No Go for my tummy. The second time around I ordered the Fines Herbes Three Egg Omelet which was MUCH better, but not better than the egg and Swiss cheese sandwich had a great tasting  biscuit.

"This restaurant has an interesting (dare I say odd?) menu. Their beef options were burger, steak frites, or a super-elite $142 Dry-Aged Côte De Boeuf for two. The pork options were schnitzel and pork chop. They offered a single chicken and single fish dish. They also offered a slew of ""hand crafted sausages"" that are apparently made fresh in-house. My fiancee ordered the burger and our friend ordered the steak frites. I ordered the sausage tasting board, which came with various pork, veal and beef sausages. It was served with fingerling potatoes and sauerkraut.The sausages tasted good, I guess. To be honest I don't really know if I can tell the difference between a high quality and low quality sausage. I probably should have gotten a dish with less ground meat. The taste and consistency of the sausages sort of meshed together. I couldn't really tell you the difference between each different sausage. I'm not saying my meal was bad, because it wasn't. It just all ended up tasting the same. My fiancee said the burger was really good and my friend said the steak frites was good. If I go back I will avoid the sausages...",3.0
"Let me start off by saying that this is a true one star star experience. Whatever pleasantries were given at the door stayed there.Upon being seated, we were given our menus and put in an order for our children. The waiter rolled his eyes ever so slightly as not to be noticed, but I did, when I asked for warm water as opposed to the stock ice water (I have a soar throat and can't drink cold water, something I already felt bad about and asked kindly to be appreciative in the request).15 minutes later he finally returns to take the table's order. Again and again, he was inattentive and condescending for just about any request we had however small. Seltzer water, instead of regular - request for cheddar cheese to be added to eggs - straws for glasses - coffee after he ""already"" asked the table for coffee refills (my mom had a stroke and didn't quite hear or understand the request the first time). But the end of the meal was the worst. When we paid the bill, we were just about to leave but giving time to my autistic nephew to finish his food. Having waited tables I know that unless the party is there for an extended period you should allow them to leave before picking up the check. Maybe that's not the case here but I insisted when asked to please hold off on picking up the check until we were finished. The waiter insisted I give it to him. I didn't fight and handed it over but not without dismay. I approached the waiter afterwards to express my frustration with his service and overall demeanor and was told he was just doing his job. If that is the case, I'm sorry to say that this establishment has a problem. I've said enough. Go if you like, the food was overpriced and average at best. Not surprised, but not the way u wanted to end a wonderful weekend with family while in NY. Better luck next time.",1.0
"We came here for dinner on New Years Day as it was one of the only area restaurants open. They were very accommodating for our group of 8 people, seating us within 15 minutes of our reservation time. The service overall was very good our entire meal, never letting our drinks go empty. The atmosphere was warm and cozy, perfect for a winter evening meal with friends. They are known for their cocktails, especially the Manhattan and Old Fashion. Once our food was served our entire table was pleased with their meals ranging from the cheeseburger to the pickle brined chicken. I would come back here again for sure and would love to try their brunch which my friends have enjoyed numerous times before.",5.0
"My daughter and I had a great time at PM last night. Our waiter Michael was attentive and sweet. The male and female hosts at the door, not so much. Lighten up, you two--crack a smile maybe. But after an indifferent reception things looked up. We had oysters and grilled octopus, both very good. We splurged on the cotes de boeuf. This arrived on three plates: delicious broccoli in what seemed like a beurre blanc, fingerling potatoes nice and crispy, and the platter of meat, enough for three easily. I thought the meat was excellent. We could have eaten the entire thing but decided to bring it home for the husband. He was appreciative. Michael recommended a sparkling white which went very well with our meal. I wasn't going to drink but when he poured my daughter's I knew I needed a glass also. All in all, a very lovely evening.

Best steak and cocktails in Brooklyn hands down!! The pork chop is the beast I've ever eaten and the steak tar tar is amazing.. I always take my parents here when they visit from London. Top notch!!,5.0

"After we decided not to wait for Buttermilk Channel for 1 hour we headed to Prime Meats down the road. There was no wait and a number of different eating areas. The place had a rustic old fashioned feel. I really liked the sunroof in the back of the restaurant but there were no openings there. I originally ordered the poached eggs well done with smoked salmon, but that came out all runny and a definite No Go for my tummy. The second time around I ordered the Fines Herbes Three Egg Omelet which was MUCH better, but not better than the egg and Swiss cheese sandwich had a great tasting  biscuit. It was soooo good!Although the biscuit is quite large I can guarantee your plate will be clean once you taste that buttery moist goodness. If you feel otherwise I may just have to make sure you ordered the right thing.",4.0
"Came here awhile ago and would really like to eat here again soon. I came with 2 gal pals, one of them got a fish meal and another got pork. I ordered their Herb & Gruyere Cheese Spätzle - as anyone that knows me is aware, I LOVE ALL THINGS GRUYERE RELATED.It was AMAZING. Cheesy, spongy, buttery, herb-y goodness! We also sampled some of their artisan cocktails. Plus, our waiter was charming and their atmosphere is soooooo pretty. This perfect is a perfect date place in a great part of Brooklyn. Two thumbs up, I hope to come back here again really soon.",5.0
Probably the saltiest burger and fries I've ever had . Squash soup was ok but we asked for some bread or crackers for the soup and they only had pretzels with more salt on it !!,2.0
Great food and terrific waitress but the hosts dont seem honest. Sat us outside when no one is in the restaurant. Just tell us you have a lot of reservations coming in. 30 mins later they are still not here. Their preztel looks crazy too.Update:We can't tell if the about they charged us correctly too... we gave one credit card and got two different receipts. Down one star. Update two:They under charged us but we honestly corrected them. Sitting outside in the dark and can't sign the bill... back up one star.,2.0
"This restaurant has an interesting (dare I say odd?) menu. Their beef options were burger, steak frites, or a super-elite $142 Dry-Aged Côte De Boeuf for two. The pork options were schnitzel and pork chop. They offered a single chicken and single fish dish. They also offered a slew of ""hand crafted sausages"" that are apparently made fresh in-house. My fiancee ordered the burger and our friend ordered the steak frites. I ordered the sausage tasting board, which came with various pork, veal and beef sausages. It was served with fingerling potatoes and sauerkraut.The sausages tasted good, I guess. To be honest I don't really know if I can tell the difference between a high quality and low quality sausage. I probably should have gotten a dish with less ground meat. The taste and consistency of the sausages sort of meshed together. I couldn't really tell you the difference between each different sausage. I'm not saying my meal was bad, because it wasn't. It just all ended up tasting the same. My fiancee said the burger was really good and my friend said the steak frites was good. If I go back I will avoid the sausages...",3.0
"Let me start off by saying that this is a true one star star experience. Whatever pleasantries were given at the door stayed there.Upon being seated, we were given our menus and put in an order for our children. The waiter rolled his eyes ever so slightly as not to be noticed, but I did, when I asked for warm water as opposed to the stock ice water (I have a soar throat and can't drink cold water, something I already felt bad about and asked kindly to be appreciative in the request).15 minutes later he finally returns to take the table's order. Again and again, he was inattentive and condescending for just about any request we had however small. Seltzer water, instead of regular - request for cheddar cheese to be added to eggs - straws for glasses - coffee after he ""already"" asked the table for coffee refills (my mom had a stroke and didn't quite hear or understand the request the first time). But the end of the meal was the worst. When we paid the bill, we were just about to leave but giving time to my autistic nephew to finish his food. Having waited tables I know that unless the party is there for an extended period you should allow them to leave before picking up the check. Maybe that's not the case here but I insisted when asked to please hold off on picking up the check until we were finished. The waiter insisted I give it to him. I didn't fight and handed it over but not without dismay. I approached the waiter afterwards to express my frustration with his service and overall demeanor and was told he was just doing his job. If that is the case, I'm sorry to say that this establishment has a problem. I've said enough. Go if you like, the food was overpriced and average at best. Not surprised, but not the way u wanted to end a wonderful weekend with family while in NY. Better luck next time.",1.0
"We came here for dinner on New Years Day as it was one of the only area restaurants open. They were very accommodating for our group of 8 people, seating us within 15 minutes of our reservation time. The service overall was very good our entire meal, never letting our drinks go empty. The atmosphere was warm and cozy, perfect for a winter evening meal with friends. They are known for their cocktails, especially the Manhattan and Old Fashion. Once our food was served our entire table was pleased with their meals ranging from the cheeseburger to the pickle brined chicken. I would come back here again for sure and would love to try their brunch which my friends have enjoyed numerous times before.",5.0
"My daughter and I had a great time at PM last night. Our waiter Michael was attentive and sweet. The male and female hosts at the door, not so much. Lighten up, you two--crack a smile maybe. But after an indifferent reception things looked up. We had oysters and grilled octopus, both very good. We splurged on the cotes de boeuf. This arrived on three plates: delicious broccoli in what seemed like a beurre blanc, fingerling potatoes nice and crispy, and the platter of meat, enough for three easily. I thought the meat was excellent. We could have eaten the entire thing but decided to bring it home for the husband. He was appreciative. Michael recommended a sparkling white which went very well with our meal. I wasn't going to drink but when he poured my daughter's I knew I needed a glass also. All in all, a very lovely evening. I hope to return soon.",4.0
I find that the servers were really slow and when we wanted to order and we had a question they would walk away to ask instead of finishing the order first.

The Steak Tartare was delicious, but not a stand out.  Same with the Pretzel.  For main course, we had the Steak Frites and the Hamburger.  Both come with a large portion of really excellent French Fries and the Steak came with a side of Bearnaise Sauce which was so good we ordered extra. The cocktails are also very special here.  Try the ""Golden Handcuffs"".  It should be noted that Prime Meats is not cheap, but it is worth every penny.",5.0
"So this place was a substitution to a buttermilk channel reservation.... Of which I still want to go to But the place was okay. For a Saturday afternoon late brunch they accommodated us very quickly. The waitress and servers were extremely present and patient even though my party sent back multiple parts of the meal.   I got the salmon and grits (minus the grits). The salmon is actually Lox not like a piece of salmon. Can't really go wrong with eggs   The French toast are huge so get that as a single meal or share. If you get the stake,make sure to be VERY specific as to how well done you want it. Otherwise it will be red and running. The biscuits are extremely good!!",3.0

"I've had better German food. The service is sub-par, and this place is extremely overpriced. A bacon appetizer (which consisted of a piece of thick-cut bacon and a fried egg cost $18). Our appetizers arrived to the table before our drinks. My friend order her beer during our appetizer course, and it arrived until after we all finished our entrees. I had ordered a glass of rosé champagne for my drink. They didn't have anymore; so instead, the waiter brought a glass of Prosecco. I wish he had told me first, before bringing me the Prosecco.

"Totally underwhelming.We ordered well and found the food--all of it save for the iceberg salad (and let's be honest, how hard is it to cut a head of lettuce into wedges, douse it in blue cheese and bacon crumbles and make it taste good?)--to be mediocre at best. My bass was super salty, but I didn't bother telling our server because after I told her that the waygyu beef tartare was over-spiced and overwhelmed by the horseradish and to please take it off the table, she did nothing. We still paid for it. Boyfriend ate about half of his burger, which is quite unlike him. Again, server seemed to want to ignore the fact that he barely touched his food as she whisked it away.

Prime Meats has delicious food usually - I am a huge fan of the BLT - but Thanksgiving dinner tonight was dismal. The price was a rip for the quality of the foodwhich was little better than cafeteria food. Pretzel dumpling stuffing was a large square slab of tepid tasteless stooge. The gravy lacked flavor and the entire platefelt like noone really cared or had pride in the food.There was no Thanksgiving child choice so if you wanted your kid to have the festive meal  it was $48 just like the adults. The entire thing left a bad taste in our mouths - we expected better and should have received better food. It felt like a cynical exercise - take advantage of the punters - our neighbors.,2.0

I don't get it. Been there three times and I'm just not that impressed. Pros: good sausage; good place to sit at the bar and have a cocktail.

"Prime Meats has earned a top spot in my list for neighborhood brunch. A big plus, especially with kids, is they are also open for brunch on Saturday. You won't have the crazy wait and you still get all the yumminess.My standard go to options are either the egg/cheese sandwich on a house-made biscuit or the french toast. The eggs are PA farm fresh and the cheese could have been made in house too. The biscuits are always fresh and flaky so the combo melts in your mouth for a satisfying start of the weekend day. The french toast is decadent and of course served with a dark grade A maple syrup. Fresh fruit normally makes its way on top as well.Outside of brunch you can imagine that they specialize in meat products. The burger is nothing short of amazing. My hands down favorite burger in Brooklyn. It's not cheap (~$15) but the quality of the meat, the grind, the bun and the seasoning is perfection. Doesn't hurt that the fries that come with it are just the right amount of crisp and thickness that don't need any ketchup to eat (the real judge of a fry, right?) You'll love the staff here too as they are knowledgeable, friendly and (for Brooklyn) efficient. The dress code for everyone seems to be a cross between Amish and farmhouse. Think Witness and you'll get the drift. My wife thinks all men must have waists no larger than 27"" as a requirement. There would be special exceptions for those over 6'2"" whereas they can go up to 28"".-Now On opentable and take reservations and Apple Pay!!!- On the getting in during prime time, the odd thing is they don't take reservations. Ok, so that's not odd I guess, but they will take your phone number after you ask them how long the wait is. So it's pseudo-reservations I suppose.  It'd be helpful if you could CALL in advance and give them your number if you're local (I'm about 8 minutes walking from them). What's really the difference for them - they're still calling you to let you know your table is almost ready?",5.0

Had an excellent  date night at Prime Meats. Ambience is cozy yet romantic. We started out with an old fashioned and a Manhattan. Both perfectly crafted. Has the charred octopus - delicious! Served with potatoes and caper berries. Also had the Bibb salad - boring. Skip it  My husband has the pork chop for his entree and it was out of this world. I had the bratwurst. It was good - if I went again I wouldn't order it though. Ended the meal with New York cheese cake. Which was delicious! Great place - highly recommend it.,4.0

My only complaint was I wish there was more steak. It's not the largest serving, but satisfying enough. My husband got the pork schnitzel which was also very flavorful and good.

"So its a perfect Saturday night and the fellas are out for another birthday celebration. Prime Meats was my choice this time as i am the official restaurant picker guy. We had a res for six at 8:30 and were seated right on time. The restaurant is very dimly lit and definitely has the hipster vibe going. We were seated at a nice comfortable table for six. When we go out on these occasions we pretty much order like a bunch of starving savages so let the feast begin! Most of the apps did not seem sharing friendly and so we took a different route. We decided we would start with a bunch of oysters and drinks. The oysters were all very delicious as was my old fashioned. Next course salads(no chance!!) what we needed was sausages so we ordered two sample platters for the table along with three pretzels. It was a lot of food for six big hungry men but we finished it all. The sausages are served on wood boards and come with pickled veg and sauerkraut. Very rich and savory but the acid from the kraut, pickled veg and mustard help it all go down. The entrees came next. Five out of six of us ordered the steak frites and one ordered the pork chop. What else can we squeeze on the table? Oh i know can we also have two orders of spaetzle for the table. The steak frites were excellent!  The steak was cooked perfectly and the fries, dressed greens and Bearnaise were perfect. The steak was a very nice portion that satisfied all of us. The pork chop was delicious as well. The cheesey spaetzle was great for soaking up the awesome steak juice. At this point you would think that would be enough but you would be wrong. We needed some sugary goodness to wash it all down. We had cheesecake and creme brulee. They were both good but i would say i have had better brulee.  Overall the service was good not great as drinks seemed to take a little time coming out but keep in mind we order six at a time and pretty constantly.

"I came here for brunch on a sunday around noon. The establishment was busy but not absurdly so. I waited for about 15 minutes before my guests and I were seated.

When we finally placed our order, I was delighted to swap our the potatoes and toast in my Farmer's Breakfast for a side salad dressed with a lemon vinaigrette. I paid extra for a side of fruit, just in case. The food did not take terribly long but when my food did arrive, my eggs were cold, the sausage was missing and the salad was wilted- perhaps a day before going bad. Since my server was no where to be found I told the nearest person that my meal was incomplete. The sausage arrived 10 minutes later. Of what I received, i really enjoyed the thick cut bacon and the fresh fruit. I was hungry so i ate the cold eggs and the wilted salad. I see all the great reviews so i will chalk this up to an off day. The bacon was really great so i would come back for it. I also really appreciated being able to swap out the starches for a salad.",3.0

"What happens when a restaurant gets thrown into the spotlight and its employees get a little too comfortable with adoration and press?  They forget what landed them that fanfare in the first place. My boyfriend lives out of town and was really excited to take me on a secret mission for delicious food at an undisclosed location in Carroll Gardens. That destination turned out to be Prime Meats - a place where we had both eaten amazing meals  (separately) over two years ago. We settled down at a table outside on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Menus came out. Water was poured. We had drinks and meals selected. Guess who never showed up? Our waiter. After 30 minutes passed and no one came out to check on us, my bf's blood was boiling - he works in the service industry and loves everything about good food. This was an insult in the highest order. Ultimately we left Prime Meats (with no apologies from the staff) and we found another restaurant nowhere near Carroll Gardens where we enjoyed an incredible dinner, drinks and more importantly, superior service.

"So about three years ago I was a brunch regular.  It was always packed and the food was awesome.  After a neighborhood move this great brunch was less on my radar.  I went back this Sunday and was super sad about the meal I had. It was honestly pretty dead, no wait at all at 1pm and this should have been a big red flag, I remember often we would wait an hour plus on weekends.  I ordered the Mushrooms and Bratwurst and it came out cold and was completely lackluster.  No flavor at all topped with a cool poached egg.  My friend got the benedict and said the same thing. Lacking flavor and cold.  I had ordered a side of bacon which came out about 5 minutes after our other food and was really gamey tough and over cooked and my friend got grits that ended up being watery and salty.  Honestly, I can say I won't go back.  Much better in the neighborhood.",3.0
"Went to this spot because someone recommended Buttermilk Channel, but I was smart enough to check them out on the Health Department website. So I checked out the site for clean restaurants and I found Prime Meats. Yelp sent me an email recommending the thick cut bacon so I convinced my friends to make a detour.Thank god for Yelp and the Health Department. The place looks marvelous. Being a photographer, all I could do was stare at the place and think is photo shoots I'd like. But ambiance goes so far, what about the food? I of course ordered the thick cut bacon and one of my friends who hates French Toast, ordered...the French Toast based off an email from Yelp. Not only was my bacon fantastic and not too salty, but my friend raved over the French Toast. The waiter recommended the Cherry Cocktail (not the real name, can't remember it) and it was tasty. The only criticism I can make was that I wasn't ""full"" after brunch, but I am a bit of a beast with food. This place is well worth a trip to Caroll Gardens.",4.0
"Overall experience was OK. Not bad, but not outstanding. Waiter and other staff seemed like they had all smoked a community bowl of peyote pre-shift, but were nice enough. Pros:German food menu items were very good. Attention to detail could have been better, decor was simple and understated. Generally friendly staff. Short wait for brunch, less than 15 minutes.Cons:The food runners hands were disgusting! I guarantee he touches all the food, bad vibes from that alone. We waited about a half hour for our food. My eggs were not cooked like I asked (again attention to detail) my potatoes were rubbery, dry and cold, and my steak under seasoned. Price is way too high for service and product rendered.I may return for the German food items alone, but that's about it. Not much else would draw me back..perhaps for dinner.",2.0
"I went there a few weeks ago with my family. I heard good things and passed by a few times really wanting to try the place.

Konigsburger Klopse, mild German meatballs in a mushroom sauce..sounds nice but mediocre at best. Ikeas are better...sorry chef.Main Courses. Striped Bass was a Special, my wife said it was ok nothing special, and thank god it was hers @ $26 they could give a bigger portion.  Spicy Mustard Pork Belly Confit, this was mine and I thought it sucked. Bland and it was the first time in my life I ever had to salt pork belly. It sounded great but just wasn't.  Prime Meats Burger, this was my daughters and she had the winner of the 3. Me and my wife were staring at her her burger wanting that instead, I had a taste and it had a good beefy flavor and was cooked as ordered.No dessert todayWe found the service to be very good although the place was not crowded when we arrived.

"What happens when a restaurant gets thrown into the spotlight and its employees get a little too comfortable with adoration and press?  They forget what landed them that fanfare in the first place. My boyfriend lives out of town and was really excited to take me on a secret mission for delicious food at an undisclosed location in Carroll Gardens. That destination turned out to be Prime Meats - a place where we had both eaten amazing meals  (separately) over two years ago. We settled down at a table outside on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Menus came out. Water was poured. We had drinks and meals selected. Guess who never showed up? Our waiter. After 30 minutes passed and no one came out to check on us, my bf's blood was boiling - he works in the service industry and loves everything about good food. This was an insult in the highest order. Ultimately we left Prime Meats (with no apologies from the staff) and we found another restaurant nowhere near Carroll Gardens where we enjoyed an incredible dinner, drinks and more importantly, superior service. Prime Meats: Don't Believe the Hype.",1.0
"So about three years ago I was a brunch regular.  It was always packed and the food was awesome.  After a neighborhood move this great brunch was less on my radar.  I went back this Sunday and was super sad about the meal I had. It was honestly pretty dead, no wait at all at 1pm and this should have been a big red flag, I remember often we would wait an hour plus on weekends.  I ordered the Mushrooms and Bratwurst and it came out cold and was completely lackluster.  No flavor at all topped with a cool poached egg.  My friend got the benedict and said the same thing. Lacking flavor and cold.  I had ordered a side of bacon which came out about 5 minutes after our other food and was really gamey tough and over cooked and my friend got grits that ended up being watery and salty.  Honestly, I can say I won't go back.  Much better in the neighborhood.",3.0
"Went to this spot because someone recommended Buttermilk Channel, but I was smart enough to check them out on the Health Department website. So I checked out the site for clean restaurants and I found Prime Meats. Yelp sent me an email recommending the thick cut bacon so I convinced my friends to make a detour.Thank god for Yelp and the Health Department. The place looks marvelous. Being a photographer, all I could do was stare at the place and think is photo shoots I'd like. But ambiance goes so far, what about the food? I of course ordered the thick cut bacon and one of my friends who hates French Toast, ordered...the French Toast based off an email from Yelp. Not only was my bacon fantastic and not too salty, but my friend raved over the French Toast. The waiter recommended the Cherry Cocktail (not the real name, can't remember it) and it was tasty. The only criticism I can make was that I wasn't ""full"" after brunch, but I am a bit of a beast with food. This place is well worth a trip to Caroll Gardens.",4.0
"Overall experience was OK. Not bad, but not outstanding. Waiter and other staff seemed like they had all smoked a community bowl of peyote pre-shift, but were nice enough. Pros:German food menu items were very good. Attention to detail could have been better, decor was simple and understated. Generally friendly staff. Short wait for brunch, less than 15 minutes.Cons:The food runners hands were disgusting! I guarantee he touches all the food, bad vibes from that alone. We waited about a half hour for our food. My eggs were not cooked like I asked (again attention to detail) my potatoes were rubbery, dry and cold, and my steak under seasoned. Price is way too high for service and product rendered.I may return for the German food items alone, but that's about it. Not much else would draw me back..perhaps for dinner.",2.0
"I went there a few weeks ago with my family. I heard good things and passed by a few times really wanting to try the place. I have to start questioning the people who reccommend restaurants to me.I'll start with the coctails, They were the best part of the meal, we tries 3 different ones and all were good.Appetisers were Pretzel, which was ok but I don't understand what everybody's raving about..it's just ok, that's it.   Roasted Beet and Carrot Salad, very good one of the meals highpoints. Konigsburger Klopse, mild German meatballs in a mushroom sauce..sounds nice but mediocre at best. Ikeas are better...sorry chef.Main Courses. Striped Bass was a Special, my wife said it was ok nothing special, and thank god it was hers @ $26 they could give a bigger portion.  Spicy Mustard Pork Belly Confit, this was mine and I thought it sucked. Bland and it was the first time in my life I ever had to salt pork belly. It sounded great but just wasn't.  Prime Meats Burger, this was my daughters and she had the winner of the 3. Me and my wife were staring at her her burger wanting that instead, I had a taste and it had a good beefy flavor and was cooked as ordered.No dessert todayWe found the service to be very good although the place was not crowded when we arrived.

"I am only reviewing the 2013 thanksgiving pre-fix.A normally very good restaurant  provided a cynical rip-off for this overpriced holiday meal.

There was also dessert -pumpkin pie or berry compote.The chef was clearly not inspired as this meal was only a few steps above a really good frozen dinner.The first course was good but not stellar by any means and dessert was ""ehh"".What a disappointing rip-off. And no child menu for thanksgiving dinner. Shame on you , Prime Meats, for being so lazy and so greedy. Was looking forward to this meal for weeks - what a huge let- down.( ps - the reason we had thanksgiving dinner here this year: we enjoyed a really excellent Thnksgvg day meal here about 4 years ago.

"Not bad at all, but not worth going out of your way (as in not worth leaving Manhattan). The decor is very cozy just like the area.

(Might sound weird, but even as a woman I notice that most restaurants cater to women or business dining, so I found this unique about this place). Factoring in the price, the food was fine. The waitress we had was clueless (lol) , service in general was sub par (basic stuff like taking away empty plates, bringing out entrees at the same time, clumsy stuff you overlook here but wouldnt somewhere in the city).Burger was decent, not mind blowing. Large and not over seasoned. Not as sloppy soft like Spotted Pig/Shake Shack but not too firm either. We  had ours with blue cheese, and the amount of cheese overpowered the meat. Next time I will either request the blue cheese on the side or try a different cheese option. The arugula salad was surprisingly good!

"German farmer hipster chique best describes this place.These are brown times: Very dark wood, super low lighting, lots of specialty brown alcohol drinks (and only one vodka - a potato kind from New Jersey that I definitely regretted the next day), dark food, even a handsome brunette serverThe menu is inventive, though the food was not quite as delectable as it was made out to be in the descriptions.  Table favorites were the squash soup and the chocolate mousse.  My (very brown) Beef Sauerbraten & Braised Red Cabbage was a perfectly cooked, melty in my mouth brisket, but overly sour sauce for my taste.  Nearby spatzle was surprisingly light but also a bit bland.  Brined chicken was fine but forgettable.If you're coming here, I recommend the following:suspenders deep hunger for whiskey but a light hunger for foodflashlightbullhorn to communicate with your dining companions on a Friday nightfull wallet (brown leather of course)",2.0
"I am only reviewing the 2013 thanksgiving pre-fix.A normally very good restaurant  provided a cynical rip-off for this overpriced holiday meal. The $48 per fix included a soup or salad, a main course of turkey breast, confit of turkey leg with pretzel dumpling stuffing , a dollop of cranberry sauce, with a very small side on plate of green beans and Brussel sprouts . There was also dessert -pumpkin pie or berry compote.The chef was clearly not inspired as this meal was only a few steps above a really good frozen dinner.The first course was good but not stellar by any means and dessert was ""ehh"".What a disappointing rip-off. And no child menu for thanksgiving dinner. Shame on you , Prime Meats, for being so lazy and so greedy. Was looking forward to this meal for weeks - what a huge let- down.( ps - the reason we had thanksgiving dinner here this year: we enjoyed a really excellent Thnksgvg day meal here about 4 years ago. THAT meal was outstanding, prepared with care, and very reasonably priced - that was NOT what we experienced tonight)",1.0
"The best eggs benedict I've ever had, hands down.  It's served on a buttery soft biscuit that melts in your mouth.   Mmmmm.   I feel like Prime Meats does breakfast and brunch better than dinner.  Not that I've had a bad dinner here, but the breakfast and brunch items I've had stand out more.   For example, I loved the mushroom and bratwurst brunch special, while the steak frites I had for dinner was ok - not bad, just not very memorable. While service has been spotty on some of my visits, it's been great the last couple of times I've been. Overall, it's a solid place that's definitely worth checking out ... go for brunch and get the eggs benedict!",4.0
"We ended up here for brunch a few weeks ago, since Buttermilk was being snooty. The brunch menu is pretty small (about 9 things) - with a real focus on lunch-type things. The rest of their menu seems German influenced with lots of sausage.The server told me the burger was one of the best burgers in Brooklyn, so like a sucker I believed him and ordered the burger. Turns out he was right. This thing was VERY well seasoned & had the right texture/doneness. Very impressed.Good coffee, pretty good service, authentic interior. I'd go back without reservations.",4.0
"Not bad at all, but not worth going out of your way (as in not worth leaving Manhattan). The decor is very cozy just like the area. I feel it makes men comfortable, but cozy enough for women to enjoy as well, making it a nice date spot, somewhere you can take your dad and a place where a group of regular guys would feel comfortable getting together for a quiet dinner. (Might sound weird, but even as a woman I notice that most restaurants cater to women or business dining, so I found this unique about this place). Factoring in the price, the food was fine. The waitress we had was clueless (lol) , service in general was sub par (basic stuff like taking away empty plates, bringing out entrees at the same time, clumsy stuff you overlook here but wouldnt somewhere in the city).Burger was decent, not mind blowing. Large and not over seasoned. Not as sloppy soft like Spotted Pig/Shake Shack but not too firm either. We  had ours with blue cheese, and the amount of cheese overpowered the meat. Next time I will either request the blue cheese on the side or try a different cheese option. The arugula salad was surprisingly good! Will come back to try the porterhouse for 2 some day.Overall it's a solid restaurant to have in the area, but not a foodie destination.",4.0
"Had to wait about an hour for our table, but well worth it.  The oysters were delectable and the main courses (Pork Belly/Sausage entree and Steak Frites) were amazing.  The service was pretty good, though our waiter said that he got grief from his colleagues about not opening our wine at the table (which was a bit strange).",5.0

The spätzlel was good too but not what I expected.  In a restaurant with so many German dishes I thought it would be knöpfle (dumpling style).  Instead it was a noodle.  That would have been okay except the flavor was pretty much overwhelmed by the heavy cheese sauce so it tasted like a ""meh""  linguine alfredo.My g/f was fairly satisfied with her conventional bar burger but at $18 it cost nearly twice what the mecca of burgers, Burger Bistro, charges for arguably the best burger in Brooklyn.    My jagerwurst was pretty bland but the roasted sauerkraut was great.Several of the reviews here criticized the service.  Maybe we were lucky but it was pretty decent and proactive when we were there so I'd give them four stars.  However, it was overall an uneven dining experience with unimpressive fare.",2.0

"This review is for this specific entree: I finally came back to try the Côte De Boeuf with a couple of friends.  Although the rest of our meal was great (we shared a pork chop entree, oysters, and sides) I really was disappointed in the whole experience with this piece of meat that is supposed to be the star of the meal. We all grabbed a piece and I was very lucky with the piece I grabbed because it was the only piece that was medium rare (and that one piece was delicious, hence the extra star to two!).  Now to be clear, we asked our waiter if it would be cooked medium rare and he replied, ""yes, that's the standard"".  When the big hunk of meat (close to 30 pounds) is brought to our table and 96% of it is MEDIUM, it is not acceptable for a steakhouse.  So after the manager came by, he apologized and said they can bring another one but it'd take about 45 minutes.  We were fine with it, and they also were kind enough to give us complimentary carafes of wine.  Second try: the manager comes back himself carrying the Côte De Boeuf. And after looking at it, he paused and said, ""It's a little more rare this time"".  Places the plate down and leaves.  We look at it... and for some reason there's less pink than the first time!  I ate a piece thinking I was wrong.. but I don't know why I put that in my mouth. Half the piece was gray and not juicy whatsoever.  So we put all our pieces back on the plate and left it until the manager came back 15 minutes later and apologized that it was an off night and took the steak off our bill.  We were grateful that the management was kind enough to comp our drinks and remove the charge of the steak off our bill.  The thing is that we were really looking forward to having this, and I really want to go back to try it again... but I have never sent back a steak twice before.  It was just very disappointing that the second time it came out it was worse than the first.  That's just a big no-no for any restaurant.",2.0

"Prime Meats does the atmosphere right, starting with an elegant black columned and glass exterior.  Inside, everything is paneled in rich, dark woods, pressed tin ceilings, matching fixtures, and judicious use of mirrors.  The bar immediately by the entrance is small but lovingly designed.  Its a small restaurant, with two adjacent, narrow dining areas.  Aside from some brusqueness while waiting for our table, the service was generally quite attentive, friendly, and competent.  All the waitstaff, men and women, were sharply dressed in pants, shirts, waistcoats, and some with armbands; another nice nod to the theme.Meat is their specialty, German the style.  There's a variety of sausage and other charcuterie, their dry-aged black Angus, brisket, pork loin, and pork belly. The menu is quite a bit more diverse than that, with a raw bar, salads, soups, fish, and a large selection of vegetable sides and cheeses.  Their full bar offers a large specialty cocktail menu and a small selection of craft beers, and a good wine list.  I had a good IPA, which arrived in a big, sturdy mug.Food highlights were the buttery bone marrow that you prepared on toast with roasted garlic and radish, smooth steak tartare, crispy skinned brook trout, and a great herb and mushroom spatzle.  The dried hunter's sausage that so many liken to a Slim Jim, was really like a much better version of that, less salty, less processed, pretty tasty.  The weisswurst came in an urn-like bowl, submerged in cooking liquid; it was delicate tasting and well-prepared.  Sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, and french fries were all good.  The oyster special was good, the shrimp cocktail overcooked.  The DeBragga & Spitler Dry-Aged Côte De Boeuf, which was brought out raw for perusal, was an excellent steak but the degree of doneness varied a lot throughout the piece; our medium-rare was medium-rare in the center but quickly became medium then well-done by the end pieces, which is more variation than I want for the price paid; fortunately, we had people in our party who preferred something in the entire range so that worked out.  The steak came pre-sliced but the slices are so big, you'll be needing that steak knife.Overall, the food was competently prepared, seasoned well, in good portions.  Still, I have to say that while the food was good, it was not great.  Also, its on the expensive side for the area and takes no reservations.  They didn't used to take any credit cards but apparently now accept AMEX.  None of these things would deter me from going, not in the least, but the food just didn't transcend good for me, and that's probably why I won't rush back.  I think it could definitely be a great place for others.",3.0

Oysters from not too far away-which surprised me. I dont like anything other than west coast oysters but these were briny without being salty or flabbily enormous.

"Last night we came to Prime Meats for the second time, specifically for their amazing burgers. We got there around 9 PM and of course there was a wait, even at that hour. Our group of 6 started with a drink at the bar. The bar isn't very big so there are no barstools, but it is a great place to wait and try one of their cocktails. My husband tried the punch for $5, which was mostly tequila, not my favorite liquor so I had a wine.After out wait we were sat in the main dining room. We ordered almost right away because we all knew what we wanted. Unfortunately though we had a rather long wait for our food, almost as long as our wait for the table. However, jt was well worth the wait! Delicious, juicy, overflowing with blue cheese as always. It was the perfect burger. I devoured the whole thing as did everyone else. One person did break from the group and got the pork chop, which she said was just as tasty and it looked great.Overall, I recommend prime meats to anyone who wants a delicious burger.

The menu is quite a bit more diverse than that, with a raw bar, salads, soups, fish, and a large selection of vegetable sides and cheeses.  Their full bar offers a large specialty cocktail menu and a small selection of craft beers, and a good wine list.  I had a good IPA, which arrived in a big, sturdy mug.Food highlights were the buttery bone marrow that you prepared on toast with roasted garlic and radish, smooth steak tartare, crispy skinned brook trout, and a great herb and mushroom spatzle.  The dried hunter's sausage that so many liken to a Slim Jim, was really like a much better version of that, less salty, less processed, pretty tasty.  The weisswurst came in an urn-like bowl, submerged in cooking liquid; it was delicate tasting and well-prepared.  Sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, and french fries were all good.  The oyster special was good, the shrimp cocktail overcooked.  The DeBragga & Spitler Dry-Aged Côte De Boeuf, which was brought out raw for perusal, was an excellent steak but the degree of doneness varied a lot throughout the piece; our medium-rare was medium-rare in the center but quickly became medium then well-done by the end pieces, which is more variation than I want for the price paid; fortunately, we had people in our party who preferred something in the entire range so that worked out.  The steak came pre-sliced but the slices are so big, you'll be needing that steak knife.Overall, the food was competently prepared, seasoned well, in good portions.  Still, I have to say that while the food was good, it was not great.  Also, its on the expensive side for the area and takes no reservations.  They didn't used to take any credit cards but apparently now accept AMEX.  None of these things would deter me from going, not in the least, but the food just didn't transcend good for me, and that's probably why I won't rush back.  I think it could definitely be a great place for others.",3.0
"Prime is a super spot. Service was great, menu selections were wonderful and the wine was great. So great in fact I have forgotten the Rose(Spain I think) and Whites we had! Might have been a Gruner in there somewhere...Had Roasted Beef Bone MarrowRadish, gremolata, roasted garlic & toast. Huge portion, THANK -YOU! No one dishes out marrow in that quantity in SF. Tasty. Oysters from not too far away-which surprised me. I dont like anything other than west coast oysters but these were briny without being salty or flabbily enormous. They also did not taste like pennies, which is how the East coasters taste to me sometimes. Score for the East!Steak TartareCreekstone sirloin with parsley, anchovy, capers, shallots, Tabasco, Worcestershire, mustard oil & quail egg. MMMM! Not much to add but the MMMM.House-made Pretzel-so fun and tasty-parts of it were soft and other parts(smaller crossed over pieces) crunchy! I realize the things we ordered were somewhat decadent and probably not the usual afternoon faire. Worked for us and we enjoyed the place.",4.0
"Last night we came to Prime Meats for the second time, specifically for their amazing burgers. We got there around 9 PM and of course there was a wait, even at that hour. Our group of 6 started with a drink at the bar. The bar isn't very big so there are no barstools, but it is a great place to wait and try one of their cocktails. My husband tried the punch for $5, which was mostly tequila, not my favorite liquor so I had a wine.After out wait we were sat in the main dining room. We ordered almost right away because we all knew what we wanted. Unfortunately though we had a rather long wait for our food, almost as long as our wait for the table. However, jt was well worth the wait! Delicious, juicy, overflowing with blue cheese as always. It was the perfect burger. I devoured the whole thing as did everyone else. One person did break from the group and got the pork chop, which she said was just as tasty and it looked great.Overall, I recommend prime meats to anyone who wants a delicious burger. I have to admit I'll be back and maybe to try something new.",5.0
"I had a very pleasant experience for here for brunch. I rolled in here early so that I could sober up on Sunday morning before 10am mass at Mary's Star of the Sea next door. The overall presentation of the place was very simple and clean which I loved, wait staff was ridiculously nice, even to someone at a table in the corner by himself. I had the breakfast sandwich and as much coffee as they could poor. I'd love to go back and order something else more complicated or maybe a drink after dark.",4.0
"1 of the best restaurants in Brooklyn! Super  interesting concept, a German Steakhouse, authentic German food with German /wine/beer , plus 1 of the best cocktail programs in Brooklyn(which is high praise) ! The place is a mix of speakeasy meets German Beer hall/ and steakhouse. It's truly is very unique for any part of the country, but the fact that its unlike any other Brooklyn haunt really separates from the other outstanding places in the neighborhood .  The menu is great, with a lot of options , when you walk though the front door you feel like you step back into time.  if you in the area its definitely worth a visit !!",5.0

"ooh i am such a fan of the classy, manly decor here.had an excellent egg, swiss and bacon sandwich; they do not skimp on the thick cut bacon, but it's not overwhelming, good ratio happening. simple side salad was great too. the coconut cream pie was amazing and the service was lovely.",4.0
"I went there with two friends to celebrate the fact that one of us was back from her holidays.We had a bottle of Blanc de blanc for $30 which was not bad at all.We shared spatzle (really good), a pretzel (very small... not worth the $5), and had arugula salads and meat.I am a vegetarian so I was a little skeptical about going to a place called Prime Meats but they do have multiple veggie options! We all liked our dishes and one of my friend stated that it was the best piece of meat he had in NYC.We then shared an apple strudel and a cholocat crémeux, both delicious!The restaurant / bar has a nice atmosphere, we had a great time!",5.0
"I can't get enough of Prime Meats, it's like Christmas and we try to have a Prime Meats Christmas dinner every couple of weeks. I am a big stew fan, at the moment they have a Colorado Lamb Stew with lamb shoulder, cured lamb belly, housemade merguez sausage, white beans & marrow breadcrumbs, it's sooo good or my go to is normally Beef Sauerbraten & Braised Red Cabbage which seems to have everything good in the world. Oooh and the carrots can not go without a mention, meooow! Enough about the food. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed, there's always some good tunes in the background and the service is pretty friendly. I am pleased the waits are not what they used to be, I don't care how good a restaurant is any wait over 45 minutes is far to long for me to bother.This is the sort of place I would love to be trapped in during a snow storm.",5.0

"First off the server today was super fun and she made the lunch fantastic. Her attitude lightened up the ""stuffiness"" of this place that often overwhelms you here. My review is for the burger which is pretty damn good. I had it with Maytag bleu cheese and Faicco's thick cut bacon cooked medium rare. Although it is not a an inexpensive burger it is in my top five burgers in NYC and totally worth it. I have been here many times and the food is always good but the server named Jo was a cut above what is normally in this neighborhood !",4.0

The bill came to a little over $60 which is essentially unheard of in Manhattan for 6 drinks. I'm certainly making the trek back down there at some point and trying the food.

"I have never had a dish here that was less than mind-blowingly awesome. I don't care that it's a twenty-five dollar cab ride away way down in Carroll Gardens, that it's pretty pricey, that I often find myself unable to make it to dinner by 1am and they're closed, or that often there is a wait. I will continue to harass my friends into coming here late after copious quantities of alcohol and eating everything in sight. The goat's head was incredible and a total lucky score and you should unhesitatingly order it if you're lucky enough to stumble in when it's on special and feed it to strangers at tables next to you. It's also my favorite burger (add bacon obviously) in NYC and the Frankie's cooking manual is great.

And the weisswurst just came on a bun with mustard (no side dishes). Still, much of what they had sounded great. I ordered the Sauerbraten (brisket).It was fantastic. The Sauerbraten came with braised red cabbage and pretzel dumplings. It was delicious, and the presentation of the food was excellent.

"Stumbled in last night at 10:30pm to seek a couple of nice cocktails and shelter from the rain.  I've heard good things about Prime Meats before -- and my expectations were exceeded.  Warm, cozy atmosphere, attentive courteous service, knowledgeable servers that obviously cared about the restaurant they worked at and the food served there.We had 4 cocktails, 3 small plates and some fresh oysters.  Everything was spectacular, but I'd especially recommend the Veal Meatballs (can't remember the exact name, and it's not on their site menu) atop the wild leek puree and sauteed mushrooms -- delicious, moist and bursting with flavor, and of course the Roasted Beef Bone Marrow -- that was lick-your-plate-till-the-last-drop delightful (and of course it was after 11pm and almost no other people at the restaurant, so I allowed myself to actually lick the bones!) Everything was served with the perfectly crisped bread -- not a charred bit.  The Steak Tartare could use a bit less salt... but was pretty good as well.  All 4 cocktails were also quite complex and a delight to taste.  We lingered enjoying them, and then realized that it was a bit after midnight and the staff would probably want to go home... but no one made even a hint at making us aware of the time.  All in all, a well-deserved 5 stars -- a wonderful, wonderful place!",5.0

"This review is for brunch at Prime Meats. Four of us went on a Saturday around 2:30pm and only had to wait for 10-15 minutes. We have heard that it does get packed during the normal brunch hours. We were seated in the rear of the restaurant where they had an atrium, which was stunning.We ordered the following dishes: 1) Farm Fresh breakfast w/ biscuit;2) Wild Mushroom w/ Poached egg and Bratwurst; 3) Monte Cristo (special)4) Celery SaladAll of us loved our dishes. I personally had the brunch special, Monte Cristo, which is this french toast with raspberry jam topped with a smoked honey glaze ham. It was extremely filling and delicious. The french toast filled me, the jam made it sweet, the ham gave a little sweet and salty aftertaste. I would highly recommend the Monte Cristo. The pastrami hash was another special but the restaurant ran out of it by the time we got seated. Prime Meats also has some strong good coffee but no free refills. Overall: Because we went for a late brunch, we were seated quickly. The food, alone, was amazing. The dining environment was stunning.",5.0
"I've been back to Prime Meats about 4 times since my previous review and I'm just plain disappointed by them.  The service has become increasingly worse, on my last visit the server had no idea about their wines (there was a lot of ""ummm, this one is good""), then it took over 20 minutes for our wine to arrive and that's only because I had to go and find the waiter and his response was a kind of snotty ""yeah, I know, it's coming"" tone.  WTF.  Another table was trying to flag him down to get water.   On a previous visit, our food came out before our drinks.  Shitty service aside, the food isn't that great.  That $18 burger is no longer the best burger on block, although it is still the most expensive.  The roast beef was RAW, like purple-ish/red raw, not just rare.  The spaetzle with pork belly is just a giant bowl of cubes of fat, I mean at least sear it so the fat has some color!  It's just unappetizing looking.  The breakfast sandwich is a serious rip off. I don't mind spending more money, but I expect better service than this.  Carroll Gardens has way too many restaurants for this kind of attitude to survive.",2.0

We had a bottle of red, a half dozen oysters, steak frites with salad and sauteed wild mushrooms. Everything was amazing, especially the oysters and mushrooms.

"I made my second trip to Prime Meats (Pretzel Heaven*) and yet again, did not eat meat. Among the many oddities to my personality apparently I have added the fact that I do not listen to the name of the restaurant when ordering. When at any dumping place I am often thinking of sesame pancakes, go figure.Even with this self-created error, I found something amazing in the trout salad sandwich at lunch. The trout** was mixed as a salad with pickled red onion, lettuce and tomato on pumpernickel bread and was extremely savory. The sandwich also came with salad or fries and I had the salad which was leafy greens with a tangy and sweet vinaigrette. Couple this with a soft homemade pretzel and I found myself ogling Prime Meats like Harold Crick ogled Ms. Pascal at the bakery in Stranger Than Fiction.Prime Meats is a great spot with a warm interior and a nice bar. The staff is great, each person is totally friendly and helpful and you get the feeling that they actually appreciate you coming in. One day I will get to the meat.___________________* They have not ok'd the parenthetical name addition that I have created, but if you go there and have one of their homemade soft pretzels, you will agree and sign the petition in my mind.**In order to feel more cavemanish and meat-worthy after ordering trout at Prime MEATS, I contacted some sea creatures and they all assured me that trout is actually the bacon of the sea so I feel better.",5.0
"I came here with a group of guys interested in trying burgers on a lazy, rainy Sunday evening and we ended up having a feast.  I think they could tell we were gonna be loud after our first round at the bar, so the (awesome) manager ended up sticking us downstairs at the chef's table just off the kitchen.  This is the way to go if you can do it!We started with the alpine tasting board which has bacon, bologna, sausage, and a host of other meats and goodies.  Then, we ordered 3 bacon cheeseburgers, and each took half a burger so we could try these.  Their burgers are made completely from dry-aged prime beef, and you absolutely must get it with gruyere cheese and thick-cut bacon.  They are mouth-watering and absolute heaven on the taste buds.After the burger, we ordered 36-day dry-aged bone-in ribeye for 3, which came out to 73 ounces.  They slice it up for you like you were eating sliced tri-tip.  If you can organize a group of 6 hungry guys, this sharing menu we created is definitely the way to go.  The food ended up being only $300 total, or $50/person.  Of course with drinks, tax, and tip it totaled to $600, which still isn't bad considering how much we got to try.",5.0

Here's the cliff's notes on things that occurred on Sunday 12/18 at brunch.- While putting two tables together for our party, the waiter slammed my partner's finger between them. It was audible, noticeable and the mo fo' never even apologized.- They brought out everything (several appetizers and entrees) at the same time, even though we ordered it specifically to be separate - annnnnd beyond the fact that there was so little room on the table to accommodate it all at once.- One of the waitstaff dropped a plate of toast on the floor next to our table. I lost track of time as to when the toast was replaced ... or picked-up off the floor.- They got two side dishes wrong.- No smiles to be found, on any of the waitstaff throughout our arrival, during, etc.I really hope this place gets its act back together. Though the food was still quite good, the service - on all fronts - left a lot to be desired.",2.0

"NOT CHILDREN FRIENDLY.The food was good and has been consistent for years but the service, yikes. The host was rather miffed when we showed up for brunch at 10:15 am with no reservation. Then he was completely unhelpful with strollers. My son was sleeping so I didn't want to wake him.  After a back and forth, he finally ""allowed us"" to sit outside but we couldn't keep the stroller near the table. Luckily my son woke up so we could move the stroller into the stroller parking. Next, we asked for two high chairs (for the 2 toddlers with us) and he asked if one could sit in a chair (both toddlers were less than 2 years old); we said no. He said they only had one but he would double check. He brought out the second highchair (with an attitude) but with a warning ""if they aren't using it we will need it back immediately"". Bottom line- NOT CHILDREN FRIENDLY. Great for singles and young couples which is good since the neighborhood isn't filled with families.Oh, also the Weekend Punch (on the brunch menu) is normally not ready until after 2 pm- FYI.",2.0
"I went with my family on a Saturday a little before noontime. There weren't too many people and we were seated right away, but people kept trickling in and it became packed.We got the Mushrooms with Poached Egg & Bratwurst, Farmer's Breakfast, Pork Schnitzel and Herb & Gruyere Cheese Spätzle. Since I am not a big fan of mushrooms, I won't comment on that portion of the Poached Egg & Bratwurst dish. But I will say, and the rest of the table agreed, that the Bratwurst looked like a long breakfast sausage and tasted like the breakfast sausage in the Farmer's Breakfast dish  rather than a Bratwurst. The Farmer's Breakfast was fairly standard (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.), but not in a bad way. It was just done right.I've never had Pork Schnitzel before, but I must say that it was a real delight. The pork was tender with the perfect amount of crispy breading. The portion was fairly big too.I have also never eaten Herb & Gruyere Cheese Spätzle before. It really just reminded me of a really good and upscaled version of the traditional Mac and Cheese. The herb and gruyere cheese sauce was very rich and creamy. The Spätzle was more on the soft side similar to gnocchi rather than an al dente pasta dish. It would make a good comfort food alternate for those looking for something a little different.Service was good for the most part, but our waiter seemed like he was out of it. He was rather slow in getting our coffee and tea, which at the time the restaurant was maybe a quarter full.",4.0

Couple this with a soft homemade pretzel and I found myself ogling Prime Meats like Harold Crick ogled Ms. Pascal at the bakery in Stranger Than Fiction.Prime Meats is a great spot with a warm interior and a nice bar. The staff is great, each person is totally friendly and helpful and you get the feeling that they actually appreciate you coming in. One day I will get to the meat.___________________* They have not ok'd the parenthetical name addition that I have created, but if you go there and have one of their homemade soft pretzels, you will agree and sign the petition in my mind.**In order to feel more cavemanish and meat-worthy after ordering trout at Prime MEATS, I contacted some sea creatures and they all assured me that trout is actually the bacon of the sea so I feel better.",5.0
"I came here with a group of guys interested in trying burgers on a lazy, rainy Sunday evening and we ended up having a feast.  I think they could tell we were gonna be loud after our first round at the bar, so the (awesome) manager ended up sticking us downstairs at the chef's table just off the kitchen.  This is the way to go if you can do it!We started with the alpine tasting board which has bacon, bologna, sausage, and a host of other meats and goodies.  Then, we ordered 3 bacon cheeseburgers, and each took half a burger so we could try these.  Their burgers are made completely from dry-aged prime beef, and you absolutely must get it with gruyere cheese and thick-cut bacon.  They are mouth-watering and absolute heaven on the taste buds.After the burger, we ordered 36-day dry-aged bone-in ribeye for 3, which came out to 73 ounces.  They slice it up for you like you were eating sliced tri-tip.  If you can organize a group of 6 hungry guys, this sharing menu we created is definitely the way to go.  The food ended up being only $300 total, or $50/person.  Of course with drinks, tax, and tip it totaled to $600, which still isn't bad considering how much we got to try.",5.0
"What happened to the service? Went there recently and didn't recognize a single face, which wouldn't be so bad, if the service that was there was up-to-par. It must've been ""training day"" (... sorry, I'll fight the urge for sarcasm). Here's the cliff's notes on things that occurred on Sunday 12/18 at brunch.- While putting two tables together for our party, the waiter slammed my partner's finger between them. It was audible, noticeable and the mo fo' never even apologized.- They brought out everything (several appetizers and entrees) at the same time, even though we ordered it specifically to be separate - annnnnd beyond the fact that there was so little room on the table to accommodate it all at once.- One of the waitstaff dropped a plate of toast on the floor next to our table. I lost track of time as to when the toast was replaced ... or picked-up off the floor.- They got two side dishes wrong.- No smiles to be found, on any of the waitstaff throughout our arrival, during, etc.I really hope this place gets its act back together. Though the food was still quite good, the service - on all fronts - left a lot to be desired.",2.0
"A bicycle ride around brooklyn would not be complete without a stop at your neighborhood ""Prime Meats"" now would it.  But what they h3ll is a vegetarian doing stopping into this place, you ask?  C'mon, this is a stumptown haven, doesn't everybody know that?  When New York magazine reviewed this character from Portland Duane Sorenson coming to town to shake up the coffee scene, I made a note to self to come here at some point.  Now I've been to their Clinton Street spot, and their cafe on Court Street too, so I knew I was getting into something good here.Suffice it to say you'll be getting a-plus espresso shots here, even if the menu doesn't really match my palate.",4.0

"NOT CHILDREN FRIENDLY.The food was good and has been consistent for years but the service, yikes. The host was rather miffed when we showed up for brunch at 10:15 am with no reservation. Then he was completely unhelpful with strollers. My son was sleeping so I didn't want to wake him.  After a back and forth, he finally ""allowed us"" to sit outside but we couldn't keep the stroller near the table. Luckily my son woke up so we could move the stroller into the stroller parking. Next, we asked for two high chairs (for the 2 toddlers with us) and he asked if one could sit in a chair (both toddlers were less than 2 years old); we said no. He said they only had one but he would double check. He brought out the second highchair (with an attitude) but with a warning ""if they aren't using it we will need it back immediately"". Bottom line- NOT CHILDREN FRIENDLY. Great for singles and young couples which is good since the neighborhood isn't filled with families.Oh, also the Weekend Punch (on the brunch menu) is normally not ready until after 2 pm- FYI.",2.0
"I went with my family on a Saturday a little before noontime. There weren't too many people and we were seated right away, but people kept trickling in and it became packed.We got the Mushrooms with Poached Egg & Bratwurst, Farmer's Breakfast, Pork Schnitzel and Herb & Gruyere Cheese Spätzle. Since I am not a big fan of mushrooms, I won't comment on that portion of the Poached Egg & Bratwurst dish. But I will say, and the rest of the table agreed, that the Bratwurst looked like a long breakfast sausage and tasted like the breakfast sausage in the Farmer's Breakfast dish  rather than a Bratwurst. The Farmer's Breakfast was fairly standard (eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.), but not in a bad way. It was just done right.I've never had Pork Schnitzel before, but I must say that it was a real delight. The pork was tender with the perfect amount of crispy breading. The portion was fairly big too.I have also never eaten Herb & Gruyere Cheese Spätzle before. It really just reminded me of a really good and upscaled version of the traditional Mac and Cheese. The herb and gruyere cheese sauce was very rich and creamy. The Spätzle was more on the soft side similar to gnocchi rather than an al dente pasta dish. It would make a good comfort food alternate for those looking for something a little different.Service was good for the most part, but our waiter seemed like he was out of it. He was rather slow in getting our coffee and tea, which at the time the restaurant was maybe a quarter full.",4.0
"I don't care how good the food is here. I used to be a waitress, I know that dealing with customers can be a challenge. Someone needs to notify the staff that unfounded hostility toward customers is inexcusable. We had friends in town and the staff was unconscionably rude to my friend who politely asked about the menu. This was the last straw. Everytime I eat at Prime Meats I am treated like garbage and I'm sick of it. It's amazing, as former employees in the restaurant world, this is the only establishment in our neighborhood where my husband and I are treated as if we are an annoyance.  Some of our closest friends are good friends with the staff there, so I kept hoping that things would change.  Not so.

"Very large disclaimer here, this is a review for their breakfast only. Went on a Sunday morning. Place was pretty empty. Service was okay, not great. About 5 seconds before we finished, the salt and pepper was finally placed on our table. It was odd. The food was definitely disappointing. Had the biscuit with ham, egg, and cheese. Somehow the ham was bland. Is it possible to have bland ham? Egg was decent, nothing noteworthy. Cheese was... gruyere? Maybe? Stringy, bland, and added nothing to the sandwich. The biscuit was good, but so overpowering that the insides might as well not existed. Very disappointing. Prices were expensive for not great food. My sandwich was around 9 dollars. I would not go back for breakfast. I'd give it a try for dinner though.",2.0
"Like so many other places in the neighborhood, this place is over-hyped.Went to Prime Meats last night (Sat night) at around 7P after being told the wait for a table for four is 2 hours at Frankies 457(our first choice). Prime Meats next door told us the wait would be 5 minutes, incredibly lucky since the four people after us were told 2 hours. Our biggest complaint about this place would have to be the waitress. She was incredibly pushy. Aside from recommending things even after we had made our choices (i.e. kept pushing specific cheeses on us when our friend knew which cheeses she wanted), she would keep coming back and ask for our drink orders every couple of minutes.  It became kind of annoying, especially when she went into a wine recommending frenzy at the end of which our friend told her he was looking at the menu of mixed drinks. When he left the table to go to the bathroom, his unfinished drink was taken away. Aside from the waitress, the place was ok. Pretty nice decor and hit or miss food. It just so happened that most of ours was miss. My trout was delicious (I know I know a crime to have fish in a place with meats in the title), but that was probably thanks to the crazy amounts of butter that must have gone into the sauce. Our friends got the rib-eye for two and thought it had too much fat. My boyfriend got the strip steak and was not too impressed with his either. The spatzle was too creamy and heavy. Granted that the service might have had us looking for other things to dislike about this place, we left feeling that we won't be coming back here for more.This does not deter me at all from trying out Frankies.",2.0
"I debated between 3 and 4 stars. If I was going to judge this place based on their bone marrow appetizer I would give it 4 stars. The taste factor was exquisite. But how do you serve a tiny bone split in 2 and charge $18???Come on people, i go to the butcher's shop too, I know that bones with marrow are dirt cheap! The markup price is quite unbelievable here, actually insulting. All other appetizers we ordered were Lilliputian as well, what a bummer. The steak was very tasty, a great piece of meat.

In the last 24 hours, I know one person that had Sunday brunch there and one person that had Sunday dinner there who became distinctly (and in one case violently) unwell.

I was like, why am I not at a diner, eating diner food if it's going to be like this? (Also, the waiters look exhausted and/or terrified of the kitchen?

"Went for the first time with a friend who has been raving about this place for awhile. We seemed to arrive during a sift change, and the incoming staff was a little out of sorts due to a party that had run a little long. Regardless, the wait staff, while a tad bit inattentive at times was fine.I found the food to be very hit or miss. My friend had the mushroom salad which was amazing and perfectly dressed.  The German potato salad was uninspired and need more vinegar and IDK flavor?  I took mine home and will see if I can dress it up a bit.We both had the Weisswurst.  It was served traditionally, in a bowl of the water it was cooked in.  Weisswurst is my favorite sausage.  It is very mild and relies on heavily proper seasoning and preparation. The sausage we received was over-cooked and waterlogged. Also, after each bite, it felt like an oil slick erupted in my mouth, very unpleasant. The sausage does not come with sauerkraut , which is absurd in my opinion.  But if it did they wouldn't be able to charge you $7 for their over cooked, mushy sauerkraut. At $7 the kraut should be nothing short of sublime.  I didn't even bother to take this home.There is a silver lining both the Herb & Gruyere Cheese Spätzle and Sauteed Mushroom Spätzle were to die for. If I do return to Prime Meats these two dishes, and of course the beer selection, would be the only reason.  The mushroom spätzle was just so well executed, full of flavor and well seasoned. I wish everything we had had was so good.We finished with the chocolate cremeux.  I had never had it before and our waitress, either our 3 or 4th I forget, described it as mousse like. It is not really a mousse it is more like a thick, very rich pudding.

The hen/amish chicken entree was only okay; it was eaten, but not with as much relish as the other entrees.Our server was very good-- we had a table of 8 on a Saturday night. He knew all of the specials, gave thoughtful advice on ordering. Our water glasses never stayed empty, and all special requests for entrees were met. The cocktails were really, really bad. And the bar service, in general, was very, very slow.The hospitality/ host staff/ maitre'd was also really sub-par. They did a pretty bad job of making a large table feel welcome-- of note: we didn't even have a wait. They were just very unwelcoming and probably told us 10 times each to buy a drink at the bar while we waited the 2 and a half minutes to sit down. We wanted to order drinks and be merry-- but at the table. And nobody said goodnight to us at the end of the meal.

"So, um, I'm giving three stars to a very dimly lit, extremely expensive steakhouse (I'm vegetarian) that forces its staff to wear kitschy suspenders like a Disneyworld version of German culture. It must be good.There are two things besides price that are the most important in my dining experience: the food and the service. And the food here was very good. The flesheaters at the table all devoured that big old piece of steak with teeth a-gnashing and the coos of satisfied scavengers, and after compared it favorably to Peter Luger. And for me, there was more than one delicious vegetarian option. All of the appetizers and sides, including greens and fries and elaborate salads, were perfectly cooked. The main entree options included two German noodle dishes, and my choice of mushroom was not a mistake. Before the meal, we took to some of the Midtown-priced cocktails, that were very small but very well made.The staff was really friendly and helpful, giving us good advice, bringing my little cousin a fork when he dropped his at a speed I haven't seen since Quantum Leap, and warning my dutifully of the cake cutting fee if we chose to have the cake there, even if we cut it ourselves. Seriously, he warned me amply. I still wasn't ready for the charge ascending to $20, but at least we knew it was coming.Overall, a great culinary experience if you ignore the check, the too dark ambiance, and those suspenders.",3.0
"I decided to try this place out because some friends were staying nearby. I had heard wonders about their Egg & Cheese sandwich so I went for that and other breakfasty accoutrements. I had the Egg & Cheese w/bacon, the potato rosti and orange juice. First of all, don't get the sandwich on anything other than their buttermilk biscuit, you do not want to miss this excellently flaky and hearty biscuit. If I had to choose a meat for the sandwich it would definitely be the sausage, if only because you want this bacon on the side. BACON LOVERS TAKE NOTE: this is amazing stuff, I had to stop myself from getting more of the thick-cut bacon goodness. The rosti was far more delicious than I was expecting it to be and the orange juice was fresh.I was back for a dinner meal with some coworkers and it just gets better.The service is excellent, everyone is super friendly and they don't forget or strand you at your table.",5.0

"My hubby and I went there with some great friends a few weeks ago when we were visiting and we are still raving about it!  This beautiful, intimate, small space has a terrific staff that makes you feel right at home.  Friendly and super knowledgeable, they really made it a great experience.  The food was seriously phenomenal.  Comfort food that's full of flavor.  My husband can't stop talking about the burger - the best he's ever had.  And the steak I split with my girlfriend was unreal - so fresh and perfectly prepared.  We're holding this place as the standard for any new restaurant we try and I gotta tell you, no place has come even close.  Makes we wish we lived in Brooklyn instead of South Florida.  Sigh.",5.0
"We have been here a few times. Mostly dinner, which we have loved. I'm a veggie, and the options here are very very limited compared to most restaurants. I usually order the brussels and the spatzle sans meat. They are consistently fantastic. I love the pomegranate seeds with the brussel sprouts. YUM.  Oysters are great here, too. My hubby likes the burger, although it's a bit rich. We like the beer selection, although it's pricey for beer.We tried PM once for brunch and had a bad experience. Egg sandwiches on biscuits were difficult to eat - physically. The bread is a little dense and is dry. One person in my group had it with the thick bacon and left feeling ill.  Also, the service was really bad. The server seemed angry and ignored us the entire time. Bummer.We'll be back for dinner.",3.0
"Lively atmosphere, inviting rustic decor, romantic vibe, good food (German-inspired) and good drinks, generous portions, reasonable prices (except for the ""Dry-Aged Côte De Boeuf for 2"" which, while excellent, doesn't justify the $142 price tag - other restaurants, such as Convivium in Park Slope, have an equally good steak, if not better, of comparable size, for much less (at Convivium the steak might be better but is almost half price)), good service, and just a very pleasant experience overall. What else can one ask for? There's a reason this place is packed. The rave reviews are well deserved! If I'd live nearby, I'd be a regular. Will certainly return there again and again.ps, so far we've had:Côte De Boeuf for 2Chilled IcebergHampshire Grilled Pork ChopsPork SchnitzelWeisswurstPretzel Punch Wine.... and it was all delicious and very well done.",5.0

"Really great spaetzle (sp?)! Egg noodles + cheese and herbs = really, really tasty. In general, all of the food was really good. Recc the meat/cheese plate, it's good for sharing and has a great selection of different meats.  The french fries were also surprisingly note-worthy and awesome. The hen/amish chicken entree was only okay; it was eaten, but not with as much relish as the other entrees.Our server was very good-- we had a table of 8 on a Saturday night. He knew all of the specials, gave thoughtful advice on ordering. Our water glasses never stayed empty, and all special requests for entrees were met. The cocktails were really, really bad. And the bar service, in general, was very, very slow.The hospitality/ host staff/ maitre'd was also really sub-par. They did a pretty bad job of making a large table feel welcome-- of note: we didn't even have a wait. They were just very unwelcoming and probably told us 10 times each to buy a drink at the bar while we waited the 2 and a half minutes to sit down. We wanted to order drinks and be merry-- but at the table. And nobody said goodnight to us at the end of the meal. So yes- 3 stars because overall the food was pretty tasty, the wait staff was very attentive and helpful, but the hospitality and bar side of the business was pretty disappointing.",3.0
"I rarely venture to Brooklyn, but I must say this was a treat. The homemade Pretzels and mustard are Amazing !! Had the Steak Frites and it was a perfectly cooked and big sized cut of meat. Everyone had a great meal with the choices they made. I also tased the Pork Schnitzel and it was very good.Great atmosphere for a date or dinner with friends. The staff were friendly and on top of things !!",5.0
"So, um, I'm giving three stars to a very dimly lit, extremely expensive steakhouse (I'm vegetarian) that forces its staff to wear kitschy suspenders like a Disneyworld version of German culture. It must be good.There are two things besides price that are the most important in my dining experience: the food and the service. And the food here was very good. The flesheaters at the table all devoured that big old piece of steak with teeth a-gnashing and the coos of satisfied scavengers, and after compared it favorably to Peter Luger. And for me, there was more than one delicious vegetarian option. All of the appetizers and sides, including greens and fries and elaborate salads, were perfectly cooked. The main entree options included two German noodle dishes, and my choice of mushroom was not a mistake. Before the meal, we took to some of the Midtown-priced cocktails, that were very small but very well made.The staff was really friendly and helpful, giving us good advice, bringing my little cousin a fork when he dropped his at a speed I haven't seen since Quantum Leap, and warning my dutifully of the cake cutting fee if we chose to have the cake there, even if we cut it ourselves. Seriously, he warned me amply. I still wasn't ready for the charge ascending to $20, but at least we knew it was coming.Overall, a great culinary experience if you ignore the check, the too dark ambiance, and those suspenders.",3.0
"I decided to try this place out because some friends were staying nearby. I had heard wonders about their Egg & Cheese sandwich so I went for that and other breakfasty accoutrements. I had the Egg & Cheese w/bacon, the potato rosti and orange juice. First of all, don't get the sandwich on anything other than their buttermilk biscuit, you do not want to miss this excellently flaky and hearty biscuit. If I had to choose a meat for the sandwich it would definitely be the sausage, if only because you want this bacon on the side. BACON LOVERS TAKE NOTE: this is amazing stuff, I had to stop myself from getting more of the thick-cut bacon goodness. The rosti was far more delicious than I was expecting it to be and the orange juice was fresh.I was back for a dinner meal with some coworkers and it just gets better.The service is excellent, everyone is super friendly and they don't forget or strand you at your table.",5.0

"I am going to make a bold statement. And I'm fairly certain it's going to ruffle some feathers, but I'm going to say it anyway: I think, to a degree, Prime Meats -- like the Emperor in Hans Christian Andersen's tale -- has no clothes. Or it is at least half-naked.The food is very good, to be sure. Prime Meats wouldn't have garnered so much attention if that wasn't the case.I also think it was a bold move for the owners to focus on German cuisine - although perhaps therein lies their genius.But somehow Prime Meats, despite its delicious food, doesn't have the warm, inviting atmosphere of other restaurants of its caliber. That is not to say it is not aesthetically pleasing. But it is permeated by a sense of entitlement that belies the site's humble history as a dry cleaning business.On a recent weekday, one of the owners waltzed about with his French bulldog in hand with such an air of confidence, I wondered if he would actually get in trouble if a health inspector dropped by or if he could simply say, ""Do you know who I am?"" and get away with it.I'll repeat: The food is very, very good. You can get a fine steak here - and this is a neighborhood that cannot otherwise boast a good steakhouse.But I think the fuss over this restaurant is partly psychological. In other words, I think part of the reason people rave about it is the same reason the head cheerleader and the quarterback of the football team are powerful in high school. It's not necessarily because they're good people...Sam Sifton did an excellent job describing diners in his NYT review last May: ""...brownstone bohemians, third novelists, people with Web sites, with good art at home.""They are served by waiters in beards, skinny jeans and suspenders...or, as Sifton described them, ""a crew of handsome men and women dressed as if ready to ride horses back home to Bushwick, where they trap beaver and make their own candles.""I am admittedly a struggling writer with a degree that has so far not justified its pricetag...and perhaps if I had landed a job at the New York Times or Conde Nast, I would feel more welcome here. But I don't. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of a restaurant where I've felt so unwelcome. I could perhaps understand if I was dressed inappropriately or was spewing profanities. But I wasn't. I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. And I live very close. I walk by virtually every day. And yet when I decided to drop by to take advantage of an oyster special and the restaurant was unoccupied with the exception of one other party, it took 15 minutes for our drinks to come and yet another 15 more for the oysters to appear.""I'm sorry, but the oyster guy is backed up,"" our waiter explained as the table next to us received their second platter of oysters and we checked our watches.We were eventually served and, as noted, the food was good. But at no point did I feel my business was wanted or that I would ever be compelled to return...unless I was suffering from acute hubris and needed my ego cut down to size by a staff eager to imply that I wasn't good enough to eat there.It's not just me. I've heard stories from neighbors who were deemed unfit to mingle with the clientele and who were encouraged to sit at the bar or move along.Take Frank Bruni on Twitter, for example. On January 5, he wrote, ""At Prime Meats last nite, didn't think: I'm in BROOKLYN!""In his defense, he went on to say, ""Didn't mull geography. Just ate well at super place. The borough has plenty.""But, at the same time, a Brooklyn prejudice seems terribly outdated and pompous...and somehow completely fitting for this restaurant that calls the borough its home.",3.0
"Prime Meats is one of my neighborhood favorites, especially for guests. There's usually not too long of a wait, especially at brunch, and the lunch is also fantastic (one of the best burgers I've ever had). The atmosphere is great--warm and inviting, and even the wait staff with their faux prohibition-era garb manages to be cute, not pretentious.

"Hate to say this, but hands down the worst service I've had ... ever.If you want better service, try Dunkin' Donuts.If you want better service and better food, try Buttermilk Channel.We started the night intending to go to Frankies 459 but due to the wait we they suggested we try Prime Meats, next door. at 7PM, they quoted us for a 40-45 minute wait and took our name and number. 30 minutes later I received a call letting me know we we're next on the list and there were several tables clearing and that it shouldn't be more than 30. After 40 more minutes of waiting and watching several large groups leave, I went in to check our status and was told without explanation we were looking at another 45-60 minutes before being seated. My look of shock was quickly responded to by: ""well we can seat you outside now if that works?"" It was warm and beautiful out so we agreed and were promptly seated.Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and overall very helpful with the menu and getting us situated. Unfortunately while we were placing our dinner order, the weather took a sudden turn and went from warm and calm to light rain ... and within minutes to pouring rain. Again, our waiter was extremely helpful in working with us through this and ensured that he'd try to get us inside at a table or cover us with as many umbrellas as needed to keep us dry and comfortable. The weather did not cooperate and we ended up being quickly ushered inside with a 15-20 minute wait before getting a table. Greatly hospitable with the number of folks in the restaurant and unplanned weather shift.This is where the service began to take a substantial dive, which should've been a positive turn. Our waiter from outside was no longer assigned to us, but instead .. actually we're still not sure. The remainder of the night we were ""assisted"" by no less than six different servers - none of which introduced themselves, asked how we were or acknowledged us in any meaningful way. The first of these, who's first any only statement for over an hour was ""oh do you guys need menus?"" which we let him know that we had already put our order in outside. He didn't verbally respond and quickly turned away.Another man came by shortly after letting us know that our food was on it's way and wanted to know if ""everything was okay outside of being caught in the rain"" and we all with no enthusiasm responded ""just great in light of..."".From there, our courses and servings came out massively delayed and ill-timed -- where two of the three main courses were dropped off, with a side dish (missing serving utensils and plates)  -- leaving me with nothing to eat. It took 10 minutes for someone to come by to check on us, when I quickly informed them I didn't have anything to eat (partially obvious with no plate in front of me). They quickly came back with my missing dish, though extremely late.The long waits and mistiming continues here ... after over 30 minutes, half our party left, and everything had been eaten, another new set of servers quickly swooped in to clear part of the table without acknowledging us. Another 10 minutes before yet another server came by to ask only ""if we needed anything else"". (Note still the table is still full of empty dishes) Finally the original server from inside comes back asking if we want desert and I responded, ""no just the check please"". Yes, again more long waits here ... it took more than 15 minutes for him to bring the bill. At this point, I've chalked the night up to bad service based on weather and the crowd being too much to handle (though not a valid excuse from a top-notch establishment).The water drops the check off and mumbles from what I could make out before he walked off mid-sentence, ""i guess there was some problems with the service ... and ... we helped ... sorry"", while rolling his eyes.Wow, great way to end a meal ... a sarcastic apology for inattentive and   slow service for a $180+ dinner for three.",1.0
"Love this place! Go for oysters and wine / beer or a real sit down dinner. Neither will disappoint. My husband and I go here every couple of weeks as it is in our neighborhood and for some reason we always get a seat. The waiters are very professional and the quirky outfits add to the old world vibe.I have eaten many things on the menu but the highlights are these:The spaetzel - this is over the top delish. We usually get the one with gruyere and herbs and it is out of this world. Toothsome noodles, tons of high quality cheese, butter and herbs. The charcuterie board is amazing - they have thick cut bacon, high quality ham, and even beef tongue (which is seriously melt in your mouth - weird I know since it's tongue). Oh and the pate?? My friend from Paris came with us and she thought it was as good as what she gets in bistros in Paris.The salads are always wonderfully light fresh and market fresh. Never overdressed and always balanced.Steak tartar - perfect! I was with a big group and they all got steaks and raved about the quality and taste. I don't really do steak but I take their word for it.All in all - you can't go wrong at Prime Meats. I would say my only complaint is sometimes the hostesses get snippy and tell you it's going to be an hour wait and then you speak with someone else and they say it will be 5 minutes. It's also super loud in the back dining room so if you are trying to have a conversation with more than 1 person it tends to be challenging.",4.0

Wait staff was nice too. They had Meyer's hand soap in the bathroom.The main problem is the prices are too high. It becomes a place that you go to once to splurge + to tell your friends you tried it. It's not a Brooklyn restaurant that you can go to again and again. Let me give you an example: 16 dollar burger + 2 dollars for cheese = 18 dollar hamburger.

"The DeBragga & Spitler Dry-Aged (36 Days) Côte De Boeuf is a must-have. The marbling, flavor and aging was spot on. More importantly (the part where most fail), it was cooked with absolute perfection. The Roasted Beef Bone Marrow was amazing. They served a quality product and prove why ingredients matter. For those of you visiting the bar, the cocktails were excellent. The beer selection was great - I liked their exclusive brew too, but I saw a lot of others on that list that I'd like to pair with a nice cut of beef. It won't be a problem, since I will be back over and over again. Do yourself a favor, just head on down to Prime Meats, if not you will definitely be missing out on one of the top restaurants in New York City.",5.0

"Prime Meats showcases the whole ""Brooklyn"" dining scene.You know what I am talking about: turn-of-the-century storefront, flickering filament light bulbs, tattooed waiters and waitresses wearing tucked in flanel shirts and vests, taxidermy and dark wood, locally sourced ingredients, artisan cocktails, 19th century cookware, and an utmost appreciation for the kind of food that must've been eaten by the Central European immigrants who came through Ellis Island.Prime Meats does the whole Brooklyn thing well (as does Marlow & Sons in Williamsburg, and Freemans in the LES, etc, etc). They've created a great atmosphere with which you can use to show off the city to out of town guests.But for the Brooklynite, is there still appeal? Yes. The menu was tasty and hearty, with the freshest of ingredients. 4 stars for that. Oyster plate was a fantastic way to start out the meal, with each variety barely exceeding the $3/piece mark and tastes of the crisp sea permeating every slurp. The meal only got better from there, with the Vesper Brett showcasing an impressive array of Brooklyn-does-Alpine coldcuts. Think fresh pickled cucumbers and onions, cured bacon, German sausages and paper thin slices of bologna. Welcome to German lodge food, friends; the trip won't stop here. Fresh pork Wiener schnitzel was also mighty tasty, as was the bib lettuce salad with large pieces of tangy radishes (such an unappreciated vegetable!). The herb & gruyere cheese spaetzle was more of a gourmet version of mac and cheese, and is reason enough to return. For dessert, we indulged in a warm chocolate cake, which sounds standard, but surprised us with a few shots of espresso in the cake batter.5 stars would have been awarded if the dishes were out-of-this-world inventive (which they aren't) or the prices were dirt cheap for quality grub (which they aren't).For about $50 a person, including 1-2 drinks, I'd say Prime Meats was a reasonable indulgence. They make hearty food. They create a comfortable antique-y atmosphere. Guaranteed to be a delightful experience, provided that you can get a table. My solution: get there before 6:30pm, start with pre-dinner cocktail and then slowly move into dinner -- you're guaranteed a spot for the night.",4.0
"So disappointing.  And a little bit smug.First the compliments:  The cocktails are great - tasty, fun, smart, tasty, normally priced. The decor is pretty, as are the servers.  It's like you've wandered into a Frank Wedekind Spring Awakening theme steakhouse. It's cute. So far so good.But... when the wait times are close to two hours on a weekend and the steak is $70 - $120 (for two, depends on size), they've set expectations that are a little higher than cute. And they don't meet them.   Sure the spatzle is amazing, but the prime meats weren't. The steak was fine, but not great (and the pre slicing made it get cold quickly).  The sauce was feh.  The burger wasn't cooked the way ordered.  The pork roast was good, but that was as much about the bacon and beans etc.  The service was really bizarre.  Our wait was 1 hr longer than we'd been told to expect.  Our appetizers took 30 min (it's a cheese plate, really?)   And while the staff is all attractive and articulate, they were actually incredibly surly.  Maybe something happened that night, maybe their boss is a jerk, maybe it's just a required part of the Spring Awakening angst thing.  And here's the kicker - the bathroom was a hot mess (but nothing you couldn't clean up in 2 minutes). And 30 min later, when another member of our party went, it looked the same.   I mentioned it to a server and he said, ""yeah, we just dont have time to get to that during the night"".  It's a restaurant, son.  A clean bathroom is kind of important.  You've been open for months.  You're supposed to be able to handle a crowded night and still have time to empty the garbage and put in new toilet paper.  What does the kitchen look like?Look, I love dive bars.  But at these prices, I shouldn't get divebar service.  There are so many other great restaurants within a few minutes of this place (including some owned by the same guys).  I'd say go to one of them, put your name down and then get a drink at Prime Meats while you wait.  You'll get the ambience, which, sadly, is the best part.",2.0
"I visited Prime Burger right after it first opened, and was unimpressed.  The burger was overdone and tasteless, service so-so; I ended up disappointed especially since I like Frankies' so much.  I went back after a few years to give it another shot, and my opinion has completely changed.  Service is attentive, professional and friendly (plaid workshirt and mustache uniforms notwithstanding), wine and beer selection is great, and the food that I've had is incredible.  On separate occasions, I've had the roast beef sandwich, spatzle, pork chop, pickle sides and burger.  They were all great (roast beef seems to only be a lunch option), but the burger was especially mind-blowing.  Perfectly seared, it literally bursted with juice.  It was served on a house-made roll that was toasted and very slightly sweet.  I don't throw these accolades around lightly; this was the best burger I've ever had.  Meat is largely locally sourced and they name the farms.We're fortunate to have some excellent restaurants in the neighborhood, but I was surprised by how good Prime Meats has become.",5.0
"Most likely won't be going back.Disclaimer: I don't eat meat.The mimosas were waaaay over priced, the potato leek soup was meh at best, and the server was clearly somewhere else. (Although, his suspenders were kinda cute.) Also, non-stop Bob Dylan the entire time we were there. I like Dylan and all, but I don't need a full serving with brunch.On the upside, the pretzels were pretty good, and the fruit seemed relatively fresh.",2.0
"Yes, it's silly that the waiters wear 1800 old west saloon costumes-kind of makes you feel like you are in a restaurant in Disney World or at a Mumford and Sons concert (i can only imagine that's what it would look like)- BUT the food is actually pretty good. Had a steak, a pretzel, and a cheeseboard. The steak was excellent.They also have a fancy cocktail menu with fancy names, if you are into that stuff.

"So a few things about this place. 1.  Mast Brothers Chocolate Mousse--I could eat this every day for the rest of my life and be perfectly content.  Sea salt, fresh whipped cream, super dark chocolate, yes please! 2. My contentment with the delight that is this mousse unfortunately was covered in a dark cloud of assholery that happened to be our waiter.  We've been to Prime Meats a few times--the meal is always good, I dont eat meat so my opinion is slightly biased, but the bf does and he loves everything he eats.  Brunch is meh... Id rather go to buttermilk channel any day.  But dinner--pretzels, salads, oysters, all amazing.  Its justunfortunate that the service tends to be on the ""too-cool-for-school"" side of things.  Dear waiter of last Saturday,  yes, we are a little loud, and yes we are a little drunk, but its a friends birthday and there are 10 of us and you stand to make a ton of cash off us, despite the already included 20% gratuity, had you been nicer or, not even nice, but cordial, we might had tipped you significantly extra (most of us have waited tables at various points in our lives and understand how horrible it can be).  But we said please and thank you and listened when you spoke but you couldnt even pretend to smile, in fact you didnt try to hide the stick that was up your butt as we ordered cocktails, appetizers, oysters, entrees, and dessert and coffee.  Oh prime meats, I know its cool to be distant and aloof, but seriously, if it wasnt for the awesome pretzels, I probably wouldnt go back after that experience.",3.0
"Prime Meats is a Carroll Gardens gem! Not a secret, because people regularly cross the bridges (and then some) to get here. While I've had brunch and weekday lunch here, I'd have to say dinner's the strongest meal. Why? Well, you just feel slightly less awkward getting bone marrow at dinner I say. When we can't resist it, my husband and I have shared the Côte de Boeuf and it's amaze-balls. I witnessed a mostly-vegetarian friend gladly order bratwurst and be happy about it. Basically, no I wouldn't take a vegan here at all. But if you have friends who enjoy great cocktails, marrow, schnitzel, pretzels, beer, steak you'll be satisfied. There also may or may not be a very special room for lucky people to have extra-special cocktails, but this room probably existed only one glorious night in my imagination as I'm not sure the staff would admit its existence. Get the Vesper Brett or the marrow to share, settle in and have a cozy evening...or afternoon. But remember to have cash handy if you do not have an American Express.",4.0
"Came here for brunch (by accident, while waiting for a different reservation) and am so glad I did!  Love the decor here - very rustic and charming, like the inside of a log cabin.  Got the steak and eggs and hubby got the bratwurst with potato salad.  Great quality meats, beautifully cooked.  The farm eggs are heaven - creamy and golden, just perfect.  The bloody mary had too much horseradish for me, but if you like your drinks with a kick, then you'll enjoy it.  Will definitely come back!",5.0
"Great food! I love the coffee here. The wait is normally pretty long if you wait for brunch on a weekend.We had the Mushrooms with Poached Egg & Bratwurst and Egg & Cheese Sandwich w/ Bacon. We also ordered a croissant. All of the food was delicious. The bratwurst was really good w/ the mustard, so make sure to get mustard.I only have two complaints about this place though. First, service was reeeeally slow. We waited almost 20 mins just to get change back. Second, the place definitely feels a little pretentious.

Think fresh pickled cucumbers and onions, cured bacon, German sausages and paper thin slices of bologna. Welcome to German lodge food, friends; the trip won't stop here. Fresh pork Wiener schnitzel was also mighty tasty, as was the bib lettuce salad with large pieces of tangy radishes (such an unappreciated vegetable!). The herb & gruyere cheese spaetzle was more of a gourmet version of mac and cheese, and is reason enough to return. For dessert, we indulged in a warm chocolate cake, which sounds standard, but surprised us with a few shots of espresso in the cake batter.5 stars would have been awarded if the dishes were out-of-this-world inventive (which they aren't) or the prices were dirt cheap for quality grub (which they aren't).For about $50 a person, including 1-2 drinks, I'd say Prime Meats was a reasonable indulgence. They make hearty food. They create a comfortable antique-y atmosphere. Guaranteed to be a delightful experience, provided that you can get a table. My solution: get there before 6:30pm, start with pre-dinner cocktail and then slowly move into dinner -- you're guaranteed a spot for the night.",4.0
"So disappointing.  And a little bit smug.First the compliments:  The cocktails are great - tasty, fun, smart, tasty, normally priced. The decor is pretty, as are the servers.  It's like you've wandered into a Frank Wedekind Spring Awakening theme steakhouse. It's cute. So far so good.But... when the wait times are close to two hours on a weekend and the steak is $70 - $120 (for two, depends on size), they've set expectations that are a little higher than cute. And they don't meet them.   Sure the spatzle is amazing, but the prime meats weren't. The steak was fine, but not great (and the pre slicing made it get cold quickly).  The sauce was feh.  The burger wasn't cooked the way ordered.  The pork roast was good, but that was as much about the bacon and beans etc.  The service was really bizarre.  Our wait was 1 hr longer than we'd been told to expect.  Our appetizers took 30 min (it's a cheese plate, really?)   And while the staff is all attractive and articulate, they were actually incredibly surly.  Maybe something happened that night, maybe their boss is a jerk, maybe it's just a required part of the Spring Awakening angst thing.  And here's the kicker - the bathroom was a hot mess (but nothing you couldn't clean up in 2 minutes). And 30 min later, when another member of our party went, it looked the same.   I mentioned it to a server and he said, ""yeah, we just dont have time to get to that during the night"".  It's a restaurant, son.  A clean bathroom is kind of important.  You've been open for months.  You're supposed to be able to handle a crowded night and still have time to empty the garbage and put in new toilet paper.  What does the kitchen look like?Look, I love dive bars.  But at these prices, I shouldn't get divebar service.  There are so many other great restaurants within a few minutes of this place (including some owned by the same guys).  I'd say go to one of them, put your name down and then get a drink at Prime Meats while you wait.  You'll get the ambience, which, sadly, is the best part.",2.0
"I visited Prime Burger right after it first opened, and was unimpressed.  The burger was overdone and tasteless, service so-so; I ended up disappointed especially since I like Frankies' so much.  I went back after a few years to give it another shot, and my opinion has completely changed.  Service is attentive, professional and friendly (plaid workshirt and mustache uniforms notwithstanding), wine and beer selection is great, and the food that I've had is incredible.  On separate occasions, I've had the roast beef sandwich, spatzle, pork chop, pickle sides and burger.  They were all great (roast beef seems to only be a lunch option), but the burger was especially mind-blowing.  Perfectly seared, it literally bursted with juice.  It was served on a house-made roll that was toasted and very slightly sweet.  I don't throw these accolades around lightly; this was the best burger I've ever had.  Meat is largely locally sourced and they name the farms.We're fortunate to have some excellent restaurants in the neighborhood, but I was surprised by how good Prime Meats has become.",5.0
"Most likely won't be going back.Disclaimer: I don't eat meat.The mimosas were waaaay over priced, the potato leek soup was meh at best, and the server was clearly somewhere else. (Although, his suspenders were kinda cute.) Also, non-stop Bob Dylan the entire time we were there. I like Dylan and all, but I don't need a full serving with brunch.On the upside, the pretzels were pretty good, and the fruit seemed relatively fresh.",2.0
"Yes, it's silly that the waiters wear 1800 old west saloon costumes-kind of makes you feel like you are in a restaurant in Disney World or at a Mumford and Sons concert (i can only imagine that's what it would look like)- BUT the food is actually pretty good. Had a steak, a pretzel, and a cheeseboard. The steak was excellent.They also have a fancy cocktail menu with fancy names, if you are into that stuff. Also, I saw a lot of people eating oysters and they seemed to love it.",4.0
"I love prime meats.  Great space, Awesome meat,  and great implementation of a germanically-influenced concept.  If you can get past the fact that all the waiters are dressed like gay lumberjacks, then you'll fall in love.   They've got one of the best burgers in the city.  Their ingredient quality shines through the uncomplicated cuisine.   It's also a bangin' brunch spot.  So go there.",4.0
"So a few things about this place. 1.  Mast Brothers Chocolate Mousse--I could eat this every day for the rest of my life and be perfectly content.  Sea salt, fresh whipped cream, super dark chocolate, yes please! 2. My contentment with the delight that is this mousse unfortunately was covered in a dark cloud of assholery that happened to be our waiter.  We've been to Prime Meats a few times--the meal is always good, I dont eat meat so my opinion is slightly biased, but the bf does and he loves everything he eats.  Brunch is meh... Id rather go to buttermilk channel any day.  But dinner--pretzels, salads, oysters, all amazing.  Its justunfortunate that the service tends to be on the ""too-cool-for-school"" side of things.  Dear waiter of last Saturday,  yes, we are a little loud, and yes we are a little drunk, but its a friends birthday and there are 10 of us and you stand to make a ton of cash off us, despite the already included 20% gratuity, had you been nicer or, not even nice, but cordial, we might had tipped you significantly extra (most of us have waited tables at various points in our lives and understand how horrible it can be).  But we said please and thank you and listened when you spoke but you couldnt even pretend to smile, in fact you didnt try to hide the stick that was up your butt as we ordered cocktails, appetizers, oysters, entrees, and dessert and coffee.  Oh prime meats, I know its cool to be distant and aloof, but seriously, if it wasnt for the awesome pretzels, I probably wouldnt go back after that experience.",3.0
"Prime Meats is a Carroll Gardens gem! Not a secret, because people regularly cross the bridges (and then some) to get here. While I've had brunch and weekday lunch here, I'd have to say dinner's the strongest meal. Why? Well, you just feel slightly less awkward getting bone marrow at dinner I say. When we can't resist it, my husband and I have shared the Côte de Boeuf and it's amaze-balls. I witnessed a mostly-vegetarian friend gladly order bratwurst and be happy about it. Basically, no I wouldn't take a vegan here at all. But if you have friends who enjoy great cocktails, marrow, schnitzel, pretzels, beer, steak you'll be satisfied. There also may or may not be a very special room for lucky people to have extra-special cocktails, but this room probably existed only one glorious night in my imagination as I'm not sure the staff would admit its existence. Get the Vesper Brett or the marrow to share, settle in and have a cozy evening...or afternoon. But remember to have cash handy if you do not have an American Express.",4.0
"Came here for brunch (by accident, while waiting for a different reservation) and am so glad I did!  Love the decor here - very rustic and charming, like the inside of a log cabin.  Got the steak and eggs and hubby got the bratwurst with potato salad.  Great quality meats, beautifully cooked.  The farm eggs are heaven - creamy and golden, just perfect.  The bloody mary had too much horseradish for me, but if you like your drinks with a kick, then you'll enjoy it.  Will definitely come back!",5.0
"Great food! I love the coffee here. The wait is normally pretty long if you wait for brunch on a weekend.We had the Mushrooms with Poached Egg & Bratwurst and Egg & Cheese Sandwich w/ Bacon. We also ordered a croissant. All of the food was delicious. The bratwurst was really good w/ the mustard, so make sure to get mustard.I only have two complaints about this place though. First, service was reeeeally slow. We waited almost 20 mins just to get change back. Second, the place definitely feels a little pretentious. If you can get over those two things, you'll be able to enjoy your meal.",4.0
"Spacey me...Back in May BFF & I stopped in to celebrate the Kentucky Derby.The bartender highly recommended the daily punch which sounded like a deal...but $5 and 3 sips it was gone.  That was a tease.Thank goodness I ordered the old fashion which was perfect!See my image and you'll be sure to order a few :-)This a a stunning set up, a lovely aroma of calla lilies as you enter, dark wood --very handsome interior.  Now, just need another moment to travel back to this spot of Brooklyn.",5.0

"WOW! Prime Meats is restaurant that will rival many of the Best Brooklyn and Manhattan Steak House's! Prime meats is not a steak house, but it serves damn good steak! The atmosphere is charming with a long bar when you walk in and low lighting. If you go on a weekend there will be a wait. We waited a short time enjoying Prime Manhattan's which is a combo of Rye and Bitters rather than the traditional bourbon, it a excellent Manhattan that lends itself to Lemon garnish perfectly. We looked over the raw bar which is presented like a jewelry case. At this point I decided to make the night a special dinner and see if Prime can live up to my standards. We started with Oysters on the half, they offered 3 type we tried one of each and they were excellent. We moved on the Bone Marrow (any restaurant that serves marrow is after my heart). The Marrow took longer than expected and comped us some home made warm pretzels while we waited (they were good), but not as good as the Marrow! I was in awe, marrow served on the bone with toast points. Yum! We decided to have the bone in Rib-Eye for 2, they brought the cut out for us to review it was 36oz beauty. Prime charge per oz and every oz was worth. Served pre sliced and perfectly cooked, we paired it with seared brussel sprouts with pancetta and frittes, how can you go wrong. It was a wonderful meal and evening! Prime holds its on with the best of steak houses with out the (sometimes) obnoxious steak house atmosphere!

"I came hear on a Tuesday night for dinner with my husband on a whim. Luckily, it was a lovely night. First, I have to say how surprised I was; it was packed. We only had a 10 minute wait but we couldn't even find a spot at the bar. My only compliant is that once we were seated in the dining room it was so noisy. We could barely hear each other & at times even texted something that the other person couldn't make out. We started with the oysters which were perfect. I followed it with the fish special, the tilefish & butter clams. The portion size was perfect & the food cooked perfectly. My husband had the skirt steak which was good but a little fattier than he'd like. We had several drinks, enjoying some options off their cocktail menu, but were too full for dessert.

"Wow.  I can't believe what a dismal experience this was.  From the second our waiter wandered over to our table looking like it was his first hour on the job, I had a bad feeling.  We waited forever to have our order taken and the place wasn't very busy.  My friend asked to have one of the wines on the menu described and the answer was vague, generalized and completely off the mark because when said wine arrived at the table it was acidic beyond words.  We had a salad to start which was good and both ordered steak frites as an entree, 1 rare and 1 medium rare.  Not only was the meat tough but cooked to at least medium well.  Once we finished with dinner we hoped a yummy dessert could salvage the meal.  We ordered the strudel and I asked for a sherry recommendation and explained I like something on the sweeter side, not dry and somewhat dark in colour.  Our waiter delivered something light in colour and extremely dry which actually turned out to not even be sherry.  After this he kind of disappeared (we didn't see him again for the rest of the meal) so we flagged down a different  waiter who was kind enough to remedy the sherry situation and deliver our ice cold strudel that possibly came out of a box in the back.  Bleck.  Nothing good about this dinner at all.  I can think of many better ways to drop $150 and will NOT be returning to Prime Meats.",1.0
"Great service, great atmosphere, great service, great food.  Great time!  I'm reluctant to give 5 stars since I've only been once but I left with a great taste in my mouth.  literally.There is a lot of variety on the menu with something for every budget and taste.  I was in the mood for a good burger and they delivered.  Don't skip on the bacon or cheese.. and go with medium rare.  I like my patty a little charred on the outside to give it that light crisp when you bite into it.... it also acts like a casing for all the juices that eventually ooze out of the meat.  The thick cut bacon is a winner (if you like it that way).  Also try the homemade pretzels... at $3 its a bargain.  I watched all the surrounding tables order the steak and geez I wish I had more room.  Next time!",4.0
"WOW! Prime Meats is restaurant that will rival many of the Best Brooklyn and Manhattan Steak House's! Prime meats is not a steak house, but it serves damn good steak! The atmosphere is charming with a long bar when you walk in and low lighting. If you go on a weekend there will be a wait. We waited a short time enjoying Prime Manhattan's which is a combo of Rye and Bitters rather than the traditional bourbon, it a excellent Manhattan that lends itself to Lemon garnish perfectly. We looked over the raw bar which is presented like a jewelry case. At this point I decided to make the night a special dinner and see if Prime can live up to my standards. We started with Oysters on the half, they offered 3 type we tried one of each and they were excellent. We moved on the Bone Marrow (any restaurant that serves marrow is after my heart). The Marrow took longer than expected and comped us some home made warm pretzels while we waited (they were good), but not as good as the Marrow! I was in awe, marrow served on the bone with toast points. Yum! We decided to have the bone in Rib-Eye for 2, they brought the cut out for us to review it was 36oz beauty. Prime charge per oz and every oz was worth. Served pre sliced and perfectly cooked, we paired it with seared brussel sprouts with pancetta and frittes, how can you go wrong. It was a wonderful meal and evening! Prime holds its on with the best of steak houses with out the (sometimes) obnoxious steak house atmosphere! Just remember it is cash only and can get pricey with cocktails, wine, steaks, sides and apps!",4.0
"There are a number of things I've fantasized about doing, but assumed they would remain fantasies being too improbable, even downright ridiculous, for the real world.  Like outrunning the police in high speed chase while driving a lamborghini...  bringing a hostage situation to an end by single handedly disarming multiple assailants (Jason Bourne style) and saving everybody.  Another situation seemingly too fantastic for reality is having breakfast at Prime Meats. But I've done it.  Now, I haven't done those other things, so I don't know how they all compare, but I have to say that brunch at Prime Meats is pretty incredible.",5.0
"Five stars because although no single element is absolutely perfect, Prime Meats achieves perfect aesthetic synthesis: great food in the standards-done-brilliantly mode, an atmosphere that's designed for comfort and service that manages to be both professional and laid back.  And a big, recently added bonus: if you have to wait for a table, you can go next door and browse the tiptop vinyl collection at Black Gold and someone will come fetch you when your time comes.  Great beer and wine selection, and they have Underberg, too, the world's most effective and addictive digestif, served in a tiny gold goblet.  Excellent.  I could live here.  The Franks score again.",5.0
"I came hear on a Tuesday night for dinner with my husband on a whim. Luckily, it was a lovely night. First, I have to say how surprised I was; it was packed. We only had a 10 minute wait but we couldn't even find a spot at the bar. My only compliant is that once we were seated in the dining room it was so noisy. We could barely hear each other & at times even texted something that the other person couldn't make out. We started with the oysters which were perfect. I followed it with the fish special, the tilefish & butter clams. The portion size was perfect & the food cooked perfectly. My husband had the skirt steak which was good but a little fattier than he'd like. We had several drinks, enjoying some options off their cocktail menu, but were too full for dessert. The bill came out to $150 before tip. Overall, I'd totally go back. It's worth trying for sure & the surrounding neighborhood is great to walk around.",4.0
"Gtfo. This place rocks my soul. Love their brunch items, love the pretzels (what! pretzel baguette!) I went in there thinking that this place was going to be slightly overrated, wrong.

Haven't tried the dinner menu, only lunch and brunch - both were fantastic!",5.0
"I wanted to review Prime Meats, but after waiting for 25 minutes to be seated at one of the multiple empty outside tables, I was told that my dog would have to be tied up to the streetpole about ten feet away -- and in the harsh Summer sunlight.

"Dinner on a Saturday evening -- the place was packed but we scored a nice table and settled in for what turned out to be a very good meal. Service was attentive, professional and friendly, a major plus, with natty and engaged waitstaff.I started out with The Documentary cocktail - rum, lime, mint & branca menta - invigorating and well-mixed, and also had some very fresh oysters from the raw bar. A selection of salads -- including red cabbage with walnuts and parsley, and bibb with pumpkin seeds, radishes and pumpkin seed oil -- was light and refreshing, and the mild weisswurst with pretzel roll was good, too. The dry-aged côte de boeuf was an impressive hunk of meat (paraded out on a platter before it was roasted), but when it finally arrived sliced and plated, I felt was not worth the high price tag. At over $100 for two (at $2.85/oz. given its size), the meat was fairly bland, not as tender as it could be, and several pieces were a bit gristly. Herb and wild mushroom spatzle made for a rich and tasty side, as did an order of hot, crisp frites. Sauteed kale, while plain, help cut through the unctuousness of some of the other dishes.We were really too full for dessert, but managed to share some crème brûlée and chocolate mousse.Tab with tax/tip came to ~$175 pp, but would have been less had we opted for other mains.

Meat platter, fruit plate, ham and pear sandwich, bacon, schnitzel & eggs and mortadella. I'm not a very daring when it comes to meat, but I absolutely loved their cured and thick cut bacon and the ham. The schnitzel was also a standout for me.. It was simple, creamy and not too cheesy. The sandwich was perfectly toasted and the poached pear was delicious with the Dijon mustard and cheese. We finished with chocolate mouse which was very rich, but the perfect way to end a great meal.

"My husband had originally wanted to go to Two Toms for his birthday this past Tuesday, but they were closed that night bc of their summer hours.  We were both really bummed because we had been psyching ourselves up for large cuts of meat.  I did a quick search on Yelp for possible replacement dinner locations, and after weighing the options, I decided to take him to Prime Meats.And I'm so very, very glad I did.I was concerned by some of the negative characterizations of the restaurant as ""hipster""--there's nothing wrong with a young and enthusiastic crowd, but I was worried it would be a young, obnoxious crowd that you can sometimes encounter  around Park Slope, Williamsburg, Gowanus, etc.  No one wants to feel like they aren't welcome at a restaurant, especially on their birthday.  However, we found the wait staff and other patrons to be diverse in age and not ""exclusive"" at all.  On the contrary, the front of the house greeted us with a smile, seated us immediately, our waitress attended to us without rushing our orders, apologized when drinks took a bit longer than expected, and everyone was very pleasant.  We walked in at 8pm and found the restaurant busy but not wall to wall with diners.The key reason I chose Prime Meats was the menu.  There is an excellent variety of options so that everyone in a party can find something.  My husband and father-in-law started with a dozen oysters (I believe the waitress said the offering all came from Massachusetts this time around).  I would've joined in, but I'm laying off the raw seafood during my pregnancy.  I looked at the beautiful plate of oysters longingly while they inhaled each one happily.  They looked delicious, and I was told they were fresh and had a nice briny flavor.  I chose the bone marrow appetizer, and it too was fantastic.  I wish the bones had a bit more marrow in them considering it was priced at $18, but the roasted garlic and gremolata helped to thicken out each serving.  My husband and father-in-law also had Maytag Blue and Bacon salad.  They didn't rave about it like the oysters but mentioned it was a solid starting salad.  Prime Meats also has a great drink selection.  Again, I couldn't partake but I was told that the Prime Meats Pilsner was refreshing and came out frosty cold.  I was also told that the Miramar Cooler and Manhattan were solid cocktails.For main entrees, my father-in-law went with the lamb stew.  He cleaned his plate thoroughly.  He was excited to see it on the menu and was pleased that the flavors were balanced.  My husband and I split a 31oz cote de boeuf.  We ordered it medium-rare, asking them to lean toward rare.  They present the cut of meat to you before they serve it, and i wasn't sure if we'd even be able to finish it at first.  But we did.  Because we have no shame and it was worth every delicious bite.  They cooked the cut perfectly, it was not over seasoned but had just enough salt to bring out the natural flavors of the meat.  They left enough fat on their to make me want to cry at how it melted in my mouth.  The watercress salad served with it was lightly dressed with some sort of lemon/acidic dressing that complimented the meat.  We also had a side of pull beans that were dressed in butter.  It all came together wonderfully.  It's 3 days later and my husband is still talking about that steak.We decided not to get dessert at the restaurant because we had a pie waiting at home from Four & Twenty Blackbirds.  The dessert menu is pretty small (three options), but I'm willing to give it a try the next time we dine there.  The coffee and espresso were tasty though.Overall, the food was amazing and the service was great.  I can see why some people may not enjoy the serving style, as it was more slowly paced than many other restaurants.  Of course, if a patron is constantly signaling for wait staff or are clearly desiring a more speedy service, it's up to the wait staff to adjust.  However, we were happy that they let us take our time and didn't rush us through our meal.  They were there and attended to our needs, but they were not in our face while we ate.  And our server had a pretty decent sense of humor, so that was a plus.We will be back.  As God as my witness, we WILL be BACK.",5.0

"When I think German/Austrian food, I think heavy, rich and meaty with plenty of starch and a sliver of vegetable.  When I think of the new BK food scene, I think down-to-earth, simple, and sometimes a little too hipstery.  When you combine the two rather successfully, you get Prime Meats.  We were in the area in the early evening on a sunday, and got lucky in getting seats right away b/c about 30 minutes later (around 630), the place had the bustle of a thursday night.

Complete with all the fixins and some deliciously crisp fries, it was a burger platter that any restaurant should be proud of. Along with the burger, we shared the beef sauerbraten and braised cabbage with pretzel dumplings, which was the divisive dish--I don't mind sweetness in a braised short rib, and it reminded me of korean galbijim, so I really enjoyed it.  My friend on the other hand, was not a fan of the sweetness, and thought it dulled the natural flavor of the meat. In the end, I ate most of it, so win win for me. Finally, our meats wouldn't have been complete without a proper side, herb and gruyere spatzle, which turned out to be the biggest surprise of the night. It delivered all the creaminess and cheese that a good mac/cheese has while maintaining the springy chewiness of the spatzle. Definitely a must when I return.

"My husband had originally wanted to go to Two Toms for his birthday this past Tuesday, but they were closed that night bc of their summer hours.  We were both really bummed because we had been psyching ourselves up for large cuts of meat.  I did a quick search on Yelp for possible replacement dinner locations, and after weighing the options, I decided to take him to Prime Meats.And I'm so very, very glad I did.I was concerned by some of the negative characterizations of the restaurant as ""hipster""--there's nothing wrong with a young and enthusiastic crowd, but I was worried it would be a young, obnoxious crowd that you can sometimes encounter  around Park Slope, Williamsburg, Gowanus, etc.  No one wants to feel like they aren't welcome at a restaurant, especially on their birthday.  However, we found the wait staff and other patrons to be diverse in age and not ""exclusive"" at all.  On the contrary, the front of the house greeted us with a smile, seated us immediately, our waitress attended to us without rushing our orders, apologized when drinks took a bit longer than expected, and everyone was very pleasant.  We walked in at 8pm and found the restaurant busy but not wall to wall with diners.The key reason I chose Prime Meats was the menu.  There is an excellent variety of options so that everyone in a party can find something.  My husband and father-in-law started with a dozen oysters (I believe the waitress said the offering all came from Massachusetts this time around).  I would've joined in, but I'm laying off the raw seafood during my pregnancy.  I looked at the beautiful plate of oysters longingly while they inhaled each one happily.  They looked delicious, and I was told they were fresh and had a nice briny flavor.  I chose the bone marrow appetizer, and it too was fantastic.  I wish the bones had a bit more marrow in them considering it was priced at $18, but the roasted garlic and gremolata helped to thicken out each serving.  My husband and father-in-law also had Maytag Blue and Bacon salad.  They didn't rave about it like the oysters but mentioned it was a solid starting salad.  Prime Meats also has a great drink selection.  Again, I couldn't partake but I was told that the Prime Meats Pilsner was refreshing and came out frosty cold.  I was also told that the Miramar Cooler and Manhattan were solid cocktails.For main entrees, my father-in-law went with the lamb stew.  He cleaned his plate thoroughly.  He was excited to see it on the menu and was pleased that the flavors were balanced.  My husband and I split a 31oz cote de boeuf.  We ordered it medium-rare, asking them to lean toward rare.  They present the cut of meat to you before they serve it, and i wasn't sure if we'd even be able to finish it at first.  But we did.  Because we have no shame and it was worth every delicious bite.  They cooked the cut perfectly, it was not over seasoned but had just enough salt to bring out the natural flavors of the meat.  They left enough fat on their to make me want to cry at how it melted in my mouth.  The watercress salad served with it was lightly dressed with some sort of lemon/acidic dressing that complimented the meat.  We also had a side of pull beans that were dressed in butter.  It all came together wonderfully.  It's 3 days later and my husband is still talking about that steak.We decided not to get dessert at the restaurant because we had a pie waiting at home from Four & Twenty Blackbirds.  The dessert menu is pretty small (three options), but I'm willing to give it a try the next time we dine there.  The coffee and espresso were tasty though.Overall, the food was amazing and the service was great.  I can see why some people may not enjoy the serving style, as it was more slowly paced than many other restaurants.  Of course, if a patron is constantly signaling for wait staff or are clearly desiring a more speedy service, it's up to the wait staff to adjust.  However, we were happy that they let us take our time and didn't rush us through our meal.  They were there and attended to our needs, but they were not in our face while we ate.  And our server had a pretty decent sense of humor, so that was a plus.We will be back.  As God as my witness, we WILL be BACK.",5.0
"I'm a sucker for a great tartar and manhattan. Prime Meats offers both along with excellent service in a gorgeous chic library-esque setting.

I came to brunch here this past Sunday. It was a comfortable spot on a rainy morning.

"Maybe I need to give this place another try.  Maybe I didn't order one of their stellar dishes?  I got some type of a tasting board with various 'cold cuts'...bologna, proscuitto, something similar to mortadella, some chicken pate(?), pickles.  To me, it just tasted like cold cuts, albeit obviously good quality ones that were not produced in a 'meat plant'.  There was nothing awe-inspiring about it.  I will say however that the chicken pate/mousse was excellent, as was the bread served with the platter.The service was somewhat lackluster.",2.0

"This place was a remarkably pleasing surprise. I went with a group of four on a Saturday morning for brunch. Our intended destination was Buttermilk Channel, but apparently they are closed on Saturdays. We came all the way from Bushwick so we were initially really put off. But after a quick walk up and down Court St, we decided to stop in here. I don't know whats not to love about this place, especially if you are boozy like me and/or have lots of cash to spend (It's not inexpensive and the portions aren't huge). We waited about 15 minutes at the bar for a table, but I was fully preoccupied with drinking one of the best bloody mary's I've had in my life. There, I said it. It didn't look fancy from afar, but upon first sip I knew it was special. I had been excited about Buttermilk Channels list of specialty bloody marys, so maybe I was just in the mood but I think I liked it because it had really good horseradish-- and lots of it. Regardless, it was easy to see our bartender knew what was up because we subsequently ordered an old fashioned, a manhattan and the punch and they were all top notch. The punch that day was a whiskey cinnamon something served in a little antique punch glass. LOVE.And oh! The beer. They had Weihenstephaner and a German pilsner that I can't remember the name of on tap, served in giant ceramic German mugs. The pilsner was outstanding, especially considering that I'm not a big pilsner fan when on this side of the pond. I guess I'll just have to go back so I can remember the name. Pull my arm, why don't ya. They also have growlers of these for your take home consumption.Okay, enough about booze. Onto the eats. The two men at the table ordered the Prime Meats burger and although I was dissappointed that they went with the safe option, I have to admit it was a darn delicious classic burger if I ever had one. Luckily, I was able to convince one to order it medium (can someone explain to me why one would ever go to a place like this and order anything well done?) and he was glad that I stepped in. I ordered the Gruyere and caramelized onion omlette which came with a side of mixed greens and what I can only describe as a slice of hash cake. Don't matter what ya call dem potatoes, they were great. Crusty on the outside, gooey in the middle.  Yum. The side of thick cut bacon. Don't ask questions, just order it and thank me later. The last of our party had the french toast. I can't express in words how good it was, you're just going to have to go and see for yourself. It was like candy. The outside of the bread was almost caramelized, the inside warm and gooey. Hands down best french toast I've ever had. Bottom line, what started out as a really disappointing and frustrating trip all the way from Bushwick to Carrol Gardens ended up being the best brunch I've had in my 6 months in NYC. I can't wait to go back for dinner.",5.0

"There's been a lot of hype around Prime Meats, and understandably. The proprietors already had success with the two ""Frankie's"" restaurants in Carroll Gardens and the Lower East Side. I'm awful fond of Frankie's 17, which is one of my neighborhood standbys, and had been looking forward to checking out their new venture. Unfortunately, I left somewhat unimpressed.The food was all serviceable, and good for what it was. It just seemed the hype outweighed the product. Prime Meats is a decent, well-priced (most entrees are under $20) neighborhood joint - and that's about it. It didn't strike me as anything worth travelling for.The cooking is hearty, homey, soul-satisfying, very in line with the current Zeitgeist. But for the most part dishes are one-note. The chicken, marinated in pickle brine, could have been been brined in any simple sugar/salt solution for all it tasted of pickle. There was no sense of the meat having been corned at all. Maybe they need to up the spices? I don't know. The breast meat was juicy, the pulled thigh very good, but in the end nothing really elevated it beyond something something I could make at home with minimal effort. Nothing stood out as particularly unique.Trout, in a Meunière sauce, was perfectly cooked with deliciously crispy skin, but again - nothing one hasn't had before or will have again elsewhere. A bone marrow appetizer was nice, but nothing compared to other marrow preparations like Blue Ribbon's or Prune's.Frankie's has a number of standout dishes - their cavatelli are a work of rustic art, worth going back for again and again. But nothing I tried at Prime Meats had that effect. Nothing will stand out, except perhaps the house-made pretzels (which were excellent, if a touch overpriced at $3 each) a week from now.That said, the prices are good, and I can see PM becoming a neighborhood staple - decent food in a relaxed setting - a la a Schiller's or something. Not somewhere you go to be blown away, just to have a comforting casual meal. I would certainly go back to try a little more - some of the more ""German"" items looked interesting - if I happened to be in the area. But I wouldn't go make a special trip of it.",2.0
"Went here last Saturday night and had a good time. Two of us had the greens salad which was good, but it was heavy on the mustard, one of us had the carrot salad and said it was very good.

The other person had roasted chicken, and had no complaints. I think with 3 salads, 4 dinners, 4 drinks from the bar and one soda the total was around $170.

"Went to Prime Meats for Valentine's Day dinner with my partner.  Overall, it was a delightful experience - the atmosphere of the restaurant is that perfect nouveau old timey Brooklyn vibe that so many places have now - tin ceilings, black metal light fixtures, exposed brick, dark wood.  They sat us at the window table and the big old-fashioned x-mas lights cast a warm glow over our table as we watched the traffic on Court street go by.  It was a lovely setting.We started with their oyster special - cooked in vermouth cream - with pickled vegetables.  It was delicious - just very small - appropriate (barely) for one person, and not really enough to share.  Four tiny poached oysters floating in vermouth cream, with slivers of pickled vegetables dusting the top.  We also started with the vesper brett - a selection of their meats.  Not sure if it was just me (in that I don't have the palate for German/Alpine meats/sausages etc) but didn't care for any of the meats aside from the Kassler ham - yum yum.  Came with pickled onions, pickles, brown bread and butter. I had their chicken special - brined for 48 hours in pickle juice and served with greens (collards, I believe) and mashed potatoes.  This was the star of the meal for me - some of the best chicken I've ever had - crispy dry skin topping juicy, flavorful, tender meat - silky mashed potatoes, delicious bitter sweet greens, and topped with satiny au jus.  Just amazing.   My man had the weisswurst - two white German sausages - with pretzel roll and spicy sweet mustard.  This comes in two sizes - with one sausage or two.  I believe if you get two you should also get two pretzel rolls - rather than just the one - would better facilitate the sandwich making.  The sausages were perfect though - smooth spiced mellow filling, tight skin. Yum.I drank delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS sparkling white wine - Ugni Blanc - GREAT value at $9 a glass.  My man had a Pilsner - which he enjoyed.We finished with a Stumptown Americano (perfection, obviously) and their chocolate tart which featured Mass Bros chocolate, Stumptown espresso, and sea salt.  All was delicious- the shortbread crust was a bit heavy for my taste - and too thick in terms of the ratio of bread to chocolate.Overall like many people it was good - not great.  However, I'd definitely go back just for that chicken again. Yum-o.Excellent service as well - by cute waiters in Alpine inspired checked shirts and suspenders.",3.0

Yum.I drank delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS sparkling white wine - Ugni Blanc - GREAT value at $9 a glass.  My man had a Pilsner - which he enjoyed.We finished with a Stumptown Americano (perfection, obviously) and their chocolate tart which featured Mass Bros chocolate, Stumptown espresso, and sea salt.  All was delicious- the shortbread crust was a bit heavy for my taste - and too thick in terms of the ratio of bread to chocolate.Overall like many people it was good - not great.  However, I'd definitely go back just for that chicken again. Yum-o.Excellent service as well - by cute waiters in Alpine inspired checked shirts and suspenders.",3.0
"They know meat, that's for certain. Wandered in for a late-ish dinner around 8:20 and was told that there was going to be a 15 min wait. Grabbed a drink at the bar, and didn't more than 5 mins before being led to a table in the side room. Ordered the pork chop and a the prime burger; and was warned by the waitress that the chop would take a while because ""it was on the bone"". I thought that was somewhat ominous but figured that maybe this would maybe mean a 20 min vs. 10 min wait time.  Wrong.  I ended up wait 35+ minutes, at which point my dining companion and I both agreed that the chop better be the best friggin' chop I've ever tasted or else we'd be pretty po'd at the wait.  Just as we were ruminating on whether we cut our losses and left, the food arrived. The burger was flavorful and cooked perfectly; but honestly, kinda boring. The chop juicy and full of flavor, and cooked amazingly well.  I had been worried that it was going to be stick dry given the lengthy cooking time, but it was perfectly tender.  My one gripe with the chop -- other than the unduly long prep/cook time -- was the uneven salting as some bites were extremely salty. Still, on the whole I was extremely impressed.  I'll likely be back to further explore the menu, but for now it's just ""a-ok"" and not ""yay!"" or ""omfg!"".",3.0
"Damon, Frankie ""Cocktails,"" + Julian are three of the best bartenders in Brooklyn, and they man a mean little ship of a vintage bar.

"Many primal meat eaters will wonder whether they should order the $142 cote de boeuf - here's why I took the plunge and why you should save your money.

Prime Meats is not a steakhouse - it's a place to enjoy the meats you order less often at fine dining restaurants - sausages, bone marrow etc. The prices are actually quite reasonable (other than the cote de boeuf) and if I had not duped myself into ordering the most expensive item on the menu (thinking I would be receiving a commensurate increase in quality), I would have given this place four stars and considered one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood.

Regardless, the steak lacked much seasoning and I really had to pour the chimichurri sauce on.  With a good steak, you shouldn't need any sauce.  And this wasn't a bad steak, but if I'm going to surrender to another steak house, I need to be wowed.  I will say the $23 price tag for a 12 ounce steak in New York is almost unheard of I can see people flocking here just for a bargain.-eatthisny",3.0

It was good but next time less syrup please, self.Strangely they didn't really rock the meat despite it being in their name.

"Oh Dear. Wanted to love this place--I love Frankies 17, Frankies 457, and Cafe Pedlar. But for some reason, the vibe here was...off. Food was phenomenal, but the wait staff is uppity. Sometimes your entire experience with a restaurant can be colored by a rude and inappropriate waiter. I was here a few months ago with my mother, and we ordered two entrees and an appetizer to start. Immediately the waiter seemed pissed off (maybe because we didn't order drinks), and so recommended that we order an additional appetizer since the food would ""take a long time"" to get out. This seemed weird. We told him we were fine just noshing on bread and our cheese plate. So, he brought out our food without speaking to us for the rest of the meal. No ""how is everything?"", no checking up on us. I believe he filled our water glass once but that was it. After we were done with our food, plates sitting there for about 20 minutes, he happened to pass our table, at which point, my mother had asked to see the dessert menu. The waiter stated, ""You're gonna have to wait--I am in the middle of something,"" which was a very defensive answer that was not necessary. A simple, ""One moment...I'll be right back"" conveys the same message and takes exactly the same amount of effort to recite.  Again, after our dessert plates were empty before us for 20 minutes, we had to ask him for the bill.

"My friend Alice has been in town for work-(and food)-related reasons, and gave me one night to booze and dine her... in Brooklyn. This is a big deal since for the most part, she kind of abhors the trek to other boroughs. So it was my one chance to impress her with my restaurant-pickin-skillz. With Prime Meats, I think I did damn good. 5 stars for the WHOLE experience. Interior: Cozy, a lot of love for booths in there. We had a window seat- best in the house. Had our own coat hangers on the wall- the little things make all the difference. Service: Awesome. Food: Where do I begin? The trout salad was phenomenal. Tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Gravlax with Waldorf Salad- also good, light on the mayo, thank god. Cabbage salad- least favorite of the bunch, but really refreshing. Walnut oil is such an under-hyped oil, but it adds a nice nutty bite to anything you dress it with.  Bavarian pretzel was my favorite of the starters. It's served with a sweet mustard and farmstead butter. What's not to love?                    The steak frites comes perfectly aged with a really delicious chimichurri style sauce- so garlicky and herb-infused. That sauce would be good with anything. I'd hide in my room alone on a snowy day and just drench a bowl of French fries with this sauce. And then sop up the leftover sauce with some hot rolls. Also loved the Goulash with Spaetzle. There's a ton of paprika and cumin in the goulash and that just about won me over. And the spaetzle? A stinky gruyere to take the richness of this dish to the next level. This wasn't my dish, but I had dish envy all night. To drink, we each had the punch of the day. Cranberry ginger beer with bitters and a German Cognac. For a non-drinker like me, it was perfect, served in little punch glasses, conjuring up images of Christmas parties and birthday piñatas. But that could have just been from overconsumption delirium. I left the place with a couple of pants buttons undone. Damn those high-waisted pants! I'm obviously an amateur.",5.0

I believe they're going for the niche market with the German menu, spiffy outfits and having only a few things on the menu, which in my mind equals quality. You won't get lost in pages and pages of mish-mash; you'll get one or two forms of meat and some great sides, and what's wrong with that? Unless you're a vegetarian. To date we've had their pretzels, burgers, steaks, fries, sausage, drinks, spetzle and it's all great. Don't be shocked if you get the evil eye stare down, mouth-agape stare if you order your burger well done. Hell! I don't want to end up like that paralyzed girl! SORRY!

My friend and I both ordered sandwiches. I got a Tuna Sandwich which was pretty damn good. My other friend ordered a crazy breakfast with sausage, toast and bacon. Didn't try the anything else but the toast was delicious. We went to go pay and realized it was cash or Amex only. I think I would have been more annoyed if I didn't have Amex, but I guess I should have asked if they took cards (or read the yelp reviews) instead of assuming. All in all a great experience, and I'll probably be back soon.",4.0
"We went back this summer and it turned out that the 'we only accept Amex' deal only lasted for like, a month.  It just happened to be when we were there last fall.  So I am happy to add the 5th star now that they accept all major credit cards.",5.0
"I've been here a few times. ALWAYS satisfied with the food.  my family LOVES this place.   I may even have blogged about this place before.  However, our party of 5 were here last week and it was HORRENDOUS.   Our waiter a tall bald gentleman had an attitude and a half.  We are always freindly and outgoing, but this guy was a mess.   He ""argued"" instead of informed us of things...turning nice quiet requests into stressful conversation with him.   He didn't write our frigging order down...so he got our order WRONG...hello?? can you say pen and pad?????   I wanted biscuits and gravy and he said they only come with eggs.   I said well i will pay same just let us have the biscuits and gravy, keep the eggs....he just didn't GET IT. finally I said fine just give me the entire order...and guess what?  we never GOT IT either...he forgot.  My son ordered a coffee and NEVER GOT IT.  My other son ordered sausage and he got that 40 minutes after we had our orders.  I asked for a burger with cheese, I didn't get cheese.  When I told the waiter I ordered the specialty cheese on it, he err again and brought me a burger with swiss cheese....i hate swiss.    My son ordered a steak and egg meal and they didn't give him cheddar on what he ordered they gave him SWISS....like HELLOOOOO is there an abundance of swiss back there?   The waiter when we asked about this dish or that and the menu change occurring in a half hour and if we can get apps off the breakfast and in an half hour get the 400 menu entrees and he made this big hissy fuss about it was being too much trouble....blah blah blah...we said fine and moved on but he was still fussing about everything else.   I couldn't even get a lemon for my water.....he does NOT belong in that environmet.   We are very generous 25-30% tippers when we go out, we have young sons who rely on tips from their jobs...so we know how hard they work for them...but i WAS NOT LEAVING THIS GENT more than 15% for his LACK of PERSONALITY, MEMORY AND LACK OF CARE.",2.0
"I love this place!  It's perfect for so many occasions; had a really special, celebratory dinner here with my boyfriend almost a year ago that is still fresh in my memory...perfect place to take your mom to show how charming and delicious Brooklyn can be (she loved the oysters), and where else can you have a serious breakfast meeting at 8am on a Tuesday? I've found the servers here do a great job of being extremely attentive, without feeling the need to make how fun and interesting they are an integral part of your experience...know what I mean? The food has received most of the attention in reviews here but the cocktails are seriously on point!  Wish they had bar stools, that's my only complaint.",4.0
"My friend Alice has been in town for work-(and food)-related reasons, and gave me one night to booze and dine her... in Brooklyn. This is a big deal since for the most part, she kind of abhors the trek to other boroughs. So it was my one chance to impress her with my restaurant-pickin-skillz. With Prime Meats, I think I did damn good. 5 stars for the WHOLE experience. Interior: Cozy, a lot of love for booths in there. We had a window seat- best in the house. Had our own coat hangers on the wall- the little things make all the difference. Service: Awesome. Food: Where do I begin? The trout salad was phenomenal. Tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Gravlax with Waldorf Salad- also good, light on the mayo, thank god. Cabbage salad- least favorite of the bunch, but really refreshing. Walnut oil is such an under-hyped oil, but it adds a nice nutty bite to anything you dress it with.  Bavarian pretzel was my favorite of the starters. It's served with a sweet mustard and farmstead butter. What's not to love?                    The steak frites comes perfectly aged with a really delicious chimichurri style sauce- so garlicky and herb-infused. That sauce would be good with anything. I'd hide in my room alone on a snowy day and just drench a bowl of French fries with this sauce. And then sop up the leftover sauce with some hot rolls. Also loved the Goulash with Spaetzle. There's a ton of paprika and cumin in the goulash and that just about won me over. And the spaetzle? A stinky gruyere to take the richness of this dish to the next level. This wasn't my dish, but I had dish envy all night. To drink, we each had the punch of the day. Cranberry ginger beer with bitters and a German Cognac. For a non-drinker like me, it was perfect, served in little punch glasses, conjuring up images of Christmas parties and birthday piñatas. But that could have just been from overconsumption delirium. I left the place with a couple of pants buttons undone. Damn those high-waisted pants! I'm obviously an amateur.",5.0
"New Review: Dear Prime Meats - your new facade is corporate/smorporate and it's killed the vibe, you loose a star(old review)Prime meats is the hot next door neighbor that you wish you could hang out with and most importantly have people see you hanging out with. I believe they're going for the niche market with the German menu, spiffy outfits and having only a few things on the menu, which in my mind equals quality. You won't get lost in pages and pages of mish-mash; you'll get one or two forms of meat and some great sides, and what's wrong with that? Unless you're a vegetarian. To date we've had their pretzels, burgers, steaks, fries, sausage, drinks, spetzle and it's all great. Don't be shocked if you get the evil eye stare down, mouth-agape stare if you order your burger well done. Hell! I don't want to end up like that paralyzed girl! SORRY! But really, i think you can trust their meat and it's solid good eats. Great for a rainy-day late afternoon meal to last you through the eve.",3.0
"I went here with a bunch of friends. We were supposed to get dinner but nothing on the menu jumped out to us, so only one person ended up getting a meal. I shared the steak tartar with a friend and it was great. But the rest of the night was just ok. The service was perfunctory. He didn't seem to be paying much attention and didn't get the drink order right. No big deal. The one thing that always turns me off from a place is when they charge too much for simple stuff. Their homemade pretzels were great but not $3 great.  They were fairly small. The same with the beer. The sixpoints which are a standard beer throughout Brooklyn were $8. It sours you to wanting to spend more, you feel like you're getting gipped. All in all it was a decent place, nothing I would recommend my friends to go to.",3.0
"It's soooo good.  Who cares if it's loud or dark?  The food tastes really good, definitely one of the better names on the bib gourmand list.  The potato salad is delicious, their pretzels are delicious, I'm pretty sure everything German on their menu is really good.  And...it's not expensive at all.  A great, great, everyday neighborhood kind of place.",4.0
"Rudest service ever.  I went here with my boyfriend and his mother who was visiting from out of town.  We hadn't seen each other in a while and so we ordered a round of cocktails and then wanted to talk for a few minutes before ordering.  The waitress was unbelievably rude and we would have literally walked out if we weren't so hungry.  She came back for our order 3 times in the span of 10 minutes and at the last time asked ""Are you ready to order?""""No, we haven't had a chance to look at the menu since the last time you asked.""""Well, can you get to it?""THEN, she took my drink away before I was finished with it while I was in the bathroom.  I hated this place.",1.0
"I had a lovely lunch here with a friend at Prime Meats. Around the corner from their restaurant front, there is a small specialty goods store where they sell lots of German and Italian specialty goods, fresh sausages and other meats, and a take out window. My friend and I picked up lunch here before heading over to Carroll Park to eat under the shade and people watch. I had the sauerbraten on a pretzel roll ($10) and my friend had the herb and wild mushroom spatzle ($8). Both of them were insanely delicious and, although the boxes looked small, they were incredibly filling. You can tell that all their food and pasta is freshly made, and it makes everything so much more amazing.",5.0
The food here is really amazing.  One of the better burgers in the city (I had mine with the house bacon) and the drinks are excellent.  A very cozy warm feeling place.  Everyone that works here is very pleasant and friendly.I have to give them three stars for now till they get the extended seating area done.  Very small cramped space and sitting at the bar while you wait is not even an option......... because there is not enough room for bar stools. It also makes it very hard to get into.  Last time I went it was a three hour wait which meant that we were going to be seated at 11:30.  You might as well tell me that you are booked for the night.,3.0
"Went here for brunch and it was wonderful. A quintessential Brooklyn spot with dark wood, high tin ceilings, and a giant bouquet of magnolia branches. Fantastic bloody marys. Had the smoked trout salad which was incredibly good, and also an AMAZING buttermilk biscuit. So delicious. If you're looking for a Decemberist vibe a la Grateful Dead soundtrack, unironic bearded men in plaid, and all kinds of delicious locally sourced food, in other words, a deeply *now* Brooklyn experience, this is the spot.",4.0
"The food here is good. That is if it ever gets to your table!It lost two stars for the shoddy service.I went there with my boyfriend this past Friday night. Totally went there on a whim and were told we had to wait 1/2 hour for a table. No biggie- we went to the bar and had a drink. Southern, the bartender was awesome in helping us pick a great cocktail and was just all around cool.45 minutes later we get our table. We wait a bit for our waitress. We order the pretzel appetizer. Skip it! It came out 20 minutes later and was hard as a rock- but we ate it because we were starving and tipsy at this point.  Another 20 minutes later I ask the waitress if our food was coming out soon. The table who were seated after us already got their food and we were still waiting. C'mon....I'm pretty laid back but for a restaurant like Prime Meats to make you wait THAT long for your dinner..not cool.When we finally got our meal- I had the schnitzel which was buttery yumminess. My boyfriend had the steak frites and that was yummo too! Guess what though? Our waitress forgot our side dish- the gruyere and herb spaetzle. It came out later but she did comp us because I think she finally realized how sh*tty her service was. She admitted to forgetting to put in the order!She wasn't all that nice either.So the question is do we return? Not likely- there are too many other great restaurants out there with great service too!",3.0
"Even though this review is from about 2 months ago, my mouth is watering just remembering all the details.  We spent the day hanging out with our friends who live in Brooklyn.  It was a great day of conversation, photography, and Brooklyn neighborhood exploration.  It couldn't have been a better day for all of us.... that is until we sat down at the best seat in the house.  We were forewarned that there might be a slight wait by our hosts but when we got there - there was about a 45 minute to 1 hour wait.  The hype was already built and we were too tired, after a full day of walking around several neighborhoods in Brooklyn, that we decided to grab a few cocktails and wait it out.  Not only did we only wait about 25 minutes (and everyone including our hosts promised, without over hyping it, that it would be  worth the wait), but we got the best booth with a window in the house.  We started off with the warm home made pretzel, which was good but small in size compared to what you usually get on the streets.  Not too salty and was a nice little bite to wet our appetites.  We then moved onto our primary appetizer, the roasted beets, pickled beets, bitter greens, grapefruit & pine nut brittle.  Now I'm not a big beet fan to begin with but hey, I'll try anything at least once and good thing I did because the balance between the pickled beets, the greens, and the grapefruit was rather nice and refreshing.  Gave me a whole new outlook on beets although I must admit, I won't be drinking beet smoothies anytime soon like some of my healthier friends and colleagues.  Since this is a German steakhouse, we had to try the pork schnitzel - perfectly pounded out and cooked and placed over bacon potato salad. Holy SCHNITZEL!!! Extremely tender, not greasy at all, and all the flavors were there as advertised - glad we shared this one but may get it as my main course next time.  The ladies got a chicken and fish dish and they seemed to both enjoy it quite a bit but on to most amazing steak I've had in a very long time - drum roll please .... the Cote Boufe for 2. Medium well, extremely nice crust on the outside and so succulent and tender on the inside. Salt/pepper, and that's all it needed. Served with a simple arugala salad and sliced radish w/ an olive oil drizzle. They show you the cut before it's cooked so you can approve the selection. The bone barely made it off the table by the time we were done with it. I've gone to a lot of steak houses in my time and if I'm ever in a position to request a last supper, this dish would easily make it on that list.  It truly isn't for the faint of heart and please don't try to eat it yourself.  My buddy and I shared this dish, two serious meat lovers and it was just perfect.  At $2.75 an ounce, for a ~38 - ~42 ounce cut of perfectly aged and grilled piece of succulent tenderness, Prime Meats totally lived up to all the hype.  If you're a steak lover - this place is a must try!!!!",4.0
"I'm pretty surprised this place doesn't have a higher rating... Must be the fact that they're cash only, because the food AND the service were both outstanding.  I came here with my family for thanksgiving dinner.  The prices were pretty reasonable, given the amount of food we all got and how much restaurants love to overcharge for holiday meals.  (Full turkey dinner was only $16!!  Both butternut squash soup and pumpkin pie were each around $5).  Every single bite of my thanksgiving dinner was SCRUMPTIOUS!  I had a bite of my Dad's steak, and it was ALSO SCRUMPTIOUS!  The soup.. SCRUMPTIOUS.  The pie...SCRUMPTIOUS.  The pretzels that they serve instead of bread when we were first seated.. SCRUMPTIOUS!  My mouth is actually watering right now, because I'm re-living thanksgiving dinner 2009.  Okay, enough about food because I'm salivating.  The service here is just as wonderful as the food.  I couldn't believe how genuine and nice everyone was, especially since they were all working thanksgiving night.   ..I know I'd be one saucy bitch.    The extra seating out back is also lovely.  (We literally had to walk to the end of the restaurant, through the kitchen, out the back door, and into a little extra house that they have out back)  I can see how the seating in the main part of the restaurant would get crowded, but the place out back is spacious and feels homey.   It was as if we were transported to a country farm house with brick walls, exposed beams, and a rustic stained glass skylight.  4.5 stars all around.  Definitely coming back here sometime soon for a non-thanksgiving dinner... and will be bringing extra cash!",4.0
"Great place. Prime Meats seems to aspire to seem as though they've been in this neighborhood forever; they create an old-style atmosphere with their emphasis on cocktails, decoration and details like fake mustaches. Perhaps a little gimmicky  but it has a nice, low-key vibe.  I was very impressed with the cocktail menu. They make their own bitters, out of pears (which they grow in the backyard!) and items as esoteric as Buddha's hand citron. My dear friend and dining companion ordered a Manhattan, which included the Buddha's hand bitters, and was very tasty. I ordered a cooler that featured bourbon and St. Germain's, with cucumber and seltzer. It was delicious, with a balance between the flavors, not overly sweet or too strong, and a pretty color. The cucumber flavor was a good base. We came here while waiting to dine at Frankie's 457, which is owned by the same people and is just a few doors down. The idea was to have a drink and snack until our table was ready. When we came into Prime Meats around 8 PM on a Saturday, there was a wait for a table, but just enough room at the bar. The bar is standing room only--I mean that to say there are no stools--but I think, given their space constraints, this is a nice detail.We ordered a few of the side dishes. The pretzel was beautifully formed and served with a great mustard that came, I believe, from a local vendor who's been making mustard for at least 70 years. The fries were crispy but mushy on the inside. The brussel sprouts were great, served with croutons and bacon. By the time we were called by Frankie's we were no longer particularly hungry. Drinks and snacks weren't as cheap as I expected, but the quality and experience were still very worthwhile. I also hear they have a very popular brunch. Also: cash only.",4.0

"I'm surprised I held out so long in going here as I am a big fan of Frankie's next door, as well as Cafe Pedlar down the street. Our meal here began with two fantastic cocktails; the bartender obviously knows what's going on. Then, we shared a pretzel and a bibb lettuce salad. The pretzel was left too long in the oven, leaving the twist part of it inedible. That was sad, because I often get pretzels from Cafe Pedlar and they are delicious. The salad was great, but really, really big. I'd prefer a smaller salad and a cheaper price tag!We both had the schnitzel special and it was excellent - definitely the best I've had stateside. Paper thin with a lovely salty crust. I'll probably be back here, even though I wish I didn't have to drop so much cash. For over a hundy a pop, I'd like everything to be on point.",4.0
"Prime Meats opens at 7 in the morning. I wasn't there at 7 in the morning, but after the heated debates that have revolved around it, I thought it was strictly dinner.I arrived a little after 9 AM this morning. The outside temperature was 24 degrees Fahrenheit, and the windows were foggy at the bottom, something I have always loved about winters in New York. My friend was already drinking coffee when I say down, and the waitress was quick to bring menus. I had an egg sandwich on a buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was crumbly good. I would have like a wee bit more salad with my sandwich, but for $6 if felt like a real steal. My friend had an omelet with a little triangle of hash brown and the same token salad that graced my plate. I was a little jealous of the hash brown. There were a handful of other customers - a couple of people plugged into their laptops on the banquette against the back wall, two women with an infant in a car seat, a group of three youngsters who are probably unemployed. It was warm and quiet and friendly and everything smelled delicious.There's a sign on the window that asks patrons to kindly leave strollers outside and this has been cause for angry debates in the neighborhood. In the evening, Prime Meats is a bar. It's narrow, and I imagine the volume is out of control if it's full. I don't feel like this is a restaurant that's particularly suited for family meals, and I've never really liked going to places that are overly solicitous to children when I don't have my children with me.

"Came here for a New Year's dinner with a friend.  We knew we were in for a bit of a wait, but we checked in, grabbed some cash, had some cheese at the bar, and were promptly seated.  The hostess was VERY friendly, and the waiter was attentive and very helpful with recommendations - I am surprised to see complaints about the service, but perhaps there's been turnover since those reviews were written.  The bartender was also very courteous, knowledgeable, and friendly/efficient.We both opted for the burgers, but took the waiter's recommendation and tried some oysters (Wellfleet and  Beausoleil) as our app.  Very nice!  If you like the pig, opt for the thick cut bacon (and it's an ample portion).  For dessert, we shared the apple tart which was also well prepared.  If you don't booze it up, you'll get out without killing your wallet.  That being said, the punch (served in adorable crystal glasses like grandmama would have used back in the day) is tasty, refreshing, and cheap.The only irritant is the seating - can be a little tight with some table sliding/chair shuffling to fit everyone in and allow space for the wait staff to do their thing, but that's my only gripe.  It's a solid joint for some nice meat, pleasant atmosphere and I look forward to checking out their brunch very soon.",4.0
"Will give 5 stars to places that have superlative dishes, though they may be just a few. I have not tried out their extensive menu, but I absolutely love their french toast and thick-cut bacon. So much so that I find myself thinking about them more than is reasonable. I know my french toast well, and this is definitely one of the best. Very buttery and rich. This is probably the only place I have had thick-cut bacon, so take my enthusiasm with a grain of salt, but it's so damn flavorful that it's not inconceivable that it may still be the best despite how many more places I try. Sadly, I have been there 3 times but I keep getting the same things. I do need to try something new different to be a better gauge of the restaurant.",5.0

"There's a lot to like about this place.  It's in a great neighborhood, and while the restaurant can get busy, it doesn't feel stressful or sound like a bowling alley.  If you like sandwiches, get the roast beef.  It was fantastic.  The Hofbrau House Bratwurst was delicious as well.On the down side, the Potato Rösti was uneventful.  I would skip it -- it's nothing special.    Ditto with their juice -- it tasted like concentrate.  Service was also hit and miss.  The waitress was friendly enough, but tended to rush us.All in all, a great place for brunch.  Check it out!",4.0
I had some oysters and then the pork belly for dessert.    It was a good meal and the not-too-sweet apple tart plus decaf cappacino sealed the deal for me.   I'm rarely in the area but I'd definitely go back to check things out.The white sausage entree by the way is pretty small.  Just one small piece and a white pretzel like bun.  The pork belly special entree has two very small pieces of pork belly and then a white and a pink'ish sausage.. i found my dish tasty but definitely not very filling...   I tried my dad's beef brisket dish which i felt was the best.. while my mom's dish (white sausage which was simply white sausage in a bowl of water and a white pretzel bread bun) was just okay.I'd definitely go back though... unfortunately Im rarely in brooklyn,4.0

"Excellent overall, but I have two things to add to the reviews right now: (1) the beet salad is amazing: roasted beets, pickled beets, candied pignolis, and grapefruit on bitter greens. (2) I have never seen such handsome and well-dressed waiters in my life ... and I don't even date men!",5.0
"I'm surprised I held out so long in going here as I am a big fan of Frankie's next door, as well as Cafe Pedlar down the street. Our meal here began with two fantastic cocktails; the bartender obviously knows what's going on. Then, we shared a pretzel and a bibb lettuce salad. The pretzel was left too long in the oven, leaving the twist part of it inedible. That was sad, because I often get pretzels from Cafe Pedlar and they are delicious. The salad was great, but really, really big. I'd prefer a smaller salad and a cheaper price tag!We both had the schnitzel special and it was excellent - definitely the best I've had stateside. Paper thin with a lovely salty crust. I'll probably be back here, even though I wish I didn't have to drop so much cash. For over a hundy a pop, I'd like everything to be on point.",4.0
"Prime Meats opens at 7 in the morning. I wasn't there at 7 in the morning, but after the heated debates that have revolved around it, I thought it was strictly dinner.I arrived a little after 9 AM this morning. The outside temperature was 24 degrees Fahrenheit, and the windows were foggy at the bottom, something I have always loved about winters in New York. My friend was already drinking coffee when I say down, and the waitress was quick to bring menus. I had an egg sandwich on a buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was crumbly good. I would have like a wee bit more salad with my sandwich, but for $6 if felt like a real steal. My friend had an omelet with a little triangle of hash brown and the same token salad that graced my plate. I was a little jealous of the hash brown. There were a handful of other customers - a couple of people plugged into their laptops on the banquette against the back wall, two women with an infant in a car seat, a group of three youngsters who are probably unemployed. It was warm and quiet and friendly and everything smelled delicious.There's a sign on the window that asks patrons to kindly leave strollers outside and this has been cause for angry debates in the neighborhood. In the evening, Prime Meats is a bar. It's narrow, and I imagine the volume is out of control if it's full. I don't feel like this is a restaurant that's particularly suited for family meals, and I've never really liked going to places that are overly solicitous to children when I don't have my children with me. That said, I don't think it's child unfriendly, either. But if you're going to take children, it might be better if the children are, say, over the age of 8, able to stay seated, and don't use flatware for percussion instruments.That is all.",4.0

"I don't spend a ton of time (read: any time) in Carroll Gardens, so I can't comment on whether this place is over-hyped or a hipster-fueled neighborhood blight, etc. It is definitely busy, though. I went on New Year's day with three friends, and the wait was just over an hour and a half. Normally I can't abide a wait of over an hour, but we had driven in from Manhattan after seeing a movie, and didn't really feel like giving up and going to Frankie's. While the small, busy space resulted in close quarters, Prime Meats offers a cozy, inviting atmosphere, so we sidled up to the bar and ordered some drinks and oysters. The drink selection and presentation is really nice. Some good German and NYC-based beers on tap, and wines both in bottles and a few by the glass. The ""glass"" of red wine that I ordered was actually closer to a quartino, and was served in a caraf, which justified the $12 price. So our long wait at the bar passed in pleasant fashion.Finally seated at a cozy wooden booth, we decided to order a bunch of things and share them. We got the much touted burger, with cheese and bacon. It was succulent and flavorful, maybe not the best burger I've ever had, but certainly delicious. The meat sampler appetizer was excellent, although we had to ask for more of the delicious bread and butter with which it's served. We also ordered the bibb salad and a side of brussel sprouts, along with the steak tartare. Everything was uniformly good.Service was polite and attentive. The atmosphere is nothing new, but very pleasant and warm. The bill was lower than I expected. How much more can you ask for from a casual dinner? There's a reason it's mobbed. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'm sure I'd be here all the time, too, and all in all it was worth the little trip down from Greenpoint.",4.0

"I will forever remember Prime Meats as the place where I first ate a slice of rosti--basically hash browns, which are already extremely delicious, but in pie form, thus making them even more delicious. I don't know how the genius-in-its-simplicity equation of Already Delicious Food + Pie Form never occurred to me before, but it makes me regret all the time I've wasted NOT eating foods made into pies. Here are some other foods-as-pies that I think would also be good ideas:-Cheeseburger Pie-Japanese Curry Pie-Milkshake Pie-Shepherd's Pie Pie -Arby's Beef 'n' Cheddar Pie-Chicken-Fried Fried Chicken PiePrime Meats is also home to the Egg & Cheese Sandwich, #39 on NY Mag's List of the Top 51 NYC Sandwiches, AKA my personal 51-step program for making my heart explode. Served on a buttermilk biscuit (or bread or a roll if you like), with thick-cut bacon optional (optional, that is, for stupid people), it was, I am surprised to say, slightly underwhelming. Really though, this is only because breakfast sandwiches are one of those things that I find so intrinsically delicious that I'm hard-pressed to find one I don't like. Nevertheless, should you ever happen across some freakshow who's never eaten a breakfast sandwich before (have you ever met anybody who for whatever reason has never tried a certain exceedingly common food before? Like my friend's friend who's never eaten an egg), jamming Prime Meats' Egg & Cheese down their throat is probably one of the better favors/educations you could grant them. Altogether, I really enjoyed my breakfast at Prime Meats. The food is good, the service was quick and friendly, and I even liked the space--casual but classy in a rustic way, and NYC-spacious. It's exactly the type of place I'd like to take a visiting friend from out of town to breakfast. Well, if I had any friends, I mean. Oh God so lonely.",4.0
"Absolutely the best steak and best mashed potatoes I've ever had (do not tell my grandma)Let me tell you, this place is fantastic. I'm not generally a huge red meat eater, but I do enjoy a fine steak now and again. I was taken to Prime Meats by a date, and contrary to many other reviews, as a party of two we were seated in under 10 minutes. The service was consistent all evening and very friendly. We each had (several, haha) cocktails with dinner and I can't begin to pick a favorite, but the first I had, called the ""Aviation Cocktail"",  was wonderful. We decided not to get an appetizer and bypassed that for salads, we each got the Farm salad with the bacon vinaigrette which was very very good. Tangy and smoky with a slight sweet fruit flavor, and very fresh. For our main course we decided on the ""DeBragga & Spitler Dry-Aged Côte De Boeuf"" cooked medium, with the mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach with garlic for our sides. As part of the presentation they bring out your cut of meat on packing paper for you to see, which caught my date slightly off guard, in fact he was so surprised that he narrowly missed slapping himself in the face when he turned his head.  He must have been so enthralled by my intelligent and witty conversation skills that he couldn't possibly be bothered to notice the 5 pound slab of beef hovering at his temples. That must be it. The wait for our food was so worth it, it was cooked to perfection in my eyes and it was so tender, not bloody, pink all the way through, brown on the outside with a slight char, and whatever that sauce is that they serve with it was fantastic but honestly I ate several pieces on their own (the true test of a good steak). The mashed potatoes were so good, oh my gosh, they were so good. I don't know if they put crack in them or what, but I want MORE. I'm sure they have sufficiently clogged my arteries and I'm going to need to run laps around prospect park for the remainder of the week, but I'm glad they're in Carroll Gardens because if they were in front of me now I'd devour them in a you-know-what minute. For dessert we full out splurged and shared the creme brulee. It was different than any other I've had, more creamy and seemed more rich (if that's possible). Either way, it was phenomenal. We also got after dinner cocktails, mine was SO strong, can't recall the name, but I'm surprised I made it out of there gracefully. Like many others have mentioned BRING CASH, they do not take visa or MC. Lucky me, I certainly wasn't paying, and my date had plently of cash, because I know it was pricey.

"I can't believe this place has such great reviews. The boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on a Friday night. The guy at the front was very nice as was our waiter which is the only reason I'm giving it two stars. Though we were told it would be a 45 minute wait (on a Friday of a holiday weekend!) and to have a seat (well a stand really because there are no chairs) at the bar. Normally, we wouldn't order cocktails before dinner (we like wine!) but since we were told the wait would be so long, we ordered a cocktail. Literally as soon as they placed the cocktails in front of us, they told us they had a table. It had only been 5 minutes (not 45!) which seemed a little suspicious. Did they just want to suck cocktail money from us? But I decided not to be a cynic and trust that they just had a sudden opening.The food was bland and terrible. We shared the Vesper Brett to start. It's a tasting board of cold meats. They all tasted as if they came straight from Oscar Meyer. We also each ordered carafes of wine. After about 45 minutes of wait our entrees, the waiter apologized and said it would be at least another 40 minutes because the kitchen wasn't prepared for such a large amount of diners on a holiday weekend. Seemed fishy. But since we were stuck there we ordered a bottle. Literally as soon as he opened the bottle, our food magically appeared. Call me crazy but between this and the cocktails earlier, it seemed as if they were orchestrating it so we would pump up our alcohol bill. For entrees, I had the Beef Sauerbraten & Braised Red Cabbage. Way too much Juniper Berry was used and it was inedible. The boyfriend had the Pork Schnitzel. It was overcooked and dry, though the potato salad was ok.We didn't even bother with dessert, that's how bad it was.

"Definitely enjoyed this place.  The service was awesome!   It felt like a German restaurant with a few extra steak offerings and a great looking burger.   The wife and I went with my Big Poppa and his significant other for an early dinner last Saturday.  The staff looks very much like a typical hipster with a much better attitude.  The food was really great.  Everything tasted fresh and portions were very ample, even for a salad.  The wife got the steak tartare which was amazing.  My dad and his lady friend got the radish and anchovy salad which was not too salty and had a nice balance.  I got the bacon and bacon vinaigrette salad.  It even came with apples or pears, wasn't too sure, but it was bacony delicious.  Then for our main courses we had two burgers, one with the blue cheese one with out cheese (Who is this guy who goes cheeseless on a burger?  Did I really come from my father's loins?).  Then the wife had the bone marrow and I had the pork schnitzle.  Come hungry as this was plenty to make us all stuffed.  The schnitzle serving was so delicious and served with a potato salad with bacon (Cause I didn't get enough from the salad course).  The wife also snuck in a side of spatzle with cheese.  This was a delicious little mac n' cheese dish to go along with all the other starchy potatoes on the place.We all left very satisfied and stuffed.  The services was as stated in the first line, awesome!  Will definitely return to try other things on the menu.",4.0
"We refer to this place as ""meaty"" - there is lots of meat, odd meat, on the menu. This odd meat is pretty incredible.

"Fantastic Food and Great Service.  The Oysters, Pretzel w/mustard, Lamb Stew, Spaetzel, and White Sausage were all spectacular!  Great wine and cocktails and everything was very reasonably priced for the portions and flavor.  Only negatives was the seating could have been more comfortable or upscale than wooden bench style considering the price points, and the music selection could be a little less hipster and a little more cozy.  Overall, would definitely recommend to friends and will return for certain as there's many more items we'd love to try.",4.0

There were plenty of larger available tables, due to the late hour I would suppose, and we were quickly seated at at a larger table upon our request. We ordered a frisée salad with lardons served with a sunny-side egg on top to share. Delicious- as were the entrees. My son had had a fresh fish entree ( which might have been swordfish but I have forgotten). I had steak frites and it was outstanding. The steak was a perfect medium rare and served over mixed greens with fries as good as I have ever tasted. Both entrees were high quality and well worth the price point. We shared a salad, two entrees, and four glasses of a good red for just over $100. Delicious bread and olive oil rounded out the meal. On the whole a fine dining experience at at a reasonable price. Service was a little spotty but that might be attributed to the late Sunday night time . All in all a very good meal.

"Its powerful aura looms over Brooklyn, as the solid team behind it spreads it empire to include Frankies Spuntino and Cafe Pedlar, both in Manhattan as well. Having been on our brunch list for some time, the Court Street festival this Sunday led us there on its yellow brick road. Can I get an Amen?! Besides the perfectly dry rose sparkling wine, local Brooklyn Sixpoint selection, and wondrously robust Stumptown coffee, suffice it to say the German-inspired, hipster-old-fashiony Prime Meats knows their meat. The best form of it came in their ground Angus beef burger: a rotund juicy hockey puck, seared to a supple medium rare. No need for cheese or garnishes, just a little spicy mustard and some beautifully seasoned fries will do the trick. Now this is farm-to-table quintessence. The second best for the carnivore was the link-long Bratwurst, which accompanied my very brunch-ish poached egg on top of sauteed wild mushrooms. Perfectly simple. Perfectly direct. Perfectly German. You got your meat, your eggs, and your bread. Now eat it. I do like my meat but lightened up the spread with six Blue Point oysters they had on special and an inconspicuously tasty arugula and radish salad with a delightful anchovy-infused lemon dressing.

We didn't have any complaints about the service - from the moment we set our foot in the door, we were treated with respect and promptness.  Our waiter check in on us often, but not too much to be annoying, explained everything about the food and made recommendations, what else could you want?We had a great time and I would definitely recommend this place.",4.0

It's around $15 for a 'carafe' of wine, which is 500ml...a not-too-offensive price but the Sauvingon Blanc was sub-par. The Dunkel, on the other hand, was excellent.

Why, can't you just negotiate a wide turn like everyone else, you may ask? Well, no, no you can't.

We didn't have any complaints about the service - from the moment we set our foot in the door, we were treated with respect and promptness.  Our waiter check in on us often, but not too much to be annoying, explained everything about the food and made recommendations, what else could you want?We had a great time and I would definitely recommend this place.",4.0
"Deeeelicious.  I went a few weeks back and had one of the most savory pork chops I've had in a while.  Lovely ambiance and decor, especially loves the way the waiters and waitresses were dressed.  I will definitely visit Prime Meats again.",4.0
"Good...not *great* but good. A little spendy. We started with the meat board, which was just ok, and the Butternut squash soup, which was solid.  I had the sauerbraten over red cabbage - the beef was tender and fairly flavorful, the cabbage was great. The wife der schnitzel, and it was underwhelming...possibly because she is used to my schnitzel which is pretty delicious. Wasn't a fan of the breading, which felt more like a deep-fry batter. It's around $15 for a 'carafe' of wine, which is 500ml...a not-too-offensive price but the Sauvingon Blanc was sub-par. The Dunkel, on the other hand, was excellent. All in all, it was good, but not as a good as the first time we came over the summer - they had a corn soup that was one of the best things I ever ate.The staff was young, knowledgeable, and friendly.",4.0
"Wow - this place is great.  I mean I can't stay away too long because I need more of that bacon.  It's so yummy on everything!  The burger is beyond and then you add cheese, bacon, and avocado.  It's a home run.  Sa-lam Dunck!  I'm not kidding people.  Get on the F or G and get to Prime Meats.  You don't know what you are missing until you start missing it....like me.....every week.",5.0
"Never again. Two bad meals in a row: inedible breakfast sandwich that tasted like waterlogged cardboard, and for dinner, a burger so rare it was the consistency of runny cottage cheese. Nice staff but painfully uncomfortable seating after a painfully long wait. And please to enjoy the nice sharp-edged bench that will probably find its way directly into your knee when you walk through the door. Why, can't you just negotiate a wide turn like everyone else, you may ask? Well, no, no you can't. Apparently his place is built for rail-thin models or lacrosse stick storage, because it's so narrow you can barely fit two people across comfortably, and you're constantly dodging waiters. Near calamity around every corner. As enjoyable as like trying to cross the West Side Highway. Overpriced. Overhyped. Go to Buttermilk Channel instead.",1.0
"This place is hands down my favorite regular joint.  I love the people who work there, I love the old timey vibe and the cool reinventions of classic cocktails.  I love the quality of the food.  The burger will make your toes curl.  Other favorite item is the brussel sprouts, braised cabbage and spatzel.  Love this place!!!",5.0
"I am dinging two stars for (1) the ridiculously priced wine by the glass; (2) the too dark back room and (3) the unreasonably long time it took for our meals to arrive. Also, why no bar stools?

"I made a special trip to Brooklyn just for Prime Meats, K, that is a lie. I was going there anyway because a friend lives in Brooklyn, but I left really early to get over in time to eat at Prime Meats. There happened to be a street festival happening that afternoon, May 1st. As we made our way down to Prime Meats I was wondering what they'd have as their street meat and drink. Hot Dogs and house Pils were available on the street. Great App to what would be a memorable meal. The hot dog had a bit of snap to it, the meat savoury, and the house-made kraut was some of the best I've ever had with not too much sour, and just a mild touch of caraway. Inside, I grabbed a pint of IPA, and Steak & Frites, $27 at the time I visited. The beef is dry-aged for 38 or 39 days. I've never had dry-aged beef before. I've had great quality beef before, well marbled and wet-aged, but this was different. Beef flavour was full-forward, and it was so tender. I didn't think we'd both eat our 12 oz steak and frites, but we did. It was THAT good. Our server was training a new girl, and until there was a time when they talked to each other and another customer about who was who, I didn't know. The service was great. Before dinner service started, we had a great group of bartenders, who were in the middle of switching shifts, but still were mindful of customer service.

The biscuit was good but it wasn't anything I can't get back in the East Village (JoeDoe, Northern Spy Food).

"Every sense I went to this place I have been dying to tell you what I discovered.  I know the astute among will you will recognize that today is Wednesday, and I went there on a Saturday...but that's a whole other story.  While I understand that most reviews here are about the bar, I went for brunch.      First of all I passed by it the week before last, and was immediately draw in by the outside decor of the place. It reminded me of a classical colonial cottage one might travel to on the weekends to get out of the city. Except of course that this one is still in the city. I loved it. However that day I only had a card on me to pay, and because they are ""cash only"" I made a note to return. And I did, last Saturday.       Upon entrance that same warm feel of an English style country cottage is still prevalent, only don't expect tea and crumpets, it is not that dainty. There was about a 7 minute wait to get seated, for me. I was the only one waiting. I didn't actually mind because there were magazines at the counter you could read while you wait and the hostess brought me a cup of coffee in the mean time. How cool is that? By the way the coffee was pleasantly strong, an increasingly positive trend I am noticing among restaurants.     Once I sat down, it took me a while to look over the menu. To my surprise the menu is mostly Italian in origin. I had to ponder if in fact this was how an Etruscan country cottage might appear. Maybe my knowledge of European cottages after all is a bit wanting. I still liked it though.       Personally, because I feel there is nothing better to wake up to in the morning than a couple of eggs, I ordered the frittata. And lets face it, eggs just aren't the same without a little meat to go with them, so I ordered a dry hunters sausage on the side.  I was seriously considering the white banger, but it would have put me over my budget.   The food arrived in a timely manner and looked very presentable on the plate. Not in an artistic way that made you not want to eat it, but in a very simple way that did make you want to eat it. The frittata was served just above room temperature, in what I assume is the way they are supposed to be. I am one however that happens to like my eggs hot. The taste was right on spot though, and need no additions. For the Hunters Sausage, the flavor of the meat was delicious and subtle. I would have to question wether in the end it is a perfect companion to the eggs. After I sampled it, they brought me a thick mustard, while going well with the sausage put further distance between it and the egg. In my experience mustard and eggs only work well together when deviled. And now... for the drum roll please..........The Purple Salad.  I have to tell you that hands down, this salad which accompanies the frittata stole the show. It really should get a prize for the most original salad in Brooklyn. Made of purple cabbage, mixed with a particular variety of Italian parsley that tasted very similar to cilantro, and topped with walnuts. The dressing was a very light oil with a hint of vinaigrette and something sweet.  I couldn't get enough. Frankly I would go back just to enjoy it once more.     A few other things to take into consideration. The waitress who took my order was a delightful person, not to mention patient when I asked her about the unfamiliar items on the menu. The price is unbeatable for the quality of food provided. And finally, I want one of the thick wooden tables that you sit at; so I can use as a desk to pen more reviews. They remind me of something that we have lost in the mad rush for commercialism. There is one more interesting thing to think about. When I got up to leave and on my way out, I couldn't help but to notice the aroma from all the fresh meats and cheeses. What drew my attention to that later was when I realized that it wasn't the first thing I had noticed when I walked in. The first thing that had caught my attention was how inviting it seemed, the last thing I remembered was the quality of food.      I have to give it five stars, because the only discrepancy I could find was my own lack of taste to the warm frittata.  Perfection this close is very hard to obtain. I will mostly likely go back again, but next time I will try something from the extensive meat selection, for which I suspect they are more known.  As I was finishing there was a young couple across from me who ordered a sampler that looked irresistible.",5.0

"I decided to write a review after visiting Prime 4 times.  The first time, was brunch - I was dying for an egg and cheese sandwich on a buttermilk biscuit, but they were out!  that was annoying, but i guess not a big deal really.  2nd time was a good meal, we ordered the steak for 2 which was amazing, but super expensive so it should be!  Third time I ordered the sauerbraten which was just ok.  The meat was a bit dry.  The last time we went on a random week night and the place was packed as usual, waited about 25 minutes and the service was lacking.  I ordered the burger with thick cut bacon and they forgot the bacon.  It was at least 5 minutes before I could get someone's attention and I really didn't want to eat my burger without it!  Anyway, the bacon was definitely good, but the burger was dry and I was really disappointed!  I really thought it would be a great burger.  I expect a burger to be juicy when you bite into it, and this burger did not have any juice.  It was also cooked to well done which could have something to do with it.  I asked for medium.  My husband ordered the special fish of the day which was red snapper and it was a TINY portion and no sides.  It was definitely a 3 oz portion of fish and it was screaming for a side.  I know some restaurants keep the sides a la cart which is fine, we just forgot.  I really wished that the waiter would have 'suggested' something - I mean we would have sprung some extra bucks for a side.   Anyway, I just expect this place to be more consistent and I don't get that at all after 4 times.",2.0

"I decided to write a review after visiting Prime 4 times.  The first time, was brunch - I was dying for an egg and cheese sandwich on a buttermilk biscuit, but they were out!  that was annoying, but i guess not a big deal really.  2nd time was a good meal, we ordered the steak for 2 which was amazing, but super expensive so it should be!  Third time I ordered the sauerbraten which was just ok.  The meat was a bit dry.  The last time we went on a random week night and the place was packed as usual, waited about 25 minutes and the service was lacking.  I ordered the burger with thick cut bacon and they forgot the bacon.  It was at least 5 minutes before I could get someone's attention and I really didn't want to eat my burger without it!  Anyway, the bacon was definitely good, but the burger was dry and I was really disappointed!  I really thought it would be a great burger.  I expect a burger to be juicy when you bite into it, and this burger did not have any juice.  It was also cooked to well done which could have something to do with it.  I asked for medium.  My husband ordered the special fish of the day which was red snapper and it was a TINY portion and no sides.  It was definitely a 3 oz portion of fish and it was screaming for a side.  I know some restaurants keep the sides a la cart which is fine, we just forgot.  I really wished that the waiter would have 'suggested' something - I mean we would have sprung some extra bucks for a side.   Anyway, I just expect this place to be more consistent and I don't get that at all after 4 times.",2.0
"brunch is pretty damn good, never had the dinner there.  steak and eggs are lovely if you do the meat thing.  biscuits are massive and usally hot-fresh.  something gives my wife a belly ache at this place so its a pretty rare occasion that we make our way over there these days unless we have friends/family in town and have already taken them to buttermilk.  all in all, its sweet having this place only a couple blocks away but ain't my all time fav, ya heard...",3.0
"Great menu, something different, awesome staff, nice atmosphere, lots of great booze choices - can't beat it. My husband and I have been craving German food for a couple of weeks now, and Prime Meats was a great solution! We couldn't beat our selections, maybe the only problem was that we ate too much!What we ate: Started with the draft white beer and the oatmeal stout, well served, while we had a brief wait for a table. - We had the The Vesper Brett which was a alpine tasting board with kassler, landjäger, black forest bacon, bologna,farmer's sausage & cervelat. I really enjoyed the meats and dressing them up with the mustards, pickles, onions, and bread with butter. We also got a pretzel, which had to be the best $3 I have spent in a long time. - Next with had a 3 cheese plate, the waitress made our picks, and I am glad she did. The cheeses were amazing. - For main course we had the Weisswurst, traditional German white sausage served with sweet mustard & pretzel roll. This was outstanding! Reason enough to go back. We also had the Sürkrüt Garnie (chouchrote garnie), which included slow cooked pork belly, Thuringian bratwurst,calf tongue & knackwurst and housemade sauerkraut. And for a side dish we had the brussel sprouts. It was a ton of hearty food. - For a second round of drinks we had the pilsner and the punch. Unfortunately there was no room for dessert. We were absolutely stuffed. With tip it was $130 (20%+ tip). Which I think for the amount we ate was amazing. Next time I would like to go back with another couple and get a combination of the traditional dishes and the dried aged steak. I would also like to go back for breakfast and try their homemade pastries and their lunch, and try the burger. My only criticism is that they should take credit cards.",5.0

"Went here for brunch with my husband and two friends.  I had the wild mushrooms with weisswurst, delicious country toast, and an egg (which they fried exactly to my liking rather than poaching, at my request).  Really delicious, and the weisswurst was amazing (and I'm not a big meateater).  We split a pretzel which was good, though not amazing.  But the accompanying mustard was really delish.Great atmosphere, friendly service, and comfortable seating that imparts a feeling of privacy.",4.0
"Allow me to begin by saying that I know no German and could barely pronounce half the menu.  I stayed extra hungry for a group dinner at this place and I still ended up with a doggy bag on the metro. The wine selection was fairly nice, if a pinch over priced on a few bottles. We ordered several appetizers and none were particularly large but all were tasty. The pate' was DELICIOUS, I spread it on the crispy sliced french bread (at least i think it was like a french bread). I could have had three orders of just that. The oysters were surprisingly good and fresh for a place that specializes in meat. Everyone at the table pretty much ordered different plates which allowed for us all to taste a bit of the variety offered at prime meats. My surprise favorite turned out to be the pork chop (the un-breaded one). Super moist and well seasoned. The steak fritz were up to par and the burger was certainly yum. We didn't save room for desert so I can't speak to that but I will recommend the mushroom spat... something was a unique treat.",4.0
Had an enjoyable brunch here with 5 people. The 30 minute wait wasn't too bad but it was a slow Saturday afternoon.

"Today was my first time there.  Loved the old time decor, i.e., exposed brick, tin ceiling.  However, my first thought was how incredibly noisy it is.  That was an instant turn-off in spite of one reviewer saying the food is so good that the loudness doesn't matter.  That's simply not true when you want to enjoy a peaceful meal out -- and even more of a problem when dining with someone who is hearing impaired.  There are a lot of people so you have to live with the noisy chatter, but the loud music playing on top of the noisy chatter was too much and unnecessary.  I ordered the Farmer's Breakfast which was perfectly prepared.  The potatoes were especially delicious.  My mom (hearing impaired) asked for her coffee to be served with her meal while my husband and I took ours right away.  However, another server brought my mom's coffee in spite of the fact that both she and I had told our original server she didn't want hers until her meal was delivered.  The only problem with the food is that the toast was delivered unbuttered, and butter wasn't even brought to the table.  When I asked for it, got only two pats for a party of three.  Asked for more, and by the time the rest arrived, our toast was already cold and hard to butter.",3.0

"Went here for brunch last weekend and had a terrible experience.  First of all, let me say our server was totally fine.

"Went here for a friend's birthday, not realizing it had a German theme. I wasn't really in the mood for that, so I just went with the burger.

I was afraid the service might be pretentious, given that there is a fairly high degree of pretension in the restaurant scene in this neighborhood, but everyone was actually very friendly.

It's been replaced by a feeling of suspense at whether you'll ever get your food or drinks or even a refill of your glass of water.  When it arrives, it's great.  But the service aspect is killing this place for me.  I won't be coming here again for a while.  It was a gem for a long time, but now, it's seriously come down, sorry to say.",2.0

The service was friendly, fast, and the food amazing.  BUT, in the past few months, I have eaten here about 4 times, and the wait staff has become incredibly pretentious and slow.  It's as though they are doing some kind of victory lap for the NYT reviews, and they have forgotten what got them there.  Every single time, in this recent period, I have had to wait 10-15 minutes for my cocktail to arrive.  In one case, after waiting about 10 minutes after being seated for a drink solicitation, it took 20 more minutes to get our drinks, with no apology whatsoever!  After we got our drinks, we had to wait about 10 more minutes for the waitress to get back to us to take our food order.  This is unacceptable.  Gone is the feeling that you're being taken care of. It's been replaced by a feeling of suspense at whether you'll ever get your food or drinks or even a refill of your glass of water.  When it arrives, it's great.  But the service aspect is killing this place for me.  I won't be coming here again for a while.  It was a gem for a long time, but now, it's seriously come down, sorry to say.",2.0
"just had the most perfect Sunday night meal here. bagged a cosy wooden booth by the door. found the service really pleasant, laid back and unobtrusive but really fast and efficient (and sorry - but sort of loved the fact that all the staff look like they are about to ride home to make candles...) the boy gave his Burger 92% (v high grade for him) and i loved my chips and salad and red wine our waiter recommend was heaven. so i love this place. I'm a vegetarian and i actually love it. totally unexpected. started to get really busy as we were leaving - so i'd get here early.",5.0

"Well, the wait is long, but well worth it. Friendly and attentive service and delicious food! The pretzels are amazing, dipped in a spicy mustard. The sausage is house made and also scrumptious and the spaetzel with wild mushrooms is divine. If you go for brunch, the ""brunch punch"" is a treat, if they have it.",5.0

"Stepping into this place takes you into another time.  It's one of the few joints which brings out the best in Brooklyn (in comparison to Manhattan): it's neighborhood-y, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the ingredients have a locavore feel.  I've been to dinner twice with the wife, and other times myself for drinks.  Our tips: for drinks, the Martinez, the Old Pal (not on the menu), gin martini; for food, the raw oysters, the bone marrow.  Haven't had the steak yet, but will next time.",5.0
the food is ok. the wait is absolutely horrible. i just waited 20 mins for a table for two which was not bad. people coming in were being told to wait 3 and a half hours. thats insane. the crowd is so stuck up and yuppy. just not my crowd at all. the waitstaff was so gimmickey. all wearing suspenders and just so staged. we waited 1 hour for our food too. never go there again sorry.,2.0
"Ate here on a Tuesday night and was open to a wait - this being a 'fab' new restaurant and all.  We were in a great mood and celebrating a special occasion.  To start, we asked the bartender if it was ok to drink a bottle of vintage Champagne we'd brought.  His reply before turning and walking away?  A dull, ""Oh.""This left us speculating he didn't know and had to ask but didn't want to blow his mustached cool by seeming ignorant on the subject.  He returned with a deadpan, ""There'll be a $15 corking fee.""  As they don't serve any sparkling wines or Champagne, they did not have any glasses on hand which seemed a bit odd, but oh well.  We were still upbeat and having a good time and the fact our bartender had zero personality seemed irrelevant.  45 minutes later, we were seated at a communal table with another couple.  It was 8:30.  Our waitress was friendly and joked about us traveling with our own booze.  All was good.  Then our table mates ordered and we right after and that's when everything fell apart.  They received their appetizers well before us, ours took 30 minutes.  The red cabbage salad had zero depth - and for a 'German' themed restaurant, a playful twist on the ubiquitous slightly sweet red cabbage side dish would have been nice.  Honestly, the salad needed something - a hint of sweetness, perhaps from a berry or rose hip jam infused vinegar - something, anything.  Still. Felt a bit like eating oily twigs.  My mate had the wild mushrooms which fell completely flat.  The cook forgot to add salt.  We both tried it and felt like it also needed something extra - perhaps a hint of smoked bacon fat in the sauté.  The mushrooms were also of different varieties and some of them had a too-woody texture and perhaps should have been cooked at a different rate than the more delicate ones. The mouthfeel was akin to eating cardboard with about as much flavor.  So then - on to the main course.  But where was it? By this time, our Champagne was gone and no sign of a wine list or our dinner.  Ten minutes went by, twenty - thirty.  Forty-five minutes after finishing our appetizers and after our table mates had finished their main course, we finally asked the question no diner in a fine restaurant should ever have to ask, ""Where is our food?""The waitress, who had not checked in with us or updated us once between courses, slowed down, barely stopping as she passed by, and said, ""Oh...it'll be out shortly.""  Sorry, not a good answer after forty-five minutes.Two minutes after we inquired, voila! Our food arrived.  Time was 10 pm.  We were dying.I had the German brown trout, which was lovely - cooked to perfection. Nice crisp around the edges of the skin, excellent flavor and texture. Unfortunately, it was lying on a bed of braised vegetables that had likely been plated 30 minutes earlier when the entrees should have come out and as a result, was stone cold.  I will say their flavor was great, so if the chef can get his timing right on this one, the dish should be good.  The lamb chop special was a complete disaster.  They chose not to trim any of the fat away from the rib bone - ok, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Maybe they like rustic - fine, then make sure it has a nice sear on it.  In a restaurant named 'Prime Meats' one expects they know how to cook a cut of meat.  Nope.  Instead, the chops came out gooey with the fat looking visceral, white and globular.  Just like you'd expect fat to look like if you'd heated it on a hot plate or in a toaster oven.  The flavor was decent, but the aftermath of dissecting the meat from the voluminous globs of fat that surrounded it was not a pretty sight.  In my honest opinion, one should never serve a dish that leaves more garbage on the plate than food consumed.  Somewhere toward the end of us stuffing our starved faces, the waitress brought a wine list and laid it on the table.  I thought it was the desert menu.  We were incredulous.  Who orders a first glass of wine right before finishing their entrée?  Then, just to top off the evening, we had to ask for our check, lest we wait another forty minutes.  It was delivered with a comment card, which we filled out, cordially suggesting they needed to work on their timing.  Won't go back, can't recommend it, and in leaving, I thought, ""I'm going back to the old faves - Grocery, Saul, Chestnut.  They could probably use the support right now - and they actually deserve it.""",2.0
"do not overlook that little restaurant on the corner!!  i'm not even a meat eater, but my partner sometimes needs her bacon, so we decided on prime meats. luckily there were a few options for non-meat eaters - namely, the french toast, which was unbelievable! also, the coffee was fresh and strong, and the service and atmosphere was super-nice. note: the place is cash only. so hit up the ATM and stuff yourself silly!",4.0
"This was really a wonderful getaway, and we did not even have to leave the borough for it.  After a string of disappointing meals, my wife and I were determined to find some place that would be relatiely foolproof - so we finally headed out to Prime Meats and got in without a wait, on a relatively quiet and slow (for them) weekend night.   In some ways it was the Brooklyniest place I have ever been - every waiter there was a very stylish hipster with much enthusiasm for the food and drink, the decor was dark, rustic, vintage, with old wood paneling, etc., cocktails were creative and exquisite, the menu was filled with small-batch, home-made ingredients and it was difficult to narrow down our choices.  We finally settled on some seafood appetizers - a scallop ceviche and a trout salad - followed by some hearty german meat-centered dinner plates.  It was all delicious and I look forward to visiting again.",5.0
"pretty good food, but we stopped going here for brunch because the coffee's no good (even tho its stumptown? how are they messing that up?) and everything is overpriced.  We always left feeling ripped off.  One of those brunch menus where in order to get a balanced meal you have to order extra stuff on the side and end up spending way more than you planned.",2.0

"Me and my girlfriend went last night after hearing good things but we did not have a good night. We were told there was a 30 min wait for a table when we showed up but that we could wait at the bar. No prob. For some reason they charge $8 for Six Points as if they're a delicacy and not a local brew served in many bars in the area for 5 bucks. Ok whatever. Over 30 min goes by, we're the only 2 people at the bar and the host is seating people so we ask him about our table. Apparently he claims we turned down a table already. Sigh. Ok, forget about us, don't apologize and then claim we didnt want to eat. Whatever. Finally get seated and eventually order. Service is sloooow. The food was decent, the wine list not so great and over priced, and my overall impression, I wouldn't go back. there's better food and better service elsewhere...",1.0
"Lunch with the Missus, soup and salad for her, lamb sandwich  with a side of German potato salad. The lamb was on toasted white bread with mayo and arugula, there was so little lamb I thought I was given roast beef, I could not taste that it was lamb, for $11 I want meat on my sandwich.  The potato salad was 5 bucks with thick bacon in it, bacon makes everything taste better.  Thank goodness I got the side or I would have left hungry.  The wifes Bibb salad had some leaves with brown edges, the dressing was refreshing and tart.  The butternut  squash soup had a balsamic splash.  It was ok. I drank iced tea Mrs. Grumpy had water.  Lunch was served in the back of the bar, a mini Peter Lugars, great wood work.   You can't eat the decor, but at fifty (with tip) for a soup, salad , side and a thin sandwich you can certainly pay for it.  Oh, I forgot the pretzel half dipped in chocolate, sweet and salty, stoner food.",3.0
"Terrific food and service. But much too loud. There is no reason for the music to be blasting in the background other than to rush people out for a table turn. We went at 6 pm and the restaurant was already fairly full and by the time that we left at 7:30 pm it was packed. The sound of human voices was fine. Add in the loud music, however, and the two of us could hardly talk. We would love to go with friends, but until the sound is brought under control, we would never do that in the evening. Finally, if it costs $50 plus per person for dinner plus one drink, you should take credit cards.",3.0
"I tend to be wary when brunch is suggested. Will all the places I want to got to be packed? Will I be served leftovers instead of brunch? Will the Bloody Marys be watery? However, a friend took me and two junior citizens to Prime Meats on a Saturday, and we were promptly seated by perfectly pleasant staff. The items on the menu looked most promising, and the menu also contained a sufficient amount of items to make it stand out from the run-of-the-mill brunch menu. As it turned out, the dishes we ordered were excellent, and I must say that it was a long time since I had a poached egg that tasted so good. I would have considered a five-star rating if it wasn't for the rather long wait that made stomachs growl. The staff did not ignore us, though, and they refilled coffee cups and water glasses while keeping us informed about the progress of our food from the kitchen to the table. Prime Meats will require a revisit for dinner.",4.0
"Nice place on off hours, but for the atmosphere can go to Clove Club. Was told the wait for a table for brunch was 30-45 min. Ended up waiting and HOUR AND 20 MIN!! Was then repeatedly confronted by the hostess on how she could have done nothing about it even though she sat two separate couples at one of the only other empty (there are only 2) 5 top tables in the whole place! Nice job since 2 top tables open up all the time! Would have gone somewhere else if we hadn't already waited SO long and had friends specifically come to all the way from Manhattan. Was embarrassed and the brunch was just OK, def not worth the hour and 20 min wait! Wouldn't suggest to others (go to Morton's on Adams St. the steak is better for the same price, service faster, and you can take people with you - this place is tiny).",1.0
