"I realized that I haven't reviewed this place in over two years, and I've gone many many times since then. This has become one of my wife and I's favorite spots. The food here is great. The grits are still a bit too rich for me, but my wife loves them. Their BLT (or BLaT as I think it should be called) is fantastic. They probably have the best french toast I have ever had. It took me a while to get use to the menu, but this place is definitely worth a try or two. Maybe you'll get hooked like me.The owner is opening up a soul food restaurant next door soon, and I'll be one of the first in line to try it as soon as it opens.",5.0
"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. So my friend and I came here for Friday brunch. We walked in and were immediately confused about the process. There are a bunch of tables scattered through the restaurant with a sort of rustic, hip, messy feel. We figured it's not waiter service and walked over to the counter to order. They have this blackboard behind the counter with the present menu and my friend ordered the ""BLT"" -- (None vegan) There was no mention of it being vegan on the board. What he received was a vegan BLT with tempeh bacon. He ate it, it was good. But not what he had ordered. I ordered the Tofu scramble. It wasn't mind blowing. It wasn't even amazing. Pretty mediocre. The coffees were absolute crap -- not sure where they get the beans from but we definitely were not able to drink it. So my point is as follows --- if you're going to be vegan friendly, you might want to write on the board what's vegan and what's not. Ordering a BLT and receiving tempeh is deceiving and unappreciated.",3.0
"I'll go out of my way to eat here.This place is good for a quick quality bite meal.  It's a quiet and relaxed atmosphere, more of a cafe than a restaurant.  The menu is simple and easy and from what I can tell, everything on there is a perfect version of what it is.  The chef does a very good job to have a complete menu that includes local ingredients and tailors to all diets.  I had what might be the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had here.  It was Korean style pulled pork and had fresh basil leaves.  I also tried the burger and part of a grilled cheese.  Everything was excellent and couldn't find anything to criticize.I'll be sure to go back.",5.0
"You may be turned off by the fact that Brooklyn Commune is... well, in Brooklyn, but fear not, because the trek is worth it (plus, it's literally the first thing you'll see when you get out of the train station). I was part of a private event so what I write hear may not be 100% representative of the experience, but the quality of the kitchen is apt to be the same. I ordered the pulled pork burger that had an interesting Asian flair to it. Mixed in with the meat were kimchi slices which, being Korean, I was pretty skeptical about. However, the spiced cabbage gives the burger a well-needed hotness and sharpness that is often missing in typical bbq pulled pork. Often, the sweetness of the meat overwhelms the flavors, but the kimchi does a great job of balancing that. I tried multiple other plates on the table ranging from the hearty and thick Commune Burger to the beautifully presented French Toast plate. The salad I tried (I think it was an Asian style salad? I can't remember) had a distinct taste that I really enjoyed. The Salmon Toast came out the most beautiful of all their dishes and was a sight to see. If you want a pretty food photo, I recommend that dish. Overall I had a lot of fun with friends and the chef/management and would love to make another visit soon.",5.0
"I'm almost embarrassed about the fact that it took me so long to write this review. Especially since I'm the duchess and most awesome person who comes here for brunch regularly. Since I moved to the border of Windsor Terrace and Kensington, I started looking for a place that could fulfill my gluten free brunchy carboholic needs....looks like I found it!Whatever you get on the menu that includes bread can be substituted for the gf kind. I'm fairly sure that this place uses store bought, but their brunch is so scrumptious that I don't even care. The BLT is a bacon lovers dream and the fried egg and grits is a cheesy bowl of beauty. Sadly, my favorite dish, The Lyonnaise just got cut from their menu since they renovated the place a few weeks ago. They also have a freshly made gluten free scone. Every time I've been there, it's been apple & cheese so I'm not sure if they have any other choices. Either way, get it. It's tasty. My lady thinks I'm a weirdo since I like to dunk it in my milky chamomile/jasmine tea, but I don't care. Do it.",5.0
"I've been coming to Brooklyn Commune for years, initially because the space is so inviting...with comfortable seating and big windows that let in plenty of light. When I tasted the food, though, I knew I would be making the trek from a distant part of Brooklyn very frequently. For lunch, I highly recommend their creative and delicious salads--particularly a current offering made with dandelion greens, watercress, and green and yellow beans--as well as some of the best homemade soups I've ever had. Brunch is also superb, with one of the best versions of French toast I've ever eaten. I am particularly grateful for all of the vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. I have yet to eat dinner at BC, but I am sure that the offerings are as creative and delicious as everything else I've eaten here.",5.0
"Am sitting here for weekend brunch, wondering if I'm ever going to get any service. Had to hound the waitress to take our orders.  She then brought our coffee with a container of cream.  She set down the coffee but not the cream.  Took the cream to another table.  Trying to get her attention, with a wtf.  My 2 year old is on the clock, and she hasn't eaten.  We've been here half an hour.  I see other patrons are getting some service though.Food finally came.  I guess the chef changed because the quality and preparation are just terrible.  My side order of maplewood bacon are 4 strips of fat sitting in a pool of grease.  My French toast with fruit compote, a long time favorite of mine, came out as a bunch of toast circling a huge puddle of syrup, topped with mushy bananas mixed with heavy sugar and cinnamon.  I started, but couldn't eat much of it, it was disgusting.  We left hungry with a ton of food left on the plate.  We will not be back.",1.0
"This place was my Instagram friend before I decided to stop in.  I found it after I dropped my daughter from school one day and promise to make my way there.  I had a solo Valentine and treated myself to brunch yesterday.  I seated myself by the window (self seating) and ordered two fried eggs, mixed greens, turkey bacon and toast. I also has an English Breakfast tea.  I love the way they serve the food and it was delish, the service was great and I made a new friend by way of France.  I will be returning for the cheese grits and jerk pork..what a combo?  Sounds bad, huh? Which is exactly why I'm going back..lol",4.0

Really nice little place in a neighborhood that sorely needs nice places. I'm so glad I stumbled up on this place when meeting up with some folks who were staying in the area. They serve Stump Town Coffee Roasters coffee and it's very nice. The Apricot Scone was divine. The vibe is supper nice and I highly recommend you make the track to check this place out. It's literally at the top of the stairs as you exit the Fort Hamilton station on the F train. Only reason not 5 stars is that they didn't have a meat egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on the menu without paying extra for the meat.,4.0

"The food here is terrible. We had the Korean barley soup, the falafel wrap, and the Thai chicken wrap. Barley soup: it was the best thing we ordered but still not worth the $6. The poisonously salty crouton bread thing that came with it was so bad I had to spit it out. Falafel wrap: the falafel itself was fine but the sauce was cloyingly sweet and overwhelmed everything. No sign of the tzatziki. Weak amount of chips. Even the pickle was gross. And for $10? Come on. Thai chicken wrap: worst thing of all. TOO SALTY. We actually left hungry. Never again.",1.0
"Situated in a part of Prospect park area that doesnt have that many restaurants or coffee houses, this spot is a tasty gem.Great selection of baked goods from ALMOND CROISSANT 3.50 made by Balthazar bakery to delish gluten free options like the crumbly APPLE CHEDDAR SCONE 3.50Commune also has some house made items like a FENNEL GRANOLA and a SPECIALTY SALT MIXTURE for $4 consisting of salt and unusual but great idea herb combos.Got breakfast to go on this 9 degree day, brrrr... But the TOFU SCRAMBLE def warmed me up and hit the spot. $8.00 gives you a curry based tofu scramble with 3 thick cut slices of tempeh and an already dressed side salad of mesclun. The scramble was a little on the sweet side, perhaps due to to many tiny pieces of red bell peppers.  It was fine tho. My friend also opted for a healthy option of BREAKFAST SANDWICH 9.00.  2 multigrain slices toasted and filled generously with sauteed spinach, mushroom, and scrambled eggs.  Also comes with dressed side salad. They do run outta items as the day goes on, but I love popping in to check out new items theyve just made in house or if Im carb starved, theres many a option........Whats also nice and kewl about them is how they are very much interested and a part of the south slope community, offering dinner and movie nights, special night dinners and limited seating events...........People who work there are sweet and down to earth. They are not coffee house a holes and are great and the whole place has an inviting low key vibe.",5.0

My only gripe is that both the duck and beef were overcooked which is unfortunate since the overall flavor of both dishes were on point. For dessert we had the warm chocolate cake which was OK.

It's located right next to the G/F train and it's definitely a cute little spot to be at, especially on a lazy Sunday afternoon or even on a day off!",5.0
"Casual cafe with pretty awesome and varied food options. The ""TLT"" (BLT with tempeh) is TLT (""tasty lovely tempeh"") and one of the better and healthier sandwiches I've had in a while. This is a bright spot in an area that is lacking for... Everything.",4.0

"I wish this place would figure out what kind of restaurant it is. It's not bad as a coffee shop, but they try and have white tablecloth dinners that just don't make sense.",3.0
"I am addicted to their TLT.  Seriously, every time I go there, I want to try something else but I don't because it's just that good. Excellent coffee and nice staff. Just wish they had hot chocolate during the week and that they offered a daily vegetarian soup in addition to whatever else they have. Non-vegetarians can and will eat veggie soup, but not vice versa, and especially this winter, I would love a soup option. They are really wonderful at accommodating gluten-intolerant customers and use Everybody Eats bread which, while pricey, is incredibly delicious.  I'll be back soon.",5.0
"This is a really cute place and I liked how cozy it was. We had the mussels to start and it was pretty good, the flavors were really interesting and different than what you would typically expect. For entrees we had the duck and beef wellington. Both dishes had wonderful flavors and I really enjoyed the warm kale salad. My only gripe is that both the duck and beef were overcooked which is unfortunate since the overall flavor of both dishes were on point. For dessert we had the warm chocolate cake which was OK. I'm not a big dessert fan so I cannot say much about it. Overall the food was good and I would come back to try their other dishes, especially when they change their menu.",4.0
"Lovely experience! Like many other reviewers, went with a groupon. Food was awesome and generous portions left us full, but no leftovers.The ambience is cool and the community tables makes it a perfect spot for a large group. The staff was awesome! Super friendly, gave excellent recommendations without being pushy, and really made us feel welcome. There was a large party there who was just being served dinner as we finished our meals.

"I've visited Brooklyn Commune several times, as it's around the corner from my BFF's apartment in Windsor Terrace. Usually, I visit there for coffee and breakfast things. The coffee - stumptown - is always good. The pastries I've experienced were really good, and reasonably priced. Here's the thing, though. I'm really REALLY into eggs. This is because I'm a recovering vegetarian, so they're a preferred protein source, plus back home in Austin Texas (aka the Center of the Universe) I am mama to 4 hens who are prolific egg layers. I eat a lot of eggs. As a result, I am SUPER into researching egg options at breakfasty places.At Brooklyn Commune, I've had several egg-based items, I think a frittata or quiche, as well as the egg sandwich. Both times, I've found the eggs to be kind of... dry or overcooked. When I asked for deets on the egg sandwich, they said the eggs were ""baked"": quite like quiche or frittata. Meanwhile, I was so distracted by the words ""Egg Sandwich"" on the menu, that I overlooked the bennedict-type thing with fried eggs. After I ordered and saw I was too impulsive, I wound up with this quandry: if they can fry an egg, why can't they just scramble one for that Egg Sandwich? Inquiring minds want to know.Still, this is a cool place. There's ample seating, and my last visit was on a rainy afternoon, enjoying coffee and a brownie while journaling at a large table.

"This is a review for Brooklyn commune's dinner time. I arrived earlier than my reservation and the server politely showed me to a high table to wait. It's byob, with no corking fee, and my server offered to pour me a glass while I waited for my guest to arrive. The table was ready by 7:45, but I didn't mind waiting a little because at this point I was drinking and talking with my dinner partner. Our server offered his suggestions, and we gladly took them. We went there on a groupon, so we shared the calamari, I got the salmon and my friend got the duck-pasta dish. Both were superb. I read a review before going that said the quinoa and salmon portions were small. They weren't at all. By the time I was finished I was pleasantly full, without being over-full. We also got a side of Brussel sprouts. They were alright, but I've had better. For dessert we had the chocolate cake. It was decadent to say the least. It came with a toasted marshmallow on top which was very cute. The service was friendly without being pushy. The only part of my night which wasn't great was, because the kitchen is open, all my clothes smelled like fried calamari. I put leftovers in my bag, they were only in there for 15 minutes maximum,  and the next morning my bag smelled strongly of fried calamari, which wasn't even what was in the leftover boxes.",4.0
"For an even deeper Slope experience, just head to Windsor Terrace proper (not South Slope, which merely teeters on the edge)...there, you will find a refreshingly high-ceilinged space with a roomier seating arrangement than just about any other eatery in Brooklyn, no doubt to make room for all the strollers.Right outside the Fort Hamilton Parkway exit of the F-train and a mere block or so from Prospect Park, the Commune has the squeaky cleanliness and Greenpoint-caliber spaciousness of a well-oiled business but somehow offers the family-friendly comfort and warmth of a house.Price point is on par with most places running on organic philosophies (and, in this case, renewable energy: brooklyncommune.com/abou…), which is to say you will pay about 7 bucks for a simple (""yet delicious,"" as their mantra promises) breakfast sandwich, which is about three bucks more than you wish you'd pay for something you think you could make yourself (but really can't)...or 9 dollars for a salad containing quinoa or something containing tempeh (greenhorns to green menus, look it up).Co-owner Eugenie Woo rang me up personally, and I felt intimidated, but only because I was projecting my annoyance with myself by being totally scatterbrained. See, I ran in worried to be late to lunch with a high school classmate I pretty much hadn't seen since our fifth year reunion, and had since wed the love her life, birthed a gorgeous baby, and ruled the NYC marathon at some point in between these feats. She was ordering when I breezed in, with a couple people behind her. She beckoned me over, and I stalled, not knowing what I wanted and feeling super awkward about cutting in front of two mild-mannered looking people based on the principle that they would probably just let me cut.Luckily, I decided right away that I wanted the breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, spinach, and mushroom on multi-grain bread, and stepped up to sneak in my order to Ms. Woo, who kindly and efficiently processed it without skipping a beat. Seriously about five minutes later (when I had not finished admiring the DAUGHTER of this long lost pal of mine), our food arrived. Her kale salad stimulated my vision, while my breakfast sandwich seemed to nourish all the deprived cells in my body.The portions were generous as far as a healthy place goes, but just shy of the excessive amounts that we all hope to ingest in return for eating out.The food had a very homemade taste to it, but the egg was cooked in a sophisticated, cake-like square that conformed to the bread, which kind of looked like regular toast, but simply cannot be duplicated; it was toasted to the perfect degree, bringing out the flavor of each unknown seed and sprout distributed throughout the bookends to the perfect balance of cheese-welded fillings.Mothers, fathers, kids, and babies in strollers came and went, causing multiple fliers for progressive kid-and-parent programs to flutter like butterflies' wings in their wake. Yet, no baby screeched, no child threw a tantrum, and no entitled hipster-bourgeoisie ""breeders"" polluted the air here. If I may be indelicate and say: a welcome break from Park Slope, just across the park.Those who live very close by might make a healthy habit of becoming regulars here.",4.0
"Love this place. Great spot for lunch/brunch. The BLT is one of my favorite meals.

"Fantastic dinner spot-- this place should be getting more attention!  The menu is small, but changes seasonally.  The dishes are creative and surprising-- nice, fresh ingredients with the occasional touch of molecular gastronomy techniques, ie. a dish I tried last week had a spicy Thai gelatin dip that was weird and delicious, alongside more classic roasted vegetables.  There's a  fixed-price meal option, and the restaurant is BYOB-- there's a wine shop around the corner if you don't want to bring one from home.  Food portions are just right-- on my most recent visit, I even wound up bringing home some leftovers that I couldn't bear to leave on the plate.",5.0
"Food here is top-notch, especially for the neighborhood.However, the staff working the counter seem to be under the influence of very strong marijuana and spaced out.

"I don't go to Brooklyn. Let's just get that out of the way. I love Queens, it has everything I want. But when my very pregnant Brooklyn living friend wanted to get together for a reunion, I decided *FINE* I'll go. Enter Brooklyn Commune. We decided to meet at this little corner spot at noon for brunch on a Sunday. My friend was running late so we held off on ordering food until she arrived, sticking with coffee for the meantime. The coffee was good, but we discovered that after noon their breakfast-y portions of the menu (aka eggs, pancakes, other brunch items) were no longer served! I know it's noon, but it's Sunday. If I want pancakes at noon, 1, 2, 3pm, that shouldn't be a problem. I know it's not a rule, but I've come to see and expect this type of food to last until about 4pm on weekends. I will mention in their defense that they don't advertise as being a brunch place. But such delicious sounding brunchy food should last longer than noon, at least on the weekends.

While it is nice to have a place that offers coffee and healthier prepared foods in our food desert of a neighborhood, the lack of service and cleanliness are major issues. Just yesterday afternoon (9/11), I had to politely get the attention of the only counter staff in the joint as she was too busy sweeping to notice me (this has happened several times on other visits). When she started to make my drink without washing her hands after sweeping, I asked her if she wouldn't mind doing so. To which she reluctantly did but replied, ""It's not like I was sweeping the floor with my hands!"".  Ok, besides the point...Then, before serving me she attended to another customer who also got coffee but the milk offered at the sugar bar was sour. After I watched the server make two attempts to find milk that didn't smell funny or didn't curdle from her fridge, I gave up and walked out knowing I wasn't going to get sick today from that place.

"What a place with great potential. Big space, but this place needs some soul. Music, or art maybe? A rearranging of the furniture? Not really sure what it is missing, it just felt like it was missing the ambiance or an inviting quality.

"This is a review for Brooklyn commune's dinner time. I arrived earlier than my reservation and the server politely showed me to a high table to wait. It's byob, with no corking fee, and my server offered to pour me a glass while I waited for my guest to arrive. The table was ready by 7:45, but I didn't mind waiting a little because at this point I was drinking and talking with my dinner partner. Our server offered his suggestions, and we gladly took them. We went there on a groupon, so we shared the calamari, I got the salmon and my friend got the duck-pasta dish. Both were superb. I read a review before going that said the quinoa and salmon portions were small. They weren't at all. By the time I was finished I was pleasantly full, without being over-full. We also got a side of Brussel sprouts. They were alright, but I've had better. For dessert we had the chocolate cake. It was decadent to say the least. It came with a toasted marshmallow on top which was very cute. The service was friendly without being pushy. The only part of my night which wasn't great was, because the kitchen is open, all my clothes smelled like fried calamari. I put leftovers in my bag, they were only in there for 15 minutes maximum,  and the next morning my bag smelled strongly of fried calamari, which wasn't even what was in the leftover boxes.",4.0
"For an even deeper Slope experience, just head to Windsor Terrace proper (not South Slope, which merely teeters on the edge)...there, you will find a refreshingly high-ceilinged space with a roomier seating arrangement than just about any other eatery in Brooklyn, no doubt to make room for all the strollers.Right outside the Fort Hamilton Parkway exit of the F-train and a mere block or so from Prospect Park, the Commune has the squeaky cleanliness and Greenpoint-caliber spaciousness of a well-oiled business but somehow offers the family-friendly comfort and warmth of a house.Price point is on par with most places running on organic philosophies (and, in this case, renewable energy: brooklyncommune.com/abou…), which is to say you will pay about 7 bucks for a simple (""yet delicious,"" as their mantra promises) breakfast sandwich, which is about three bucks more than you wish you'd pay for something you think you could make yourself (but really can't)...or 9 dollars for a salad containing quinoa or something containing tempeh (greenhorns to green menus, look it up).Co-owner Eugenie Woo rang me up personally, and I felt intimidated, but only because I was projecting my annoyance with myself by being totally scatterbrained. See, I ran in worried to be late to lunch with a high school classmate I pretty much hadn't seen since our fifth year reunion, and had since wed the love her life, birthed a gorgeous baby, and ruled the NYC marathon at some point in between these feats. She was ordering when I breezed in, with a couple people behind her. She beckoned me over, and I stalled, not knowing what I wanted and feeling super awkward about cutting in front of two mild-mannered looking people based on the principle that they would probably just let me cut.Luckily, I decided right away that I wanted the breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, spinach, and mushroom on multi-grain bread, and stepped up to sneak in my order to Ms. Woo, who kindly and efficiently processed it without skipping a beat. Seriously about five minutes later (when I had not finished admiring the DAUGHTER of this long lost pal of mine), our food arrived. Her kale salad stimulated my vision, while my breakfast sandwich seemed to nourish all the deprived cells in my body.The portions were generous as far as a healthy place goes, but just shy of the excessive amounts that we all hope to ingest in return for eating out.The food had a very homemade taste to it, but the egg was cooked in a sophisticated, cake-like square that conformed to the bread, which kind of looked like regular toast, but simply cannot be duplicated; it was toasted to the perfect degree, bringing out the flavor of each unknown seed and sprout distributed throughout the bookends to the perfect balance of cheese-welded fillings.Mothers, fathers, kids, and babies in strollers came and went, causing multiple fliers for progressive kid-and-parent programs to flutter like butterflies' wings in their wake. Yet, no baby screeched, no child threw a tantrum, and no entitled hipster-bourgeoisie ""breeders"" polluted the air here. If I may be indelicate and say: a welcome break from Park Slope, just across the park.Those who live very close by might make a healthy habit of becoming regulars here.",4.0
"Love this place. Great spot for lunch/brunch. The BLT is one of my favorite meals. It really stands out, especially since it's normally such an easy dish.I'd give dinner more of a 4 only because both my fish and partner's steak was pretty salty, but the quiet and chill atmosphere and excellent service still made it a great experience.",5.0
"This place is OK.I kind of hate the people that come in here.. it's a crew of people that don't live close enough to park slope(propper) so they go there to take up the space and be annoying. Granted I HATE Park slope but love SS.. but it tends to be people that should just move to LI and leave WT.Anyhow, the place has decent food but because of the clientele I tend to visit places around Flatbush instead. It sucks because it's just them and le paddok on the strip. We'll see how dinner service is as I plan to check it out instead of the usual brunch.",3.0
"Fantastic dinner spot-- this place should be getting more attention!  The menu is small, but changes seasonally.  The dishes are creative and surprising-- nice, fresh ingredients with the occasional touch of molecular gastronomy techniques, ie. a dish I tried last week had a spicy Thai gelatin dip that was weird and delicious, alongside more classic roasted vegetables.  There's a  fixed-price meal option, and the restaurant is BYOB-- there's a wine shop around the corner if you don't want to bring one from home.  Food portions are just right-- on my most recent visit, I even wound up bringing home some leftovers that I couldn't bear to leave on the plate.",5.0
"Food here is top-notch, especially for the neighborhood.However, the staff working the counter seem to be under the influence of very strong marijuana and spaced out. Perhaps a touch of Williamsburg-itus. I would love for this place to succeed but they need to get the line moving and the orders right.D",3.0
"I don't go to Brooklyn. Let's just get that out of the way. I love Queens, it has everything I want. But when my very pregnant Brooklyn living friend wanted to get together for a reunion, I decided *FINE* I'll go. Enter Brooklyn Commune. We decided to meet at this little corner spot at noon for brunch on a Sunday. My friend was running late so we held off on ordering food until she arrived, sticking with coffee for the meantime. The coffee was good, but we discovered that after noon their breakfast-y portions of the menu (aka eggs, pancakes, other brunch items) were no longer served! I know it's noon, but it's Sunday. If I want pancakes at noon, 1, 2, 3pm, that shouldn't be a problem. I know it's not a rule, but I've come to see and expect this type of food to last until about 4pm on weekends. I will mention in their defense that they don't advertise as being a brunch place. But such delicious sounding brunchy food should last longer than noon, at least on the weekends.

"I'm feeling very torn about this place. I find it equally good and unique as much as I find it frustrating and inconsistent. Starting with the not so good: Counter service is slow, not sure if it's a full service or order and get it brought to you, or whatever. It sends mixed messages and leaves customers confused what to do and if you tip or don't tip. I've seen people get service to their table but leave no tip. Then I've noticed people leave the tip when they pay at the counter. Other times, I've seen people leave a tip on the table. Very confusing for a new visitor. Our latest visit (during our anniversary, nonetheless), we sat outside as there was no AC inside. There was table service. However, the waitress brought the wrong drink. Then proceeded to bring one correct meal and one wrong one, leaving one of us to wait 15 mins for the correct order. The waitress was apologetic in the end, saying it was very busy, but after going inside to pay (because the waitress didn't notice us flagging her), we noticed it really wasn't that busy. Even the people sitting next to us were a bit confused and commiserating with us about the service (attentiveness, accuracy), all in good humor but like us, a bit exasperated. Beware the AC above if you sit outside... it suddenly dribbled water all over us and our table without warning. Not a fan of AC water in my drink. The waitress kindly changed our water when we asked.Don't get the fried chicken and waffles. The spices overwhelmed the taste of either and it was so sweetly sour, I couldn't eat most of it. I like to taste my waffle and my chicken. Also, the chicken was dried out and seemed like it had been fried and refrigerated. Ending on a positive note:Such a needed place in the neighborhood. I like its uniqueness and different menu items. It's also very child friendly and the communal tables are nice. Awesome BLT! And their salads are great too. As well as their natural sodas and other drinks. In all, stick with what you know is good here. I like the place a lot and want it to do well, but I hope they make some improvements along the way in speed and accuracy. And sometimes, I don't need a super unique food. I'd really like some really normal, fantastic pancakes or waffles with boring old blueberry or strawberry options and plain old genuine maple syrup.",3.0

For desert I had the shortbread cookies which were delicious. Overall it was a great meal. Bring your own alcohol is always a plus as well.

What's that? Also cocktail sauce aspic (!) The beef Wellington on the current menu is melt in your mouth good as is the mushroom and rye berry pasta. We also ordered the fish and chips which were lightly coated and very well seasoned, over the top delicious. The portions aren't big but our table of four had appetizers and we were all sampling from each other's plates. The place is BYOB so we had a large bottle of white which we couldn't even finish.

"I ordered. I ate. I cried. True story. Were I less of an adventurous soul, I would have simply stayed in the city or along the 7 train for some serious eats; However, since having been connected to the 2x James Beard Award Winner, Chris Scott, I have often wondered what sort of man was behind the food and the community culture that he's created. Above all, I've been very interested in the Brooklyn Food scene, which seems to be burgeoning in such a way that I could no longer ignore it. I had first heard about BC through Robicelli's. Although I am no longer connected to the owners, I was open enough to remain connected to Chris on an acquaintance level.

However, it's the people behind the food that makes what they serve to be particularly special. When restaurateurs are also chefs, they are intimately connected to their own craft. As an Artist/ Artisan, I feel that this is particularly important, as the connection to one's art is a connection to humanity.I looked around - the rustic feel of the place was comforting. There were customers typing and completely drawn in their screens (free Wi-Fi); When I looked up, I noticed long sticks of wood hanging on strings from the ceiling. There was at least three dozen wooden sticks that were formerly church pews, all sized, cut and hung by the owner and his wife/ partner, Eugene. In fact, I found out that everything in the space was completely refurbished and all the ingredients came from local farms/ markets. I imagined the wind blowing in, creating a soft flow of wooden wind chimes that calmed me immediately. The concept of Brooklyn Commune reminded me of Portland, especially since Windsor Terrace has a very quiet and residential, but a clean, quirky vibe. The Masala Seitan Wrap (Vegan: marinated seitan, spinach masala, eggplant, chana, wheat wrap) was exotic but familiar. It had a perfect amount of spice and that slight tinge of tamarind exoticism that made the seitan enjoyable - a very savory wrap indeed. In general, I'm not crazy about potato chips, but it fits well with the wrap. For some reason, the food reminded me of Sunnyside, Queens, with its vast array of gourmet and international cuisine... then it took me to Asia. Something about the wrap reminded me of taking the 14 hour train rides in sleeper bunks from the South to Central China. It triggered memories of buying packs of a very South East Asian treat- preserved Seitan- and the Eggplant dish in the dining car... And then came the tears.When it comes to sentimentalism, certain food, like other triggers (visual art, dance, music, etc) are at the center of our emotive receptors. Good food, can create such precise reactions. Amazingly, that is what the wrap did for me. One can only understand Asia if one were in the midst of the locals and understood the meaning of every sight, sound, cultural happening and of course, taste. Seitan is a very malleable food- yet, very few chefs (even the Chinese ones) are able to make it ""common"" and flavorful enough for the regular Joe, above all, for the acute foodie to recall specific memories from rural villages while globetrotting. Seitan, like other soy based protein products, has been gentrified by the Western media and sold in gourmet and vegan stores; At times, it gets a bad rep (even with all the nutritional qualities), because it doesn't taste good, simply because it is constantly being experimented on for the Western Palette. However, if you allow its natural flavor to shine with other spices, it will compliment them beautifully- You'll see that it is one of the most delicious/ unique tastes that one can experience. Coupling it with Masala, a common Indian variant (along with other SE Asian spices), every bite took me back to my time writing and farming in Wotan, Hunan, a rural mountain town in the middle of Hunan Province, with a population of 250. Those who have ever traveled alone in foreign countries for long periods of time, know that the constant stress of traveling makes you learn extremely fast, forces you to rely on your wits, vivid memories and other sentimental iconism. To me, Seitan was the food of solitary days/ nights riding in 11 hour-train rides, motorbikes and China's charcoal smoke filled air. Tears started up and I stopped short in awe. Whether or not this was the actual catalyst did not matter. The Seitan melted in my mouth and a jumble of charcoal filled memories were conjured in one intense second. Good food can do this. The Average Joe wouldn't get it, but the globetrotting foodie will cry when eating an unsuspecting gourmet wrap. Go ahead, take a bite. Close your eyes. Feel. FIN.",5.0
"A great neighborhood spot.  The food is good (although the dinner menu is still pretty small) and the coffee is very tasty/strong.  Aside from that, Brooklyn Commune represents the best of Windsor Terrace.  It acts as a focal-point for a developing neighborhood.  Feels welcoming regardless of whether I'm just running in for a cup of coffee or coming in with friends for dinner.",5.0
"My mom and I came here with a groupon deal. We had the ginger soda which was very tasty and then for entrees we has the gnocchi and the steak. The dinner menu is very very limited, not sure if they rotate but I hope so!! The gnocchi was really good but the steak was bland, fatty and not cooked well. The potatoe side was good though. The waitress tried to overcharge me for a dessert. Besides for that, the place itself is pretty cute.",3.0
"I'm really into my coffee, and Brooklyn Commune's was just okay. I had a muffin once and an egg sandwich another time. They were fine, just nothing special. It's a great space, service can be a little unpleasant, all in all nothing to go out of your way for.",3.0
Been here a few times to meet up with a friend and chat. Coffee and Hot chocolate are delicious. They have a limited but nice selection of food. It's a real comfy atmosphere that is ideal for conversation and for working. I love that it's kind of out of the way. Will be back for sure!,4.0
"This place is so adorable. The staff is really nice and friendly and the whole atmosphere is very inviting and laid back. The food is really good. When I went we had tried their prefixed menu which was very reasonably priced and offered basically similar things on the regular menu. I started off with the fried calamari which was cooked perfectly and really tasty, I then had the fettuccine with duck which just needed a little salt but was otherwise very good. For desert I had the shortbread cookies which were delicious. Overall it was a great meal. Bring your own alcohol is always a plus as well. I have also been to this place for a cooking class and learned a lot and made an awesome meal from start to finish. The owners are so sweet and nice and I love that they opt to use locally grown produce from there area.",4.0
"The food and service were exceptional. The chicken rillette was exquisite along with the presentation. We ordered a variety of entrees from the fish and chips, Beef Wellington and the duck, everything was prepared so perfect. We truly enjoyed this dining experience.  It's conveniently located by a couple of train stops. Put this on your list of places to go in Brooklyn. You will not be disappointed!",5.0
"HMMM, a new place on the corner what would be the difference from the eateries that are already on the secluded strip, I wondered!?! Tasty, new options & organic too... NICE! My favorite thing is the garlic string beans (never thought I would enjoy cold, blanched greens) I've tried some of the other cold bean options & I wasn't as thrilled. I enjoy the sandwiches (except for the egg/ omelet, yuck on the hard bread); ham & brie (OMG, yummy) also, the pork and tuna sandwiches are well put together. I am not a big fan of the coffee they sell, it never get s sweet and I end up with a pile of sugar. This is a good lunch option a little more than I like to spend on lunch so it's a pay week treat but, if you want good food you pay for it! The staff is pretty friendly as well... Go check them out!",3.0
"Every time I go here, I regret it. The sandwiches are bland and soggy-tasting. The salads taste like they're about the expire. The worst thing is the service. The counter people are so rude. Everyone looks depressed and bored; like they think they're too good to be there. Even the owners hate being there.",1.0
"Best dinner we've had in awhile. We've used a groupon twice here and will definitely be coming back. Every taste is savory and only locally grown and seasonal items are on the menu. This makes for heavy experimentation by chef Chris using staples like beets, sweet potatoes (my fave), pumpkin, etc. There are multicolored sauces on plates that have you asking the waiter, what's in this? What's that? Also cocktail sauce aspic (!) The beef Wellington on the current menu is melt in your mouth good as is the mushroom and rye berry pasta. We also ordered the fish and chips which were lightly coated and very well seasoned, over the top delicious. The portions aren't big but our table of four had appetizers and we were all sampling from each other's plates. The place is BYOB so we had a large bottle of white which we couldn't even finish. The brownie was delicious as were the milk and cookies. Our bellies were full and happy when we left there .",5.0
"I ordered. I ate. I cried. True story. Were I less of an adventurous soul, I would have simply stayed in the city or along the 7 train for some serious eats; However, since having been connected to the 2x James Beard Award Winner, Chris Scott, I have often wondered what sort of man was behind the food and the community culture that he's created. Above all, I've been very interested in the Brooklyn Food scene, which seems to be burgeoning in such a way that I could no longer ignore it. I had first heard about BC through Robicelli's.

"So we returned recently to give dinner here another chance.  When we arrived at around 6:30 on a weeknight, the restaurant was really dark and for a minute, we thought it was closed.  I can only imagine what potential customers--either walking or driving by may have thought.  I guess this was an attempt to create ambience, though I do not recall it being nearly as dark on our first visit.

As someone who is really, really into baking, the dessert menu here (I am aware that it changes periodically) really bugs me the more I think about it.  Somehow,it  manages to make me feel like the Chef is trying too hard and not trying hard enough--all at the same time.  The recent selecion of brownies with ice cream so heavily infused with saffron it tasted like freezer burn, well that felt a lot like trying too hard to me.  I get that savory and sweet can work together.  But in this case, no.  Just no.  Then there's the offering of Amy's cookies and milk.  I *think* they may be the same cookies they serve all day at the cafe and I don't get it.  First of all, dinner here is so not kid-friendly.  And really, they are the only ones I could really see being remotely interested in ordering this.

The space is lovely as the restaurant is on a corner and gets light from two sides. We were also able to hear ourselves when we talked. If you are looking for a place where the noise is overwhelming, which seems to be the goal for many restaurants these days, then Brooklyn Commune is not for you. We avoid such restaurants ourselves.

This place gets a solid 5 stars from me. Been there a few times both during the day for a coffee/sandwich and for dinner. Both menu's are terrific. I think the dishes are creative and simple at the same time. The fact that it's BYOB is also great. I don't live in the neighborhood but always try to combine a visit to Prospect Park with a visit to the Brooklyn Commune.,5.0
The food and ambiance is nice and its a block from my house. It's a bit pricey though and they seem understaffed as service is slow. But they are very nice and yummy,4.0

"When they first opened, i was kind of disappointed that a place like this had so few vegan options, but then came the summer menu and their decision to carry Barry's Tempeh! The TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce and Tomato sandwich ) is now one of my favorite things to eat. Smoky sweet tempeh, with tomato relish, guac, lettuce and tomatoes on perfectly toasted sourdough bread? My dear lord but its good! They've also added a tofu scramble for breakfast (also served with the tempeh) which is delicious.Staff and owners are A++ as is the atmosphere. Be prepared for a stroller obstacle course and noisy kids on weekend mornings though. Not the fault of the owners, of course. Definitely a gem in our little corner of Windsor Terrace.",5.0
"Like others have mentioned, there is a dearth of good cafes in the area so I was truly looking forward to the place opening. Underwhelming. The lighting sucks (the bare bulb fixtures are nice but the light cast is cold and slightly sickening). The food is mediocre and pricey. I've tried four different types of soup there, and all were bland and thin (aside from the parsnip, which was more like a thick sauce than a soup). The sandwiches weren't memorable. The tomato relish on the BLT tasted like strawberry-inflected ketchup. BLTS are the one sandwich which ought not be cheekily reinvented. It's like a bad cover band singing a Funkadelic song. Regrettably, BC doesn't have an espresso machine, only drip coffee. They serve Stumptown at the right temperature, thankfully. I hate to say it but I prefer the food at Crossroads, and that's a problem as the food at Crossroads ain't all that. And is there much of a difference between this place and Crossroads intrinsically? Here's yet another example of a shop that wouldn't last six months if it were relocated to a more commercial area of the city. And the name is irksome. i don't think a commune should charge $9 -- or was it $10? -- for a pint of soup. It seems like the place requires the name Brooklyn on its awning because without it, you might be confused and think you were in Morton, Pennsylvania or Hobart, Minnesota by the mediocrity of the food and the desperation of the decor. I will say that the counter staff is very kind and courteous but that's just not enough to seduce me.",3.0

"The idea behind this place is noteworthy- support local products, everything fresh.  And Windsor Terrace is in dire need of restaurants, coffee shops, produce shops.  However, the idea did not translate well to reality.  This might be a weekend problem, but it was really not a great experience.  We were so excited about this place, and left disappointed. -Only a few menu options, and even with a limited menu, we waited 50 minutes for our food.-Seemed disorganized and inexperienced.-The chef grabs some pickled veggies with his bare hand, drops them on the plate, then grabs some chips and drops them on the plate.  This results in soggy chips.  -Expensive- $8.50 for a BLT, no fries.  Honestly we could get a huge thai meal for that price. -Place was very crowded mostly with people waiting for their food.  We overheard several comments about slow service and lost orders.The owners appeared very friendly and willing, but it just wasn't working.  We were pretty exasperated after 40 min of waiting, and then saw half our order go to someone else (we saw the ticket with our name on it) who was about to start yelling at the chef (and had ordered the same sandwich).  Maybe hire some more kitchen staff?  Sell only salads and soups?  Don't know, but won't be returning for a while... At least not for a meal.",2.0
"I have been here three times now, and have had good food and good experiences each time. The wide-open room is spacious and airy, but seems under-utilized. I am a fan of communal seating, and the large table is very comfortable. There are smaller tables that offer some privacy, and a counter at one of the windows. Still, the space and seating seem poorly configured. The food is fresh and tasty, and the portions are good-sized. Sweets are lacking on the menu. The cookies are sort of lame and over-priced (my $4+ dessert of coffee and cookies was disappointing). Serving breakfast into the late afternoon on weekends would be a welcome addition! The staff are friendly and efficient, and always helpful. Service is generally very good, and it would be easier to tip the staff if service was a little more straightforward.

"When they first opened, i was kind of disappointed that a place like this had so few vegan options, but then came the summer menu and their decision to carry Barry's Tempeh! The TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce and Tomato sandwich ) is now one of my favorite things to eat. Smoky sweet tempeh, with tomato relish, guac, lettuce and tomatoes on perfectly toasted sourdough bread? My dear lord but its good! They've also added a tofu scramble for breakfast (also served with the tempeh) which is delicious.Staff and owners are A++ as is the atmosphere. Be prepared for a stroller obstacle course and noisy kids on weekend mornings though. Not the fault of the owners, of course. Definitely a gem in our little corner of Windsor Terrace.",5.0
"Like others have mentioned, there is a dearth of good cafes in the area so I was truly looking forward to the place opening. Underwhelming. The lighting sucks (the bare bulb fixtures are nice but the light cast is cold and slightly sickening). The food is mediocre and pricey. I've tried four different types of soup there, and all were bland and thin (aside from the parsnip, which was more like a thick sauce than a soup). The sandwiches weren't memorable. The tomato relish on the BLT tasted like strawberry-inflected ketchup. BLTS are the one sandwich which ought not be cheekily reinvented. It's like a bad cover band singing a Funkadelic song. Regrettably, BC doesn't have an espresso machine, only drip coffee. They serve Stumptown at the right temperature, thankfully. I hate to say it but I prefer the food at Crossroads, and that's a problem as the food at Crossroads ain't all that. And is there much of a difference between this place and Crossroads intrinsically? Here's yet another example of a shop that wouldn't last six months if it were relocated to a more commercial area of the city. And the name is irksome. i don't think a commune should charge $9 -- or was it $10? -- for a pint of soup. It seems like the place requires the name Brooklyn on its awning because without it, you might be confused and think you were in Morton, Pennsylvania or Hobart, Minnesota by the mediocrity of the food and the desperation of the decor. I will say that the counter staff is very kind and courteous but that's just not enough to seduce me.",3.0

"The idea behind this place is noteworthy- support local products, everything fresh.  And Windsor Terrace is in dire need of restaurants, coffee shops, produce shops.  However, the idea did not translate well to reality.  This might be a weekend problem, but it was really not a great experience.  We were so excited about this place, and left disappointed. -Only a few menu options, and even with a limited menu, we waited 50 minutes for our food.-Seemed disorganized and inexperienced.-The chef grabs some pickled veggies with his bare hand, drops them on the plate, then grabs some chips and drops them on the plate.  This results in soggy chips.  -Expensive- $8.50 for a BLT, no fries.  Honestly we could get a huge thai meal for that price. -Place was very crowded mostly with people waiting for their food.  We overheard several comments about slow service and lost orders.The owners appeared very friendly and willing, but it just wasn't working.  We were pretty exasperated after 40 min of waiting, and then saw half our order go to someone else (we saw the ticket with our name on it) who was about to start yelling at the chef (and had ordered the same sandwich).  Maybe hire some more kitchen staff?  Sell only salads and soups?  Don't know, but won't be returning for a while... At least not for a meal.",2.0
"I have been here three times now, and have had good food and good experiences each time. The wide-open room is spacious and airy, but seems under-utilized. I am a fan of communal seating, and the large table is very comfortable. There are smaller tables that offer some privacy, and a counter at one of the windows. Still, the space and seating seem poorly configured. The food is fresh and tasty, and the portions are good-sized. Sweets are lacking on the menu. The cookies are sort of lame and over-priced (my $4+ dessert of coffee and cookies was disappointing). Serving breakfast into the late afternoon on weekends would be a welcome addition! The staff are friendly and efficient, and always helpful. Service is generally very good, and it would be easier to tip the staff if service was a little more straightforward. I place my order at the counter, and there is a tip can at the register. Instead of waiting at the counter, I am instructed to take a seat, and servers deliver the food.

It's not bad for $7 and it was quite delish and fulfilled my heart's desire of getting warmed up. I also really like their coffee- it's a light and smooth blend that doesn't require much cream and sugar. I will take anything other than Starbucks these days. This place also appears to have some healthy food options like a tofu scramble and organic salads. So there are definitely some options for the vegans out there. Service is pretty decent.

The Stumptown coffee is nicely brewed.  The staff are very friendly and genuinely appear to want to get to know you.They also sell beans, dried pasta, and other unique and somewhat high-end grocery items.  I'm not sure how successful that would be.  I'd say stick to what they do best, and that is churning out delicious meals from the kitchen with friendly and attentive service.",4.0
"Close, but needs some work. This restaurant is much needed in this area, and it represents a new feeling and ethos that is beginning to flourish in this neighborhood: a more middle class Park Slope full of people who want local, ethically grown, organic food, with sophisticated but simple flavors. The restaurant is new, and they still have kinks to work out. Unfortunately, almost every time I have gone in there is something to disappoint, which is a bummer because I want SO MUCH to love this place. There is nice variety, local ingredients, sophisticated flavor profiles, and an upscale feel to the place, but other elements need to catch up.  To start, the food is pricey for what it is (everything is about $2 more than I would expect/hope to pay), which would be fine if it was done right, but it often isn't. The chicken sandwich on their winter menu, was delicious, but was VERY skimpy on the chicken (for the high price). Their ceasar salad may as well be called an ""oil of anchovy"" salad, and again was awfully small for the high price. I like a little anchovy flavor, but this is the only flavor in this uncreamy, unappetizing salad. Yuck. The tofu Vietnamese sandwich from their winter menu was good, but could have been better (the bread was very soggy). The chickpea salad is dry and lacking in flavor. Their broccoli rabe was bitter - it's a bitter tasting vegetable - but coupled with lemon, it just made it more bitter, not delicious or savory. Their Sumptown coffee beans are probably free trade and organic, but they're expensive and the taste is not worth the cost. Today we ordered their falafel wrap, and the falafel was inedibly hard and dry. It seemed like it was baked (great! healthy!), so there was no moisture from being fried in oil, but yeesh, do they try their own food? $8.50 for a vegetarian sandwich that I can't eat? Also, the food always takes longer to be prepared than what I imagine these simple foods that should be prepped and mostly pre-made anyway. Why do two cold sandwiches take 20 minutes? And lastly, if your order is taken by a middle aged white guy, make sure to check your order. He's lovely, but he always forgets something in my order (that I have already paid for and by then I have walked all the way home). I want them to succeed, but they need to improve, or else I need to stop paying them to continually disappoint me.",2.0

I went there recently on a Saturday morning at almost 9:30 and they weren't open yet. WTF? They're not open on weekday mornings as I'm on my way to work, about 8:10 or so. And they're practically on top of a subway entrance. How not smart is that? And how annoying? They don't post a sign outside saying what their hours are so that I know whether to venture down there for a cup of coffee or not before 11 a.m. That's my suggestion for a big improvement: wake up and open up your coffee place so that people who wake up earlier than 10 a.m. (read people with kids and people who work day jobs) can grab a cup of coffee on the way to the playground or the commute.",3.0

"Sandwiches are delicious, as is the coffee. It's wonderful to have this much-needed addition to the neighborhood.

"I live in Ft. Greene and come here on both weekdays and weekends for the veggie- friendly, local food on the menu!  The design and ambiance of this place is amazing. Today, I was able to taste their Red Velvet Pancakes which were even more delicious than the sound.  The service is unbelievable and I really appreciate how the owners have really worked hard at making this not only a restaurant, but a place that serves the community!  It is one of my favorite spots and look forward to more visits to the Commune!",5.0
"I love this place.  I've tried a couple different breakfasts here (cheese grits and the nicoise breakfast), and they're both really great.  I've also had some excellent soups and I swear by the vegan TLT on nights when I get home from work too tired to cook.  Great coffee, great pickles, excellent sides, and their commitment to local and organic food, not to mention really interesting cooking, make Brooklyn Commune one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn.",5.0
"Great addition to Windsor Terrace...Stumptown Coffee rocks...all food is organic shmanic grass fed free range etc...salads are always fresh, tasty, and inspired. Sandwiches are good...not great..but good....desserts are kinda pricey... more than $2 for a little cookie!...Service is always great and it's quiet even when packed. Great addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"Second time in a row I pay $2.25 for tepid cold decaf. When I ask to warm it up they nuke it. Cold = old , guys. Put on a fresh pot. Also there doesn't seem to be a kitchen exhaust fan. Smells like an old kitchen and leaves your clothes smelling not so charming.",2.0
"Really excited to have this place in the neighborhood, and would give 3.5 stars if I could. I hope the spot can get over some of the initial opening/first week growing pains.The soup was delicious! Like the name also, moody soup...aka, soup of the mood I guess, this one was squash and pear. Really, really, tasty.I wish they would have some more vegetarian Sandwich options; I hate when places make the one veggie sandwich a wrap, like people are vegetarian because of an eating disorder not other environmental/anti corporate farm reasons.Very excited for the produce and salads and the stumptown coffee and homemade soda was delicious.I have never seen so many toddlers in the hood, not sure where they all came from, and why they stayed so long, this is no fault of this place, but is there anything to be done?Did not have breakfast on opening day, so looking forward ti trying it. Though, unless it is amazing will probably stick to Terrace as their 3 dollar delicious bagel sandwiches will be hard to beat the 7.50 egg sandwich at Brooklyn commune.I hope to continue going here and continue adding stars, because I really want this place to succeed and become a much needed neighborhood mainstay.",3.0
"After a few months in operation, Brooklyn Commune has really hit its stride.  It serves great Stumptown coffee (though I still wish they had espresso drinks).  The space is attractive -- well thought out, with great flow.  But the real attraction is the food.  The menu changes with the seasons and they recently added, among other things, an incredible falafel sandwich.  They've actually managed to take falafel to a whole new level!  They also have homemade jams and condiments for sale, like the daikon kimchi that is better than anything available in K-town.  (I know:  I actually did a side-by-side taste test.)My greatest worry is that this place will be so successful that it will move to Manhattan or another more-chic part of Brooklyn.  It's that good.  Here at the Ft. Hamilton Station end of Windsor Terrace (stop calling this Kensington, dammit!), are we really worthy of Brooklyn Commune?",5.0

"Went for an 11AM Sunday breakfast with my 3-year old,my husband and our friend. We ordered at the counter and our food was brought out to us.

Smash the yolks, toss the greens on top and eat with bites of the bacon. Delicious! My daughter was more into the chips served with her grilled cheese, but the sandwich was made with good cheese and seemed to be grilled on a panini press. Stumptown coffee, which was great as usual. The ingredients were of good quality and worth the money. I plan on heading back soon for another go-round with the lyonnaise!",4.0

"Brooklyn Commune's best kept secret is the soup of the day. If you're lunching on a budget, get the soup!  It's hidden near the bottom of the menu but it is worth every bite.  For $5, you can buy a cup (more like a pint) of soup with unusual but surprisingly complimentary and tongue-tantalizing flavors. And if that doesn't sway you to try it, I'll give you an example of some of the soups I've enjoyed. Summer peach with blackened salmon served cold, savory carrot ginger, vegan celery root, and last nights deliciously gourmet duck soup with sausage and sweet corn. They also have a great menu, fresh ingredients, and a quiet neighborhood vibe to fall in love with.  The prices are a bit steep, but I trust the quality and flavor of the food that I don't feel guilty spending $10-12 on a truly satisfying meal. See what I mean? I'm hooked.  As should you be. My only suggestion would be to incorporate espresso into their drink menu.  They have the advantage of their location by the train station and could benefit from opening early for the morning commuters tired from the weekend and desperate for a caffeine fix a.k.a ME.",4.0
