"I went in for brunch today and was so happy with my experience here :-)Our server and everyone working was so nice, friendly and helpful! All of our food and drinks were great, super yummy. The ambiance was really nice, also. It's a beautiful space and I loved the music being played. Will def come back~ excited to try more. xo",5.0
"I'm happy to see a new restaurant like this opening in my neighborhood.  The design/decor is nice but not the most original.   The layout and  ""duplex"" window walls in the back are cool!  The cocktails were really good, the food was a little disappointing.  My friend and I both ordered the pork entree.  Both of our dishes were WAY over-salted.   It was edible but not very enjoyable.  I do believe that if the dish was seasoned properly, it would have been good.  My boyfriend ordered the so called ""special"" which was a pulled chicken sandwich.   He said it had hardly any chicken in it and that came with a lousy portion of fries all for $15.  I also noticed the fry portion was bad because I stole a few, I'll admit they were tasty.  Our unanimous decision was if you're going to charge Bushwick dwellers Manhattan prices at your restaurant, your shit needs to be on point!",3.0
"I would like to give the place a 4-star, but I can't.Arrived mid-afternoon on a Tuesday and the place was almost empty, not a negative to me. They have a long bar at the entry, an upstairs and a downstairs (more like a split-level-downstairs) seating area. The place has a laid-back, quiet vibe. My daughter and I chose downstairs as it was well-lit from the sunlight pouring in the large glass windows, and it was empty.Well, almost empty. There were little gnatty fruitflies (not sure what they're called, but those little annoying gnatty fruitfly-type things) that appeared after we'd ordered and settled in.I was shocked as they kept coming. Already into our meal we decided to swat away and do our best.Food was very good, not great, but a solid 7+. Menu was interesting, and service was good.Coffee was horrific. Skip it if they offer.So, if you skip the coffee and they fix the gnat issue, it would be a solid 4-star. Barring that I can only go to 3.",3.0
"Absolutely loved doing brunch here. Small menu, but exactly what we were looking for. Hip interior design with a laid back, casual vibe. Nice to find a hidden gem like this that isn't laced with pretension. Incredibly nice staff.",5.0
"The location is vintage New York, as you make your underneath the J train tracks and through the discount stores and bodegas of Broadway, but the vibe is decidedly Miami. Our party of three (I was the third-wheel on this particular evening) took over a large semicircular table across from the bar, so we didn't get to experience the elevated dining room. Instead we were rewarded with close views of the enclosed kitchen and bartenders. We saw our carefully constructed cocktails and craft beers come right over to the table. My entree - a special for the evening - was a luscious crab pasta, with just the right amount of cheese mixed in. It was $16, which was very fair. I understand this is from the owner of the Bossa Nova Civic Club, and some of the preference for a reinvention of Art Deco-era nightlife is reflected in the decorating choices here. It also shares the sense of being slightly ahead of its time of this part of southwest Bushiwck. But just as Bossa Nova has turned into a neighborhood institution for its queer-focused dance parties and embrace of the City's trap scene, I can see the demand for an upscale, yet reasonably price place for dinner and a cocktail or two.",4.0
"Small gem in Brooklyn. Hidden away in a part of Brooklyn that I normally do not venture into, I came here for breakfast/brunch. Had the Juno Benedict and was not disappointed. I will be going for the sage egg sandwich next time since I saw it being served to another patron and it looked amazing too. The hot chocolate here is made fresh (I can tell by the taste) and just make sure you stir it up extra when you get it to unlock all the chocolate flavors locked away at the bottom of the glass.",5.0
Can't stop cumming!! Sooo good. Everything makes me to continue to cum in this restaurant. Been here 6 times in 3 weeks and can't get enough of this place. Shout out to their whole staff and all of their food dishes (I havent had a bad one yet). Hopefully you luck up and get there on a ribeye or bacon night.  #didjuno? #becausewedo,5.0
"I would consistently walk by Juno while it was under construction wondering what it was as the big airy windows caught my eye. I finally walked by a few weekends ago and saw that it was finally open! The interior is quite beautiful with a clean, sophisticated vibe much needed in the up and coming neighborhood on dirty myrtle avenue under the M train.  The staff, from the servers to the bartenders, was incredibly knowledgeable and cool and made me feel like I fit right into this Bushwick spot. I've tried several cocktails and my favorite was the Late Night Triumph. mmm tequila with a bit of sweet and spice, so delicious! All the food I've tried has been wonderful as well. I like that their menu lists meats as just chicken, pork, beef - as the cuts vary on what is best available that day. The pierogis are my favorite and will always get as an appetizer! The specials are always noteworthy and worth a try. They also have dj's on the weekend nights that makes a chill bar vibe that my friends and I like to just hang out and drink there till late in the morning and then stumble around the corner home. I heard they just started serving a late night menu that I am thrilled to try soon!It has also been my go to stop for coffee before getting on the M train in the mornings. They have a go to window and super amazing coffee so much superior than the coffee from the places nearby. I love Juno!!!",5.0

"This was just for the brunch. Cute space. My friend and I ordered the two eggs any way with bacon, hash brown, salad and toast. I had poached eggs that were extremely watery, and the salad size left me wanting more. My friend is allergic to gluten and they didn't tell her until our food arrived the hash browns had gluten in them, it would have been nice to know prior, as she would have ordered something else. It was overpriced for what we received, and they compensated for the food my friend could not eat with just 1 piece of extra bacon. The waitress' attitude left us feeling uncomfortable to ask for more. I also found a hair in my eggs, the waitress said ""oh."" Didn't offer a new plate. This was disconcerting as the table next to us found hairs in their drink.The bartender at the front was extremely friendly. We will be back for drinks, not food.",2.0

"Was excited to hear the folks behind Bossa Nova Civic Club opened a new place, but I can't really recommend it. Cocktails are great, but the menu is just ok and the service is seriously socially awkward. It's fine, but too expensive for what it is.",3.0

"Juno, a new American fare restaurant and cocktail bar, just opened this month (December 2015). I happened to meet the owner on the street in November and was invited to the food and drinks taste testing, some of which really blew me away. I was able to try many entrees on the menu. I would definitely go back for the Octopus and if you're in the company of vegetarians, the general Tso's eggplant. Juno also has an impressive cocktail menu. I returned to last night to end a relaxing night out, and we ordered 2 National Anthems since I liked it so much on tester night. The atmosphere was relaxed and comfortably half full considering it was a Monday night. Definitely will return for the food, drinks, and friendly service.",5.0
"Seriously good and a welcomed new addition to the neighborhood.  I've been for both brunch and dinner.  For brunch, I had the shrimp and blue corn grits, which was excellent, but maybe just as good was the malted cold brew coffee.  I'd go back just for that.  And it was served with these little metal straws with paddles on the end.  Honestly, I had to hold myself back from pocketing it, it was so cute.  For dinner, I had the burger which was maybe a bit too big for me (it's a double burger), but still really tasty.  The vibe is sexy and fun and was a hit with a group, and just me and my husband.",5.0

"I came to Juno for the first time on a business trip. It was on a rainy Wednesday and I needed  lunch. A bunch of friends and casual acquaintances recommended I tryout this new hip diner on myrtle avenue. Carrying only a $20 bill & an AMEX card (we all know how THAT is... ) I decided to give it a shot. Even though expectations were low.... Please read on. I was greeted by a very interesting fellow and we talked a great deal about artificial intelligence, human extinction, the presidential election, astral projections and near death experiences. A delicate and well manicured playlist of funky, danceable yet intellectual music caressed our conversation at a reasonable volume while I stirred raw cane sugar into my daily steamy cortado, destroying the beautful floral design the server painstakingly bestowed upon me. Anyways.... Let's  talk seriously their FOOD! My breakfast burrito, was a sensuous bouquet that consisted of organic fluffy eggs, hearty & nutritious black rice, golden dewdrops of melted cheddar, an exotic satchel of pickled jalapeño medallions, and sliced avocado, nestled snuggle in a flour tortilla blanked. It was cut in half and served with hot sauce and sour cream. After learning they take Amex, and having such a great time, I impulsively topped off my hravenly afternoon with a glass of 2013 domaine de belle vue, a naturally sparkling white wine that took me closer to heaven at every tiny sip, and continued socially awkward yet intriguing convo that seemed to go on for ages. I live in gowanus most of the time but if I ever shouldfind myself in Bushwick.... You can be sure i will certainly unequivocally visit this new classic American neighborhood institution. God bless Juno Diner. When you are here, you are FAMILY",5.0
"My new favorite neighborhood brunch spot. The food is delicious the Bloody Mary's are spot on, the prices aren't bad. It's no Tandem but it'll suffice as a great new neighborhood hang out. The entire waitstaff are extremely easy on the eyes, but seem to still be getting the hang of working this new restaurant. I'm sure they will only improve over time.
