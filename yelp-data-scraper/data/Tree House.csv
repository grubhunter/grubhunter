"I came here for brunch with my friends. I love that Tree House is so near my home in Bed-Stuy. It is a nice edition to the neighborhood.The menu had interesting choices and I wanted to try everything. They have unlimited mimosas for $15 which is a great deal (especially because they have so many flavors of mimosas). The decor was nice, welcoming and comfortable.The service was ok. We were a big party (but other than that, the restaurant wasn't busy at the time that we were there). It took a while to get our orders in and it also took a while to get our food. I ordered the crab cakes which came with curried corn and corn bread and my friend got the salmon pancakes with avocado salad on top. We also shared a side of scallion grits. The food was pretty good. I think that the portions are very small for the price of the food.I am curious to try their dinner menu. I really think that this restaurant has a lot of potential to be amazing. Either the prices should be lowered or the portions should be larger.Other than that, this is a nice place and I would come back.",3.0
Nice spot. Went here with a friend for late night drinks.  Had the sorrel punch which was great.  Drinks came fast and strong.  Service was on point.  Space was small but well designed with tables in the back and front and bar in the center. A nice find and I'll be back! As an aside.... We were by the kitchen which felt like a sauna... a bit uncomfortable,4.0
"Different vibes from the new owners!!The appetizers were good but my favorite was the henny punch that the bartender insisted we try  ( Henri) who was was so nice, patient and funny.  Also very attentive! Good customer service in there... can't wait to go back for the henny punch. Good music also!",4.0
"The colors of the walls plus the great music make the bar a modern and cool place to go and hang out with friends!The beer is cheap, they have a considerable variety of drinks and the cider that I had was very good (JK scrumpy hard cider)!I totally recommend this new spot in Bed Stuy! :)",4.0
"Sooooo the ambiance here is tranquil yet somehow still upbeat. Feels very personal, almost like I was home. The food here is delicious and the prices are doable. I have to say this again. The food is really good. Didn't try any of the cocktails but I will next time. Definitely coming back here whenever I'm in town. And it's a BOB! Boom.",5.0
"Tree House is very cozy and it's also affordable. The shrimp and the crab cake is my favorite. The fries are homemade and the music is great. When spring comes the deck will be a nice spot to eat, drink, and chill. Ms. Ella, the owner, is always there making sure you are enjoying the food and the atmosphere.",5.0
"This is absolutely the best addition to the neighborhood. We came here on Saturday for the first time, they are in the soft opening phase but you would NEVER know. Everything is A+. There is a beautiful outdoor  back area, a few cozy padded benches and several candle lit tables. So far I have had the firecracker shrimp, ripe plantains with red pepper dipping sauce and tree house glaze chicken wings. Everything was perfect, the red pepper dipping sauce is out of this world!!!! The bartenders are very friendly and make a nice strong drink. I am excited about the Tree House and look forward to its continued success.",5.0
"I think this was the opening weekend for this establishment and I'm glad we ended up coming.   Its a really nice lounge/bar with a zen like decor and mood.  I tried the Don Tree, pretty tasty, not a large drink, but tangy.  We didn't order food but it smelled great (no its not vegan).   Pretty sure we will be back.   I hope they keep the chill vibe.",4.0
"This place is new, obviously, but it's going to come up really quick. I love the vibe, the owners are nice, and they have TV's! That's a big one for me, because I live beers on tap and live sports. I've watched Sunday Night football here, as well as the Knicks night games.",5.0
"Did an event there and the food was amazing. The chef was sooooo on point. Had fried shrimp, Yuca with a mash potato presentation and fried sweet potato. I ate twice it was so good. I highly recommend this place. It also has an outside area that's very appealing.",5.0
"This place is amazing!! The food is great! The drinks are great! The service is great and they're so friendly! And the atmosphere is perfect! It will be an especially great place to visit during the summer because they have a beautiful patio in the back with lots of seating. I definitely recommend the crab cakes, mussels and grilled shrimp. Everything tasted so fresh and had great flavor to it. I will definitely be back! This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood!",5.0
"Bedford Stuyvesant has a  new swanky watering hole.  Zen, Modern upbeat but chill is what comes to mind when describing the space, I really think these folk get it, on the entire Customer service thing, it was an A 1 experience the drinks were amazing and the food not far behind.  Go there Friday's or Sunday's are  the best!!! I saw young business professionals and folks that look as if there were part of the Artist scene there mingling with business suit types.  Happy hour was lit to say the least, Awesome staff, they were so much fun!!!!. I will return for the great atmosphere, I predict this will be a Brooklyn hot spot, mark my words.",5.0
