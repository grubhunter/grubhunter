"Legitimately left my house not knowing where to go to eat with my friend. He's vegetarian and most of my food at home is meat. I also didn't feel like cooking today. Got in my car and he said that this was a hot, new place and it is basically down the block from me.Go in and the ambiance is nice and hipster. The entire place inside and out is rustic. It feels authentic because they play Middle Eastern music. Oh and for those of you looking for some drinks, happy hour is from 12-7. $5 beers and house wines. We order a pistachio personal pizza to share. That was absolutely fantastic. I don't know how it works but it does. It's crushed pistachios over a pizza. And not just a few pistachios. The entire pie was layered in pistachios. I got the DAR burger, which is a burger with feta cheese and some veggies. It was also super good. My friend got their falafel dish. He definitely liked it.For desert, we got basbousa which is like a coconut cake A bit dry for my tastes but it's actually good. I'm used to flan types of cakes drenched in milks. Finally, we got the Arabic coffee which is supposedly stronger than espresso. We will see about that! :)Highly suggest this place if you're in Greenpoint!",5.0
"Our absolute favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. We used to live in Williamsburg and would visit the Grand Street location at least once a week. Now we live in Greenpoint and we were going through withdrawal before the new location opened!Delicious food, great options. Couldn't recommend enough!",5.0
"I like Dar 525 very very much. The burger is delicious, the falafel was not the best I've had, the chicken soup just as yummy as my mom's (who is a chef) and the brunch mushroom pizza could have had the eggs cooked a bit more. The mix review on the food was done on purpose, just to say some on the items on the menu might have room for improvement does not mean I didn't like them, I still ate every last bite.Will I continue to order online and visit the restaurant? You bet! I think they are aware of their hits and misses, they make a real effort to provide fresh, good quality food and I cannot complain about the service, every time we have been there we have been treated exceptionally well. I live nearby and I'm just happy to have Dar close by. Love the music they play at the restaurant, the fresh baked bread and the diversity in the menu.",4.0
"This cozy corner reopened a space that was dormant for years. This makes me happy. It was a boring Sat, and the decision was to go out aimless in search of food. Luckily Dar popped up and we set our sights. Middle Eastern fare was on our radar because let's be honest, what's more satisfying than delicious meats or vegetables options with fresh ingredients? Dar delivered the goods for sure. The spot is cozy. A well needed addition to south GP, Dar serves up a great selection of app dips, Kafta platters, veggie lovers pita sammies, and delicious pizzas with all the usual suspects. The latter of which is something I will return to enjoy. This is a great new addition to the neighborhood. I literally might go back tomorrow... The price point is spot on for the portions and offerings. Do go now",4.0
"Home away from home!I stopped into Dar 525, for a late lunch during the opening weekend of it's second Brooklyn location. The Mediterranean-styled restaurant felt comfortable and cozy, decorated with hanging lamps and colorful pillows which aligned the back wall.  The dining room feels intimate as it is filled with less than 10 tables and a traditional firing brick oven positioned behind the bar.The temperature dropped a bit this day, so for a starter, the chicken soup was the obvious choice for me. The chicken soup is served with freshly baked pita bread. The middle of the bread is filled with air and I couldn't help but smile when it arrived to the table and I was able to ""pop"" the middle of the fluffy pita, and watch the warm air flush out.For my entrée, I ordered the lamb kebob platter, which I highly recommend. The lamb was tender and tasted delicious. The platter is a good choice if you have a big appetite because it comes with pita bread, salad, rice, hummus and baba ganoush. I enjoyed the baba ganoush and recommend this dish on it's own as a first course to share with others.",5.0
"Dar 525 is a mecca for Mediterranean food! I live for their pita which is a puff ball of amazingness. Decided try out this Greenpoint location, one of two in Brooklyn for lunch and came out feeling more than satisfied. I ordered one of their six lunch special platters, the Kafta kebab, which had ground lamb and beef, pita bread, green salad, rice, and baba ganoush. All that food for $8! The ground lamb and beef were succulent with a medley of aromatic spices and full of flavors. Everything on the platter complements each other. The coolest part is the pita which is made fresh to order in their own. From any angle in the restaurant, you can see the oven. When I saw the pita, I didn't realize it would be a ball. It doesn't lose its puffiness until you poke a hole in it. Not only is it light and delicate but also a perfect accompaniment to the baba ganoush. The restaurant isn't particularly large so it's more for small groups. There windows blanket warm natural lighting to the dark woods of the space. The aforementioned oven is the main feature in the decor. Service is wonderful and the lady even gave a complementary dessert which I forget the name of but it was a pistachio cake with honey with a fragrant floral essence I surprisingly loved. It was the perfect sweet end to a great meal. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",5.0
"I had the chicken kabab lunch plate and loved every bite. Delicious, wholesome and cooked perfectly! The fresh baked pita was a pleasant and delicious surprise.  Really, really loved the food, the atmosphere and the service.",5.0
If I could marry a restaurant and live happily ever after with its food this would be it. I've been eating at the location on Grand for a couple of years and they never disappoint (amazing food and service that is consistent). Love their new location.,5.0
Just got done with dinner and had to let the world know- Dar 525 in Greenpoint is so so good! We had the Dar burger and tilapia dinner. We also got a side of falafel to share and then a piece of baklava for desert. Everything was just so fresh and delicious. The prices are really great too- you get a lot for what you pay!,5.0
"Excellent lamb kebab and savory baba ghanouj. Up the block from my house is a big plus. Come here, we want it to be successful as it well deserves.",5.0
Really great Mediterranean. The assorted platter is fantastic! I especially recommend the babaganoush and  muhamara. Their falafel is also good. Their basbousa/semolina cake is a delicious way to end your meal.  Fast delivery too!It is also worthwhile to dine-in here. The atmosphere is really cute & cozy. They also serve a fantastic brunch!,4.0
This place is the real deal. Had the mixed meat platter. Perfectly cooked. Every piece of meat in it was tender and juicy. Hummus and baba ganoush was great as well. Cucumber yogurt was a bit watery for my liking. I would highly recommend delivery from this place because I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.,5.0
"I went to Lebanon and fell in love with labne. This is the best labne I've had since. Oh did I tell you I love labne? So glad this place opened up. Honestly the best middle eastern food I have in NYC. And it's cheap. And they bake their pita fresh and bring it to the table. The Syrian rolls are delicious. I have both the chicken gyro and chicken swarama and they are both delicious. Also the babaganoush is also the best I have had in NYC. Haven't tried the pizza yet but they look great. One strange thing is their humus isn't that great. They also have great lunch specials, $5 for a sandwich.",5.0
"Obsessed with this place!! Love the vibe, the light, the food, the music. Prices are very reasonable too!!! So happy Dar is in my neighborhood.",5.0

"What a gem! So excited this place opened in my neighborhood! We've been twice and had the burger, the herbed eggs, and the Mediterranean omelette- all for  brunch. Can't beat the freshly baked pita bread! Everything just tastes FRESH! The staff is super friendly, and the place is really cute too. Can't wait to come here for dinner.",5.0
"Great to have another food option in the neighborhood, especially since we lost Greenpoint Heights and Boulevard.  But solid food, good prices, comfortable atmosphere.  Can get a bit toasty with the oven, but its part of the charm.  Huge fan of the cucumber dip.",4.0
"Just like the original location the food is awesome, but if I spend $18 + tax  for 3 containers of dip it should come with enough pita to actually finish the dip.",2.0
Went there twice on the same weekend.. ordered the same dish on the Brunch menu.  Done perfectly each time.  The manager served us and made sure we were attended to.  This will be my go to place for Syrian food in NY.,5.0
Probably the best quality-price mediterranean restaurant in the whole Wburg/Greenpoint area. You can't go wrong with the kebbeh as appetizers. Prefer then the platter than sandwiches for main. And the place is 'bring your own bottle'... What else?,5.0

"I gave this place 3 stars mostly because of their service, not the food. However, the food wasn't exactly the best Mediterranean food I've ever had either.When my boyfriend and I walked in at around 7 pm on a Friday, the small seating area seemed mostly full with only 2 tables of 2 empty, so we took this as a good sign. (Boy were we wrong.) We weren't greeted for over 5 minutes after walking in and standing at the door awkwardly. I understand the waitress (who I guess doubles as the hostess?) had her hands full, but the least she could have done is say hi and let us know she'll be right there, like most other places do. When we finally got a table and placed our order, I noticed my knife was dirty so I asked for another one, and the second one I was given was also not clean. I decided not to ask for another one and just use my fork to eat. The waitress also forgot part of our order and finally brought it out well after we mentioned it by the time we were almost ready to go. We also had to ask for the check 3 times and then waited a very long time afterwards before we actually got it. Now for the food. We ordered Syrian rolls, kibbeh, and one mixed grill with lamb kebab, kafta kebab, and mergues. Everything tasted decent except for the kibbeh and the rice in the mixed grill, but I've definitely had much better Mediterranean food at multiple other restaurants. The kibbeh was pretty bland and the rice was somehow made in a way that made me feel like I was eating plastic. We definitely won't be back here again.",3.0

You're greeted by the smell of fresh baked pizza and bread from their brick oven. It's smaller than the original location but it's inviting and cozy. I tried the chicken soup and shepherd salad. This might be the best chicken soup I've ever had. I hope my mom doesn't read this!! Lol,5.0
