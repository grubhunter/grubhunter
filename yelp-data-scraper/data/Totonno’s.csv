"I went with a bunch of friends today and while I don't agree with Food Networks ""Best Pizza"" claim, the pizza is very good though.  The pizza is thin but has a really thick chewy crust, so ignore the reviews that state this is a ""thin"" crust pizza.  The pizza is perfectly cooked and has fresh ingredients.  A large pie is $20 some odd dollars but toppings are $2.50 each.  They don't have any crazy toppings list, just simple garlic, sausage, pepperoni, onions peppers, and my favorite anchovies.  We got 4 pies: peppers and onions, mushrooms and garlic, mushrooms and pepperoni, and anchovies.  This type of pizza is the type you need to eat straight away because the next day the soft/chewy/crisp crust turns rock hard.The place is a bit of a dive, only cash, no other food other than pizza.  For me it's an hour drive to get there from Pelham Bay.  Overall very good pizza and reasonable at $20+ since many other pies start at $25+, but pizza in my hood Morris Park/Pelham Bay of the Bronx is just as good if not better (Patricia's Morris Park, Louie and Ernie's, Crosby Pizza Shop).  On the the other hand L&B Spumoni Gardens still the best Sicilian pie on the face of this earth near by.",4.0
"Really good pizza, super thin, you will leave wanting to eat again I can't really complain about it but I also don't see all the hype. this pizza is on par with the old (Keyword OLD) Grimaldi's and New Park Pizza in Howard Beach Queens. Divy, cash only, expensive pies ($20.50 for a large) It's not a bad place, I just find it to be nothing special. come for the atmosphere and to say you ate at the #1 Pizza place in America voted by Food Network.",4.0
"Don't even talk to me about Pizza let alone New York pizza if you never been to Totonnos in Coney Island. If you haven't made the trip you're not committed to pizza and you can gfy at a papa johns take out windowNothing else really compares. This should be the standard for a NY style pizza(btw it's pies only). Sorry Dominic of Di Fara -you're good but youre a different animal altogetherBe prepared to wait and don't piss off the waitress, Cookie, she owns the joint with the man flippin dough behind the counter",5.0
"Located on Neptune Avenue, Totonno's is surrounded by car repair businesses on almost all sides.  I was informed of its long history and its comparable ranking to Grimaldi's(of the past).   According to Yelp, it is only open a few days out of the week(Thursdays to Sundays).  I am not exactly sure what the reasoning is as it has the potential to eclipse all others.The margherita pie I had was the best one I've ever tasted.  There is definitely room for improvement though; the bottom of the pie was semi-burnt.   A light char is acceptable & desirable as long as my initial taste isn't that of black chalkiness.  Another oddity I noticed was the lack of basil leaves which always adds that extra freshness in a margherita pie.The interior is very simple with a few tables for seating and a direct view of the oven and packing area.  Don't expect a warm reception as I found everyone to be rather indifferent.  With one person covering tables, an older gentleman manning the oven, and two ladies taking orders & packing the pizzas, it seems to run on very few necessities.  My order took a little over 30 minutes to complete on an early weeknight.The caveat for such a place with a long family history and great tasting pizza?  The pricing.  A large pizza is really the size of a Pizza Hut pie.  It is rather small, and two people could easily finish it and possibly have room for more.  I'm not sure what their small looks like, but I am afraid to ask.  The pricing for a large Margherita pie with no toppings was $22.32(taxes included)- yikes.  Perhaps the reason for being open only a few days of the week?  They can afford it.",3.0
If you think you know pizza and haven't been to the legendary Totonno's then you don't know pizza. Totonno's has been serving pizza in the Coney Island side of Brooklyn since the 1920's. Talk about longevity! They make a mean pizza pie. True Italian American pizza at its best. They can be busy at times but it's worth the wait. Don't get pissy with the women in the back because of the wait. Her name is Cookie and she's the owner of this amazing pizza sanctuary. It's been in her family and she takes her pizza serious! I highly recommend Totonno's pizza for a true NY pizza experience.,5.0

"We drove to Totonno's Pizzeria on Saturday, found parking right out front, and grabbed the last open table. Then the magic started! We ordered a large 50% garlic and 50% cheese. The crust tasted like a good Italian loaf of bread. The pizza was able to be firm and not limp, and was cooked perfectly. The pizza was not oily and tasted great. I think the pizza is in my top 3 for NYC. I will gladly come back. Personally, I like more tomato sauce on my pizza, but that is my personal preference. Take nothing away from a true master.I looked around the room and there was a good mix of people from all races and walks of life. One of the wonderful aspects of living in NYC and of course America.",5.0
"Ordered: Small regular pizza piePros--The tomato sauce was incredible--it had the perfect level of sweetness. The pie had a great crispiness to it with a slight doughiness. One of the best pizzas I've ever had!Cons--The waitress didn't give off a friendly vibe. Although the place was technically sit-down with waiter service, we had to ask for the check at least 3 times before it was finally brought.",4.0
The accolades that this place has received are well placed.  I am truly impressed with what this place dishes out.  I would go so far as to state that it is the best pizza in NYC.  The menu is simple- pizza.  That's what your here for and that's what they offer.  Two sizes with a limited selection of fresh toppings.  The master puts your pizza together and bakes it right in front of you.  The taste is out-of-the-world.  Every aspect of the pie is done perfectly - the sauce is just right (not too sweet!).  The crust is crispy and slightly charred.  The cheese is fresh and delicious.  At some point I intend to perform a pie-to-pie test between Difara and Totonno's -- but for the time being I am considering this place the best there is.  On my visit I did notice something interesting- the place was full to capacity but it was dead quiet.  Everyone was busy enjoying their pizza- amazing!  It's THAT good.,5.0
Ahhh Totonnos an old school Brooklyn pizza joint no frills just here for pizza. One of my favorite pizza places to go for a pie. Me and my gf came on a Friday afternoon in the winter. Best time to go because we walked right in no lines. Sat down and told cookie we wanted a large plain pie. It came out in 13 minutes pipping hot and crispy. The sauce and cheese is an even mixture and the crust is amazing. A perfect pie if I don't say so myself though next time I drop by I will tell them to add some extra sauce on it to make it even more tasty. My only gripe is the price of the pie but if you consider Difara at 5 dollars a slice thus is a steal.,5.0
"If you look up 'best pizza in BK"", this place often pops up. It also gets compared to DiFara's pizza often. I came here around 6pm on a Sunday and expected a line. No line at all! Only 2-3 tables were occupied. +1 already over DiFara's.I love thin crust pizzas - this was definitely the best crust I've had. Very crisp, not soggy at all and I got pizza with toppings. Some of the crust was a tad burnt, but otherwise, perfect crust.The actual pizza was a little lacking in flavor. Waiting a couple minutes after they bring you the pizza (fresh from the oven) will allow the flavor to come out more, but who wants to wait!? Addition of sausage, mushroom or green peppers/onion helped the flavor but I was still a bit disappointed (probably 3/5 for flavor alone).Final verdict: Amazing crust.

"Coming off the Mermaid Parade, we headed straight for this place. We were ready for the ""horrible service"" everyone mentioned, and also anticipating the great pizza. The line was almost an hour, but that is a given for any famous NYC restaurant on weekends. So no gripes there.We ordered a half red and half white, with sausage on the white since it had garlic. (we imagined it'd be like the Pepe's Garlic White pizza in New Haven/Yonkers) However, ours white half came soaked in oil but no garlic, and was just too much with the sausage. After making it known to the server (who was actually pretty nice, thankfully), she went to double check--twice--with the pizza maker. The explanation was that the garlic has been included, but all the complicated words suggests that it's very fine so that is not easily visible. Even if it were finely ground garlic powder, I think we would taste it. There's just none. Eventually a female owner-looking person came out, again saying something about it already included and very finely chopped, etc (still not acknowledging that it's just not there), and gave us some minced garlic in the cup (that's certainly not so fine as to be invisible), asking us almost impatiently to add ourselves. To her credit, I think she's trying to be nice about it, probably fighting the very negative reviews on service. Yet spreading raw garlic on the pizza after it's cooked is just not the same.Stuff happen. We understand. However, just owe up to it. As it is, it's a $30 pie (with two bottled soft drinks) that's a bit underwhelming, and half of that was a mistake not quite made right. The pie is very thin, so get the large one, as it's going to be pretty easy to finish. It also came out piping hot, which was a plus. We liked the margherita half--though not extraordinary, was good enough--and will probably just get that next time and have an update. Yet it's definitely not worth waiting in line for, and not quite it's hyped up to be.",3.0
"BF took me here recently after visiting Coney Island.  There was a line, but it was nice to have the time to settle my stomach after riding the cyclone.  We came about 45 minutes before closing time.  I don't recommend anyone who comes later than that because they shortly told the people behind us that they would be the last customer they serve before closing.  The restaurant is no frills, but charming in an old school kind of way.  From the $5 Chianti in a twist-off bottle and serve in a plastic cup to their famous thin-crusted pizza, this family joint has the perfect no BS, what-joo-see-is-what-joo-get style down to a tee.  Lights started to get turned off right at closing time, and we paid in cash and left happily stuffed.  My advise for anyone who wants to come check out their amazing pizza,1.  Come early. Be prepared to wait in line2.  Have no expectation from the service3.  Bring an empty stomach",4.0
"Very disappointed, I had the small pie with toppings. They were cheap on the cheese and toppings.  The cheese was inconsistently applied throughout the pie, some slices had ""a lot"" of cheese and some had very little.  The crust was very good.  Other than the crust, the rest of the bottom of the pizza was quite soft, couldn't hold the slice up without extra support.Toppings are $2.50Small pie $16.50Large pie $19.50Cash onlyCoke 8oz $2The restaurant was nicely decorated with many pictures and photos.The tables were not organized so well on the right side.  They were placed in a baseball diamond shape fashion, so it was 1st base and the table next to you was 3rd base, they have this chair for clothes which gave the person sitting close to the home plate corner not so much room.The service was ok, the lady appeared to be quite cranky.  I couldn't ask a question without being comfortable.",2.0
"I'm giving two stars because everytime I have gone here, attempted to go here, called a phone order in, slept out front to wait for a pie ( just kidding I didn't really do that) there has been some sort of issue. Let me explain..The last and most likely final attempt at ordering a plain large cheese pie from here I almost had a meltdown trying to speak to the older woman that has been here since the 20's. I walked in here at 4pm on super bowl Sunday and the place was dead.. DEAD. Employees were picking their fingernails at the cash register it was so dead. I asked what the wait time is..woman behind the counter said less then 10 minutes . Okay no problem, I had to run to stop and shop which is literally so close you could throw a baseball and probably hit it with a good arm. I figured let me go quick and pick up chips and dip and I will call in and then go pick up the ONE CHEESE PIE I wanted. 20 minutes later I was done and called to call in my order which old woman told me was an excellent idea to do 20 minutes prior and she told me the wait was now 1 hour and 45 minutes. I actually thought she was kidding and laughed in the phone. People, she was serious. I said you realize I was just in there 20 minutes ago right ? She said I know who you are and we just got a lot of orders. I almost lost it. Obviously didn't wait two hours. I mean insanity much? 2 hours for a cheese pie? I think not. The other times I've tried eating here it's just frustrating.. They are only open 2 days a week, for 30 minutes from 12-1 and then close for 4 hours and then open till 5 and close at 7.. I'm over exaggerating but their hours are the most ridiculous hours ever. Tottonnos you are WAY over rated ... Sorry I'm not sorry.",2.0
"The Pizza at Totonno's is definitely in the top 5 in the city. Crisp flavorful thin crust pizza, great sauce, perfect amount of cheese and toppings.  Win, win, win.  The one waitress is SO surly, so unpleasant, and the wait for a pie can be endless even when there are empty tables.  The hike from the subway is significant if you've got little ones.  If you are a group larger than 4 and happen to hit it wrong, your wait could be interminable.Overall, the food merits the visit. The service does not.  If you are looking for a great pie, Totonno's will not disappoint. We will always return when we are in Coney Island.",4.0

And this location had one important uniqueness: the pizza ;)The place looks the same as it did in the past, and that's part of the experience of eating here. I had the pepperoni, delicious. My friend had the margarita, good.I respect places like this one, and I can say that I did not get disappointed. Much better than di fara, almost as good as Roberts. If you are in coney, try it!",4.0
"Coming off the Mermaid Parade, we headed straight for this place. We were ready for the ""horrible service"" everyone mentioned, and also anticipating the great pizza. The line was almost an hour, but that is a given for any famous NYC restaurant on weekends. So no gripes there.We ordered a half red and half white, with sausage on the white since it had garlic. (we imagined it'd be like the Pepe's Garlic White pizza in New Haven/Yonkers) However, ours white half came soaked in oil but no garlic, and was just too much with the sausage. After making it known to the server (who was actually pretty nice, thankfully), she went to double check--twice--with the pizza maker. The explanation was that the garlic has been included, but all the complicated words suggests that it's very fine so that is not easily visible. Even if it were finely ground garlic powder, I think we would taste it. There's just none. Eventually a female owner-looking person came out, again saying something about it already included and very finely chopped, etc (still not acknowledging that it's just not there), and gave us some minced garlic in the cup (that's certainly not so fine as to be invisible), asking us almost impatiently to add ourselves. To her credit, I think she's trying to be nice about it, probably fighting the very negative reviews on service. Yet spreading raw garlic on the pizza after it's cooked is just not the same.Stuff happen. We understand. However, just owe up to it. As it is, it's a $30 pie (with two bottled soft drinks) that's a bit underwhelming, and half of that was a mistake not quite made right. The pie is very thin, so get the large one, as it's going to be pretty easy to finish. It also came out piping hot, which was a plus. We liked the margherita half--though not extraordinary, was good enough--and will probably just get that next time and have an update. Yet it's definitely not worth waiting in line for, and not quite it's hyped up to be.",3.0
"BF took me here recently after visiting Coney Island.  There was a line, but it was nice to have the time to settle my stomach after riding the cyclone.  We came about 45 minutes before closing time.  I don't recommend anyone who comes later than that because they shortly told the people behind us that they would be the last customer they serve before closing.  The restaurant is no frills, but charming in an old school kind of way.  From the $5 Chianti in a twist-off bottle and serve in a plastic cup to their famous thin-crusted pizza, this family joint has the perfect no BS, what-joo-see-is-what-joo-get style down to a tee.  Lights started to get turned off right at closing time, and we paid in cash and left happily stuffed.  My advise for anyone who wants to come check out their amazing pizza,1.  Come early. Be prepared to wait in line2.  Have no expectation from the service3.  Bring an empty stomach",4.0
"Very disappointed, I had the small pie with toppings. They were cheap on the cheese and toppings.  The cheese was inconsistently applied throughout the pie, some slices had ""a lot"" of cheese and some had very little.  The crust was very good.  Other than the crust, the rest of the bottom of the pizza was quite soft, couldn't hold the slice up without extra support.Toppings are $2.50Small pie $16.50Large pie $19.50Cash onlyCoke 8oz $2The restaurant was nicely decorated with many pictures and photos.The tables were not organized so well on the right side.  They were placed in a baseball diamond shape fashion, so it was 1st base and the table next to you was 3rd base, they have this chair for clothes which gave the person sitting close to the home plate corner not so much room.The service was ok, the lady appeared to be quite cranky.  I couldn't ask a question without being comfortable.",2.0
"I'm giving two stars because everytime I have gone here, attempted to go here, called a phone order in, slept out front to wait for a pie ( just kidding I didn't really do that) there has been some sort of issue. Let me explain..The last and most likely final attempt at ordering a plain large cheese pie from here I almost had a meltdown trying to speak to the older woman that has been here since the 20's. I walked in here at 4pm on super bowl Sunday and the place was dead.. DEAD. Employees were picking their fingernails at the cash register it was so dead. I asked what the wait time is..woman behind the counter said less then 10 minutes . Okay no problem, I had to run to stop and shop which is literally so close you could throw a baseball and probably hit it with a good arm. I figured let me go quick and pick up chips and dip and I will call in and then go pick up the ONE CHEESE PIE I wanted. 20 minutes later I was done and called to call in my order which old woman told me was an excellent idea to do 20 minutes prior and she told me the wait was now 1 hour and 45 minutes. I actually thought she was kidding and laughed in the phone. People, she was serious. I said you realize I was just in there 20 minutes ago right ? She said I know who you are and we just got a lot of orders. I almost lost it. Obviously didn't wait two hours. I mean insanity much? 2 hours for a cheese pie? I think not. The other times I've tried eating here it's just frustrating.. They are only open 2 days a week, for 30 minutes from 12-1 and then close for 4 hours and then open till 5 and close at 7.. I'm over exaggerating but their hours are the most ridiculous hours ever. Tottonnos you are WAY over rated ... Sorry I'm not sorry.",2.0
"The Pizza at Totonno's is definitely in the top 5 in the city. Crisp flavorful thin crust pizza, great sauce, perfect amount of cheese and toppings.  Win, win, win.  The one waitress is SO surly, so unpleasant, and the wait for a pie can be endless even when there are empty tables.  The hike from the subway is significant if you've got little ones.  If you are a group larger than 4 and happen to hit it wrong, your wait could be interminable.Overall, the food merits the visit. The service does not.  If you are looking for a great pie, Totonno's will not disappoint. We will always return when we are in Coney Island.",4.0
"Excellent pizza -- but only pizza -- in a real old fashioned place.  The pizza is good -- thin crust, coal fired.  They use only fresh ingredients, including fresh mozzarella, on the pies, which is fantastic.  The pies are thin; we went through 2 for 4 people and weren't too full afterwards.  Though they are listed on the menu board, they also have white pizza and margarita, which I would have ordered if I had known.  There are maybe 10 tables and if they are all taken the line forms outside -- no waiting inside -- so keep that in mind if it is cold or raining. But, if you are looking for an old fashioned, authentic NY pizza place, this is it. Two pies, 3 beers, 2 sodas and 2 Snapples came to $100. cash (cash only).  I will definitely be back.",4.0

Very old traditional pizza with a fantastic crust. The accolades make sense as this pizza is one of the best examples of why NYC is pizza heaven.

"Totonno's is Brooklyn Pizza. Their pies are classic, and their recipe carries you straight to a cozy little Italian-American pizza kitchen in the 1930's.Their pizza is neat, crispy and savory. Their sauce is the driest there is, practically just minced tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil and sweet garlic but it's incredibly flavorful. Their crust is crispy and peppery, and you can taste their classic coal oven with every bite. Their mozzarella, made in-house, is perhaps the best I've ever had on a pizza. It's pearl-white and fluffy. The entire package is amazing, and this is why Totonno's makes the best pie in New York, hands down. Don't get complicated here. I go with either their Margherita or their mushroom-pepperoni pie. The restaurant itself is old-school Coney Island, and your served with paper plates and styrofoam cups. The air smells like NYC summer, you can smell the ocean and the charcoal oven. The decor is authentic pizza joint, and the people that work at the restaurant are real-deal New Yorkers. I love it. Totonno's is how a pizza joint is supposed to look and feel. In the summer it's always super crowded, forget about parking, and make sure you have your order ready because the staff gets frantic. They have fairly spacious booths and tables if you want to sit down, but prepared to wait a few hours. Anyway, this place is awesome. I highly recommend it if you're anywhere close.",5.0
"This might be my favorite pizza in New York City.  I don't mind traveling an hour by train to get a pie once or twice a year. The crust and sauce are just worlds above other places, let the tourists truck out to Midwood to wait on line for hours, I'll take Totonno's any day.As a second generation, 100% Italian, this is what it's supposed to be, and if you're coming to the ""source"" you need to be prepared to open your mind.  This place has been since 1924 and generations have been following tradition to a science to keep the quality of these pies up to their standards.  That's the priority here, not killing you with kindness to cover up for frozen french fries, or pre-making the pies to fit more customers in the door. You're going to have to wait, because the pizzas are each made-to-order, and that's why they are so delicious.  Using quality ingredients and not skimping might cost a little more, but in NYC Totonno's prices are pretty standard for a top-notch pizza.  You're not going to see Papa John prices here.  Anyone who complains about the quality of this pizza has gotten too accustomed to the generic pies that pass for pizza across America.  Since apparently people need to be told what good pizza is in order to know (see lines in Midwood...) THIS is what good pizza is, overlook the inconveniences and enjoy.",5.0
"Service in this place is brusk, brisk, or just overly not super welcoming.. When asked what kind of pizza we could order, the lady looked at me and said large or small.. With a little more pressing we were told that meatball, sausage, onion, pepper, garlic and extra cheese were some of the options as well.. Large pies were 18 bucks.. We got two glasses of red for 4.95 each. We went with a plain pie: The sauce is San Marzano I believe.. Its a simple fresh sauce that is fantastic..  The crust is very much of the Neopolitan Style.. Crispy with a really nice chew..  The cheese is a really creamy mozzarella and there is also some hard cheese sprinkled on.. I really like how the hard cheese melts and crisps along the edge of the crust.. The slice itself is really easy to manage.. You can fold a slice fresh out of the oven and not have the contents pour out in a molten state.. The cheese stays put and doesn't all come off with the first bite..  You see how that cheese is really melted on the actual dough.. It really keeps every bite perfect..  Cooked in a charcoal oven this is among the best ""Plain"" pizza's I have had.. With this quality of pizza, its really personal preference as to what's the best pizza in NY.. This just might be my pick..",5.0
"After seeing the Food Network special, I knew I had to come in on my weekend trip. This place literally makes nothing but pizza and they're only open four days a week. So I ordered a 14 incher with half cheese and half sausage and mushroom. It had a great charred crust and fresh mozzarella cheese that you just don't get on most pizzas. The sauce was very zesty, it was quite good. The disappointment was the bottom of each slice, where it was soggy in the middle. Maybe it was from the olive oil, but to me, a good crust needs to be crispy all the way through. Also, the quality of the sausage was just so-so, it didn't have as much seasoning as I'd like Italian sausage to have. And a small pie plus a drink cost me around $27.00, not exactly cheap. While it's certainly a good pizza, it doesn't deserve the title as the best in New York, let alone the country.",3.0

"Totonno's is Brooklyn Pizza. Their pies are classic, and their recipe carries you straight to a cozy little Italian-American pizza kitchen in the 1930's.Their pizza is neat, crispy and savory. Their sauce is the driest there is, practically just minced tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil and sweet garlic but it's incredibly flavorful. Their crust is crispy and peppery, and you can taste their classic coal oven with every bite. Their mozzarella, made in-house, is perhaps the best I've ever had on a pizza. It's pearl-white and fluffy. The entire package is amazing, and this is why Totonno's makes the best pie in New York, hands down. Don't get complicated here. I go with either their Margherita or their mushroom-pepperoni pie. The restaurant itself is old-school Coney Island, and your served with paper plates and styrofoam cups. The air smells like NYC summer, you can smell the ocean and the charcoal oven. The decor is authentic pizza joint, and the people that work at the restaurant are real-deal New Yorkers. I love it. Totonno's is how a pizza joint is supposed to look and feel. In the summer it's always super crowded, forget about parking, and make sure you have your order ready because the staff gets frantic. They have fairly spacious booths and tables if you want to sit down, but prepared to wait a few hours. Anyway, this place is awesome. I highly recommend it if you're anywhere close.",5.0
"This might be my favorite pizza in New York City.  I don't mind traveling an hour by train to get a pie once or twice a year. The crust and sauce are just worlds above other places, let the tourists truck out to Midwood to wait on line for hours, I'll take Totonno's any day.As a second generation, 100% Italian, this is what it's supposed to be, and if you're coming to the ""source"" you need to be prepared to open your mind.  This place has been since 1924 and generations have been following tradition to a science to keep the quality of these pies up to their standards.  That's the priority here, not killing you with kindness to cover up for frozen french fries, or pre-making the pies to fit more customers in the door. You're going to have to wait, because the pizzas are each made-to-order, and that's why they are so delicious.  Using quality ingredients and not skimping might cost a little more, but in NYC Totonno's prices are pretty standard for a top-notch pizza.  You're not going to see Papa John prices here.  Anyone who complains about the quality of this pizza has gotten too accustomed to the generic pies that pass for pizza across America.  Since apparently people need to be told what good pizza is in order to know (see lines in Midwood...) THIS is what good pizza is, overlook the inconveniences and enjoy.",5.0
"Service in this place is brusk, brisk, or just overly not super welcoming.. When asked what kind of pizza we could order, the lady looked at me and said large or small.. With a little more pressing we were told that meatball, sausage, onion, pepper, garlic and extra cheese were some of the options as well.. Large pies were 18 bucks.. We got two glasses of red for 4.95 each. We went with a plain pie: The sauce is San Marzano I believe.. Its a simple fresh sauce that is fantastic..  The crust is very much of the Neopolitan Style.. Crispy with a really nice chew..  The cheese is a really creamy mozzarella and there is also some hard cheese sprinkled on.. I really like how the hard cheese melts and crisps along the edge of the crust.. The slice itself is really easy to manage.. You can fold a slice fresh out of the oven and not have the contents pour out in a molten state.. The cheese stays put and doesn't all come off with the first bite..  You see how that cheese is really melted on the actual dough.. It really keeps every bite perfect..  Cooked in a charcoal oven this is among the best ""Plain"" pizza's I have had.. With this quality of pizza, its really personal preference as to what's the best pizza in NY.. This just might be my pick..",5.0
"After seeing the Food Network special, I knew I had to come in on my weekend trip. This place literally makes nothing but pizza and they're only open four days a week. So I ordered a 14 incher with half cheese and half sausage and mushroom. It had a great charred crust and fresh mozzarella cheese that you just don't get on most pizzas. The sauce was very zesty, it was quite good. The disappointment was the bottom of each slice, where it was soggy in the middle. Maybe it was from the olive oil, but to me, a good crust needs to be crispy all the way through. Also, the quality of the sausage was just so-so, it didn't have as much seasoning as I'd like Italian sausage to have. And a small pie plus a drink cost me around $27.00, not exactly cheap. While it's certainly a good pizza, it doesn't deserve the title as the best in New York, let alone the country.",3.0
"The pizza here is great and the service was great! Unfortunately if you're a pineapple fan or a fan of special toppings like that, they don't have those types of pizza's here, but the pizzas that they do have are rather delicious and very cheesy! They also offer snapple, juices, and beers!",4.0
"The pizza is good enough but I've officially given up on this place. Besides only being open a few days a week, half the time they close before 8pm. What kind of restaurant has a closing time of 8pm to begin with but cares so little about customers that they close early?Today was the last straw. We showed up at 7:30pm to a packed place with luckily one table available and sit down. The waitress comes over to yell at us for coming so late.  I'm going to say that again. We came 1/2 hour before close and were yelled at in front of other tables trying to enjoy their meals. Please guys, give your money to a restaurant that wants it and let these guys burn in hell.",1.0
"Fresh and homemade ingredients. I think that they even make their own mozzarella here. Walking into this place is its own experience.

"Pizza was great: excellent Neapolitan style and awesome crust. However, the service was lacking. We had to wait outside for 20 minutes for a table at 3pm (because someone had reserved tables inside, even though the place doesn't take reservations), only to find out that we couldn't order a small pie, because they only had large pies available (??).Also, all paper plates/cups is just lazy, given the prices.",3.0
"I am writing this updated review after I saw the Food Network show ""Top Five Pizza Places in the US"" last week. I was shocked, horrified and disgusted to see that Totonno's got the #1 pizza place in the US from FN and its two reviewers Geoff Zakarian and Sunny whoever from that BBQ show on FN (like she knows the diff between a real NY pie and burnt DiGiorno's).  First of all, if you peruse my review of Totonno's from last year, you will see that it finished last in my ""Great Bklyn Pizza Extravaganza"". It was rated last by each one of my five expert reviewers - and myself. The pizza was bland, with a tasteless crust, and got cold very quickly. To think that THIS barely avg pie is the #1 pie in the USA just makes me want to either heave, or just LOL... I  can't decide.What's maybe worse, is that Food Network should be ashamed of themselves for putting this joint in the #1 spot and having one of their top chefs Geoff Zakarian host the show. I have high respect for Geoff but I am confident that he did not participate in the evaluation of however many pizza joints FN sampled before they made their final ratings. In fact, I would bet that Geoff Z did not even EAT a Totonno's slice and just  read the script that they wrote for him when they made the show.I can (maybe) forgive FN for including one of those dogshit Chicago pies that looks more like a lasagna than a pizza in their top 5, and can certainly forgive them for having Frank Pepe from New Haven as #2 and Neapolitano from SF as #3, but having Totonno's as the #1 pie in the USA is a pizza transgression that is so egregious that it words escape me.",3.0
"*4.5 starsEvery year my friend Anton holds a pizza crawl right before summer finally bows its head down and departs. The other places he picked this year, I had already been to: Spumoni, Toby's Public House. But I had been deprived of checking out the infamous Totonno's for years. Perhaps because when he initially started this pizza crawl idea he was unemployed and I was still trapped in my job dreaming of all the pizzas. Totonno's is special though because to me it seems so intimate and family-knit. Held together through perseverance and Sandy even since 1924, though, they did have to do some heavy-duty rebuilding. What makes them also stand out is that they use an old coal fired brick oven. Yeah, yeah, you are shaking your head now saying so many deuchey pizza places have coal-fired ovens now that its passe. But what is different about this place is that the original ones (only a handful in New York are still allowed) don't pass the environmental laws and if they were installed since its foundation there is some kind of lien allowed. The walls are decorated with old newspaper clippings. Simple table tops with paper plates and plastic silver-ware and cups. The pizza? Super crisp crust. Amazing sauce. Probably one of the best marinara sauces that I've ever had on a pizza. The mozzarella is oozey and pulled apart. We didn't go for any toppings. We kept things simple. Except for asking for half of it to be liberally decorated with fresh garlic. The wait is also quite awhile and I think they are closed on certain days. But if you ask me if I'd rather sit outside and wait for an angry man to make my pizza for 2 hours at DiFara's or wait in a never ending line at Grimaldi's, I would pick this place instead to check out. It's simple, no fuss and the people are even pretty awesome here. I pulled out my camera to try and slyly take photos of all of the pizza for Yelp and one of the workers enthusiastically asked if she wanted me to have her take our picture with their Za. Ha.

"This place is simply too hyped up.I ordered a sausage pizza - they didn't have sausage.Then I ordered a pepperoni pizza and they didn't have pepperoni.I ordered a mushroom pizza - no mushrooms.Okay a regular pie.I brought the regular pie home and no one thought it was great - just a regular pizza. Not worth the trip, the money or the hype.",1.0
"I came here with 3 other friends on a Saturday night (shortly before 6pm) and we didn't have to wait for a table. Yes, the hostess is brusque but I suspect she just plays it up for newcomers since she seemed to tone it down as the night went on. We ordered a regular pie and a mushroom/sausage pie. The pie was paper thin which would have been amazing if it didn't turn soggy in 5 minutes due to the heavy handed, flavorless sauce on top. The upsides were the fresh cheese and the crust that seemed to have hints of dry-baked cheese all over it. Unless you are also planning to spend some time at the rides in Coney Island, I don't recommend you trek it all the way down here, especially not with weekend train service at its worst. I'm glad that they are up and running after Sandy, and I wish them all the best but I won't be a regular here.",2.0
Pizza is delicious. Thin crust with both aged and a little of fresh mozzarella. Could use some fresh basil though and the service could be a tad better. This is a mom and pop joint and it's a true New Yorker/Brooklyn experience. The lady serving you has been there for DECADES! I could eat a whole pie by myself. I'm not gonna lie - the pizza is really good. You cannot buy by the slice. It's whole only.,4.0
"We came up with a ton of potential headlines for this Yelp review:""Pizza so good, you'll ignore the service.""""Come for the pizza, stay for the bathroom water.""""Maybe they can hear us talking shit about them.""So, after a ton of hype, we made the trip out to Totonno's, which is no small feat. It's at the end of the subway line and then some. Basically the middle of nowhere. Makes sense that they're only open 4 days a week.Don't get me wrong, the pizza was good (more on that later). But the reason we were able to brainstorm so many headlines was because the service was atrocious.I can ignore the fact that when we walked in, the older waitress didn't say a word to us and just pointed us to an open booth (after all, we thought we were lucky to even get a table with no wait).I can ignore the fact that the younger waitress took about 5 minutes to pass out cups, napkins and silverware. And when we asked for tap water, she directed us to the bathroom and said ""there's a sink over there"" (to be fair, the toilet and sink were in different rooms. But hey, at least fill the water for us to create the illusion that the water we're drinking didn't literally come from the same place customers wash their hands).That's two strikes that I can ignore. Here's what I can't ignore: we ordered a large plain pizza at around 12:35. We watched tables turn over, and new parties get seated. We watched those tables get their pizzas before us. We asked the younger server about our pizza half an hour later and she says it's coming. We ordered ANOTHER pizza (with sausage and mushrooms) just in case the kitchen's backed up. But nope, 20 minutes later, we get the SECOND pizza first, with no sign of the first that (at this point), we had ordered almost an hour ago.The sausage/mushroom pizza was probably the weakest of the three that we eventually ordered. The sausage didn't really add much except texture, and mushrooms must have been scarce because each slice had maybe 0-1 mushroom pieces per.So after we finished what was supposed to be our second pie, our first pie arrived. Now I'll admit, the plain was pretty damn good. Not too oily. Crispy crust that wasn't too thick. Good sauce and they didn't skimp on the cheese. Best slice I've ever had? Probably not. I don't even think it was the best slice I've had this month (you can thank Vinnie's on Bedford for that).Anyway, at this point, it had taken over an hour to get two pizzas, so we ordered a third. This one was peppers and onions. Better than the sausage/mushroom, but not as good as the plain somehow.So anyway, I don't want to be overly harsh because it was definitely an interesting experience (I'd probably be a lot more angry if I wasn't in good company). Some positive points about the restaurant:1) They serve beer, and not complete bottom-barrel crap. You can get a Peroni or a Brooklyn brew.2) The decor has tons of reading material (basically copies of all their accolades and newspaper write-ups from the past 50 years). You'll probably find yourself reading an article or 10 because the service is so slow.3) Pizzas come to your table hot, hot hot.4) We came on a Sunday afternoon and there wasn't a wait (it was also World Cup Sunday and it was supposed to rain, so your mileage may vary). There were several periods that there were empty tables all throughout the place. It supposedly seats 44, according to an article we read on the wall.5) When we left, we said thanks/goodbye to three people. One of them said bye back, so 33% success rate there for customer service.So should you go to Totonno's? If you're in the area, sure. If you want the best pizza in Brooklyn, probably not. But in case you swing by, let's set some ground rules:1) Expect authentic old school pizzeria pizza. None of those artisan ingredients or fancy crap.2) Don't come here if you have somewhere to be. Even without a wait for the tables, we spent over 2 hours here.3) Sink is outside the toilet. That's also where you drink from.",3.0

"Totonno's is one of the titans of NYC pizza, in business for nearing a century and still family-owned and run.  It continues to be worthy of its reputation and for pizza connoisseurs, a required trek to this southern end of Brooklyn.  Despite being close to bustling Coney Island, its on a stretch of Neptune Avenue that remains quiet and low-key.  The pizzeria space is small, casual, and unapologetically old-fashioned, and everyone who loves the place no doubt prefers it to stay just that way, including me.  Its walls are a montage of photos and press, old and new.The only thing to have at Totonno's is pizza.  The only decisions to make are size (the standard 8-slice large or 14"" 6-slice small) and toppings (the classics, go elsewhere for artisanal or creative).  Beers, wines, and sodas to go with the pizza, including a nice selection of Brooklyn Brewery beers.Totonno's makes their pizza in a coal-fired oven.  It comes out piping hot, beautiful to behold.  The pizza crust is sublime, as thin as possible with a beguiling crispiness and bit of chew.  Its edges are thick, charred, and uneven, with a lovely flavor, and the perfect end to a slice. Toppings are spare, just right.  Personally, I don't need anything on their perfect plain pie, but when I've had it, they use good quality ingredients.I've visited Totonno's now and then over the years, and consider them one of the best pizzas makers of NYC-style pizza, and consistently good.  I'm pleased to find them post-Hurricane Sandy back on their game.  Go early to avoid the lines and bring cash.",5.0
"Euuuughhhhhh....So, I came here with high hopes and two friends. We entered and sat ourselves cause no one seated us. One waitress (a younger one) was sweet and /seemed/ to mean well. We got paper plates and cups... interesting. We weren't gonna hate on this place for not wanting to wash dishes, but that was a first. When she took our orders we asked for water. She brought us 3 Snapple water bottles and we realized if we opened them, we'd be charged for them. Nobody is giving away Snapple water. Just beware: if you want free water, you have to specify. I mean, I've never asked for water at a restaurant and gotten bottled water. My friends called this their ""water scam.""We tried to get her attention to get her to take back the water bottles and bring us actual free water. An interaction with my friend went like this:My friend: Hi, could we please get water in our cups?Waitress: There's a sink over there *gestures to the back, towards the kitchen and leaves the restaurant for her break or something*My friend: *confused*All of us: *confused*We try again.My friend: Hi, so, uh. To get water, do we just go to the sink and get it ourselves?Waitress #2: *laughing to herself* If you want.All of us: *confused again*My friends were thirsty (me not so much, I'd just had a bottle of water on the way, but it was really hot out on this August day). So, they get up and /serve themselves/ to water. They came back looking pretty grossed out and disturbed. They later told me the sink was ""not somewhere you'd want to get water from."" I'll take their word for it.Anyway, we get the pizza. Hungry and excited, we begin to eat and yeah wow, what a disappointment. It wasn't AWFUL, but we have all had so much better. If you are a yelper, you have totally most likely had better. We got a plain pizza because that's just how you roll when you're getting coal oven NYC pizza - but if you decide to come here, I rec you guys to get toppings. I never say that, but this pizza needs it. Let's break it down.This place made me realize coal oven does not always = good pizza. I wasn't a fan of Grimaldi's at ALL (nor my friends) but in a weird way, I could kind of fathom why people could love it. But this, I can't really. It's $17.50 for an 8 slice 14 inch pie, $20 for an 8 slice 16 inch pie, and we'd have been happy to pay this if the pizza had been up to par. However:1. The crust. Coal oven pizzerias I've been to usually have notoriously thin crust. Some love it, some hate it. Totonno's crust has a bit of a chew though, which was unexpected, but fine, I'll take it for what it is. A bit too much char and chew for me (definitely too much char on the crust!) to be really enjoyable.2. The sauce. The sauce was interesting to me, because it toes the line between sweet and savory. It doesn't commit to being either. With every bite, I kept trying to keep figuring it out. I liked it, though it could've used seasoning. 3. The cheese! The biggest problem. If you're someone who loves the pizza for the cheese, no. It was bland. What a tragedy. The cheese was a somewhat rubbery texture, drier mozarella which I could've forgiven - I've had that texture on grandma slices in the past and loved it because it had flavor. But the taste was lacking.All in all, a disappointing slice. We all wanted to douse our slices in parm to just give it some flavor. That's a bad sign ya'll and you're better off going to so many other pizza places.My friends had a blast poking fun at the Food Network's ""Best pizza in America"" or whatever it was sign. They absolutely roasted it. Anyway, time to pay and my friend and I both need change. We ask an older waitress working there because our original waitress was elsewhere. My friend requested change and then I began to, and she interrupts me and says ""I can't give all that change"" with such brash attitude and left. I suspect it's the same bold and brazen woman doling out unecessary levels of sass to other reviewers who I see also had sucky service. Tl;dr: The pizza: no. not worth it. Bland. They should season more. You're in nyc, there are so many other better places.The service: worse. It's kinda like those self-serve frozen yogurt places but with pizza.The paper plates and cups: priceless just priceless(Edit: Also, wow, Ryan D and I had an eerily similar experience here. Just confirmatory.)",1.0

"Legendary pizzeria in Brooklyn, New York and America!!!!! A descendant of the Lombardi ancestry, Anthony ""Totonno"" Pero, pizza maker at Lombardi's left and started this Coney Island staple in 1924.  Similar coal fired brick oven pizza like Lombardi's but I just like Totonno's so much more.  The dough is lighter, crunchier, nice char, bright and fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz and pecorino romano. That's it!!! Simple quality ingredients that marry perfectly together. No slices, only fresh made to order pizza pies. Small is $16.50 for a 14 inch and Large is $19.50 for a 16 inch. Toppings are additional $2.50. I recommend getting plain or with pepperoni, mushroom or sausage.  Keep the toppings minimal, no more than two.  Respect the pizza. Super laid back and casual vibe.  Cookie is the owner, host and waitress.  She friendly and great to talk to.  She'll be there when you're ordering, then go off to the side to read, watch tv and do her own thing and when you're ready to pay, she'll bring the bill over.  Just an unpretentious local spot.Been coming here for about 7 years and I still love it.  With so many different styles of pizza, it's hard to choose a favorite but this is definitely in my top 10.",5.0

Everything about the pizza individually like the crust, cheese, sauce, and toppings were good, but when combined weren't that impressive. Crust was baked perfectly, cheese pearly and not greasy, sauce a bit bitter, and toppings fresh but not flavorful. I had been talking this place up to my boyfriend for a while now, and I was kind of embarrassed mid meal when it didn't garner any grunts of satisfaction. Food is the only thing I know!

Instead of an overly oily, messy, cheesy slice like I was rudely served at DiFara, I got an extremely satisfying pie here.The menu is bare bones (just small or large pizza with a few choices of toppings, and nothing else), but it's all you need.If you come all the way to Coney Island, don't bother with Nathan's. You can get that in any mall food court. Come here instead for a very unique and very New York experience and most importantly. some really excellent pizza. Just make sure to bring cash and to leave plenty of time.",4.0
Pizza so tasty it's worth the abusive service. 5 stars for the pizza & 2 stars for the service.,5.0
"Legendary pizzeria in Brooklyn, New York and America!!!!! A descendant of the Lombardi ancestry, Anthony ""Totonno"" Pero, pizza maker at Lombardi's left and started this Coney Island staple in 1924.  Similar coal fired brick oven pizza like Lombardi's but I just like Totonno's so much more.  The dough is lighter, crunchier, nice char, bright and fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz and pecorino romano. That's it!!! Simple quality ingredients that marry perfectly together. No slices, only fresh made to order pizza pies. Small is $16.50 for a 14 inch and Large is $19.50 for a 16 inch. Toppings are additional $2.50. I recommend getting plain or with pepperoni, mushroom or sausage.  Keep the toppings minimal, no more than two.  Respect the pizza. Super laid back and casual vibe.  Cookie is the owner, host and waitress.  She friendly and great to talk to.  She'll be there when you're ordering, then go off to the side to read, watch tv and do her own thing and when you're ready to pay, she'll bring the bill over.  Just an unpretentious local spot.Been coming here for about 7 years and I still love it.  With so many different styles of pizza, it's hard to choose a favorite but this is definitely in my top 10.",5.0
"Rude waitress, cash only, limited menu, had to fill up our own water from the tap (!), but the best pizza I've ever had. The pepperoni is perfection.",5.0
"I'm assuming the OTT rudeness is contrived/supposed to be amusing? Barking at people who wander in: ""QUEUE OUTSIDE!"" Making you wait when the tables are empty and then once you're seated: ""WHAT DO YOU WANT!?"" There's no menu, you order from the board by the kitchen. The service is beyond begrudging and the pizza is nothing special at all - sauce is fine, crust okay, with a nice enough coal-fired flavour. But nothing to write home about. Pizza has moved on since this was the gold standard... The five minutes I waited for a table was five minutes too long.",2.0
Not sure what all the hype is about. I live not too far so I decided to give it a try. The pizza is made from scratch right in front of you which is a plus. The downside is the service. The waitress was an older lady who looked miserable. The pizza itself wasn't bad but nothing special.,3.0

"I first went here in 2013, and I was impressed with the sausage and mushroom pie I ordered to go. Revisited recently and was kind of disappointed. Everything about the pizza individually like the crust, cheese, sauce, and toppings were good, but when combined weren't that impressive. Crust was baked perfectly, cheese pearly and not greasy, sauce a bit bitter, and toppings fresh but not flavorful. I had been talking this place up to my boyfriend for a while now, and I was kind of embarrassed mid meal when it didn't garner any grunts of satisfaction. Food is the only thing I know! My reputation for recommendations has been compromised. That isn't to say we didn't consume the entire pie. For $27.50, you eat it.",2.0
"No wait to speak of around 7pm on Memorial Day (even with all the crowds on the beach!) They only had large pies available so we ordered one with sausage, peppers&onions. Incredibly thin crust but somewhat soggy in the middle. Fresh mozzarella on the pie was great but the pizza could've used more sauce. The crust wasn't as flavorful as others. A decent pizza but definitely not one of the best, I'd say.",3.0

"Best pizza in NYC hands down, rather 2 thumbs up!Delicious pizza made in real brick oven. You get what you pay for.

They should hire some new servers, some young, energetic and kind youngsters, the older lady can have an attitude sometimes, and overall she just talks loud, when she sits at a table and talks to friends she sounds like an episode out of mob wives, not everyone wants to hear your business! Also the cheese and some toppings are right out in the open, I respect them for having an open kitchen, but I feel like a costumer can just walk up and sneeze onto everything....yes, I'm a germaphobe!

"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. The pizza itself was decent, and I'm sure I would have given this place three stars had the service itself not soured my experience.This was by far the worst service I've experienced dining out. The waitress demanded we wait outside when we got there (that's fine), but we were standing with a group of people outside who were all confused as to what was going on. People were seated with no discernible order, other than perhaps the waitress liked one group more than the other. That said, my group of four got there before a whole family of 16 got there, yet they were given four empty tables before we could even get seated. Along with this, the waitress demanded we order right away as soon as we were seated. In a rush, we asked her what she would recommend and she gave us a complete look of disrespect and said with a voice of disdain, ""Get a pizza.""My girlfriend wanted to leave right after that, but we had made the trek all the way  out to Coney Island, so I convinced her not to just walk out of the place right then and there. We ordered a pizza and some drinks, my girlfriend asked for water. The waitress threw (THREW) her a plastic cup and pointed in the direction of the restroom. ""Water's there.""Never have I ever dined at a place where the customer was treated so badly. I'd prefer McDonald's, Domino's service to this place. This pizza could have been the best on Earth (it wasn't), but we, the customer, were treated like the scum of the earth.The pizza itself...apparently if you have a mediocre pizza place open for decades, that automatically labels it as good pizza. Having grown up in New York, I really can't say this is the best pizza. It probably wouldn't even rank up in the top 20 places I've had pizza at. It could be entirely possible that I was there on an off-day, or that the service experience definitely made all the food taste bad, but I was not impressed at all.",1.0
"I have seen summer time hour plus long waits going down at this Coney Island locals pizza joint. Go in the winter and you can walk in during prime lunch hours (noon, 1) with as little as a 5 minute wait. Get fresh garlic on your pie - you won't be sorry. The sausage is fennel-y and the 'roni is freshly sliced. The crust isn't chewy but more on the crispy side - making this pie a New York style meets Neapolitan hybrid (the Neapolitan coming from the San Marzano tomatoes). I didn't love the crust as much (I left behind crust carcass - when I usually eat every last bite) it was a little overdone for me.Glad I can cross this pizza destination off the list. Happy to have gone but would have been slightly disappointed if I had to wait for hours for this pie. Also worth noting that the old woman server is super crotchety. Sit down, place your order and even if she never comes back to your table other than to give you a check, you are NOT supposed to help yourself to soda or silverware. Or do so for a properly embarrassing reaming in front of the dining room.",3.0

"I love Totonno's Pizza. The owner just stands in back with little assistance, spinning dough and drizzling olive oil from a big square can.

My brother and I waited two hours, and when we came inside, there were empty tables. Of course, nobody outside could see, and we weren't telling...The waitress (the chef's wife/co-owner, too?) approached and told us her husband wasn't able to spin smaller pies at that time. That was confusing. How hard is it to divide fresh dough in half?

"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. The pizza itself was decent, and I'm sure I would have given this place three stars had the service itself not soured my experience.This was by far the worst service I've experienced dining out. The waitress demanded we wait outside when we got there (that's fine), but we were standing with a group of people outside who were all confused as to what was going on. People were seated with no discernible order, other than perhaps the waitress liked one group more than the other. That said, my group of four got there before a whole family of 16 got there, yet they were given four empty tables before we could even get seated. Along with this, the waitress demanded we order right away as soon as we were seated. In a rush, we asked her what she would recommend and she gave us a complete look of disrespect and said with a voice of disdain, ""Get a pizza.""My girlfriend wanted to leave right after that, but we had made the trek all the way  out to Coney Island, so I convinced her not to just walk out of the place right then and there. We ordered a pizza and some drinks, my girlfriend asked for water. The waitress threw (THREW) her a plastic cup and pointed in the direction of the restroom. ""Water's there.""Never have I ever dined at a place where the customer was treated so badly. I'd prefer McDonald's, Domino's service to this place. This pizza could have been the best on Earth (it wasn't), but we, the customer, were treated like the scum of the earth.The pizza itself...apparently if you have a mediocre pizza place open for decades, that automatically labels it as good pizza. Having grown up in New York, I really can't say this is the best pizza. It probably wouldn't even rank up in the top 20 places I've had pizza at. It could be entirely possible that I was there on an off-day, or that the service experience definitely made all the food taste bad, but I was not impressed at all.",1.0
"I have seen summer time hour plus long waits going down at this Coney Island locals pizza joint. Go in the winter and you can walk in during prime lunch hours (noon, 1) with as little as a 5 minute wait. Get fresh garlic on your pie - you won't be sorry. The sausage is fennel-y and the 'roni is freshly sliced. The crust isn't chewy but more on the crispy side - making this pie a New York style meets Neapolitan hybrid (the Neapolitan coming from the San Marzano tomatoes). I didn't love the crust as much (I left behind crust carcass - when I usually eat every last bite) it was a little overdone for me.Glad I can cross this pizza destination off the list. Happy to have gone but would have been slightly disappointed if I had to wait for hours for this pie. Also worth noting that the old woman server is super crotchety. Sit down, place your order and even if she never comes back to your table other than to give you a check, you are NOT supposed to help yourself to soda or silverware. Or do so for a properly embarrassing reaming in front of the dining room.",3.0
"Very good, but not the best. Crust is solid, as is the sauce and the sauce-to-cheese ratio. I've been eating pizza all over New York for twenty years and absolutely love pizza. Totonno's is a classic, but not one of my top favorites. Service seems hierarchical -- locals and those familiar to the staff seem to get preferential treatment and seating. Can be filled with too many tourists on group tours. Always feel a little rushed.",4.0
"I love Totonno's Pizza. The owner just stands in back with little assistance, spinning dough and drizzling olive oil from a big square can. I took a star off for service (should have taken off 3, but you know legendary pizza places don't give a crap.) If you're in a hurry to get to Coney, don't even bother waiting. My brother and I waited two hours, and when we came inside, there were empty tables. Of course, nobody outside could see, and we weren't telling...The waitress (the chef's wife/co-owner, too?) approached and told us her husband wasn't able to spin smaller pies at that time. That was confusing. How hard is it to divide fresh dough in half?

The crust on this dough isn't worth dealing with the server taking the drink order of everyone at the table but mine.  For me, perfect pizza is the perfect storm of dough, sauce and topping.  Totonno's understands that all three elements must stand on their own.  While I sometimes enjoy the novelty of devilishly complicated slices like a macaroni and cheese slice, scaloppine slice, or in one case, a general Tso's slice, one must always come back to basics.  Totonno's, while they could use an attitude adjustment, delivers a lesson on proper pizza technique",2.0

"This place is so ""Brooklyn.""  I came here on a Sunday, an hour before the closing, with the boss lady having to come over and unlock the door.  Unexpectedly I was the sole customer.  The ignorant me wanted to get a couple of slices, but found out that they sell only the entire pies.  Since it was my first time here, I decided not to miss out on the taste of history, and ordered a small cheese pie.  I sat down at the booth, gazing around and admiring the decor of this historical establishment.  It did not take long into my wait for the ""Brooklyn"" side of the place to come out.  The tranquility was broken by the aforementioned hostess who thought that the girl being guided by the pizza guy was adding way too much sauce.  She looked at the apprentice and asked if she had been applying the sauce that way all along.  It got quiet for a moment and then the pizza man rescued the girl saying in a hushed, timid, apologetic tone, ""Cookie, relax...that pizza's for me"". After an awkward and lengthy pause he added, ""I used to dip everything in that sauce when I was younger"".  ""Putting so much sauce overpowers the flavor"", the lady argued, as she sat down at the booth across me. ""You're gonna make it soggy with all that sauce"", she complained.  Luckily the tension soon dissipated as a new customer arrived at the door.As for me, I am not sure if I was the one who wound up with the ""saucy"" pizza.  I'll tell you one thing.  That sauce is the winner.",5.0

"Don't go there for the hospitality. Theirs no warm and fuzzy feelings unless you're a life long patron.  Even then you might get smacked upside the head if you get smart with the head mistress of this pizza palace. You'd never guess from the decor that the dough at this place is the perfect combination of air and nyc attitude. The crust on this dough isn't worth dealing with the server taking the drink order of everyone at the table but mine.  For me, perfect pizza is the perfect storm of dough, sauce and topping.  Totonno's understands that all three elements must stand on their own.  While I sometimes enjoy the novelty of devilishly complicated slices like a macaroni and cheese slice, scaloppine slice, or in one case, a general Tso's slice, one must always come back to basics.  Totonno's, while they could use an attitude adjustment, delivers a lesson on proper pizza technique",2.0
"This is the place where I sampled my first real ""NY Pizza""  about 5 years ago.  Today it was the last place I am eating pizza at in NY on our trip.  Still amazing and still my favorite pizza of all time.  Came here with my buddies today and ordered a large pie, half cheese, half pepperoni.  Washed it down with a black cherry soda and it was heavenly.  The pizza here is so simple.  Good fresh mozzarella, sauce, olive oil and dough.  They have been doing it this way for 80 or so years.  Keep it simple and let the ingredients shine through.  The char on the bottom of the pizza is still the best I have ever seen.  It crunches when you bite into it but still gives you a fantastic chew.  The sauce is just right, the dough is thin and the crust had some nice chew to it.  The same dude that made my pizza the first time 5 years ago made my pizza again today.  Consistent!  Gotta love it!  Until we meet again Totonnos....you are the best and I will miss you and dream about you often!",5.0
"This place is so ""Brooklyn.""  I came here on a Sunday, an hour before the closing, with the boss lady having to come over and unlock the door.  Unexpectedly I was the sole customer.  The ignorant me wanted to get a couple of slices, but found out that they sell only the entire pies.  Since it was my first time here, I decided not to miss out on the taste of history, and ordered a small cheese pie.  I sat down at the booth, gazing around and admiring the decor of this historical establishment.  It did not take long into my wait for the ""Brooklyn"" side of the place to come out.  The tranquility was broken by the aforementioned hostess who thought that the girl being guided by the pizza guy was adding way too much sauce.  She looked at the apprentice and asked if she had been applying the sauce that way all along.  It got quiet for a moment and then the pizza man rescued the girl saying in a hushed, timid, apologetic tone, ""Cookie, relax...that pizza's for me"". After an awkward and lengthy pause he added, ""I used to dip everything in that sauce when I was younger"".  ""Putting so much sauce overpowers the flavor"", the lady argued, as she sat down at the booth across me. ""You're gonna make it soggy with all that sauce"", she complained.  Luckily the tension soon dissipated as a new customer arrived at the door.As for me, I am not sure if I was the one who wound up with the ""saucy"" pizza.  I'll tell you one thing.  That sauce is the winner.",5.0
"I was in Brooklyn for the mermaid parade and we wandered over here to eat while the parade was going.

"Very sorry to review this place poorly, there are so many really good pizza places in NYC, even just in Brooklyn. Sadly this isn't one of them, and we really wanted it to be. We first tried their pie many years ago when the kids were still young and we got very wet sauce in a cardboard box (we did not order ""to go""). The box was soaked when we were halfway done. The crust was burnt, and hard to eat. We just went back and this time no box, the sauce was better but we saw they use canned plum tomatoes as the delivery came in during our meal. The crust was still burnt, but you can eat it with a drink to wash it down. The sauce had some flavor and wasn't runny but there was little of it. The cheese was good quality but was kind of a thin layer so you couldn't taste it well. We had two pies; the first, pepperoni and sausage so added flavors from the extra toppings. But even with the toppings, we sadly did not think, ""wow, a tasty pie"". The second pie we asked for was just plain Marguerite as we really wanted to taste their ""classic"", but were disappointed. DiFara charges much more, but in comparison is very tasty and worth it. Again, so sorry to not give them a good review, but they need someone who can make a great tasting pie. The service was fine, we went when it wasn't crowded or too busy. I made the mistake of getting our second round of drinks myself since the fridge was in the dining room. Apparently, you shouldn't do that. I wasn't yelled at but the owner seemed maybe upset with her staff. I would love to go back again if I see consistently good reviews.

"I was kind of prepared for the worst of the worst as far as 'customer service' goes but it seems like most of these reviewers are fucking crybabies.  Jesus. Know what you want to eat before you go - not that complicated - and order.  Nobody was extra polite, but nobody was rude either.She asked us our order (a small cheese pie, two cokes) and that was it.  Whenever we said thank you, she said you're welcome.  I had zero issues with their hospitality honestly and was more annoyed at our wait.  We grabbed the last open table around 12:30/1:00pm on a Saturday, and it was just the luck of the draw that someone had ordered like five large pies to go sometime before we got there so the roll out was a bit delayed.  By the time we got our pie, other tables that had gotten there long after us were also already being served.  Bummer!  But again, just timing.  I thought the pizza was perfect in every way, but my dude is more into the Jersey style and won't pretend he's not.  It was perfectly crispy and saucy and the cheese was d-o-p-e.  A small pie was perfect for us - gotta leave room for Nathan's! Don't know when the crazy line-out-the-door madness hits, but during the hour or so we were there, no one had to really wait for a table.They had a bottle of prosecco and cookies out for 'dessert' for their 90th anniversary.  Our lady seemed to be spotty about informing people, but I've got two eyes and helped myself to a cookie.As far as their James Beard Award credibility goes, it's warranted.  It's for their pizza, their history, their legacy, not their paper plates and paper cups or your incessant boohoo-ing over not being wined and dined with your $20 pizza.",4.0
"Totonno's is an institution of the old New York family business (opened in 1924) and one of the most authentic pizzas known outside of Naples. In order to maintain the quality of the pizza, its handmade start to finish when you order. Pizzas are only served by the pie only (small is 14"" and large is 16"") so there are no soggy slices. Resist getting more than 2 toppings - any more and you'll overwhelm the delicate thin crust. In terms of beverages, beer, sodas and waters are bottled. No tap, but Stewart's Cream Soda and Root Beer make up for it. The damage? $27.70 for a small with 2 toppings and 2 sodasThe only thing that could be better about Totonno's is reducing wait time. First, perhaps more seats, or the willingness to split tables so less people are sitting in the heat. Second, making sure break times are better staggered for the chefs - we had to wait 30 minutes for our pie (the wait for handmade goodness) but all 8 tables got served their pizza within 10 minutes of each other, which seems inefficient process wise. Counteract the wait by visiting in the off hours (at 2:15 pm we didn't have to wait for a table) and by bringing good company to keep you entertained.",4.0

"I don't claim a favorite pizza at the moment. I'm partial the memory of my now of my dearly departed or defunct pizzerias, carrying an allegiance to flashback reminiscences from my happy pizza-eatin' childhood. You know how people like to over-sentimentalize the dead, but this is with pizzas of the past. Also, I have a lot of pizza eating to do, as research, before I make some kind of major declaration like that. Not that anyone's waiting with baited breath or anything. It's just that I gets grandiose. Anyway, so in the interest of these kind of pizza fact-finding missions a person may be lead to take herself on a nostalgic tour of favorite pizza places of her yout.

(By the way, I love it that people in my life are all on board with this birthday week gimmick.) What I'm longwindedly getting at here is: The best pizzas of my life have been found in the BK borough and Totonno's, part of that pack, continues to make some of my top favorite pizza around. It's one of my all time favorites of favorites.These pies (no slices here) remain fundamentally unchanged over the years; true to memory and tradition, I say. What you can expect are thin, thin crispy crusts with a the slightest bit of chew, and a touch of char from the coal-fired brick oven, giving the pizza a flavor that can not be duplicated. Pizzas are topped with a simple, juicy, bright tomato sauce, olive oil, mozzarella & a sprinkling of romano. It comes together perfectly, I tell you. Wonderful pizza. It is imperative that whenever we're anywhere near Coney Island, we're heading over to Neptune Ave, to Totonno's. I love their pizza. So happy that Totonno's is back up on it's time-honored pins after Sandy had her way. Grateful for the great pizza.Anytime I've visited this classic place it's been on the off-peak hours and so I've never dealt with any really long wait. This latest stop however, a few weeks ago, found us in the midst of a huge family's annual pizza tour, complete with a bus & a camera crew. All tables were taken and grabbing one for us two was gonna be a while. It was time we did not have. So to-go was the ticket, this time. It was fun talking with Cookie and the friendly staff as our pizza was made in front of our faces, as we tried to stay outta the way in the close quarters. (During this time I received an offer that if I ever cut my hair, I was to bring it to the pizza man. Now, I usually donate this mop, but if some kinda free pizza for life kinda deal could be worked out, I'd consider it. Yeah. Wink.

Certainly a cooled down Totonno's slice eaten in the front seat of yo car is still gonna be a good time, but the perfection is fleeting, my loves. No time to dillydally, I luckily spotted a suitable stoop just 'round the corner and some steps away, so to sit and split our small pie.Now, I grew up sittin on stoops. I've grubbed countless folded slices while loitering on city stoops in my day, but balancing a pizza box on our two sets of knees was a new trick for the ole gal. It was magic.By the way, I'm not suggesting or condoning plopping down on somebody's private property to take your feast, but for the record,  I was willing to take my chances.

"I was kind of prepared for the worst of the worst as far as 'customer service' goes but it seems like most of these reviewers are fucking crybabies.  Jesus. Know what you want to eat before you go - not that complicated - and order.  Nobody was extra polite, but nobody was rude either.She asked us our order (a small cheese pie, two cokes) and that was it.  Whenever we said thank you, she said you're welcome.  I had zero issues with their hospitality honestly and was more annoyed at our wait.  We grabbed the last open table around 12:30/1:00pm on a Saturday, and it was just the luck of the draw that someone had ordered like five large pies to go sometime before we got there so the roll out was a bit delayed.  By the time we got our pie, other tables that had gotten there long after us were also already being served.  Bummer!  But again, just timing.  I thought the pizza was perfect in every way, but my dude is more into the Jersey style and won't pretend he's not.  It was perfectly crispy and saucy and the cheese was d-o-p-e.  A small pie was perfect for us - gotta leave room for Nathan's! Don't know when the crazy line-out-the-door madness hits, but during the hour or so we were there, no one had to really wait for a table.They had a bottle of prosecco and cookies out for 'dessert' for their 90th anniversary.  Our lady seemed to be spotty about informing people, but I've got two eyes and helped myself to a cookie.As far as their James Beard Award credibility goes, it's warranted.  It's for their pizza, their history, their legacy, not their paper plates and paper cups or your incessant boohoo-ing over not being wined and dined with your $20 pizza.",4.0
"Totonno's is an institution of the old New York family business (opened in 1924) and one of the most authentic pizzas known outside of Naples. In order to maintain the quality of the pizza, its handmade start to finish when you order. Pizzas are only served by the pie only (small is 14"" and large is 16"") so there are no soggy slices. Resist getting more than 2 toppings - any more and you'll overwhelm the delicate thin crust. In terms of beverages, beer, sodas and waters are bottled. No tap, but Stewart's Cream Soda and Root Beer make up for it. The damage? $27.70 for a small with 2 toppings and 2 sodasThe only thing that could be better about Totonno's is reducing wait time. First, perhaps more seats, or the willingness to split tables so less people are sitting in the heat. Second, making sure break times are better staggered for the chefs - we had to wait 30 minutes for our pie (the wait for handmade goodness) but all 8 tables got served their pizza within 10 minutes of each other, which seems inefficient process wise. Counteract the wait by visiting in the off hours (at 2:15 pm we didn't have to wait for a table) and by bringing good company to keep you entertained.",4.0

"A classical, legendary, missing-link in the evolution of pizza as we know it, awaits all who bow before the altar of the pizza gods!  Truly a mandatory pilgrimage for all devotees to the slice.  Those in the know have been sure to go or at least salivate with dreams of doing so.  Those who don't... listen up!Totonno's is not your typical NYC street slice; actually it's NOT a NYC street slice, but instead an ancestor of it- a proud forefather so to speak.  One step removed from the traditional Neapolitan pies of Italy, this pizza represents the pie of NYC at the turn of the century (the 20th that is) when droves of Italian immigrants stepped through the gates of Ellis Island and planted roots in their home-to-be in this so-called New World.  Taste history in the NOW!  Most definitely worthy of the trip to Coney Island it certainly is, but one must not be turned off by the surrounding neighborhood (which does have a touch of hood-like qualities on nearby blocks).  No worries about late-night nervousness though... Totonno's isn't open past 730 or so, and may even close earlier if a busy day leads to a shortage of dough.   So get there early (I'd say 630 at the latest... and the earlier the better).  You WILL WAIT AFTER YOUR ORDER... because the old coal oven only cooks a couple of pies at a time, so bring your patience along with your cash. CASH ONLY and don't expect it to be cheap either.  That said, it's worth the price to drop a Jackson for a large (which me and the wife took down without too much of a problem).  You first trippers out there, I'd recommend going with the Margherita and/or the white pie.  Can't go wrong with the those two headliners. All in all, I'd put this in the top 3 pizza joints I've tried in the five boroughs (along with L&B in Bensonhurst and New Park in Queens).  I doubt there is much better pizza anywhere on the planet.  No kidding.",5.0

"Get cash, walk in, sit down and wait for your paper plate and cup. The menu is at the front so look up. Or just look at the picture I posted and order the same thing. You will not be disappointed. This pizza is different from Johns/Lombardi's. It's a little bit like Grimaldi's with a better crust. It's cooked in a coal oven giving it a charred taste. Unlike Saraghina, it's more American than Italian if that makes sense. The crust is less soft, more chewy. It's tough to describe. But it's excellent, must try. If you go for a meat topping I would definitely say GET THE PEPPERONI OVER THE SAUSAGE. Maybe this is my personal preference talking but I can't remember eating a better pepperoni slice in my life. Grimaldi's doesn't come close. DO NOT order a coke. They give you a tiny 8 oz. bottle and you will need to order more. If you order water, ask for tap or else they will bring you a bottle. The drink situation is the only thing that isn't great about this place. The neighborhood is sort of industrial. There are a lot of auto repair shops on the block. I would probably close at 7 too if I were them. There's street parking but it's tough to find around dinner time. You might need to drive around a while. In fact, I saw two cops drive around a while then finally park right in front of someone's driveway so they could come in and eat a pie. Was it illegal? Yes. Do I blame them? No, cuz I would do the same thing for this pizza.",4.0
"Two words ""Never Again"". Talk about an exhausting end to a day well spent!Landed here after avoiding the droves of tourists from the Applebee's in the neighborhood.. Spent the entire afternoon and evening hanging on the Coney Island and was in a mood for some nice old fashioned pizza. Yelped for help and out came Totonno's suggestion.Arrived and the lady (the only not-so-smiling/friendly server) informed us that they have only the large pies left. Ordered the same desperately. First fail: the server boy literally threw the pizza tray on our table. Upon noticing he was doing pretty much the same on all the orders. Second fail: the pizza is simply cheese and raw tomatoes thrown over a plain pie hurriedly. No spice, no flavor, nothing. I would pick L&B and our beloved La Bella in a heartbeat over them. Third fail: they keep the condiments (parm, chili flakes and  so on) out of the customers' reach.. Such an insult to a so called all Italian authentic pizza joint. Fourth and Epic Fail: cash only! I get it but please don't add 3 extra toppings to our plain pie and throw a bill of $36.75 in our face... Had we not checked, we would have been taken for a ride by folks here. Then to top it, all no apologies (not even a simple sorry) as if it was an honest mistake...Well Totonno's you might have been South Brooklyn's best at one point but you sure failed to impress me and get into the best category on my yelp pizza places' list....",1.0

"A classical, legendary, missing-link in the evolution of pizza as we know it, awaits all who bow before the altar of the pizza gods!  Truly a mandatory pilgrimage for all devotees to the slice.  Those in the know have been sure to go or at least salivate with dreams of doing so.  Those who don't... listen up!Totonno's is not your typical NYC street slice; actually it's NOT a NYC street slice, but instead an ancestor of it- a proud forefather so to speak.  One step removed from the traditional Neapolitan pies of Italy, this pizza represents the pie of NYC at the turn of the century (the 20th that is) when droves of Italian immigrants stepped through the gates of Ellis Island and planted roots in their home-to-be in this so-called New World.  Taste history in the NOW!  Most definitely worthy of the trip to Coney Island it certainly is, but one must not be turned off by the surrounding neighborhood (which does have a touch of hood-like qualities on nearby blocks).  No worries about late-night nervousness though... Totonno's isn't open past 730 or so, and may even close earlier if a busy day leads to a shortage of dough.   So get there early (I'd say 630 at the latest... and the earlier the better).  You WILL WAIT AFTER YOUR ORDER... because the old coal oven only cooks a couple of pies at a time, so bring your patience along with your cash. CASH ONLY and don't expect it to be cheap either.  That said, it's worth the price to drop a Jackson for a large (which me and the wife took down without too much of a problem).  You first trippers out there, I'd recommend going with the Margherita and/or the white pie.  Can't go wrong with the those two headliners. All in all, I'd put this in the top 3 pizza joints I've tried in the five boroughs (along with L&B in Bensonhurst and New Park in Queens).  I doubt there is much better pizza anywhere on the planet.  No kidding.",5.0
"A trip to Totonno's is a trip to another world.  They've been in business for 90 years--yes, 90 years!  When I think of the pizza blood line in this place I get woozy.  People that know me, know that I'm all about pizza.  Ever since I was a little kid, my favorite food has always been pizza.  And ever since my first paycheck, I started a quest to find the best pizza--slice or pie.Totonno's has the best pie, without question.  Look, if you're a noob or just a casual pizza-eater, then you won't be impressed.  You probably don't have the pallet to pick up on the subtle flavor profiles of their dough and mozzarella.  I'm not claiming to be an expert, but I can say with all certainty that I know good pizza.  I've spent so much money looking for a great slice, that when I come across a place as legit as Totonno's I tell the world.Parking... might be a problem.Dining-in during the weekend...might be a problem.But when you finally experience that first bite, remember the moment...savor it, because you'll never have that ""first-time"" experience again.For the pizza geek, Totonno's is the pinnacle.  It's absolutely worth a visit, or twenty.***CASH ONLY***Make a day of it...",5.0
"Get cash, walk in, sit down and wait for your paper plate and cup. The menu is at the front so look up. Or just look at the picture I posted and order the same thing. You will not be disappointed. This pizza is different from Johns/Lombardi's. It's a little bit like Grimaldi's with a better crust. It's cooked in a coal oven giving it a charred taste. Unlike Saraghina, it's more American than Italian if that makes sense. The crust is less soft, more chewy. It's tough to describe. But it's excellent, must try. If you go for a meat topping I would definitely say GET THE PEPPERONI OVER THE SAUSAGE. Maybe this is my personal preference talking but I can't remember eating a better pepperoni slice in my life. Grimaldi's doesn't come close. DO NOT order a coke. They give you a tiny 8 oz. bottle and you will need to order more. If you order water, ask for tap or else they will bring you a bottle. The drink situation is the only thing that isn't great about this place. The neighborhood is sort of industrial. There are a lot of auto repair shops on the block. I would probably close at 7 too if I were them. There's street parking but it's tough to find around dinner time. You might need to drive around a while. In fact, I saw two cops drive around a while then finally park right in front of someone's driveway so they could come in and eat a pie. Was it illegal? Yes. Do I blame them? No, cuz I would do the same thing for this pizza.",4.0
"Two words ""Never Again"". Talk about an exhausting end to a day well spent!Landed here after avoiding the droves of tourists from the Applebee's in the neighborhood.. Spent the entire afternoon and evening hanging on the Coney Island and was in a mood for some nice old fashioned pizza. Yelped for help and out came Totonno's suggestion.Arrived and the lady (the only not-so-smiling/friendly server) informed us that they have only the large pies left. Ordered the same desperately. First fail: the server boy literally threw the pizza tray on our table. Upon noticing he was doing pretty much the same on all the orders. Second fail: the pizza is simply cheese and raw tomatoes thrown over a plain pie hurriedly. No spice, no flavor, nothing. I would pick L&B and our beloved La Bella in a heartbeat over them. Third fail: they keep the condiments (parm, chili flakes and  so on) out of the customers' reach.. Such an insult to a so called all Italian authentic pizza joint. Fourth and Epic Fail: cash only! I get it but please don't add 3 extra toppings to our plain pie and throw a bill of $36.75 in our face... Had we not checked, we would have been taken for a ride by folks here. Then to top it, all no apologies (not even a simple sorry) as if it was an honest mistake...Well Totonno's you might have been South Brooklyn's best at one point but you sure failed to impress me and get into the best category on my yelp pizza places' list....",1.0
"Why is this place so far away from the train station? It's so yummy! If it wasn't for Sarah K. I would not have known about this place. Well, I guess that's not true, since I did read it Serious Eats recently. But I would have never thought about this place while I was in Coney Island.Pretty good pizza. The crust was crispy with a little charred taste. Fresh mozzarella. Soda in glass bottles. Sturdy tables. Wouldn't even know that this place burned down a few days ago.Restroom is kinda weird though. Toilet has its own room and the sink is outside next to it. And everything is behind a curtain.",4.0
"Speaking as a former New Yorker and somebody who's consumed lots of pizzas over the years, I'd rate Totonno's the very best of New York City. The pizza is great (it's better than DiFara's) and the inside of the place looks like what a pizzeria should look like. Upon entering I instantly felt like I was in a Martin Scorsese movie.But really. $18 for a small pizza? That's a rip-off. I can get a perfectly good small pizza back home for $8 which is LESS THEN HALF of Totonno's price. And likewise it will be from a coal oven. And the pizza will taste better than Totonno's. I'm not kidding. I don't know what it is about New Yorkers and their exorbinantly high prices for pizza. Sometimes I wonder if it'd be cheaper to fly to Naples and pick up a pizza there by myself.Now keep in mind, I didn't say Totonno's is the best in the nation. It's just the best of NYC. But that's a pretty big accomplishment by itself.",5.0
"came here today for lunch. there wasn't much of a line. but that's good with me. menu is simple: you order either a large or a small pie with your choice of the usual pizzeria toppings. there are about 10 tables: about 6 four seaters and a couple of booths that could probably seat 6 people tops. I ordered a small mushroom pie for two people. the pizza itself is of the thin crust variety with a beautiful slightly charred crust. They use a coal fired oven. the proportion of sauce to cheese is very good and I enjoyed the crispy, slightly salty and smoky crust. Compared to John's of Bleeker street, the pie has a more mosaic appearance as the cheese is interspersed in the sauce whereas John's Pizza is entirely covered in cheese. indeed, Totonno's makes a very gourmet pizza. they also serve coca cola in the vintage glass bottles. the people here are very matter of fact, but don't be offended. the only thing that would have made the pizza better would be some basil leaves :) all in all, great thin-crust pizza.",4.0

I found myself sprinkling table salt and pepper on top of the sauce to give it a bit more taste. That was very sad!

Yes, there is sometimes a line, but not always and not as bad as other destination pizza places. The pizza is just right. Thin, crispy, smoky crust, flavorful sauce, fresh mozzarella and a variety of toppings to choose from. Add a Brooklyn lager and you've got yourself a meal. They've been through a ton between a fire that shut them down for a long stretch, and then Sandy, and always bounced back, so I also feel good about giving this place my support.",5.0
"Have moved Totonno's up in my ranking to top 3 pizza in NY.  There's nothing I can add to all the reviews - it is perfection.  Must say my pizza preferences skew toward NY-style, red sauce, mozz, crisp crust.  A lot of the other 'pizza' I love across our fair City, I more classify as great bread with great toppings.  But this is Pizza, capital P.Wait is not an issue at about 4, stick with the off hours.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I have been trying different pizza spots around NY. He thinks this is the best and I definitely agree that it was delicious and is in my top two. I think i do prefer Lucali's but it can't be beat that there was no wait here, it was closer to home, their pepperoni tastes great, and they offer garlic powder, which is extremely important to the bf because he gripes about it every time there isn't like at juliana's.",5.0
I've eaten a lot of pizza in my NY existence and grew up in Coney Island... pre-burn down I would have given this place an easy 4 or maybe 5 stars..Last time I went I was totally under-impressed. Sauce is bleh and the counter service? BITCH PLEASE. You do not go BROOKLYN on THIS Brooklyn girl.I waited for my pie outside as a friend picked it up because i almost slapped the woman. The meats looked undercooked and the whole experience was just not like the old days... i guess nothing is but i will leave Totonnos to the tourists.You want to wait for a GOOD pizza???

"Totally one of the best pizza places around.  I love their perfectly oven grilled pies.  It comes out hot and sizzling, and truly makes your mouth water.  A true taste of fresh gourmet product is made totally clear with their slices from heaven.  This place has a cool finesse, reminds me of an old italian mob movie.  I just love that feeling of being in a movie.They close early-8pm.  Cash ONLY.  Pies, no slices.I wish this place was closer to my house, I would definitely be here all the time!",5.0

"I've been waiting to try this place for months, as it always shows up on someone's top 10 lists.  It didn't disappoint, but didn't wow either.The good:  It's a funky old joint, adorned with photos/awards/newspaper clippings, but is otherwise the definition of simple.  No menus, no condiments, a somewhat indifferent staff.The bad:  pretty much the same as above.  If you're expecting an experience, you'll be annoyed with the lack of experience (and quirky things like the prompt delivery of an empty dixie cup with no other offerings).  As an example, I ordered a coke, assuming it would be a decent portion-size to go with the pizza joint feel, but got a tiny 8oz bottle.The neutral:  The pizza.  I thought it was overall pretty solid.  Looked great, nice crust, but the cheese was pretty blah in taste and abundance, as was the sauce.  Don't get me wrong... it's much better than most.Why it gets 3 instead of 4 stars?   The price.  $18 for a small cheese.  $20+ for a large, before adding in $2.50 per topping.  This is absoultely simple pizza in a simple place but gourmet priced.  I give them props, but probably won't be giving them more money.",3.0
"If you're looking for just a slice of pizza, you won't get that here.  You have to order a while pie.  The pies aren't sitting on a counter, they are made to order.  The place is cute, sporting old school decor.  Great place to stop and enjoy after enjoying a day at Coney Island",4.0

After finding out this place was one of best pizza joints in town I had to try it even though my boyfriend thought I was crazy to drive from Red Hook to get it. I had the small half white pizza and the other half red(margherita) with sausage. I loved the crust and the fresh mozzarella made it really good.

"I think the most important thing to remember when trying Totonno's is it's not typical NY style pizza. It's cooked in a brick oven. Totally different style. The crust is super light and dry but flavorful. They use fresh mushrooms (not canned) and fresh mozzarella cheese. You cannot buy their pizza by the slice, whole pies only, so keep that in mind when ordering. Also, each topping is $2.50, so their pies can get a bit expensive, pretty quickly.  There were 5 of us when we went and 2 large pizzas filled us up. They only sell pizza. Nothing else. One of the reasons I think their pizza is so good. Worth the walk if visiting the coney island beach -- less than a 1/2 mile. Very old fashioned place.

And toppings were a big sparse and seemed to lack freshness.  The worst part - shoddy and rude service, especially from the owner.  It's very no frills, which can be ok but to get anything we basically had to get up and get it ourselves.  Forget the idea of being checked up on.  The owner was obnoxious to us as well as other patrons the whole time.  It was a cool/windy day and when ppl came to wait for a table, she made them wait outside even though there is plenty of room to wait inside and said it very rudely to them (it was just 2 ppl waiting and not like there was a line).  We asked for a side of tomato sauce and she just said they don't do that.

"It was a blisteringly hot muggy day, but no matter, there was official business at hand. I was crossing off another joint on my pizza bucket list. Totonno's has always escaped my pizza forays for one reason or another (distance, hours, tragic fire of '09) so a visit this summer was a must. Armed with one of my favourite wingmen-Wing L!-we made our way over to colourful Coney Island one recent afternoon for some pie. Although recently renovated, Totonno's still gives off a strong old school air boldened by unstinting pride. Family owned and operated since 1924. Open till the dough runs out. The walls are proudly plastered over with photos of sports heros, celebrities and accolades all over. You know you're dining at the altar of something special. We take our seat after Louise-I believe-says to grab a table as she's tired of standing around. She's curt, to the point, sports a nicotine soaked voice and almost pounces on an unassuming customer who had stealthly made his way to the back of the restaurant. ""What the..?! How'd he get back there?""The wait is short, we make do with a small cheese which is just right for our outstretched appetities. It's a good, solid pie. The texture, specifically the crust is the best feature here. Served right out of their coal oven, our pie is hot, crunchy, thin and crisp like a cracker. It's shamelessly burnt in spots but that's ok, I like it that way. It does not droop! On the whole, it gives good chew. The cheese is fresh, buttery mozzarella and on the edges a dusting of hard cheese (romano? parm?) is baked in. If there is a weak link, it is the tomato sauce. Uneventful. It's plain and unadulterated but still missing a fresh zip.This may not be the best pie you'll ever have but it is definitely worth a visit on any pizza afficinados list. There's character in spades here -both in the building and the pizza.",3.0

Awesome pizza for a long time in coney island. Its not my favorite as difaras is the best but very good. I could eat the whole damn pie its so good.

"Didn't get a chance to try the pizza, but the 'hostess' was really rude.

The walls are proudly plastered over with photos of sports heros, celebrities and accolades all over. You know you're dining at the altar of something special. We take our seat after Louise-I believe-says to grab a table as she's tired of standing around. She's curt, to the point, sports a nicotine soaked voice and almost pounces on an unassuming customer who had stealthly made his way to the back of the restaurant. ""What the..?! How'd he get back there?""The wait is short, we make do with a small cheese which is just right for our outstretched appetities. It's a good, solid pie. The texture, specifically the crust is the best feature here. Served right out of their coal oven, our pie is hot, crunchy, thin and crisp like a cracker. It's shamelessly burnt in spots but that's ok, I like it that way. It does not droop! On the whole, it gives good chew. The cheese is fresh, buttery mozzarella and on the edges a dusting of hard cheese (romano? parm?) is baked in. If there is a weak link, it is the tomato sauce. Uneventful. It's plain and unadulterated but still missing a fresh zip.This may not be the best pie you'll ever have but it is definitely worth a visit on any pizza afficinados list. There's character in spades here -both in the building and the pizza.",3.0

"Yum!  Super-thin crust, the sauce to die for, and cooked just right.  The ambiance is old-school Brooklyn and the waitress, an older woman, is a bit abrupt, but that's okay.  The pizza makes it worth it.  The only odd thing is that even though they have cans of Coke in the fridge, if you order a Coke they only serve the bottles for sit-down.",4.0
Awesome pizza for a long time in coney island. Its not my favorite as difaras is the best but very good. I could eat the whole damn pie its so good. Go in sit down and get a pepperoni pie then go a few doors over to l.b.j jeans and ask lord harry latts and tell him travis t sent you. Im not kidding.,4.0
"Didn't get a chance to try the pizza, but the 'hostess' was really rude. I walked up to the door and started pushing it open, when a woman yelled at me saying 'There's still no tables!' and pushed back on the door to close it in my face. I was kind of confused why she would act like I had come in before and was bothering her, since I had just arrived, and there was nobody else outside, After that I just turned around and walked away.

I'm finishing up a long over due review. This place to me is a different category of pizza which is great but different than the quintessential Brooklyn slice which is best made at Di Fara. However for the super hot fast cooking coal oven pizza which is more thin and made with fresh mozzarella you can't beat this Totonno's. It's truly fantastic. (Back in the day the thing to do was Pizza at Totonno's and then get the best cannoli's at the corner Italian bakery which sadly closed).,4.0

(like we knew we had to stay outside so they can figure out we were there to eat). we were 2 adults,2 teens and a 6 yr old. we ordered a 2 topping large pie. peperoni and sausage. i asked for olives, they didn't have, i asked for basil...nope. our pie was brought to us by one of the ""cooks"" that pretty much threw it on the table. disappointing as i was, i asked my family to ""let's eat this one, and then walk over to GRIMALDIS"" at least there i know we would get what we wanted. they didn't want to wait again so i tried ordering a small pie. no they didn't have no more small. lol. so we ordered another large with 2 topping. again no flavor, and soggy, and thrown on our table. so in the end, our order was 4 sodas, 1 beer and 2 large 2 topping pie. the bill was 75$ (lol) one of the server (which was an old rude hag), was complaining out loud how people had finished eating and they were not leaving and had the nerves to point at our table. we weren't there for more then 30-45 min. out of kindness, i left a 5$ tip to our server that never came back to make sure we were ok, so in total, we spent 80$ for pizza that was not as good a regular dollar slice and service and servers that were so rude that we felt like the black people did back in the segregation era. (mind you, we are Hispanic maybe that's why)",1.0
"Best pizza in NYC!!! Worth the trip!!PIcture it...A moon...hitting your eye...like A BIG PIZZA PIE... it hurt like hell but it was oh so good! AMORE INDEED! That's Totonno's in a nutshell!It a trek to get to and if there isn't a Cyclones game happening you may want to check the store hours but when I tell you that you can taste the generations of men, sweat, love, artisanship and more in this pizza you will thank me later for sending you here!Full of Brooklyn flare from direct yet friendly attitude to the let's converse as if we are old friends but only just met you will have a grand experience here. As for the pizza...OOOOOOHHHHH as for the pizza...you can only order by the pie and they dont get too fancy here with topping. I say get the large with your favorite toppings and then stand guard when it arrives. The pizza men are not to bad to look at and there is even a gorgeous enchantress that will take your order and give you a run for your money!I can't say enough good things about this place! Just go. The End!Deliciously Living,Michael",5.0
I'm finishing up a long over due review. This place to me is a different category of pizza which is great but different than the quintessential Brooklyn slice which is best made at Di Fara. However for the super hot fast cooking coal oven pizza which is more thin and made with fresh mozzarella you can't beat this Totonno's. It's truly fantastic. (Back in the day the thing to do was Pizza at Totonno's and then get the best cannoli's at the corner Italian bakery which sadly closed).,4.0
"So, after a failed attempt to go to Tottono's a few years back (it had burnt down!) I finally made it there. It was a light, thin crust pizza, with gooesy fresh mozzarella-pretty delicious but with more burnt spots than I prefer on my pizza and without basil. It is a small, quaint old fashioned looking spot. I don't think they serve alcohol and you cannot bring outside drinks (sign on the door!). Pies are under $20 and you can get toppings. They have a wall boasting their numerous awards and the staff  were friendly. The owner proudly shared her story of accepting the James Beard award and seemed genuinely happy to serve us. Make sure you get there early though, it was a Saturday, they closed at 8 and seemed to have a strict policy of not letting anyone in after 7:30-they will turn you away!",3.0
"This place is good but I feel like I've had it before. If you've had John's on Bleecker or Times Square or Patsy's in East Harlem, then you been done this style of pizza.

"After a year or so of being closed due to a fire Totonno's is finally opened again.

The place isn't fancy and it's not an Italian restaurant as well, all they have is pizza. They don't even have fancy pizza with fresh basil (yes this means no Margherita Pizza). They have 2 sizes of pizza (the large plain being about $20).

She proceeds to tell me that's her table and she's doing 'paperwork' (there's a Manila envelopeclosed on the table)-- she was behind the counter when we arrived, not doing any paperwork. No other booths available, she denies her customer the best seat in the house.  I'm like.... Wait a minute. She doesn't know who I am. I'm also Italian like the guys running this place, but Bronx Italian. Came all the way from the Bronx to get treated like shit. I left so upset with my boyfriend (who told me last time he came with his family she was SO mean to them). Look, I NEVER go on yelp to trash people (look at all my reviews- they're for great experiences only). But I left here so upset and disappointed because my family, everybody talks about their great pizza -- but I could NOT accept the way that woman treated me. I work in food service and I know--- best seat in the house IS NOT RESERVED FOR EMPLOYEES!!!! She has paperwork!? They need an office. Hell-- flip over a cardboard box and do it in the basement. Or-- tell your customer 'oh I'm sorry you know I'd love to seat you there but I have some work to do. Let me finish it then ill move you over there in a bit.' SOMETHING?!! Anything, but don't snap at me like that! Whoa. So I left, and had to come back and tell her my feelings because I was so disappointed with her nasty attitude after so much hype it threatened to ruin my day. When I came back, I see she had moved a couple of her Italian looking friends to save her seat. Seriously? I thought she had paperwork to do!?? She then apologizes and asks me to come sit with her in the booth. At this point I have such a horrible taste in my mouth from her attitude I refused and I will never go back there again. Hey Totono's here's a tip: put the lady with the nasty attitude in the BACK OF THE HOUSE!!!

Fine except that the peperoni side had an average amount on it and the mushroom side was very lacking even for a pizza with mushrooms on all of it. Sorry guys, you short changed us on the extra toppings and I am back to let others know! We are picky pizza eaters but when a pizza and two sodas come to nearly $30, we have a right to be!",3.0

my first brooklyn pizza experience was at totonno's! you can only order small or large pies (no slices). my half was mushroom and my bf's half was sausage. both were really good. its like a margherita style pie but the crust is the best part. it is thin and crunchy. it also turned my hands black but supposedly that is what gives it the special taste. they also make it to order which is the best way to eat pizza.,4.0

"Of the old school pizzerias, this one may have had the most going for it. Patsy's coal oven pies are literally coated in dust, which immediately knocks it out of the running. Lombardi's and Grimaldi's both have delicious pizza, but the former is a little too expensive and touristy, and the latter is staffed by the rudest old men you'll ever meet, and is like a dank, smelly cave inside. Where the others have their issues, Totonno's captures that nostalgic old New York feel without too much attitude, and the pizza is delicious and reasonably priced. Perhaps I'm biased because everything tastes better after a day on the boardwalk, but, visit to DiFara's pending, I may just have to crown Totonno's the victor in the classic New York pizza wars. The sauce and cheese were great, but what really gives them the edge is the sauce, which is just amazing. By far the best part. I was watching the guy in the back make the pizzas while I was on line for the bathroom, so after a minute or two I asked what was in the sauce. This is how that exchange went down:""Can you keep a secret?"" ""Yes!""""...So can we!""Zing!They've got a little Italian attitude, but in that funny endearing way, rather than being abrasively rude. To recap, great food, good prices, unmatched old school atmosphere and some feisty but fun servers. What's not to love? It's a trek out to Coney Island for sure, but it's always a fun trip and when you can wrap it up with pizza here the whole journey becomes well worth your time.",5.0
"Above average pizza and extraordinarily outrageous prices, though all high-end Zagat rated pizzerias are this expensive, I can't really justify it. I suppose when you have the reputation and the tourist clientele you don't need to be the best necessarily.It's freshly made dough, thin crust, really delicious but salty mozzarella cheese, pepperoni was as plain as the presliced stuff you buy in any grocery store, the tomato sauce was well-balanced and not overpowering. There's a novelty factor to it, but this is aiming too much to that old New York family-centered tourist market and not to the guy like me, who simply wants the best slice you can get. I guess I'll have to keep looking for that special place. It was a good meal though, just cost 50% more than it was worth.",3.0
"The WORST pizzeria I have ever been to. I was actually excited to show my bf this place considering how famous it is, but I ended up just getting embarrassed and looking like I have horrible taste.We walked over here and had to wait outside for 20-25 minutes behind other couples. Nobody takes your name, you just have to remember who is in front of you and then wait for the waitresses to call you in. We finally get seated at a booth and the waitress Cookie doesn't ask us what we want to drink so we just grab sodas out of the fridge. She then comes by and asks us what we wanna order. I tell her we did not get menus and she says to look up at the wall. Can't afford to print up menus? We then tell her we want a small pie since other Yelpers recommended we split that. She then tells us their out of small pies!! Are you kidding me? How can a pizzeria who makes their pizza fresh be supposedly out of small pies? How can you not just take the dough you are gonna use for a large pie and make a small one? Ok so we order a large pie since we didn't have a choice and she told us 2 people can definitely finish a large one.Next a red headed monster of a waitress comes by and tells us that they need our booth for a larger party of six and wanna move us to another table. We go over to check out the table and before we can even sit down she has moved our stuff. Seeing how close it was to the door and that it was right under a noisy fan, I told her I don't wanna move and that I want to sit at the booth. She is already setting up the table and told me she'll check if anyone is leaving as if I already lost my table. She does not tell us that somebody offered to give us their table so she could sit the larger party and just calls the party of 6 in. I put my bag on the table and tell her I'm not sitting over there and she YELLS at me saying ""you're not going to sit over there lady"" making the whole restaurant look at me like I'm the crazy one. Excuse me but we waited outside like everyone else, I don't care who is waiting, I'm a customer too.It is so obnoxiously clear that they only care about larger parties then couples. A party of six got 3 pizza pies one right after they finished the other before 3 tables of couples got 1!! We finally get our pizza and notice a pool of oil right in the middle of the pizza. It was paper thin, yet had a thick crust. I also couldn't taste the basil. It still tasted good but the structure was really inconsistent. The waitresses never asked us how we were doing, and  it was clear we had finished our drinks right around the time we got the pizza. All they cared about was making sure another party of 7 got their drinks. The red headed one then takes our empty pizza pan without asking if we want anything else. It takes another 15 minutes for cookie to write out the check for $26 which the red headed one just slammed down. We paid and walked right out. I told him not to leave any tip with the disgusting way we got treated and he then asked me why he would tip someone who just brought pizza out? Yea their job basically makes no sense to begin with. Glad we tried it and didn't go out of our way. Now I can see why this place only has 148 reviews compared to L & B spumoni gardens 691!I will never recommend this place to anyone and Grimaldis is just as good anyway.

"Totonno's is everything I love about Brooklyn.  The Brooklyn I was raised in.  The fun, sometimes crazy, sometimes mellow streets.  The hot sidewalks I scraped my knee on when I fell off of my big wheel.  The ""skully"" playing on the street corners while our parents sat on lawn chairs in front of our apartment doors drinking ""Riunite.""  The old school Italian Pizzeria's that served riceballs, calzones and lemon ices.  The dance shows my friends and I would put on for the neighborhood...Totonno's brought back all of those memories for me the second I walked through the door this afternoon.  A tiny little pizza place in Coney Island, that is rarely ever open, doesn't sell pizza ""by the slice"" and is chock full of young families and old Italian men happily taking down an entire pie on their own.I've heard a lot about this place over the years, and have been living in Coney for almost 7 months now and today was the first time I tried it.  Besides the sweet childhood memories it brought back of the ""Old Brooklyn,"" the pizza is nothing short of AMAZING.Thin crust, perfectly baked, sauce to die for, fresh mozzarella that is mouth-watering, mushrooms so juicy they are like a meal on their own.I can't even begin to thank the pizza gods for giving me the experience I had today...  In a word:  STELLAR.I think I like this place better than L&B's and that, my friends, is a HUGE compliment.",5.0
"Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, this pizzeria is a great find if you live in the area. Large pie - $19.50Small pie - $16.50Toppings - +$5.00Margherita - $20.95These pies are thin like Grimaldi's. Luckily, unlike Grimaldi's there is no wait or the wait is short enough to make it worth it. My Margherita was suffering from a case of over hydration - too much water made the center soggy and floppy. The outer periphery was less damaged and could withhold the traditional handling of a pizza (i.e. with hands & without the fork and knife). The sauce was sparse, and so was the cheese. The slice was a little above average - it had a hint of savoriness, but there was no overwhelming blast of flavor. I also had a small pie with mushrooms. I was happy to find that the mushrooms were more of a portabello quality than that of the button mushroom quality, and reflected the old adage - quality over quantity. The crust held up better in this one and we could eat it with our hands - the way it should be. This is great if you are in the neighborhood or Coney Island - it is a couple blocks away. A distance you can weather on a nice summer day or a brisk fall one, but not in the winter.",3.0

"Of the old school pizzerias, this one may have had the most going for it. Patsy's coal oven pies are literally coated in dust, which immediately knocks it out of the running. Lombardi's and Grimaldi's both have delicious pizza, but the former is a little too expensive and touristy, and the latter is staffed by the rudest old men you'll ever meet, and is like a dank, smelly cave inside. Where the others have their issues, Totonno's captures that nostalgic old New York feel without too much attitude, and the pizza is delicious and reasonably priced. Perhaps I'm biased because everything tastes better after a day on the boardwalk, but, visit to DiFara's pending, I may just have to crown Totonno's the victor in the classic New York pizza wars. The sauce and cheese were great, but what really gives them the edge is the sauce, which is just amazing. By far the best part. I was watching the guy in the back make the pizzas while I was on line for the bathroom, so after a minute or two I asked what was in the sauce. This is how that exchange went down:""Can you keep a secret?"" ""Yes!""""...So can we!""Zing!They've got a little Italian attitude, but in that funny endearing way, rather than being abrasively rude. To recap, great food, good prices, unmatched old school atmosphere and some feisty but fun servers. What's not to love? It's a trek out to Coney Island for sure, but it's always a fun trip and when you can wrap it up with pizza here the whole journey becomes well worth your time.",5.0
"Above average pizza and extraordinarily outrageous prices, though all high-end Zagat rated pizzerias are this expensive, I can't really justify it. I suppose when you have the reputation and the tourist clientele you don't need to be the best necessarily.It's freshly made dough, thin crust, really delicious but salty mozzarella cheese, pepperoni was as plain as the presliced stuff you buy in any grocery store, the tomato sauce was well-balanced and not overpowering. There's a novelty factor to it, but this is aiming too much to that old New York family-centered tourist market and not to the guy like me, who simply wants the best slice you can get. I guess I'll have to keep looking for that special place. It was a good meal though, just cost 50% more than it was worth.",3.0
"The WORST pizzeria I have ever been to. I was actually excited to show my bf this place considering how famous it is, but I ended up just getting embarrassed and looking like I have horrible taste.We walked over here and had to wait outside for 20-25 minutes behind other couples. Nobody takes your name, you just have to remember who is in front of you and then wait for the waitresses to call you in. We finally get seated at a booth and the waitress Cookie doesn't ask us what we want to drink so we just grab sodas out of the fridge. She then comes by and asks us what we wanna order. I tell her we did not get menus and she says to look up at the wall. Can't afford to print up menus? We then tell her we want a small pie since other Yelpers recommended we split that. She then tells us their out of small pies!! Are you kidding me? How can a pizzeria who makes their pizza fresh be supposedly out of small pies? How can you not just take the dough you are gonna use for a large pie and make a small one? Ok so we order a large pie since we didn't have a choice and she told us 2 people can definitely finish a large one.Next a red headed monster of a waitress comes by and tells us that they need our booth for a larger party of six and wanna move us to another table. We go over to check out the table and before we can even sit down she has moved our stuff. Seeing how close it was to the door and that it was right under a noisy fan, I told her I don't wanna move and that I want to sit at the booth. She is already setting up the table and told me she'll check if anyone is leaving as if I already lost my table. She does not tell us that somebody offered to give us their table so she could sit the larger party and just calls the party of 6 in. I put my bag on the table and tell her I'm not sitting over there and she YELLS at me saying ""you're not going to sit over there lady"" making the whole restaurant look at me like I'm the crazy one. Excuse me but we waited outside like everyone else, I don't care who is waiting, I'm a customer too.It is so obnoxiously clear that they only care about larger parties then couples. A party of six got 3 pizza pies one right after they finished the other before 3 tables of couples got 1!! We finally get our pizza and notice a pool of oil right in the middle of the pizza. It was paper thin, yet had a thick crust. I also couldn't taste the basil. It still tasted good but the structure was really inconsistent. The waitresses never asked us how we were doing, and  it was clear we had finished our drinks right around the time we got the pizza. All they cared about was making sure another party of 7 got their drinks. The red headed one then takes our empty pizza pan without asking if we want anything else. It takes another 15 minutes for cookie to write out the check for $26 which the red headed one just slammed down. We paid and walked right out. I told him not to leave any tip with the disgusting way we got treated and he then asked me why he would tip someone who just brought pizza out? Yea their job basically makes no sense to begin with. Glad we tried it and didn't go out of our way. Now I can see why this place only has 148 reviews compared to L & B spumoni gardens 691!I will never recommend this place to anyone and Grimaldis is just as good anyway. I'll stick to my fave place (L &B Spumoni gardens obviously) which has:1. Thick delicious pizza which has been around 70 yrs compared to Totonnos 802.

A restaurant where history and traditions meet. I am very happy this landmark place was not completely destroyed by Sandy and was able to reopen for business as it offers the most delicious pizza( we usually get Margherita and mushroom) And I do believe it beats Grimaldis for taste.

I've had better! Not worth the price at all,1.0
A restaurant where history and traditions meet. I am very happy this landmark place was not completely destroyed by Sandy and was able to reopen for business as it offers the most delicious pizza( we usually get Margherita and mushroom) And I do believe it beats Grimaldis for taste. Very atmospheric small restaurants with pictures and newspaper articles on the walls . Go on weekdays as it gets extremely busy on weekends. Upon our last visit we saw restaurant owner himself going around meeting and greeting customers and thanking everyone for their support. Very homey old school place!,5.0
"Ahhhhhhh I always crave their pizza whenever I think about it!!  Honestly the best brick oven pizza I ever had in my life! ~~Yes, better than GRIMALDI""S, which I believe is wayyyyy to touristy, not worth that extremely long wait, while being crammed inside while eating!Even though Totonno's is small and can get pretty busy, I've been lucky the past few times I've been there where I was able to get a seat without a problem.    They keep it simple to a limited amount of flavors which is what I love about this place.    Even though this is like the best freakin pizza ever, when I order a pie, usually 2 or 3 slices are...let's say ""more crispy"" from the rest of the pie, which I completely understand because it's brick oven pizza, but it's overwhelmingly too much of a charcoal flavor for me. However, some people don't mind this.",4.0

"This review has been a long time coming.  I was at Totonnio's about 6 month's ago over the summer.  My boo had to check out the splendor of Coney Island, and the magic of Yelp's intergalactic pizza tracking technology found Totonnio's nearby.We arrived about 15 minutes before it opened.  A guy sitting on his white plastic chair said it'd be open in 10.  We peruse the neighborhood and come back to find a typical middle aged chubby New Yoorker, cell phone in ear, banging on the front door.  He's apparently in a rush, he complains to the phone that they're late in opening, ""They got me held hostage over here!""  I peer in and see an older woman beginning to set up the restaurant with an air of upmost tranquility.  The chubby New Yoorker makes it obvious we are waiting, ""I'm waiting for my mother, she runs the cash registah!""  They are supposed to be opened at midday, it was now 12:19.  A few minutes later the screen door is finally unlocked and we're seated.The woman is friendly and takes our order.  She briefly apologizes for the delay, while she does so nearly half the restaurant gets filled.  We ordered a large pizza, half Margherita and half peppers and onion.  As I sip my Coke, the chef arrives with our pizza, sees the amazement on my face, and say's, ""Don't eat too fast!""  The pizza was delicious, the sauce was sweet and tangy with the right mix of chunkyness and sauciness.  Not the typical NY pizza with tons of garlic and grease, this was fresh, slightly crispy, and just plain amazing.  If anyone ever goes to NY, make the 45 minute F train ride to Coney Island and go to Totonnio's.  Not just for the pizza but also for the experience, pure NY!!",4.0

Totonno's Coney Island is in my view in the running (with John's) for the best pizza in town.

"This is some serious historic pizza and you owe yourself the favor of checking this place out at least once.Easy to find, easy to like if you're not impatient or picky.

Bring your manners, but not your exaggerated sense of self-importance - this is Brooklyn after all - and not the hipster part.

"Stopped here during a recent Coney Island trip and wanted to see what the hype was about. The pizza here is light, airy, and delicious.

The crust is thin and charred, just right. I would have preferred a bit more sauce, but it was tasty enough that this is a minor complaint. Service is no frills, but gets the job done, so don't expect anything fancy; this is a family run joint. Definitely worthy of being my new pizza stop in Coney Island.

"Went here after reading the reviews here on Yelp about the great pizza. Meh, the pizza was ""okay"" but nothing special.

The sauce was nice as was the cheese, but really this is a b-level version of the truly delicious Gruppo in the East Village.Also, the service at this place is non-existent. Now, usually I'll put up with a lot when we're dealing with good food, but it seems like this place is stuck in their heyday and believe they don't have to keep customers. The pizza we ordered was literally slammed on our table without a word from behind the waitresses back since she was moving so quick to get away from us. We were not approached again. In the hour and change we were there, the only contact from our waitress was ""what do you want?"" and her running after us screaming that we took the check with us when we left our cash. Which we didn't, she just didn't see it on the table. But she made me go back to the restaurant with her while she checked to be sure we didn't take it. This part I really didn't get.

"Went here after reading the reviews here on Yelp about the great pizza. Meh, the pizza was ""okay"" but nothing special. The crust was a bit too thick for a ""thin"" crust and the char on it overwhelmed the flavor of the ingredients on the top (I generally like a little char on a good pizza too). The sauce was nice as was the cheese, but really this is a b-level version of the truly delicious Gruppo in the East Village.Also, the service at this place is non-existent. Now, usually I'll put up with a lot when we're dealing with good food, but it seems like this place is stuck in their heyday and believe they don't have to keep customers. The pizza we ordered was literally slammed on our table without a word from behind the waitresses back since she was moving so quick to get away from us. We were not approached again. In the hour and change we were there, the only contact from our waitress was ""what do you want?"" and her running after us screaming that we took the check with us when we left our cash. Which we didn't, she just didn't see it on the table. But she made me go back to the restaurant with her while she checked to be sure we didn't take it. This part I really didn't get. I understand them needing the check for their books, but you have the money and if the customer says they left it on the table you ask them to come back to the restaurant to check for it? Ugh. This pizza was not worth it. AT ALL.",2.0
"Best pizza I've ever had.  Worth the shlep.The other locations do not compare, don't expect greatness unless you go to Coney Island.",5.0
"Ok, this pizza was slap someone good.  I saw it featured years ago on some food network show, but I live in Chicago, so I waited.  and waited, and waited until finally, my first visit to NYC.  I decided to venture out of Manhatten and head to Coney Island.  I remember this place and headed over.  Sure, I had to wait, and wait, and wait!  It was so worth it.  Probably the best za I ever had.  It was crazy good.  Will have this again when I go back to NYC.  They do not accept plastic so bring the $!",5.0
"Totonno's has been on our list of places to try for a long time so we were excited to try it when we went to Coney Island yesterday. After watching the hot dog eating contest, we definitely weren't feeling Nathan's so Totonno was the obvious choice!It's a cute little place, very little frills. There are paper plates and cups. When I asked for water, she told me I could go fill my paper cup at the sink...um okay...Needless to say, I stuck with my soda. The bathroom just a toilet and you have to walk out to use the sink outside (same sink she told me to fill up my cup with water). I am not normally picky about dive-like places but this was all a bit strange to me.We ordered a small plain pie for the two of us. The first bite my fiance took he was like, eh. The crust was REALLY good (thin, chewy, brick oven with blackened spots). The sauce was this orange color and thin (I prefer chunky sauce). The cheese was pretty good standard mozzarella. Overall, it was just okay. I'm not sure what all the hype is about. We've tried all the ""famous"" NY pizzas (Lombardi's, Grimaldi's, Pasty's) and New Haven pizzas and this was the lowest of all of those. If you happen to be down in Coney Island and craving pizza, I'd suggest making a trip here. But I wouldn't come to Coney Island just for this pizza.If I could give 2.5 stars, I would. The crust was really, really good.",3.0
"Definitely a pizza you will remember.  The crust is nice and thin.  The amount of mozzarella cheese is perfection at its best and sauce is not over powering.  Nonetheless, pizza was AWESOME but the service is not what I expected.  The owner's superfluous disposition towards her clientle makes me think twice before traveling to eat this delightful pizza.",4.0
"The moment I've long been waiting to seize,Is getting to try a Totonno's Napolitano pizza made with their house specialty cheese.What a perfect day to visit Coney Island when it's 70 degrees!Although this place is off the beaten path, I was feeling somewhat safe and at ease.The surrounding area is pretty much devoid of manicured lawns and trees.There certainly wasn't enough pollen around to make me sneeze.The line was so long that we did consider going next door for takeout Chinese.As we waited in line, out comes third generation owner Louise!Geez........What's with Louise!?Is that a frown or some degenerative facial disease?Signora, I'm only here for your well renowned pizza...please?Good service is not an issue and I'm sure many who've come here agree,It's great tasting pizza and the best part is the flavor of toasted Romano cheese. Boy was my palate so pleasantly pleased!It's a pizza that will bring me down to my knees,But...I will not do that in front of Louise!",4.0
"Out of all the pizza places I've been to, this is the second best! (sorry, Lombardis in Little Italy is a little bit better, but this beats out Grimaldis).  No line, loud Italian women, and a sketchy bathroom all make the pizza taste that much more traditional.  Yommmmmmmmmm.",5.0
"This place is terrific, is it worth the trip all the way out to The Coney.  Absolutely.The pizza is incredible, and the ambiance is great!  We had this older woman with a bad dye job, a thick brooklyn accent who didn't write down our order, she yelled it back to the kitchen and made us get our drinks out of the cooler on our own.  Thinking about it makes me smile, this place is one of a kind, and the pizza is terrific.  It all came together well.  I would highly recommend it, especially if you are pizza person like I am.",4.0
"I ordered the regular pie.  The crust was WAY too thin for me.  I had 3 pieces and it was like an appetizer.. and the pie was $16.50. ..wow. It was small for a regular...or maybe because it was so thin.. I was still so hungry. The sauce and cheese was really good though.  You can't order just slices either, only pies.This place needs a normal customer's bathroom.  The bathroom is a tiny closet with no sink. You have to walk out to the site and use the utility sink next to the counter. That's a big minus for me.",3.0

That's a lot for my broke college self, but obviously this place is so famous that they charge what they want.Also, it closed at 8PM on a FRIDAY we had to get our pizza take-out because we walked in at 7:35 (there were no available seats anyways) -- so perhaps a little more effort on the restaurants behalf to accomodate customers (at least stay open 'till 9 ... pizza is always a great late night food!)

"No longer living in New York, and having heard recently that this memorable joint was gutted by a nasty fire, I decided that perhaps now was the time to finally write a Yelp review of my most favorite of pizza places, Totonno's.Totonno's is typically about an hour by subway from Midtown, so if you go make sure to budget your time accordingly. Additionally, the crowds are much more manageable between the fall and early spring. I rarely find myself here in summer.The decor is very old school, with simple tables and chairs lying underneath photos of famous visitors and newspaper clippings that are plastered on the walls. I doubt they've done much in the way of renovating since they first opened. Service is minimal: you may find yourself giving your order directly to the pizziaolo himself, despite the fact that there is usually someone waiting the tables. This isn't Daniel or Nobu: people come here for one reason, and one reason only, and it isn't the service. But if they're not busy you'll have your pie 5 minutes after ordering.At the front, clearly visible to all who dine, lies the secret to Totonno's success, their well-aged coal-fired oven. The pizza that's been churned out of that oven since the 1920s can't be matched. The inner crust is thin and crispy with a light char. The rim is crispy on the outside but soft and chewy within. Totonno's primarily uses fresh mozzarella (frequently with a dash of pecorino), which is placed on the dough first followed by a splashing of sauce (and any toppings) before entering the oven. To be honest I've only had their margherita and white pies (the latter being what they're famous for), but I've heard that their pepperoni pie ain't half bad either.Hopefully they'll be back for business by October.

"I have been coming to this neighborhood institution for many years and now have the pleasure of bringing my daughter. No slices at this joint - just perfectly cooked pies.

"That afternoon on the train I felt the sudden impulse to travel all the way to the last stop. It was autumn and a faint sun had begun to fall on the windowpanes of the subway car, as it emerged from the darkness of the tunnel into the elevated tracks of Brooklyn. The clock was just striking five. I don't suffer much from nostalgia, but a feeling struck me: what if I could suddenly walk into my childhood?Coney Island. I got off the almost empty train as soon as it came to a halt. Making my way down the stairs of the station, I came outside to the bright, shining lights of Nathan's Famous. Images of early youth dates and sounds of laughter from friends pulling a prank brought me to a time and place that seemed vaguely familiar. However, as I walked around the corner of the street, the quiet and deserted blocks reminded me of the reality that the busy season of summer was long over. This was no quest for self-knowledge. Instead, this was a search for clarity and reconciliation. At every step of my pizza journey, I had confronted evidence of the inadequacies of understanding and the realization that certitude was for fools. What better place then, to reconcile the mysteries of great pizza, than at the doorstep of that old faithful, Totonno's. As I turned the door handle, I wondered whether I would enter the world of childhood all over again.There was near complete stillness. People dining on the solitary occupied table looked up from their conversation in my direction. A flash of recognition came before their eyes - a fellow pizza aficionado. They continued with their chatter as I took a seat. ""Margherita"" was the only word that escaped my lips as the hostess came to ask me for my order. She nodded and as she turned around I smiled and added, ""Coca Cola bottle"", without looking ahead at the menu on the wall.No sooner had she left that I glanced at the accolades and reminders of its glorious history on the surrounding walls. Newsreels about the Brooklyn Dodgers and the wars were next to bombard the senses. These were replaced with affectionate portraits of childhood friends and relatives as soon as the pizza was served. I bit into the crust that was nicely blistered from the coal fired hearth, and was as thin, crispy and pliant as that in my recollection. The cheese was also excellent, and fresh, but the tomato sauce was a disappointment. ""You're utterly ruthless and listen to no one but yourself"" was the discordant voice over the reel rebuking the old owner hard at work. Could it be that Jerry Pero ran such a totalitarian shop that no one could replicate his creations after him? Images of the modern day Maestro of Midwood, immersed in concentration at the task of singly crafting masterpieces seemed to answer this in the affirmative.

Serious Pie in Seattle, WA Down Town. I know, I would have never guessed reading all the pizza buzz about NYC and Chi Town. NYC, Chi Town and Philadelphia all had great pizza but IMO they lacked the distinct melding of flavors that I found at those two shops. Both are very different but have that classic thin crust.The pizza here is delicious and pure in it's style. I watched as they laid down the fresh hand made mozzarella cheese slice by slice then adding the made in house Italian sausage. Made with true care for style and taste. Extra crispy on the edges and soft on the inside true of The Napoli style. I'd recommend you try this and I hate to compare but you have to hit Portland and Seattle to try the pizza.Enjoy!",4.0

"Overall, the pizza was pretty good. Definitely one of the better places in brooklyn. However, I do still think that they are trumped by DiFara's.

"It's good pizza. It's simple pizza. If you want the Brooklyn pizza experience, it may not get better than this. However, the down side is that they know they can expect customers no matter what, they are not particularly friendly, it is not Burger King and you cannot have it your way, and the servers are somewhat unfriendly. Also, it's expensive and I think it's cash only. Drink-wise, for $2 or $2.50 each, you get an 8 oz. bottle of soda. The pizza was good, but it may be a one-time deal for me just to say I've eaten there. It's certainly not worth sitting on the F train for an hour each way to and from Manhattan.",4.0

NYC, Chi Town and Philadelphia all had great pizza but IMO they lacked the distinct melding of flavors that I found at those two shops. Both are very different but have that classic thin crust.The pizza here is delicious and pure in it's style. I watched as they laid down the fresh hand made mozzarella cheese slice by slice then adding the made in house Italian sausage. Made with true care for style and taste. Extra crispy on the edges and soft on the inside true of The Napoli style. I'd recommend you try this and I hate to compare but you have to hit Portland and Seattle to try the pizza.Enjoy!",4.0
Delicious? Yes. Expensive? YES. Just make sure to fill your pockets with cash money before stuffing your fat face full of pizza pizza pies.,4.0
"Overall, the pizza was pretty good. Definitely one of the better places in brooklyn. However, I do still think that they are trumped by DiFara's. The wait is better than DiFara's though so I guess it depends on one's priorities. It also is in the middle or nowhere which makes it inconvenient.",4.0
"It's good pizza. It's simple pizza. If you want the Brooklyn pizza experience, it may not get better than this. However, the down side is that they know they can expect customers no matter what, they are not particularly friendly, it is not Burger King and you cannot have it your way, and the servers are somewhat unfriendly. Also, it's expensive and I think it's cash only. Drink-wise, for $2 or $2.50 each, you get an 8 oz. bottle of soda. The pizza was good, but it may be a one-time deal for me just to say I've eaten there. It's certainly not worth sitting on the F train for an hour each way to and from Manhattan.",4.0
"Pizza tasted pretty good, but is not worth a ride from Manhattan.Price is higher than merited because of the name.(24 dollars a pie with no extra toppings)Service: bad (in addition to lack of hygiene) The waitress was mopping the floor one minute and bringing the food as soon as she put the dirty mop down. Additionally, took us 50 minutes to get a pie because allegedly our original pie was damaged in the making.Would not make an effort to return.Di Fara's on Avenue J is still the king of NYC pizza in my book..",2.0
"My new favorite pizza place!  I think this is one of the best pizza's I ahve ever had in Brooklyn.  Their crust is thin, crusty and  the pizza is delicious.     They do not deliver though and they only take cash, so definitely head for ATM before you get there.",5.0
"So I thought this would be just another thin crusted pizza shop with alot of hype like most are. But this pizza had something special. A unique taste, crunch and flavor. My parents took me here and we just got in since they closed at 8pm. The gun hole in the window is just like the one i have at home! I highly recommend!",5.0
"Best Pizza in NYC. Worth the trip to Coney Island.  Come early, they close at 8 pm. We almost missed it. It is a little pricey but worth it. the crust is crisp and paper thin. great sauce and cheese combination. I am not a toppings person but the pepperoni they use is top quality. Cannot wait to go back for more.",5.0

"Nine for the pies.  Zero for the service.My wife and I made a special trip from Chicago over the July 4 weekend to experience the pizza here.  Boy were we disappointed!First of all the actual food product is first-rate.  My wife pronounced it the best pizza she's ever had.  We had the fresh garlic and anchovy pie.  I have to admit that it was superb.  Good tomato sauce combined with a very fine, un-floppy crust.HOWEVER, there is a waitress there, an older, dark-haired Italian woman, who made our visit quite an unhappy one.  It was obvious from the start that we had done something to irritate her.  Maybe we didn't know the Brooklyn pizza handshake or something.  But she proceeded to ignore us for the remainder of our stay.  Quite pointedly.My message to you, dear waitress, is to grow up!  If you're unhappy slinging pies get another job, for cripe's sake.  Don't take out your disappointments in life upon unsuspecting tourists.Message to fellow Yelpers: do not tip this woman!  She needs a hand  making a career transition elsewhere, so let's all help her.  OK?",3.0
"I was visiting Coney island and was looking forward to eating pizza at Totonno's after reading reviews. So we enter the small establishment and sit down. The waitress asks what we wanted to drink.

I really don't get it. You can't make a small , but you can make a large. We couldn't eat a large so we paid for our drinks and left.  i still don't get it. You can make a large , but not a small.",1.0
I came across a television special on pizza and it's history in New York. The owner of Totonno's said in passing that his coal-fired oven reaches 900 degrees in order to cook his pizza which takes an average of 3 minutes to cook. 900 degrees! You can melt aluminum and then some at that temperature. A true master at work. Pies come piping hot to your table so let it cool off before jumping in. Crispy crust and very good old Brooklyn-style pie. He uses the freshest hand cut mozzarella and a very savory pizza sauce.,4.0
"We found ourselves heading towards Coney Island after trekking through Brooklyn all day and found a great opportunity to grab a pie at Totonno's.  Something that I've wanted to do for years.  Fortunately for me, there was no line.  I ordered a plain pie for $20 and waited around 15 minutes.  Judging a book by it's cover, Totonno's looked like an average gourmet (Brooklyn style, I guess) pie.  After taking my first bite, I fell in love with the crust.  It was dry, crispy, and ultra thin.  The cheese pie was ok, but next time I'll have it with toppings.  That sould push my rating to 5 stars.",4.0

"Yes, it is excellent pizza. Crust - great char, thin and tasty. Sauce - perfect combination of whatever is in it that works nicely with the cheese.

If it had just been about the time, I'd have been ok, but I watched as several pick-ups went out the door, people(apparent regulars) who walked in AFTER us got served before us and no attention was paid to us outside of taking an initial drink or pizza order.

"Great pizza, but no soda fountain or ice. Only serves bottles of soda and small 8 ounce bottles at that. While the pizza is fantastic, I felt it was a little small and overpriced. Off the beaten path, and several blocks from the beach. If you want traditional NY pizza, skip this place. If you want more traditional Italian ( Naples ) style, this might be the place for you.

"I had to wait an hour and a half to get my pizza here. Was it worth the wait? I'm not sure. But it was certainly among the best pizza I've ever had in my life.I hear that this is the only charcoal pizza place left in New York. Charcoal pizza is a different taste. The crust is a little cripser and tastes a little black around the edges. This makes the crust on the edge probably the pizza's biggest weakness. It's not bad, but you'll find that pieces of uneaten crust start piling up on your plate.They use fresh mozzarella, always a plus, and it does not cover the whole slice. The sauce is tasty and they also use it sparingly. This is not a typical pizza strategy. It makes for a crispy, light taste. It also makes the pizza less filling (I ate at least 7 slices). But it's a different taste and definitely a good one.The toppings are good. I tried cheese, pepperoni, sausage and onion (all seperately). I am not a fan of pepperoni on pizza. Normally, it makes the pizza too greasy and the taste is overpowering. This is probably the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had. The pepperoni is sliced thinly and crisps just a little too make a more subtle taste. The sausage was juicy and real italian sausage. The onions were red onions heaped on and cooked to a nice texture-- mostly soft with a little bite.The drinks are served in tiny bottles and are relatively expensive for their size. The service is a little grumpy, but not to the point of being annoying.The location is ""charming,"" but the booths are small and the chairs are uncomfortable, making you sit up straight.All these drawbacks aside, the pizza is one of a kind and delicious.

"Totonno's pizza is a type of pizza that when you first taste it, you think ""Okay, this is good pizza"" and wont come back until like the next 6 months.  Then when you come back, you constantly crave it and start appreciating it for what it is.  The store is located in the middle of Neptune Ave.  I can never find the place immediately - there is no frills or thrills kind of sign, no color.  Just the name ""Totonno's"" on the sign.  The inside is raw!

I did have a hot slice when it first came out, and while it was very good, I can't say I would suggest it as a destination, unless you're already planning to go to Coney.

"You haven't had pizza until you've been to Totonno's in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Sure, the Manhattan versions of this restaurant are well and good, but the atmosphere out on Neptune Avenue and the fact that this is the original restaurant (opened in 1924), make it just a little bit more special. If it's your first visit, I suggest ordering a plain pie to begin - creamy mozzarella, tomato sauce that you want to inhale and a crisp, yet chewy, yet completely fantastic crust. Pick up a pie to go and take it down to the boardwalk, or stay at the restaurant and eat off of  your plastic plates and drink from your plastic cups and soak up the local scene.

It is good pizza but not great pizza. Fresh ingredients and a well made crust. It is close to Coney Island and seating is available. The pizza tastes good but I wouldn't go crazy to travel here.,3.0
"Got there at 7:40 pm - they close at 8pm and she would only let us get a pizza to go. So, heed others' advice and don't get there later than 30 minutes before they close if you want to eat in the restaurant, which I recommend, because by the time we walked to a bench on the  boardwalk, the pizza was cold. I did have a hot slice when it first came out, and while it was very good, I can't say I would suggest it as a destination, unless you're already planning to go to Coney. But definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. The sauce was a little sweet for my taste - but fresh and good. .",3.0
"so my friends were visiting from D.C. and obsessing about trying this place--""we've seen it on the food network, it looks amazing we have to go,"" so i obliged since they were visiting. well, after a little more than an hour on the N train we arrive at this pizzeria---we order 3 pies, 1 large pie xtra cheese, 1 large pie xtra chees and pepperoni and 1 large white pie xtra cheese half sausage.so after devouring all of these pies (it may sound like a lot but its not heavy pizza, also there was a lot of drinking the night before--so this was just the hangover munchies), but i digress. anyway, we concluded that the only way to eat this pizza was to have a topping, because without a topping there was absolutely no flavor. this place gets a 2 b/c to me, a truly good pizza doesn't need any toppings--and this did, it was the only way that it had flavor. in short, if you want to try this spot--go to one of the locations in manhattan unless you live within walking distance of this one, otherwise it's not worth it.",2.0
"You haven't had pizza until you've been to Totonno's in Coney Island, Brooklyn. Sure, the Manhattan versions of this restaurant are well and good, but the atmosphere out on Neptune Avenue and the fact that this is the original restaurant (opened in 1924), make it just a little bit more special. If it's your first visit, I suggest ordering a plain pie to begin - creamy mozzarella, tomato sauce that you want to inhale and a crisp, yet chewy, yet completely fantastic crust. Pick up a pie to go and take it down to the boardwalk, or stay at the restaurant and eat off of  your plastic plates and drink from your plastic cups and soak up the local scene. Well worth a long ride on the B train!",5.0
"Ah Totonno, Totonno, Totonno...having lived in the Coney Island area for years this was one major benefit which almost entirely made up for being so far away from everything. I was devastated when I heard about the fire. This weekend I went back and was so glad to see that the fire wasn't a total loss. The place looks almost exactly the same except for the fresh coat of ecru paint (used to be white). All the pictures and news articles still on the wall and dare I say it, Cookie seemed a bit happier now that she's back in business. The pies are just as good as ever. Some of the best in NYC, and I know my pizza. If you like thin crust, then this is the place for you. I'm a traditionalist...I like my pie's either plain or with garlic. you don't want to go heavy on toppings because the crust is thin. For some reason, I always MUST have a beer when eating a Totonno's pie - Brooklyn Lager or IPA. Life doesn't get much better than that!",5.0
"believe the hype.everything about the pizza is AMAZING. the cheese is fresh, the sauce was light but flavorful, and the crust was unique in a good way. the price is a little high but you have to consider the quality of the ingredients; its a fair price guys! fyi, if you come here you MUST get the pie with pepperoni, its HANDS DOWN, the best  pepperoni ive ever tasted.PS only pies, no slices.",5.0

"I give Totonno's three stars because after reading all the reviews, I realize that taste, especially regarding food, is individual. To my palette, the pizza at Totonno's is five stars. To one guy, ""bawn an rayzed in Brooklyn, "" it only rated one star, ""onnaconna the lines usta be aroun da block but dere wuz only too guyz dere when i waz dere and da ol guy passed an it went downhill frum dere. Now a slice tastes like a POS."" I doubt that a slice tastes like a POS but I'm sure the guy who said so is an expert in that area. I always liked Totonno's because of the pizza and attitude that went with it. Everyone should go there at least once and come to their own conclusion. But, how do you say, fageddabowdit, it's homemade sauce, dough, and rancid attitude that melts my heart. Hey, I shudda given it five stars, but I fahgodabowdit.",3.0
"Ok, I confess, I like the fact that I'm now a local and get treated like royalty when I come in.  It took years and a changed zip code to earn that.  But all in all, I come here for the pies.  Beautiful simple fresh ingredients, perfect crust, old-school charm.  Yes, they march to the beat of their own drummer, but with pies like that?  Who cares?  Just keep 'em coming....",5.0
"True pizza connoisseurs will love this place.  Its genuine pizza made the old fashion way.  Don't bother w/the Totonno's in the city, this is the one and only true deal!  Its far for all the city folk, but my parents live just one train stop away!  But it is REALLY well worth it to travel that far.  They are only open Wednesdays to Sundays, so be sure you go @ the right time.  I don't remember them ever being busy either.  But w/the cyclones close by now, I'm sure before and after ever game, they must have a HUGE line blocks long.  A small will feed 2 ppl who aren't that hungry, so I'd get a large!  Also, I wouldn't save some for later, this is the type you must scarf down while its hot and piping fresh!",5.0

"I am a big fan of pizza and Totonno is one of my favorite places in South Brooklyn, right on the same page with Di Fara.  I am not going to discuss particular merits of Di Fara versus Totonno slice, because I love them both and each place has its charm.  Totonno's is bare bones decor, but it does have a few sit-down tables which get filled very fast on the weekends.  We have never had a problem with a service because I walk into any place not really expecting much and not acting like I am the center of the universe and 99.99% of the time, I get good service and awesome food.  Totonno's pies are thin crust, properly charred, with an amazing sauce and cheese.  I can probably eat half a pie myself.  The only problem is, the place is still closed after the fire.",5.0
