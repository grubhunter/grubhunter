"The atmosphere and the food were both great. We were wandering around the hood after hearing there was a 1.5 hour wait for brunch somewhere else. This is NY. I am not waiting over an hour to sit down for brunch. We wandered into this place and got a spot at the bar even with them busy. I had the lobster bisque and caesar salad. I will say those potato pancakes are very good. Service was pleasant, the cooks even said hi from the bar, and the food was good. What else can you as for on a weekend day?",5.0
"Have been here twice since they opened and am so thrilled to have a new spot for dinner dates. Great vibe, service & cocktails. The Texas Daisy is my new go-to, can they make that everywhere?They have a $65 tasting menu, which looks stellar. As a vegetarian I had asked if they would be able to accommodate. They said they would speak with the chef, and when we arrived for our reservation that night, the chef made a point to come to our table and explain that he didn't feel he would be providing us the full value of the tasting menu without the meat/fish components. I appreciated him being candid and up front with us. They did indicate that in a few months in the Spring/Summer once they have been up and running a little longer they would be able to do so, and I am looking forward to taking them up on it!The food is fantastic and full of robust flavor. The brussel sprouts are one of my all-time favorites, perfectly crisped and rounded out with creamy tahini and raisins to balance out the bitter, also a HUGE serving for a side. Could be a meal in themselves. The mushroom pici pasta has a rich earthy flavor with just enough truffle topped with delicious crispy breadcrumbs. My husband loved his Pork Spare Ribs, said they were cooked to perfection and were literally the best he had ever had. Great place for a cocktail and bar snacks, or a full meal. Can't wait to go back, a perfect addition to the neighborhood!",4.0
"Love, love, love this place! Can I give them the 6 ""stars"" they deserve? The chef and cooks know what they are doing here! The owners know how to make the customers pleased and content with happy bellies. I have had the scallops twice now, 2 different styles and both are amazing. Desserts are always delish- esp the tres leches! The banana caramel cake is on point. The seating at the kitchen bar is really cool and I would love to come back to have my next dinner there- hopefully the lamb dish and mushroom pasta, pici.",5.0
"Must. Get. Brussels. Sprouts!! Great place that is just about an 8 minute walk from Barclays center. We went during happy hour and they had some great options like $10 burgers, $1 house made chips and $6 drink specials. About four of us sat at the bar and had cocktails and bar food. Everything was delicious...the stand out was BY FAR the Brussels! So crispy and unexpectedly splendid! The bartender was nice - the bar is heavy on the whiskey, bourbon, and offers limits vodka drinks-but he made a mean martini! Will definitely come back here.",3.0
Came here with my parents to wash our previous meal down with some drinks. This review should be kept simple because it was simply a great time. Everything I loved:1. A great happy hour (good prices)2. Great friendly staff (like their service is impeccable they are so sweet and professional and great with recommending things)3. Beautiful ambience so intimate and a bit quaint4. Drinks are amazingggg This is the type of place you're glad you found and will be even happier to return to. Waiting to see Noah again (he's such an entertaining bartender). My pekoe punch was so refreshing.,5.0
Other then  the pork torchon and may be the pancakes nothing worth exploring on that menu. Not to mention having to deal with pretentious staff,3.0
"Although I haven't tried their tasting menu, I finally got to try Prospect's wagyu burger! (On their Monday burger night, of course.) For $8, it comes with lettuce and tomato, and you can add cheese, pickles, caramelized onions, various sauces for $1-2 each and even chicken liver mousse ($3). Sadly it doesn't come with fries, but I ordered them as a side and they were absolutely perfect. I believe Prospect recently decided to offer their entire menu on Mondays, and not just the burger.I came with some friends around 8pm and the restaurant was completely packed and VERY loud. Fortunately, we grabbed tables outside and enjoyed the balmy air and our juicy burgers in peace. My only criticism is that the burger meat drips through the brioche bun and makes it a really messy experience. Service was friendly, and our water glasses were always filled.The waitress told us that someone used to get a bunch of burgers and feed them to HIS DOGS. I'm now sure that being a dog in Fort Greene is how you live your best life.",4.0
"Habana Outpost next door was packed and didn't want to walk too far, so ended up here for a nice quiet dinner. Dark and classy on the inside but opted for the outdoor seating (a few small tables).Waitress was very nice and went through a lot of the menu items. Decided to not spend a king's ransom on food, so settled on sharing the mussels ($21) and pairing with a beer ($7). Food came out about 20 minutes later with a large pile of mussels swimming in a coconut curry sauce along with two toasted bread wedges. Sauce really made the whole meal, which was great to scoop up with the shells or soak with the bread. Satisfying. A lot of the main items here are expensive, but a good selection for happy hour.",4.0

"Such a cute place! I love when I accidentally find good places, with no planing and with no great expectations. Me and my friend entered prospect based on reviews we read on my Yelp, and I want to tell you that this place really worth the reputation. From the cocktails, through the clean bathrooms (where you can write on the wall) to their no less than amazing green chicken. I'm just happy I found this place.The people who work here are very friendly, and they made me feel that they are honestly trying to help, and help us find the right dish for us. So for me it is the green chicken. I suggest you try it as well ;)",5.0

"Prospect! The second establishment in Brooklyn with that monkier to open up within the past few years. Yet neither of which are in Prospect Heights. Such a shame. Prospect offers the best high end dinning experience in Fort Greene in my opinion. And that says a lot. They offer top quality dishes with the best ingredients. Everytime I have eaten here I had a wonderful experience. The menu changes. And changes a lot, which I appreciate. I've had/tried several different dishes here. The ones that stand out are the bass (No treble) and their foie gras. Nothing I ever ate ever disappointed me. So why 4 stars? I've came here for drinks once and was not been pleased.

As a result I was three cocktails and two beers in without the slightest of buzz. At this point I figured I should head elsewhere. At that time I was handed my bill, which of course was taxed. Of course it was! Now I don't know if my bartender had done this intentionally, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and still tipped well.

"Because things change. (copyright Atif I.)Ten years into its existence, recency of feedback is the true value proposition of yelp - superseding the ""Real People. Real Reviews"" tagline that created differentiation at a time when Citysearch (remember them??) was the main source of user contributed reviews, for it was easier to trust someone with a real name and a real picture. But, with passage of time current reviews are more relevant and trump the flowery prose from the famous food critic when the restaurant was (initially) reviewed. Nowhere has this been more apparent to me than at Prospect, which I first visited in May after reading the 2013 NY Times review that raved about its desserts (""neither an afterthought nor a tangent""). It thus surprised me no end that Prospect only had 2 desserts, a number now down to just 1 (boring Tres Leches cake). Clearly the pastry chef has left the restaurant, as has the chef de cuisine, and in the Times' defense: how can one guard against such an event? It can't. Consequently, the quantum of reviews capturing the current reality provide yelp with an insurmountable advantage - even as food critics, bloggers, and restaurant owners delight in trashing review quality at yelp. However, all that readers of yelp reviews need to figure out is: what to take away from whose review, and those data points will trump professional food critics' ability to offer wisdom such as: ""walnut paste darkened with cocoa and coffee gives the carrots a brooding, bittersweet depth""... Despite the changes in the kitchen, it would be unfair to not recognize the merits of Prospect and their current staff.  Of the dishes I've eaten, the few that accentuate Asian influences have been bold and exhibited intense flavors. On my first visit I loved the lemongrass coconut broth that livened up the flawlessly executed skate. On a recent visit, the special of the day was an appetizer: striped bass belly that was accompanied by soy drenched fried rice and nuoc chom sauce. Both of these dishes merited 5 stars. At the same time, it's also fair to note that many dishes on the changing menu have failed to excite - including the housemade fettucine (Bottarga, Bonito Flakes, Lemon Beurre Blanc), the Green circle chicken (one version with roasted potatoes, kale, asparagus, and roasted garlic, and another with Freekeh, mushrooms and pureed carrots), and most regular starters and sides.Beyond the paucity of desserts (reflecting a surprising level of disregard), I don't believe I've been as vexed by a restaurant's menu as at Prospect. While, the management's intent is to ensure menu freshness through a steady rotation of dishes (other than regulars like chicken liver mousse, deviled eggs, truffle fries, etc.), and at the same time have something for everyone - the 5 entrees feature 1 dish each that is vegetarian, chicken, pork, and 2 that are fish - I've often stood outside the door wondering whether the menu changes are merely cosmetic as opposed to providing any real differentiation. Accordingly, I would recommend prospective diners to ignore the menu and instead place their trust in the kitchen by requesting the tasting menu at $ 65pp, and sit at the chef's counter. In spite of 4 visits in the past 4 months, I've yet to like a cocktail, other than the visually arresting ""In it to Nguyen it"" (Plymouth gin, keffir lime & lemongrass simple syrup, lemon juice, basil, Togarashi salt), and so I worry that the price points and menu limitations will get in the way of the outsized ambitions of the restaurant for this stretch of Fulton Street. Here's hoping the name of the cocktail is reflective of the spirit of the owners and the kitchen. (3.5 stars)",3.0
"I'm definitely a fan of this neighborhood joint. I've been here a few times, and although once I had extra salty fries, (and it was immediately taken off the check mind you) I've had nothing but good food here. I'd say it's low-key enough for a date, and the bar is super chill. I personally like Burger Mondays because their burger is really good and it justifies my ordering of it. :) I continue to go back here, and it's nice to see someone stick in this spot for awhile. Happy Hour is also good - the wine there has never disappointed me.",4.0
"First time visit for weekend lunch and I will happily return.  The space is nice - sort of clean vintage design.  Service is friendly and efficient.  We started with the truffled deviled eggs just because they sounded great. Truth be told I didn't taste a lot of truffle but they were delicious nonetheless.  Virgin Mary was a little thick but I watered it down and that did the trick. It was nice and spicy, and topped with a delicious green olive.  I'm not sure that a burger is the best way to judge a new restaurant but that's what I was in the mood for and I would happily go back for this burger again.  It arrived cooked medium rare as requested, on a nice brioche bun, with lettuce, tomato and cheddar cheese.   It was so delicious we asked what the secret was and were told they use Sambal (pretty sure that was it!) and capers in the ground beef. Yum.  I substituted a salad for the rosemary garlic fries - burger came with a small but perfectly dressed Caesar salad.  I will happily return for a full meal. The dinner menu looks varied and interesting and definitely worth a return visit.",4.0
"I love everything about Prospect. I've had the good fortune to dine here many a time, and each experience has been better than the last. Their menu changes frequently, and although it's never particularly long, they appreciate the value of variety. Speaking simply of the proteins, I've had the pleasure of inhaling octopus, sweetbreads, beef, foie gras, scallops, quail, duck, lobster and more. Each and every dish has been gorgeously presented, expertly cooked, and unfailingly interesting. Not to mention, completely devoured by me and anyone I care to bring along. The sheer talent of the kitchen is evident in every bite, and their specific genius is in the deft balance of so many different ingredients in combinations that would never occur to us mere mortals. Of particular note is that accompaniments are never an afterthought; when baby brussel sprouts and charred onions are even more desirable than the dry-aged sirloin on the same plate, you know there is some sort of wizardry afoot. To be sure, vegetables do not take a back seat here. Don't sleep on the sides; the crispy cauliflower is salty, garlicky perfection, and if fries strike your fancy, they are rarely this well-done. The market vegetable plate changes daily but is always an herbivore's dream. The baby beet salad is stunning, and when in season, the burratta and heirloom tomato salad is absolutely breathtaking. (Yes, I'm talking about food here, and I regret nothing.)To be fair, such talent has its price. No one I know can afford to dine here every night, but meals this good should be reserved for the right occasion anyway. After all, Prospect is unabashedly using the best ingredients available, and believe me when I say that this is food worth paying for. As I delude myself more and more into thinking I know what I'm doing in my own kitchen, I become that much more impressed with restaurants that can offer me meals that I could never hope to duplicate. Chef Kyle McClelland is simply on another level.It might be easier to avoid returning to Prospect over and over if the dining room wasn't so inviting, if the service wasn't excellent, if their barrel-aged cocktails weren't so tempting, and if it wasn't within walking distance. Unfortunately for my desire to try new restaurants as often as possible, I haven't found faults as of yet. (I suppose if I have any complaints at all, it would be that the lobster cappuccino that I was once fortunate enough to taste has never made another appearance on the menu.)As it is, this is beautiful food served in a comfortable atmosphere, and you'll find me there again and again. I'm definitely not sad about it. Go here, and you won't be either.",5.0
"Perfect place for an after work drink with a friend. Great ambiance, good food and drinks. My friend and I found this place by chance. We had planned to go to No.7 one block away from Prospect, but as soon as we got there we realized the place was too noisy for us. We decided to walk down Fulton and scout for a better place. We found Prospect, a really nice place (unpretentious), we sat at the bar for that casual feel and the bartender was very attentive and friendly. Helped provide more information with a number of items on the menu. We used their snacks and starters menu to make it a tapas dinner. The food was ""delish"", mouth watering. We shared the deviled eggs, avocado & toast and yummy oysters. Glad I found this place, I will be going back again!",4.0
"KenScale: 8.0/10Prospect is a New American restaurant in Fort Greene run by Alan Cooper and Stephen Cohen along with chef Kyle McClelland. I visited this restaurant only because it seemed like one of the few viable pre-theater options near Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) (I was planning on going to watch The Nutcracker performance). Overall, however, I had a very solid dinner. Prospect would be another evidence that Brooklyn is not just a second fiddle to Manhattan in the New York City dining scenery.Market vegetable plate was very well cooked, while charred octopus with various vegetables and potato was also very tender, although the seasoning could've been slightly toned down. I also enjoyed black bass, which was well cooked and worked harmoniously with confit razor clams and roasted fennel. Colorado lamb with vegetables and mushrooms was also very solid, with very tender meat. For dessert, I had Burgundy & Blue (which consists of Italian giner spice cake, lemon mousse, poached pears, and Valdeon gelato).

"I had a lovely dinner here yesterday evening.  Though the restaurant was scheduled to close at 10pm we were graciously seated and invited to order at 9:45pm.  Our waitress was attentive and well versed in the menu and gave us some useful background on the entrees and wine selection.  We shared the truffled deviled eggs, gnocchi with lamb ragu (absolute best ragu I've had) and the chicken in red curry sauce.  Everything was made perfectly and the portion sizes were just right.The ambiance is an urban rustic feel with an open kitchen and bar aligning the rear and side walls.  Great use of space, it feels both intimate and communal.I would give 5 stars, but we felt the menu was just a bit limited and would have liked to see a bit more selection.  But definitely a place I'd visit again.",4.0
"Because things change. (copyright Atif I.)Ten years into its existence, recency of feedback is the true value proposition of yelp - superseding the ""Real People. Real Reviews"" tagline that created differentiation at a time when Citysearch (remember them??) was the main source of user contributed reviews, for it was easier to trust someone with a real name and a real picture. But, with passage of time current reviews are more relevant and trump the flowery prose from the famous food critic when the restaurant was (initially) reviewed. Nowhere has this been more apparent to me than at Prospect, which I first visited in May after reading the 2013 NY Times review that raved about its desserts (""neither an afterthought nor a tangent""). It thus surprised me no end that Prospect only had 2 desserts, a number now down to just 1 (boring Tres Leches cake). Clearly the pastry chef has left the restaurant, as has the chef de cuisine, and in the Times' defense: how can one guard against such an event? It can't. Consequently, the quantum of reviews capturing the current reality provide yelp with an insurmountable advantage - even as food critics, bloggers, and restaurant owners delight in trashing review quality at yelp. However, all that readers of yelp reviews need to figure out is: what to take away from whose review, and those data points will trump professional food critics' ability to offer wisdom such as: ""walnut paste darkened with cocoa and coffee gives the carrots a brooding, bittersweet depth""... Despite the changes in the kitchen, it would be unfair to not recognize the merits of Prospect and their current staff.  Of the dishes I've eaten, the few that accentuate Asian influences have been bold and exhibited intense flavors. On my first visit I loved the lemongrass coconut broth that livened up the flawlessly executed skate. On a recent visit, the special of the day was an appetizer: striped bass belly that was accompanied by soy drenched fried rice and nuoc chom sauce. Both of these dishes merited 5 stars. At the same time, it's also fair to note that many dishes on the changing menu have failed to excite - including the housemade fettucine (Bottarga, Bonito Flakes, Lemon Beurre Blanc), the Green circle chicken (one version with roasted potatoes, kale, asparagus, and roasted garlic, and another with Freekeh, mushrooms and pureed carrots), and most regular starters and sides.Beyond the paucity of desserts (reflecting a surprising level of disregard), I don't believe I've been as vexed by a restaurant's menu as at Prospect. While, the management's intent is to ensure menu freshness through a steady rotation of dishes (other than regulars like chicken liver mousse, deviled eggs, truffle fries, etc.), and at the same time have something for everyone - the 5 entrees feature 1 dish each that is vegetarian, chicken, pork, and 2 that are fish - I've often stood outside the door wondering whether the menu changes are merely cosmetic as opposed to providing any real differentiation. Accordingly, I would recommend prospective diners to ignore the menu and instead place their trust in the kitchen by requesting the tasting menu at $ 65pp, and sit at the chef's counter. In spite of 4 visits in the past 4 months, I've yet to like a cocktail, other than the visually arresting ""In it to Nguyen it"" (Plymouth gin, keffir lime & lemongrass simple syrup, lemon juice, basil, Togarashi salt), and so I worry that the price points and menu limitations will get in the way of the outsized ambitions of the restaurant for this stretch of Fulton Street. Here's hoping the name of the cocktail is reflective of the spirit of the owners and the kitchen. (3.5 stars)",3.0
"I'm definitely a fan of this neighborhood joint. I've been here a few times, and although once I had extra salty fries, (and it was immediately taken off the check mind you) I've had nothing but good food here. I'd say it's low-key enough for a date, and the bar is super chill. I personally like Burger Mondays because their burger is really good and it justifies my ordering of it. :) I continue to go back here, and it's nice to see someone stick in this spot for awhile. Happy Hour is also good - the wine there has never disappointed me.",4.0
"First time visit for weekend lunch and I will happily return.  The space is nice - sort of clean vintage design.  Service is friendly and efficient.  We started with the truffled deviled eggs just because they sounded great. Truth be told I didn't taste a lot of truffle but they were delicious nonetheless.  Virgin Mary was a little thick but I watered it down and that did the trick. It was nice and spicy, and topped with a delicious green olive.  I'm not sure that a burger is the best way to judge a new restaurant but that's what I was in the mood for and I would happily go back for this burger again.  It arrived cooked medium rare as requested, on a nice brioche bun, with lettuce, tomato and cheddar cheese.   It was so delicious we asked what the secret was and were told they use Sambal (pretty sure that was it!) and capers in the ground beef. Yum.  I substituted a salad for the rosemary garlic fries - burger came with a small but perfectly dressed Caesar salad.  I will happily return for a full meal. The dinner menu looks varied and interesting and definitely worth a return visit.",4.0
"I love everything about Prospect. I've had the good fortune to dine here many a time, and each experience has been better than the last. Their menu changes frequently, and although it's never particularly long, they appreciate the value of variety. Speaking simply of the proteins, I've had the pleasure of inhaling octopus, sweetbreads, beef, foie gras, scallops, quail, duck, lobster and more. Each and every dish has been gorgeously presented, expertly cooked, and unfailingly interesting. Not to mention, completely devoured by me and anyone I care to bring along. The sheer talent of the kitchen is evident in every bite, and their specific genius is in the deft balance of so many different ingredients in combinations that would never occur to us mere mortals. Of particular note is that accompaniments are never an afterthought; when baby brussel sprouts and charred onions are even more desirable than the dry-aged sirloin on the same plate, you know there is some sort of wizardry afoot. To be sure, vegetables do not take a back seat here. Don't sleep on the sides; the crispy cauliflower is salty, garlicky perfection, and if fries strike your fancy, they are rarely this well-done. The market vegetable plate changes daily but is always an herbivore's dream. The baby beet salad is stunning, and when in season, the burratta and heirloom tomato salad is absolutely breathtaking. (Yes, I'm talking about food here, and I regret nothing.)To be fair, such talent has its price. No one I know can afford to dine here every night, but meals this good should be reserved for the right occasion anyway. After all, Prospect is unabashedly using the best ingredients available, and believe me when I say that this is food worth paying for. As I delude myself more and more into thinking I know what I'm doing in my own kitchen, I become that much more impressed with restaurants that can offer me meals that I could never hope to duplicate. Chef Kyle McClelland is simply on another level.It might be easier to avoid returning to Prospect over and over if the dining room wasn't so inviting, if the service wasn't excellent, if their barrel-aged cocktails weren't so tempting, and if it wasn't within walking distance. Unfortunately for my desire to try new restaurants as often as possible, I haven't found faults as of yet. (I suppose if I have any complaints at all, it would be that the lobster cappuccino that I was once fortunate enough to taste has never made another appearance on the menu.)As it is, this is beautiful food served in a comfortable atmosphere, and you'll find me there again and again. I'm definitely not sad about it. Go here, and you won't be either.",5.0
"Perfect place for an after work drink with a friend. Great ambiance, good food and drinks. My friend and I found this place by chance. We had planned to go to No.7 one block away from Prospect, but as soon as we got there we realized the place was too noisy for us. We decided to walk down Fulton and scout for a better place. We found Prospect, a really nice place (unpretentious), we sat at the bar for that casual feel and the bartender was very attentive and friendly. Helped provide more information with a number of items on the menu. We used their snacks and starters menu to make it a tapas dinner. The food was ""delish"", mouth watering. We shared the deviled eggs, avocado & toast and yummy oysters. Glad I found this place, I will be going back again!",4.0
"KenScale: 8.0/10Prospect is a New American restaurant in Fort Greene run by Alan Cooper and Stephen Cohen along with chef Kyle McClelland. I visited this restaurant only because it seemed like one of the few viable pre-theater options near Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) (I was planning on going to watch The Nutcracker performance). Overall, however, I had a very solid dinner. Prospect would be another evidence that Brooklyn is not just a second fiddle to Manhattan in the New York City dining scenery.Market vegetable plate was very well cooked, while charred octopus with various vegetables and potato was also very tender, although the seasoning could've been slightly toned down. I also enjoyed black bass, which was well cooked and worked harmoniously with confit razor clams and roasted fennel. Colorado lamb with vegetables and mushrooms was also very solid, with very tender meat. For dessert, I had Burgundy & Blue (which consists of Italian giner spice cake, lemon mousse, poached pears, and Valdeon gelato). I loved the texture of pears working with other elements to create a well-executed dish.The restaurant has a relatively small space, and has the vibe typical of a neighborhood restaurant in Brooklyn (casual and lively).

"Celebrated our 4-year anniversary/engagement with dinner here. I had been dying to go since even before it opened as Chef Vinson's Chopped win was one of my favorite things ever.  We made a reservation and sat outside. Our server was very friendly and the restaurant had a nice ambiance. It was a very enjoyable dinner but I'm a little torn on the food. It was adequately delicious, but perhaps my expectations were too high...yet I can't blame myself on this one. First, they were out of the appetizer we really wanted (it was either the pork belly or foie gras) so we got some oysters. Nbd, i love oysters. We had 2 kinds, one of which was great, the other we didn't love. Then B had a pork chop, I think, and I got the lobster, after our server told me it was life-changing. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The 1.5-lb fresh lobster I had in Belize earlier this summer was life-changing. This was good, with lots of truffles, but without that OMG-I-could-die-happy-now something special. My meal was also an almost comically tiny portion. We were also psyched for the heirloom carrots side, but they were out of that too, and iinstead of asking us what we might like instead, they brought us roasted asparagus which I love but can make just as well at home. The menu is already small enough that running out of multiple things is extremely limiting. Vinson kept running in and out of the restaurant looking stressed. Finally we waited so long to pay our bill that B had to bring it inside. I feel like there is the prospect of greatness here but it is yet to be realized.",3.0
"My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner; we really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back, but it is a bit spendy so maybe not right away.Thoughts: the New Amsterdam cocktail tasted really, really good. The Merlot tasted... red.

"I'm almost tempted to go to 5 stars since we had a great night there but the price is a little steep for me to go there yet--I want to come back and try their Monday night burger-and-beer special, that might push me to 5.  In any case, we had a great dinner here recently.  I was able to make a last-minute reservation around 8:30 pm and I'm glad I did because Prospect was still pretty busy, even at that hour.  Our waiter was awesome--just the right amount of friendly and informative without being pushy or overbearing.  I ordered something with grilled scallops, polenta, roasted sunchokes and oxtail and it was amazing. I thought it would a somewhat weird combination but the flavors worked together perfectly.  My date ordered something with suckling pig and Brussels sprouts and I was pretty envious of his plate too, although I think I made the right choice.  We also got a side of truffle fries which were good.  I will say that I was worried Prospect would be quite pricey but honestly they have plenty of entries in the low $20s, which I consider a pretty good deal for the high-end level of food and service.  After living in FG for almost two years I'm not sure why it took so long to try Prospect but I'll definitely be back!",4.0
"I want the reviews about this place and I had a lot of expectations based on the reviews. We were unable to be seated for dinner because they were busy on a Sunday night so we decided to sit at the bar which was fine. The woman behind the bar was not attentive to me and my party but she was attentive to one particular party across the way. My meal here was expensive and not do that memorable or delicious.  I don't mind expensive if I felt I got a great meal.I had the grilled octopus and my friend had the Foie Gras (I guess came with the duck). The duck made uo majority of the plate, & the duck was salty. Duck is always tricky, not many can make a tasty non salty duck. Anyway, the grilled octopus was okay.For the main meal my friend had the black sea bass which smelled fishy and also tasted fishy (that's not a good thing for fish). My friend ordered it & he decided to keep eating it, if that was my meal I honestly would have sent it back.I had the suckling pig which wasn't as delicious as I expected.  It was a bit dry. I had suckling pig at a Filipino place, now that was one bad a $$ suckling pig..delish. There was nothing I wanted to eat on the dessert menu.Overall not a meal I would recommend especially for the price there are many other places to eat for less with better food.",2.0

"Celebrated our 4-year anniversary/engagement with dinner here. I had been dying to go since even before it opened as Chef Vinson's Chopped win was one of my favorite things ever.  We made a reservation and sat outside. Our server was very friendly and the restaurant had a nice ambiance. It was a very enjoyable dinner but I'm a little torn on the food. It was adequately delicious, but perhaps my expectations were too high...yet I can't blame myself on this one. First, they were out of the appetizer we really wanted (it was either the pork belly or foie gras) so we got some oysters. Nbd, i love oysters. We had 2 kinds, one of which was great, the other we didn't love. Then B had a pork chop, I think, and I got the lobster, after our server told me it was life-changing. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The 1.5-lb fresh lobster I had in Belize earlier this summer was life-changing. This was good, with lots of truffles, but without that OMG-I-could-die-happy-now something special. My meal was also an almost comically tiny portion. We were also psyched for the heirloom carrots side, but they were out of that too, and iinstead of asking us what we might like instead, they brought us roasted asparagus which I love but can make just as well at home. The menu is already small enough that running out of multiple things is extremely limiting. Vinson kept running in and out of the restaurant looking stressed. Finally we waited so long to pay our bill that B had to bring it inside. I feel like there is the prospect of greatness here but it is yet to be realized.",3.0

"After an incredibly disappointing meal in Manhattan the night before, on Saturday we decided to eat before the Nets game in Brooklyn.  Prospect had only been getting good reviews, and we decided to check it out for ourselves.  Arriving at 6:45, the place was hopping, but fortunately there were two seats at the bar which we happily took.  With an hour to eat before we had to run to the game, we didn't have much time.  When we mentioned this to the staff they said they'd get us our food quickly, and they did.  So, I'm giving this place 4.5 stars.  (I'll bump it to a 5 after I eat there again and after they improve their desserts)What did I like?The Food.  Mostly excellent, with only one dish that I thought was a miss.Snow Crab Salad - Outstanding!Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras - Outstanding & InterestingOctopus - Very tastyLobster Rolls - Where am I, Maine?  Yum, yum, yum.The Drinks.They have a great beer selection.Try the Sixpoint Sweet Action if you like IPA's.Try the Founders Breakfast Stout if if you like the dark stuff.Lots of good mixed drinks too.  They make a mean old fashioned.  But the star in my opinion was the graceful exit.The Staff.Everyone from the Owner, to the bartenders, to the chef was very friendly.  The place looks like it could be hipster/pretentious, but the people were the complete opposite.  The Place.Great job transforming this space into a beautiful restaurant.  I'd visited the previous restaurant, which was horrible, and it was pretty awesome to see what the new owners came up with.Yes, this place is not cheap, but then again neither is New York.  If you are going to the Barclays Center, or to BAM, or just want to check out Fort Greene, you won't go wrong making this a stop before or after any of the above.When th weather warms up their outdoor tables are going to be primo too.  I can't wait for my next trip back.",5.0

"This should actually be 3.5 stars. We went for the first time on Thursday evening. When we arrived, most of the tables were occupied, which was a good sign. We opted to sit at the chef's table. We ordered a Negroni and a My Little Huckleberry. Both cocktails were delicious .To start we had the escargots and the sous vide egg. Presentation of both dishes was beautiful.

The sous vide egg is served on a bed of wonderfully crunchy potato hash, with Serrano ham and spinach puree. Both were scrumptious but something in one of the dishes made both our mouths and lips itch. Very weird, but that didn't stop us from cleaning our plates.

He said we looked adventurous, so...Main dishes: skate cheeks and dry-aged sirloin. With the sirloin came the first ""miss"" of the evening. It was WAY over-salted. But my dining companion is a very good eater -- member of the clean-plate club -- and he didn't want to complain. I didn't really care for the sirloin, but we actually ate about two-thirds of it. So I didn't feel it was right to complain/comment on the saltiness.

"We have never seen more itsy bitsy portions at not so itsy bitsy prices and we have been to a few upscale spots around they city.  Lovely atmosphere, lovely staff, but when you get a large plate with a rim that is about 6 inches wide and a very small bowl indentation in the middle of the plate - that's the serving size of an entree.  See link here  to get an idea of an entree serving size at Prospect.hotelblog.typepad.com/.a…Pork ragu was not pulled pork but ground pork though it was tasty.Salads were bland.If portions were increased or prices reduced, we might return.  But go for happy hour and then it is worth it.",2.0
"Scallops and octopus to die for. Melon with fresh ham was cool, refreshing and delicious. Mixed baby greens salad was wonderful. We shared six oysters that came from both coasts.  They were fresh, briny and so so good.Service was very attentive. So why not five stars? Really really small portions and very dear pricing.That being said, I would very much recommend Prospect.",4.0
"Staff was great - very friendly, attentive and knew the menu well (could tell they've actually tasted everything)Food was excellent - foie gras, truffle fries, homemade bread with truffle butter, pork cheek, etc). Interesting menu and executed perfectly. Liquor was not overpriced. In fact it was very reasonable.Atmosphere was nice - cool, clean, upscale yet relaxed scene. The open kitchen adds some vibrance and gives you something to stare at when conversation lulls.",5.0
"We had our engagement celebration dinner here.This was the only place in my life that where I've eaten liver and enjoyed it! Believe me, I've been trying for years!We had the tasting menu and it was full of flavor and surprise. Plus the staff was wonderful and surprised us with a ""Celebration"" dessert! It was a wonderful experience!",5.0
"I had an incredible dinner last night at Prospect. We came before a play at BAM and they were great at helping us time our meal so that we made it out in time to get to the play. Our server was friendly but not imposing, and had lots of great suggestions. The meal:Fantastic oysters, some for $1 some for $3, which he paired with a great dry white wine.Potato leek soup: not your average potato leek soup! Really good.Octopus with charred brussel sprouts and potatoes - excellent.Sous vide egg: I didn't try it but my mother loved it.Cassoulet: The duck confit was great, of course, and the rest of it is not to my taste but others at my table were all about itSkate cheeks: what a treat!Scallops: incredible. Really. Also great for cocktails, and has really good looking bar food! Love the ambiance. I'll definitely go back!",5.0
"Only had the appetizersThe Kobe beef burgers were out of this world, I want to go back just for that. My next favorites were the squash soup, scallions, and duck breast. The foie gras lollipops were ok, although I must admit,  I'm not the biggest fan of foie gras. My least favorite of the five were the frog legs.Bartenders and service were great as well",5.0
"Truly a little treasure in Fort Greene.Sophisticated but unpretentious atmosphere, the same goes for the food and staff.Highly recommend the risotto- tender and amazing flavors.Scallops are cooked perfectly and seasoned well.And don't forget the sirloin. Have been here for just drinks and appetizers and a full dinner. Either way you can't lose (the cocktail menu is fantastic, by the way)Definitely will be back.",5.0
really cute place.  open kitchen.  we sat at bar.  it was perfect for us.  the bartender was super busy! the host was also going around being attentive.  he comes off a bit harsh but still ok :-)  wasn't sure how to take his 'expressions'.my friends loved all the cocktails.  i'm still on my detox period so had a virgin ginger lemon thingy (made upon request by bartender)...delicous and refreshing.  sucked it down in less than 5 mins :-)truffled fries are a yummy snack to have.  also had the brussels sprouts and the cauliflower. all great.  great location to attract the BAM crowd.  i'll definitely come back.,3.0

"Came for lobster Monday and left satisfied. For $20, you get a hefty lobster (with the tail cracked for your pleasure), a handful of roasted fingerling potatoes, pre-buttered corn on the cob, and 3 little neck clams. It's delightful and though I need some practice with the cracker, I had great fun without making a terrible mess of myself.

"Had a great dining experience here on Sunday evening.  The place was super empty, not sure why and even the kitchen staff wasnt really sure why it was so quiet.  This was good for us as we got super attentive service and got to speak with the kitchen staff since we were sitting at the kitchen counter area.  Appetizers were all great including the corn chowder and roast vegetables.  Mains were also excellent.  Only complaint is the veal was coated with some kind of small circular grain that I think detracted from the experience since i found it hard to chew and it got stuck in my teeth.   The server did explain while ordering that the veal was one of the more ""out there"" dishes but I ordered it anyway. The skate was excellent along with the dessert.  Small portions.Overall very great dining experience.  Will come back.",4.0

"Having family come into BK for a show at the Barclays Center was a perfect excuse to get out of my neighborhood and try out something new.  Prospect did not disappointed.  There was not one complaint about our orders.  The oysters were very fresh and properly shucked - maybe I'm going to too many oyster happy hours or something? - and the truffle fries, lobster, steak, and burrata dishes were fantastic.  I would definitely recommend Prospect.",4.0
"I had to give Prospect a review after an outstanding dinner last night.  If there's one drawback to Prospect, it's that they don't have many tables, so it's hard to get a reservation, and the bar is pretty packed with those still wanting to eat or drink here.  But walk-ins are welcome, and with no reservation available, my partner and I were  offered seats at the chef's counter, which frankly, I prefer.  I love to watch the kitchen in action.The five stars were earned mainly for two reasons:  1) the Prospect Sour cocktail was absolutely superb.  They have a pretty decent original cocktail list and a nice wine selection by the glass, which complimented all of our dishes.2) The Long Island Fluke was one of the best fish dishes I have had in recent memory.  The fish was perfect, seared to a wonderful crispiness on top and flaky underneath.  Served with what they call ""flavors of New England clam chowder,"" it was a nice deconstruction, with some delicious clams on top of charred leeks, crispy pork belly and small round potatoes.  Absolutely delicious when all brought together.I look forward to trying the tasting menu in the future.",5.0
"Awesome oyster selection.Great wine list.Pork chop and pork belly special was divine. Get the heirloom tomato and burata appetizer and chef's selection of vegetables. Seasonal dessert was interesting, though not my favorite. Adorable location, attentive staff, great use of seasonal produce and eats. Recommend to people trying to impress someone on a date or to people going out to eat with the parents. A bit too pricey for me to go all the time.Love the vintage photographs along the back wall -- awesome shots of old school Brooklyn!",4.0
"This place was great.Food was every bit as good as this type of place on the other side of the water....but much more relaxed.I started with the Foie gras, which you don't see often on menus anymore. ...feeling a little guilt in retrospect, one has to hope it's done in a humane way. Perhaps naive.Anyway, it was really really delicious! In fact, hadn't tasted anything this good since dining at Chefs table / Brooklyn Fare! Then had the Lamb. It too, was quite good.",5.0
"We ate here last weekend after reading a very positive review in the New Yorker mag.The interior atmosphere is typical brooklyn hipster.  Noise level was moderate.The service was a bit slow, but they were very busy getting folks to the McCartney show at the Barclay that evening.  Luckily we were in no rush.  They did ask, something many places don't bother with.  The food was interesting and reasonably priced for metro NY.  My only complaint is that the ""chefs ice cream choice"" for dessert was absurdly small.  About two spoon-fulls.  Really?  For $8?  Anyway, go for the food, skip dessert.  Many decent places nearby for that.",3.0
"Fried chicken mondays, everyone! I had just seen 'gravity' - one of the best movies ive seen in a while, and then i eat the most phenomenal preparation of my most favorite comfort food- fried chicken. But this is no ordinary fried chicken meal, you can choose truffle mac and cheese, string beans, mashed potatoes and gravy! We chose the truffle mac and cheese! But oh my god- the cornbread with home made honey butter... Is mindblowing. I cant forget to mention the sauces- bbq, homemade buttermilk ranch and hot sauce. Oh, i also must comment on the presentation. Loved it!",5.0

"Fresh fettuccine, Risotto prepared the way it should be (not coagulated like so many do...blegh) with perfectly seared scallops.Chicken liver mousse was light and tasty..loved the added touch of chopped walnuts scattered on top for crunch/texture.

"When we entered, the woman at the door said: "" Can I help you?"". Not: ""Good evening, welcome to Prospect"" or some other welcoming phrase. I felt like I was in a drugstore. A restaurant like this should do more to establish a welcoming atmosphere from the moment customers enter.Once it was established that we had reservations, things began to improve. We both had the tasting menu. We were served an amuse-bouche of tuna with micro greens and a hint of soy sauce. It was larger than any amuse-bouche I have ever had, 4 bites for me. But it was very tasty.The tasting menu began with a beet salad with Meyer lemon gelee. Amazing! Then we were served gnudi with foie gras. Deliciously rich and tasty. The fish was wonderful and the venison was excellent. The vegetables accompanying the fish and meat were beautifully prepared and were a wonderful addition to the meal. If I were to rate this restaurant on food alone, it would get a solid 5 stars. But the service, though ambitious, was a little awkward throughout the meal.I expect that with time, this place will only get better and I will definitely go back. So my fellow-Yelpers go eat here and enjoy the excellent food. This will give the staff much needed practice and it will become an even better place.",4.0
"Shortly after I wrote my review of Prospect a few weeks ago, one of the owners contacted me with the most heartfelt apology. He asked if I would consider coming back one day for a meal to have a chance to try the cuisine. That meal was had this past sunday night.Now, onto the breakdown of the evening!Service: The service could not have been any better. Our waiter was one of the best I have had the pleasure of dining with in a very long time. He remembered us from our ill fated first attempt and was full of recommendations (all were spot on) and witty pleasantries. The other waitstaff assisting also were very attentive if our waiter (I am sorry I didn't get his name) wasn't available for the moment.Appetizers: butternut squash soup with a root beer foam and roasted marshmallows, beef carpaccio and scallops. The scallops were the biggest hit of the evening according to my fellow seafood eating diners. The soup was delicious, smooth and well balanced. Unlike many butternut squash soups, this was wonderfully seasoned with just enough sweetness.Entrees: we sampled four entrees consisting of the cassoulet, chicken breast, duck breast and the skate. As a side, we took the recommendation of our waiter, ordering the candied brussel sprouts.Each and every bite from each plate was better than the last. The chef managed to make food that was as perfectly seasoned as it was beautiful to look at. My chicken in particular was full of flavor, moisture and flavor contrast. It was perfectly roasted. The brussel sprouts are an absolute must with their sweet/salty/crispy parts. Yum! All 4 diners were members of the clean plate club at this meal.Desserts: We tried all three desserts that included the s'mores with bourbon chocolate mousse and meringue, a beautiful citrus cake and Weiss Cake with roasted banana cake and stout ice cream. Each was pleasing to the eye and full of different flavor/consistency contrasts. Each pairing worked perfectly!Drinks: the guys didn't get alcoholic drinks, but both myself and my friend sampled a red and white from the wine menu. Both were delish. I had a Sauvignon Blanc and she had a Shiraz. Each paired perfectly  with the meal. After dinner I had a soothing lavender mint tea, my husband had an Americano and our friend had an espresso. All very good.What can i say? I left Prospect and told my husband that this was THE best meal I have had in Ft. Greene to date. That reminds me, I do believe in second chances.",4.0

"I could not be happier with my experience here. Everything was excellent - the food, the service, and the overall ambiance.

I am being overly hard on them, but if you want to charge these prices in Fort Greene then you need to present a spectacular dining experience.  I'm sure I'll be back before too long because the basics are there... they just need to tweak the details a bit to hit it out of the park.",3.0

"I first sampled executive chef Kyle McClelland's culinary creations when he came down to Dallas last fall to take over as executive chef at a restaurant down here, and when I found myself in New York for the weekend I just had to stop by, since I've kept up with him and knew about Prospect. I absolutely loved everything about this place. It's cozy with an open kitchen so you can see the chefs preparing everything. Small space, but well organized. You can sit at the bar, a table, or the bar where you can see the chefs in the kitchen. Decor is great, I love the whitewashed brick and wood planks and the ceiling is beautiful. Staff was very friendly and attentive and made great recommendations on dishes. The food is upscale, prices are very good for what you get, and the atmosphere is relaxed.I started off with a drink called the Texas Daisy. Being from Texas, I naturally gravitated toward it and had to give it a try. I was expecting to taste nothing but tequila since my taste buds can be sensitive to it but was pleasantly surprised when it was a tart blend of the tequila, agave and lime. Very delicious and drinkable. I had two.My friend and I split the homemade bread & butter and Nantucket scallops for appetizers. Homemade bread is absolutely delicious, it was fresh out of the oven, a little salty if anything but that's just my taste. Butter was room temp, soft and spreadable, and the scallops were served with bacon and little greens in a rich sauce, which we used the bread to mop up. Perfection.For entrées, my friend had the 14-day dry aged duck on top of quinoa with salt roasted onions, preserved currants and figs. She said it was incredible. I was too busy enjoying my seared Ahi tuna with foie gras atop sautéed baby bok choy with mushrooms. The tuna was so buttery and tender I could cut it with a fork, and the bok choy perfectly cooked and not the least bit bitter, which I sometimes find in places since the base takes longer to cook than the leaves. The foie gras was amazing, I'm not really a big liver person but anything duck will get me. Then there was dessert. We had a rich caramel apple crumble that was served with vanilla ice cream and topped with a beautiful edible fall leaf, colors and all. Paired with a dessert wine that was 100% Moscat grapes, it almost tasted like a honey wine to complement the apples, very delicious but was very strong.  All in all another amazing experience with Chef Kyle's food. I will be back every time I return to NY, which I hope will be soon.",5.0
"A place that fort greene has been waiting for, what I would call farm to table, although they do not claim that, as in NY, the winter does not allow farm to table unless you own a green house!  Innovative beets, served three ways, with shaved horseradish, one with wasabi and another with dehydrated  cherries. All I can say about that is YUM.  Oysters, were fresh.  Service was lively and fun, great and attentive. We had the dry aged duck, which was served over quinoa and small onions, perfect.  The pasta of the day was fresh, with roasted seasonal veggies, nothing over cooked, but cooked to perfection that brought out the flavors of the veggies.   The brussel sprouts were great, tender, just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness.  Fresh, not overcooked.  Bread is fresh baked, and while you need to order this, comes with refill at no extra cost.  Desserts, were great, sorbets, and the carmel apple, was a deconstructed apple pie, that rocks.  Naturally good food at Prospect.  Hip and lively, cute space and nice selection of wines.",4.0
"I'm not sure if I went to the same restaurant as the rest of you...The service was inattentive, at best (I was sitting at the bar and had to wait quite a while for a glass of water, it took us a while to order and they didn't think to bring us silverware until after they'd brought us our food); the dish I ordered was bland and didn't deliver on its promise (I ordered the ""tempura"" fish and chips, but there was nothing crispy or tempura-y about it); and it was delivered on a plastic plate.  If I'm to be honest, the plastic plate was the straw for me (especially because my dining companion got an actual plate...and the place wasn't full so they couldn't have run out of plates...AND I saw stacks of various types and shapes of real plates at the kitchen window)...just truly bizarre.",2.0

"Prospect is bound to give Walter's a run for its money.Came here with two friends for drinks followed by dinner last night. Saturday, around 7:30, and the place was pleasantly bustling and busy. Everyone was exceptionally friendly and talkative -- from the host to the bartender to the server. Whenever my friend and I excused ourselves for a cigarette, someone was there to open the door for us, so that we might poison our lungs with as little fuss as possible.Now onto the food. The menu is pretty much aligned with the ""local American nouveau ohhhhh organic"" vibe that we're seeing across the neighborhood (and possibly beyond, though I tend not to venture far). Oysters, chic burgers, brussels sprouts, and so on. But damn the food was well-executed. The burger was phenomenal, arguably better than the one at Walter's (which is a fantastic burger), roasted cauliflower was so good I'd come back just for a bowl of it, fries were perfectly crisp and seasoned with truffle oil and salt. Decor and ambiance are lovely, people are lovely, food is lovely, wine is lovely. I loved it. This place is bound to get insanely busy in the weeks to come, as more locals figure out how awesome it is...but oh well...Prospect deserves it. I'll gladly wait in line.",5.0
"This place serves delicious food, tasty drinks, and the customer service is superb. My friend and I came in last night for a little dinner before a performance at BAM. The hostess greeted us and asked if we needed to be out by a certain time, which was actually really helpful and not pushy at all. We had maybe 1.25 hours until showtime and it felt like the staff was helping us stay on schedule rather than rush us through our evening. We sat at the chef's counter and enjoyed watching the meal prep. The ambiance in the place is very elegant. We started with cocktails, a Vieux-Carré for her and Brooklyn for me. Both were excellent. For dinner we shared several small plates: truffled devil eggs, calamari, chicken liver mousse, and the beet salad. We also asked for a cheese plate to come out after this (my friend is a francophile!), with a glass each of bourdeaux to pair it with. Honestly everything was really good and well presented and though the portions were not huge, we left feeling full and satisfied. DEFINITELY come here if you're in the area!!!",5.0

"What the hell happened? Bf and I were excited to come back, had a GREAT brunch here months back, but today: I was served undercooked eggs on a stale English muffin and the amount of food on the plate was half that from my last experience. I'm not a big eater and I left hungry. And they were turning people away at 20 til 3. Had it taken any longer--or had we wanted to spend more time there over another drink or more food--it was obvious we would have been booted out. So sad. Bf just looked at me shocked, remarked ""that was awful"" as soon as we got out the door. New owner? Summer slump? So bad and far from last experience that I wouldn't try again any time soon.",1.0
"My wife and I had a burger at the bar here a couple of days ago and enjoyed it. We came back tonight with the modest hopes of repeating the experience, but wow -- the food was truly awful. We started with the deviled eggs. I tend to be an undemanding diner -- if something put in front of me is halfway edible, I'll eat it. But these eggs were among the worst things I can ever remember being served in a restaurant. They were *so salty* that after one bite I was reaching for my water glass for relief. If I had made these eggs at home, after that initial taste I would have thrown them out.Me and the Mrs. then shared a burger, and the experience was similar to the eggs -- just insanely salty. And the meat was overcooked. The waitress told us wagu beef looks well done even when it's medium rare, but that didn't gibe with our experience. The burger we'd had a couple of days earlier was pink. I realize one star is harsh, and I don't doubt that other diners have had better experiences here than we did. In fact, as I've said, we had a satisfying meal ourselves a few days earlier. But a restaurant that charges $17 for a burger should be polished enough to get it right every time. What we ate this evening wasn't just so-so. It was unacceptable. It was worse than diner food. Worse than really bad diner food. I regret that I didn't talk to someone in management about what we experienced, but as we were exiting I looked around and everyone was busy (which I don't hold against them). Meanwhile my wife, who underwent intestinal surgery in 2012, was feeling like she could be sick to her stomach for the first time in months. So we made a quick exit, deciding that we'd have to express our feelings through Yelp.",1.0
"I first sampled executive chef Kyle McClelland's culinary creations when he came down to Dallas last fall to take over as executive chef at a restaurant down here, and when I found myself in New York for the weekend I just had to stop by, since I've kept up with him and knew about Prospect.

"After reading about this place from NY Times, my partner and I decided to give this a try. We were greeted by the friendliest host, she actually was the manager and only learned about it later. Seated fairly quickly and our server was very pleasant. Decor is nice and I always welcome new restaurants in the area, regardless of price,  hoping they would last longer than one season. We started with their bread, being it's homemade, and we're suckers for warm bread. It was tasty, not doughy and really baked well. We ordered the ""grilled"" octopus. I was a little confused because it didn't taste grilled at all. It tasted like very boiled and just really lacked any taste. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the octopus. We also ordered the foie gras which was the best thing in this place. We had three other dishes and decided to order another set of bread because it was so good. When the bread arrived, it was cold inside and didn't have that baked taste like the first batch we received.  More like it was microwaved and served to us. We opted to return and had them bake it a little more. Mind you the bread wasn't free. The kitchen has an open view to the customers. Once we saw our server, who was very nice, spoke to one of the chefs about the bread we had asked to bake a little more, the entire kitchen staff gave us the dirtiest and evil looks. There were at least five of the in the kitchen. To say the least, when the bread finally was served again, we decided not to eat it. We managed to finish our meals and decided to skip dessert which was the primary reason we gave this place a try. The manager noticed our disappointed looks. However we didn't say a word and just asked for our check. She asked if everything was alright and we said yes. She asked three times and we finally said it was because of her kitchen staff who needed to be kept behind walls where the customers can't see their reaction when bread is returned because it was cold.She apologized profusely for her cooks and didn't make us pay for our meals. We refused but she insisted. While her kitchen staff behaved poorly, this manager stepped up and gave a new meaning to customer service. Hooray for this woman. I forgot her name All in all, yes I encourage you to try this place. Maybe they've learned to keep their chefs to just do their thing and keep their evil eyes to themselves.",2.0
This place could not have been better. My boyfriend and I came back to Prospect after having some amazing drinks there a couple of weeks ago. We had the steak tartare and a couple of cocktails to start. My bf loves their extensive bourbon and rye collection. For the main course he had the scallop risotto and I had the market vegetable plate. Apparently the preparation for this particular dish is different every day. We both agreed at the end of the meal that we would be coming back very soon.,5.0
"First of all, I have always seen this space as a missed opportunity, so I'm very excited that Prospect has settled in.We had a really wonderful time here last night.  I was surprised that we had no wait to get in at just before 9 on a Sunday in Fort Greene.  We got the only remaining table though, which is always a perfect moment.Our server was knowledgable and friendly and gorgeous.  He very patiently helped me find a great wine and chatted with us about oysters and planned the courses well.I got a nice Manazanique and my dining companion had an old-fashioned which he felt was superb.  We started with oysters.  They had 4 options: 2 West Coast and 2 East Coast.  The East Coasts were Wellfleets--standard but fresh, briny, and delicious.  We absolutely loved the snow crab ""salad""--don't leave here without ordering it.  It is unique and I'm still thinking about it the next day.We also shared shisito peppers (love!) and the suckling pig, which was cooked to perfection.  The description of that dish on the menu had me a bit wary, but it was wonderful.It's a great restaurant and a wonderful alternative to Walter's, when that place is beyond packed.",5.0

"Wow! We went back for dinner this Saturday night. We were greeted warmly again by Paige and the rest of the lovely staff.First of all, the man sitting at the table next to us was the biggest nightmare of a customer - asked for ""plain food instead of all this fancy stuff"". The waiter assured him that he'd speak with the kitchen and come up with something he'd enjoy. Then the man canceled his date's order because he thought she had run out on him (she was outside on the phone, probably complaining about what a nut he was). When she came back, he had to re-order her food, and even though this was totally all the customer's fault, the waiter brought out a plate of deviled eggs and said, ""with the chef's compliments, since the re-order will take a moment for us to get out to you"" and the man said ""yeah, well, i don't eat deviled eggs."" OMG! STILL, instead of getting any kind of attitude, the waiter kindly brought out a basket of bread for him to munch on. This man complained about EVERYTHING and the waiter was a pure gold saint. Bravo to his patience! I would have poured a drink in his lap.Now, as for our meal, it was perfection. Started with the oysters again which are really not to be missed. We had the lamb belly for an app and we could not get over how scrumptious it was. Pea soup with fried milk and frog's legs? You betcha. Super fresh, like spring in a bowl. Our entrees were the suckling pig and the halibut, and we were glad we chose those two because the pig was SO decadent and the fish was nice and light. They balanced each other well since we shared them. This place has quickly become our favorite spot in the neighborhood. We've told everyone about it so get here soon before it becomes so popular you can't get in! Great food and great service is all I ever ask for. It doesn't sound that difficult but it is - difficult to find AND difficult to execute. I really applaud Prospect for doing it well and making it look easy. My boyfriend woke up on Sunday with a gleam in his eye and said...""So, can we go to Prospect for brunch today?""",5.0
The Pork Belly/ Egg  Dish was Divine!!! I will be back when in town from LA,5.0
"Lovely decor in that industrial vibe that is the new standard. This would make a lovely date spot. The food was yummy though the price point is a bit high in my opinion. The food was fresh and spot on in terms of seasoning. I had the lamb belly that was delectable-it was fatty, crispy and served on some interesting paste made of lentils. I then had the bass which was super fresh and had some lovely vegetables (fava beans and some other veggies). I love carbohydrates and felt deprived with the vegetables that came with the bass so I ordered the truffle fries which were delicious though pricey. (  I would come back for the burger just to have those fries!) My dinner mate had the venision which was lovely and I am not always a fan of game meat-especially when its pretty rare. But the venison was good!!!Didnt have any dessert because they didnt have anything gluten free or dairy free. But all in all I was pleased with my meal and would definitely go again.",3.0
"Walked in on a Thursday night. Was seated right away. The place is small but cute. Decor is sort of like an upscale tavern with the heavy woods replaced by white tile giving it a lighter, more modern feel. There are a combination of tables, seating at the bar and seating facing the open kitchen. Probably only enough table seating for about 25 people in the restaurant and with the other seating, not more than 45 (and those are generous estimates). Ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was ok, not great. Cod as the entree which was really good and the tres leches for dessert which was probably the best tres leches I've ever had. Presentation on everything was very detailed  and thoughtful; definitely rivals upscale restaurants. I loved the attention to the combinations of flavors and textures in the entree. The service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely go back. As a note I had tried going in before on a Monday night which is their ""burger night"". Apparently they only serve burgers on Monday, not a good option considering I was with a pescatarian and that I don't eat red meat, so we left. Overall a good experience and I would recommend it.",4.0

"It took me a little while to buy into this place. It just seemed so upscale for the neighborhood. I'm so glad I gave it a chance. I started out just having cocktails here a few times and they were excellent. The only bar food I tried was the truffle french fries and, while they were good, they didn't inspire me to come back for a full meal. However, a few more glances at the menu and some really good reviews did.My first meal, I sat at the chef's table- a very fun experience. When I can't decide what to order, I like to see what other patrons are eating, so this gave me a front row seat. Everything coming out of that kitchen looked amazing. The waiter was very attentive and friendly and poured me several tastes of wine. When I wasn't fully satisfied, he called over the sommelier who helped me pick out the perfect bottle (Arugs Pinot Noir Carneras). I ordered the Fois Gras special appetizer (great seasonings and tasty sear, but a little well done) and the ""Kyle's Cassoulet"" (Pork Belly, Lamb Shank, and Saucisson over Tarbais beans)- excellent. I also added the side of bread with Truffle Butter and Brussels Sprouts, both fantastic choices. I finished with the Weiss Cake but would recommend going another direction for dessert, even though the description (Roasted Banana Bavarian Cake with Salted Caramel and Mother's Milk Stout Ice Cream) is right up my ally. The actual cake was a little boring despite the amazing description. The group next to me did the tasting menu and each person ordered a different dessert, each one looking better than the next. My second food centered visit here was for Sunday brunch. I HIGHLY recommend it. It's crowded but you can usually get a seat right away if you are willing to sit at the bar. My party came a little later, though (around 2PM). Again, service was excellent. I started with a solid cappucino and I shared the jelly donuts with my companions (my mouth is watering as I write). They are absolutely delicious- a must order to start off your meal. Because everything on the menu sounded so amazing, we went on to split the French Toast as well as order our own meals. I chose Crepes and I chose well. One of my companions ordered the Prospect Benedict which she enjoyed (and it looked excellent). My most recent experience was for dinner again. My server was not very friendly this time, but the hostess and bar staff were. I ordered the Flank Steak special and I would be psyched if they added it to the regular menu! The sauce was delicious. I had the bread and Brussels Sprouts again but regrettably skipped having an appetizer. The dessert must have also been a special because I don't see it on the menu, but it was a huge improvement on the Banana Cake. I just wish it was bigger!As expected with this sort of place, serving sizes are not large so come here planning to order all your courses.",5.0

I was a little confused because it didn't taste grilled at all. It tasted like very boiled and just really lacked any taste. The sauce it came with didn't compliment the octopus. We also ordered the foie gras which was the best thing in this place. We had three other dishes and decided to order another set of bread because it was so good. When the bread arrived, it was cold inside and didn't have that baked taste like the first batch we received.  More like it was microwaved and served to us. We opted to return and had them bake it a little more. Mind you the bread wasn't free. The kitchen has an open view to the customers. Once we saw our server, who was very nice, spoke to one of the chefs about the bread we had asked to bake a little more, the entire kitchen staff gave us the dirtiest and evil looks. There were at least five of the in the kitchen. To say the least, when the bread finally was served again, we decided not to eat it. We managed to finish our meals and decided to skip dessert which was the primary reason we gave this place a try. The manager noticed our disappointed looks. However we didn't say a word and just asked for our check. She asked if everything was alright and we said yes. She asked three times and we finally said it was because of her kitchen staff who needed to be kept behind walls where the customers can't see their reaction when bread is returned because it was cold.She apologized profusely for her cooks and didn't make us pay for our meals. We refused but she insisted. While her kitchen staff behaved poorly, this manager stepped up and gave a new meaning to customer service. Hooray for this woman. I forgot her name All in all, yes I encourage you to try this place. Maybe they've learned to keep their chefs to just do their thing and keep their evil eyes to themselves.",2.0
This place could not have been better. My boyfriend and I came back to Prospect after having some amazing drinks there a couple of weeks ago. We had the steak tartare and a couple of cocktails to start. My bf loves their extensive bourbon and rye collection. For the main course he had the scallop risotto and I had the market vegetable plate. Apparently the preparation for this particular dish is different every day. We both agreed at the end of the meal that we would be coming back very soon.,5.0
"First of all, I have always seen this space as a missed opportunity, so I'm very excited that Prospect has settled in.We had a really wonderful time here last night.  I was surprised that we had no wait to get in at just before 9 on a Sunday in Fort Greene.  We got the only remaining table though, which is always a perfect moment.Our server was knowledgable and friendly and gorgeous.  He very patiently helped me find a great wine and chatted with us about oysters and planned the courses well.I got a nice Manazanique and my dining companion had an old-fashioned which he felt was superb.  We started with oysters.  They had 4 options: 2 West Coast and 2 East Coast.  The East Coasts were Wellfleets--standard but fresh, briny, and delicious.  We absolutely loved the snow crab ""salad""--don't leave here without ordering it.  It is unique and I'm still thinking about it the next day.We also shared shisito peppers (love!) and the suckling pig, which was cooked to perfection.  The description of that dish on the menu had me a bit wary, but it was wonderful.It's a great restaurant and a wonderful alternative to Walter's, when that place is beyond packed.",5.0
"Settle down everyone! Just make sure you arrive full because their of Gwyneth Paltrow portions also, make sure you have a loaded flask to nip on because these are Beverly Hills prices. But seriously people, after you pay the check make sure as you make your way to the door to drop a nice hot and steamy ball of gas out of your 2 hole to show your true appreciation of Clinton Hill's pretentious restaurant nouveau. Also who stole the soul from the wait staff? This place can take the gaspipe.",2.0
"Wow! We went back for dinner this Saturday night. We were greeted warmly again by Paige and the rest of the lovely staff.First of all, the man sitting at the table next to us was the biggest nightmare of a customer - asked for ""plain food instead of all this fancy stuff"". The waiter assured him that he'd speak with the kitchen and come up with something he'd enjoy. Then the man canceled his date's order because he thought she had run out on him (she was outside on the phone, probably complaining about what a nut he was). When she came back, he had to re-order her food, and even though this was totally all the customer's fault, the waiter brought out a plate of deviled eggs and said, ""with the chef's compliments, since the re-order will take a moment for us to get out to you"" and the man said ""yeah, well, i don't eat deviled eggs."" OMG! STILL, instead of getting any kind of attitude, the waiter kindly brought out a basket of bread for him to munch on. This man complained about EVERYTHING and the waiter was a pure gold saint. Bravo to his patience! I would have poured a drink in his lap.Now, as for our meal, it was perfection. Started with the oysters again which are really not to be missed. We had the lamb belly for an app and we could not get over how scrumptious it was. Pea soup with fried milk and frog's legs? You betcha. Super fresh, like spring in a bowl. Our entrees were the suckling pig and the halibut, and we were glad we chose those two because the pig was SO decadent and the fish was nice and light. They balanced each other well since we shared them. This place has quickly become our favorite spot in the neighborhood. We've told everyone about it so get here soon before it becomes so popular you can't get in! Great food and great service is all I ever ask for. It doesn't sound that difficult but it is - difficult to find AND difficult to execute. I really applaud Prospect for doing it well and making it look easy. My boyfriend woke up on Sunday with a gleam in his eye and said...""So, can we go to Prospect for brunch today?""",5.0
The Pork Belly/ Egg  Dish was Divine!!! I will be back when in town from LA,5.0
"Lovely decor in that industrial vibe that is the new standard. This would make a lovely date spot. The food was yummy though the price point is a bit high in my opinion. The food was fresh and spot on in terms of seasoning. I had the lamb belly that was delectable-it was fatty, crispy and served on some interesting paste made of lentils. I then had the bass which was super fresh and had some lovely vegetables (fava beans and some other veggies). I love carbohydrates and felt deprived with the vegetables that came with the bass so I ordered the truffle fries which were delicious though pricey. (  I would come back for the burger just to have those fries!) My dinner mate had the venision which was lovely and I am not always a fan of game meat-especially when its pretty rare. But the venison was good!!!Didnt have any dessert because they didnt have anything gluten free or dairy free. But all in all I was pleased with my meal and would definitely go again.",3.0
"Walked in on a Thursday night. Was seated right away. The place is small but cute. Decor is sort of like an upscale tavern with the heavy woods replaced by white tile giving it a lighter, more modern feel. There are a combination of tables, seating at the bar and seating facing the open kitchen. Probably only enough table seating for about 25 people in the restaurant and with the other seating, not more than 45 (and those are generous estimates). Ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was ok, not great. Cod as the entree which was really good and the tres leches for dessert which was probably the best tres leches I've ever had. Presentation on everything was very detailed  and thoughtful; definitely rivals upscale restaurants. I loved the attention to the combinations of flavors and textures in the entree. The service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely go back. As a note I had tried going in before on a Monday night which is their ""burger night"". Apparently they only serve burgers on Monday, not a good option considering I was with a pescatarian and that I don't eat red meat, so we left. Overall a good experience and I would recommend it.",4.0

"It took me a little while to buy into this place. It just seemed so upscale for the neighborhood. I'm so glad I gave it a chance. I started out just having cocktails here a few times and they were excellent. The only bar food I tried was the truffle french fries and, while they were good, they didn't inspire me to come back for a full meal. However, a few more glances at the menu and some really good reviews did.My first meal, I sat at the chef's table- a very fun experience. When I can't decide what to order, I like to see what other patrons are eating, so this gave me a front row seat. Everything coming out of that kitchen looked amazing. The waiter was very attentive and friendly and poured me several tastes of wine. When I wasn't fully satisfied, he called over the sommelier who helped me pick out the perfect bottle (Arugs Pinot Noir Carneras). I ordered the Fois Gras special appetizer (great seasonings and tasty sear, but a little well done) and the ""Kyle's Cassoulet"" (Pork Belly, Lamb Shank, and Saucisson over Tarbais beans)- excellent. I also added the side of bread with Truffle Butter and Brussels Sprouts, both fantastic choices. I finished with the Weiss Cake but would recommend going another direction for dessert, even though the description (Roasted Banana Bavarian Cake with Salted Caramel and Mother's Milk Stout Ice Cream) is right up my ally. The actual cake was a little boring despite the amazing description. The group next to me did the tasting menu and each person ordered a different dessert, each one looking better than the next. My second food centered visit here was for Sunday brunch. I HIGHLY recommend it. It's crowded but you can usually get a seat right away if you are willing to sit at the bar. My party came a little later, though (around 2PM). Again, service was excellent. I started with a solid cappucino and I shared the jelly donuts with my companions (my mouth is watering as I write). They are absolutely delicious- a must order to start off your meal. Because everything on the menu sounded so amazing, we went on to split the French Toast as well as order our own meals. I chose Crepes and I chose well. One of my companions ordered the Prospect Benedict which she enjoyed (and it looked excellent). My most recent experience was for dinner again. My server was not very friendly this time, but the hostess and bar staff were. I ordered the Flank Steak special and I would be psyched if they added it to the regular menu! The sauce was delicious. I had the bread and Brussels Sprouts again but regrettably skipped having an appetizer. The dessert must have also been a special because I don't see it on the menu, but it was a huge improvement on the Banana Cake. I just wish it was bigger!As expected with this sort of place, serving sizes are not large so come here planning to order all your courses.",5.0
"Oh Prospect. Just not the way to treat locals. It's great that you have a $5 pint and $1 oyster happy hour. Great idea. Though when it's 5pm and a local couple with stroller are drawn to your establishment by dreams of bivalves washed down with Kelso and they ask whether they can be seated inside when there is not a soul in the place and it looks like rain, don't say ""Well, it's easier outside.""Also, it's a happy hour. Everyone knows it's a way to upsell food when people are drunk enough but  be a little subtle. We came for oysters and beer. Let us order  and enjoy them before harassing us with the dinner menu at least four times.You seem desperate and that's a turn-off.Also, the oysters were not Malpeques as advertised and badly shucked.  Won't be back.",2.0
"We sat at the kitchen counter twice and did the tasting menu.

"A friend and I went by around happy hour, although we didn't know they had happy hour offerings.  The pekoe punch was on special that night and it was refreshing and flavorful.  We shared a bunch of snacks and didn't even get to the mains.  We started with the truffled devil eggs which were creamy and tangy.  We moved on to the chicken liver mousse that came with wonderfully acidic pickled shallots to cut through the fat and richness of the mousse.  We split the meatloaf burger - yummy and juicy.  The waiter was nice enough to ask if we had any food allergies.  My friend has a shellfish allergy, which we didn't think mattered since we didn't order any shellfish but we were informed that the torchon of all things contained XO sauce.  We still ordered it but her half was torchon-less and just came with the delicious cheese and jalapeño chutney.  The chutney was so delicious that I continued to eat it long after the torchon was done.  Lastly, we thought we needed a veggie so the waiter recommended the asparagus, which came roasted and salty and delicious.  Overall, a lovely pre-BAM evening.",5.0

"I had an incredible meal last night at Prospect. Came in by myself and luckily there was one seat left at the Chef's Bar. The space is very small but extremely cozy and well designed. Food- I opted for the Tasting Menu and it blew me away. Chef Kyle and Chef Vinny clearly take pride in creating innovative dishes out of prime ingredients.  My courses happened to lean heavily on fresh seafood, including a duo of spot prawns - one live and one being charred on burning hardwood charcoal right before my eyes. Other seafood dishes included soft shell crab with homemade kimchi and seared Atlantic halibut topped with a tempura Louisana crayfish. Non-seafood dishes excelled as well, such as seared Hudson Valley foie gras over local honey, passion fruit, granola & yogurt. I quipped that it was the greatest yogurt parfait on the planet. Pastry Chef Annika also came up with some delicious take on IPA beer to finish the night - a financier topped with various sorbets, chocolate and some kind of red hop powder. Bar - they have a big selection of house drinks which looked amazing from the ones I saw. I didn't do the wine pairing but would love to next time. Very nice bourbon selection as well. Service - everyone was wonderful and they seem like a tight knit family even though the restaurant hasn't been open very long. My water glass was never empty and the servers were all very gracious. All in all this was one of the best meals I've ever had. These guys really have their stuff together and the sky's the limit for them. Also, you will pay twice as much for this quality of experience in the city.  I can't wait to go back!",5.0
"The food was absolutely fantastic! Creative blends on traditional dishes that works oh so perfectly. We had the special appetizer to go along with some oysters, and couldn't pass up the bread. Some people might be upset at having to pay for bread and butter, but this stuff, WAY worth it! For our mains, we had the rack of lamb and the suckling pig. Both were absolutely wonderful! Additionally, I can't say enough great things about the staff - very attentive, friendly, just all around great service. The main complaint I see on here is that it is expensive for this neighborhood. And if you look at the other restaurants around, yes, it is generally more expensive. But, it is also in a different class of restaurant, and I see no reason why it isn't time for Fort Green to have a place like this. I knew what the menu was going in, and I knew what we were in for as far as cost. It's not an every night kind of place, but for the quality of the meal, and the staff that they have, it was well worth it.",5.0
"There are many  reasons to visit this restaurant but the bread and truffle butter alone are worth it.  What a great start to our evening.  Our party of six tried many different dishes and everybody was raving about each one:  the oysters, seared octopus, the pork special, the cassoulet - and on and on.  And the wait staff was extremely friendly which always makes a meal that bit more special.It was wonderful  that at the beginning of the meal we were asked if anybody had any special dietary requirements - should be a must by all restaurants.Well worth the trip from Manhattan - and the restaurant is very close to the subway.",5.0
"Food was 4-starts.  The service was 2 at best.  Our entrees came out right after our appetizers and it was pretty clear that when they were brought back, they had just been sitting under the heat lamp for 20 minutes.  Seems like a place that has lots of promise - the food was good (apps for sure...entrees had promise) but the service sucked.  To add insult to injury, the waitress charged me for a $100 bottle of wine (the one we ordered was $60) and added another entree to our bill and then did absolutely nothing to apologize for her mistake.  Really want to like this place but there are too many other great spots in the neighborhood to make a return trip worth it.",3.0

"My review is for drinks and dinner at the bar on a recent Sunday, when we were heading to the new Polonsky Theater for a 7:30 show. They get 5 stars for attentiveness alone. My husband ordered a whisky drink, which he never does, and set it down after a quick sip. The bartender noticed, took it off the bill, and replaced it with an excellent red and an apology. (It actually was a very good drink, just not for him.)  Great wine list and the bartender was very knowledgeble. The menu is inventive and varied.

I stayed on Duffield and hoofed it up here because of the Yelp reviews. WOW - this place Rocks! Small SoHo comfy atmosphere and  the menu selection is fresh and unique. Worth a visit if your in the area. I' ll be back!,4.0
"I had an incredible meal last night at Prospect. Came in by myself and luckily there was one seat left at the Chef's Bar. The space is very small but extremely cozy and well designed. Food- I opted for the Tasting Menu and it blew me away. Chef Kyle and Chef Vinny clearly take pride in creating innovative dishes out of prime ingredients.  My courses happened to lean heavily on fresh seafood, including a duo of spot prawns - one live and one being charred on burning hardwood charcoal right before my eyes. Other seafood dishes included soft shell crab with homemade kimchi and seared Atlantic halibut topped with a tempura Louisana crayfish. Non-seafood dishes excelled as well, such as seared Hudson Valley foie gras over local honey, passion fruit, granola & yogurt. I quipped that it was the greatest yogurt parfait on the planet. Pastry Chef Annika also came up with some delicious take on IPA beer to finish the night - a financier topped with various sorbets, chocolate and some kind of red hop powder. Bar - they have a big selection of house drinks which looked amazing from the ones I saw. I didn't do the wine pairing but would love to next time. Very nice bourbon selection as well. Service - everyone was wonderful and they seem like a tight knit family even though the restaurant hasn't been open very long. My water glass was never empty and the servers were all very gracious. All in all this was one of the best meals I've ever had. These guys really have their stuff together and the sky's the limit for them. Also, you will pay twice as much for this quality of experience in the city.  I can't wait to go back!",5.0
"The food was absolutely fantastic! Creative blends on traditional dishes that works oh so perfectly. We had the special appetizer to go along with some oysters, and couldn't pass up the bread. Some people might be upset at having to pay for bread and butter, but this stuff, WAY worth it! For our mains, we had the rack of lamb and the suckling pig. Both were absolutely wonderful! Additionally, I can't say enough great things about the staff - very attentive, friendly, just all around great service. The main complaint I see on here is that it is expensive for this neighborhood. And if you look at the other restaurants around, yes, it is generally more expensive. But, it is also in a different class of restaurant, and I see no reason why it isn't time for Fort Green to have a place like this. I knew what the menu was going in, and I knew what we were in for as far as cost. It's not an every night kind of place, but for the quality of the meal, and the staff that they have, it was well worth it.",5.0
"There are many  reasons to visit this restaurant but the bread and truffle butter alone are worth it.  What a great start to our evening.  Our party of six tried many different dishes and everybody was raving about each one:  the oysters, seared octopus, the pork special, the cassoulet - and on and on.  And the wait staff was extremely friendly which always makes a meal that bit more special.It was wonderful  that at the beginning of the meal we were asked if anybody had any special dietary requirements - should be a must by all restaurants.Well worth the trip from Manhattan - and the restaurant is very close to the subway.",5.0
"Food was 4-starts.  The service was 2 at best.  Our entrees came out right after our appetizers and it was pretty clear that when they were brought back, they had just been sitting under the heat lamp for 20 minutes.  Seems like a place that has lots of promise - the food was good (apps for sure...entrees had promise) but the service sucked.  To add insult to injury, the waitress charged me for a $100 bottle of wine (the one we ordered was $60) and added another entree to our bill and then did absolutely nothing to apologize for her mistake.  Really want to like this place but there are too many other great spots in the neighborhood to make a return trip worth it.",3.0
"Prospect is a great new restaurant about which you'll hear much more. It's small, less than 50 tables, but the food is wonderfully delicious with great wines to pair! The décor is what you'd expect in a sophisticated Brooklyn establishment, needless to say, it is very tastefully done and not overdone. The service is professional and friendly. I highly recommend Prospect (and I've eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world). Congratulations Prospect and we will be back ... even to Brooklyn.",5.0
"My review is for drinks and dinner at the bar on a recent Sunday, when we were heading to the new Polonsky Theater for a 7:30 show. They get 5 stars for attentiveness alone. My husband ordered a whisky drink, which he never does, and set it down after a quick sip. The bartender noticed, took it off the bill, and replaced it with an excellent red and an apology. (It actually was a very good drink, just not for him.)  Great wine list and the bartender was very knowledgeble. The menu is inventive and varied. Loved the butternut squash soup with a root beer accent and a very rich venison entree. We got out in time without feeling rushed, which is an art.",5.0
"The decor is lovely. The staff seems ready and willing and eager, but a little unsure how to go about it all. A seemingly stressed waiter (there were maybe 4 tables full) had to ask the manager where to keep a birthday cake. A question about the cheeses was met with a blank stare, and a check at the notes. There's a beautiful popcorn machine they're trying to hide behind some wine bottles until they ""get it up and running"". It's popcorn - plug it in and put some kernels in there. But mostly: $3.50 per oyster? No thanks.",3.0
"We really liked this restaurant, with a few reservations. First, the pluses. Amazing lobster entree, and really friendly, knowledgable service. Great coffee. And oysters. And the heirloom tomato salad was very nice. The minuses: the baby lettuce salad was swimming in a sort of Caesar-style dressing - should have gone much lighter on the dressing. And worse, the desserts (chef's seasonal special) were cloyingly sweet. Like, really really sweet. Next time, a different salad, and the lobster!",4.0
"So so good from start to finish. Had a celebratory dinner here and left feeling like we hadn't had a dinner that delicious in a very long time. To start: oysters- great selection and delicious homemade sauces, and heirloom and burrata salad was fresh, complex and incredibly flavorful. Entree for me was the butter poached lobster which was FANTASTIC, and he had the squid with chorizo, also amazing and to share the grilled asparagus. Dessert was their only offering of sunflower seed mousse with gelato. The creamy smooth mousse complimented the sweet and tangy gelato perfectly. Every single dish had incredible flavor and texture combinations. The dinner was pricy but worth it. Absolutely will be back for another occasion.",5.0
"Fantastic fried chicken, although the bucket only has 4 small pieces.  If u arrive hungry, chances are, the chicken meal won't suffice.  We would still go back though. The sauces were good; mac and cheese was ok, corn bread was good, and the cold slaw had too little mayo for my taste.",4.0
"Everything about this place was fantastic. The ambiance was cool, the cocktails were excellent, and the service was impeccable. The food was equally as awesome-- the butternut squash soup was delicious as a starter, the flavors of the gnudi just seemed to continue expanding, and the peanut butter popcorn dessert ingenious. We live on the UWS, but are already eagerly planning our next venture to Fort Greene just for another chance to eat at this fantastic restaurant!",5.0
"Wife and I celebrated her birthday with a mid-week stay in Brooklyn.  We live in central NJ and have both worked in Manhattan.  We enjoyed trying the top-rated restaurants there (Per Se, Wd-50, Daniel, Mesa Grill, Gramercy Tavern, Gotham Bar and Grill, Morimoto, Del Posto, Les Halles, etc) as well as trying to find hidden gems.  Little did we know that we'd strike gold in Brooklyn on our first visit over the bridge (other than an ill-fated dinner at Peter Luger).  I'm not trying to name drop.  I just want to lend as much credibility to the rave review that's about to follow.....From the moment we arrived at Prospect (9:15 on a nondescript Tuesday night), we were treated like family.  We chose to sit at the back counter overlooking the kitchen.  Immediately, one of the chefs (Darryl) struck up a conversation and walked us through the possibilities of the chefs tasting menu.   He asked my wife about her likes and dislikes and suggested we let them do their thing.  We did and they did.  Eventually we got to know the other chefs - point man Nathan and finally Vinson Petrillo, the Chef de Cuisine.  To watch Nathan and Darryl craft each plate, and then see Vinson apply the finishing touches with such attention to detail (while being able to ask them questions and learn how they approach cooking) was a pure joy.  They could not have been a nicer group of young men.  It was late and I'm sure they would have liked to close up shop but they answered all of our questions regarding their training, work experience, approach to food, etc... with such patience and thoughtfulness that we'll never forget the experience.  We also met the owner/executive chef Kyle McClellad who explained that he had worked with these guys before and brought them together at Prospect.   The man knows talent.  Chef Vinson has appeared on Food Networks' ""Chopped"" three times and won twice.  To hear his stories about the experience is a fascinating look into the popular food culture that has sprung up in America.  Chefs today are rock stars and these guys are about to graduate from small venues to sold out stadiums.  Make sure you get to Prospect soon.  It'll be the equivalent of saying you once saw Bruce and the E-Street Band at the Stone Pony or the Beatles at Indra Club in Hamburg, Germany.Thank you to everyone at Prospect for making my wife's birthday such an unforgettable evening.  I owe you big time.",5.0
"I had high high hopes for Prospect, and eagerly anticipated its delayed opening.  Before heading in on a Saturday night for dinner I met a friend a few nights before for a cocktail, which was great.  Dinner, though, not so much.The waitress was lost and confused, read the specials from her notepad, oversold the size of everything (from the starter ""candied walnut and raspberry salad, which had approximately two of each) to the pasta of the day ($18 for a more or less appetizer portion of bland pasta, though loaded with local vegetables), and could not efficiently manage to keep the flow of cocktails in line (though the cocktails are great, especially the Wild Eyed Rose).  We were seated next to the window, which prominently displayed the culinary offerings, but which unfortunately resulted in constant distraction by interested passersby (note to owners - just move the outside menus to the opposite window to avoid distracted diners).  My friend got the crispy duck, which wasn't so crisp, and I got the vegetarian pasta (my other friend got the meat pasta).  Nothing was anything more than fine, which isn't enough to rope us in for a second try.The meal (a shared appetizer and main course) took nearly two hours, and while we did indulge in enough delightful cocktails to make the time pass, Prospect has some work to do to keep up with the local competition.  Walter's, Roman's and LuLu & Po have this place beat, hands down.  Wishing it all the luck I can, and hoping for the best, but likely won't go back until word on the street improves.",2.0
"Wagyu Meatloaf sandwich...velvety beefy savory mingling in the mouth - soft as a scallop, meat and cheese/seasoning a complex meld of flavors recognizable as a ""burger"" only in the shape.  Yes, there are so many fancy burgers out there, but only one or two wroth writing about.  Alongside, a thoughtful arrangement of local curly red greens, lightly dressed, and dancing with whisper-thin sliced round heirloom carrots, radish, and shitake. No afterthought side salad here.  And a large mug stuffed with blades of hot, al dente potatoes lightly sprinkled with crumbs of herbs and parmesean, another meld raising the bar on fries.  Cold and windy outside...so a Hot Toddy (bourbon, honey, lemon juice, in a large mug, HOT) started the meal off well.  Staff are warm and attentive without being overly friendly or doting.  Banquettes are comfortable and the environment, while certainly noisy when full, is elegant 1920's bistro/flannel-grey elegance/black box theater.  I was there pre-theater when tables and bar were pretty empty but would say this is a destination for drinks meetup after work as well as inspiration for this Bronx girl to hop on the train for a more leisurely dive.",4.0

Living in Manhattan now for 13 months I have taken full advantage of the renown restaraunts in the city and tried mostly all the famous spots. So i've had my fair share of experiences.

"Welcome, new neighbor!Strolled in for happy hour around 6:30 and was surprised to find an already full house.
