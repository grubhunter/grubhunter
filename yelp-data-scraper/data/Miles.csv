"I Can only comment on their wine, drinks, atmosphere and service as I've never eaten here and probably never will. The menu looks amazing but I have some dietary restrictions that just don't work out here.I live a 10 minute walk from Miles and have been many times. The bartenders are always really friendly and laid back, zero snobbism which is a great and rare find these days. The booth in the front is intimate and cozy (and almost always open). The bar is a nice and some tables across from the bar are really nice for groups or sharing with others. Overall, a really welcoming space. I happen to like being able to see what's going on in the bar, no twists and turns and shady corners, so I love this place. The wines are just right and the cocktails are great. I don't think I would come out from Manhattan for this particular place, but I sure am happy that I live so close by!!",5.0
"I went to Miles on a Monday evening (literally outside their door at 5:59 pm - they open at 6) and loved it. I've read reviews about this place having the best Happy Hour specials and yup they were right - their free mac n' cheese is to die for. It was soooo good. BUT let me start over. So I went inside and the bartender took our orders, told us that the kitchen was still prepping so they didn't have the mac n' cheese then and there. I ordered a draft (HH was $1 off their draft beers - I paid $5 plus $1 tip) and sat in one of the little tables towards the back. This place is small but very cozy. Soon enough a couple of minutes later one of the servers brings us our little mac n' cheese bowls and sets two types of hot sauces on our table. I ate it in seconds!! Like I said before, it was so good.Overall, I really think this is such a cool/chill bar.",4.0
"Miles has easily one of the best Bushwick happy hours and it's on MONDAY. When everyone is dreading the work week starting you can reward yourself for making surviving Monday with ""Miles Mac n Cheese Mac Monday! "" I have been to Miles a  number of times and for some reason it's never too crowded.  A lot of places in Bushwick are ahead of their time. Bushwick maybe names the next Williamsburg but it is still going to take time before it's over crowded and annoying. And even though we alllllll dread that day, we also need to support those brave businesses that have taken the leap of faith of opening their doors before their time. Miles is one of those places. I love the space. Even though the space is small, they create little pockets for groups and tables for intimate setting but I always prefer to sit at the bar, in a way it's a bar's VIP area since, the bartender is consistently checking in on you.  Last Monday I finally made it for the mac and I was super excited about the beer list. I kept hearing about smoky beers and there was one on the list. All the beers are $5 for happy hour. Most of the beers are normally 6-7 so you are saving a buck or two. But every beer comes with mac. The smoky beer was a perfect pairing for the mac. The mac was super creamy and had a lovely sprinkling of breadcrumbs and heated to perfection.  I enjoyed every nibble. But I couldn't resist getting another crafty beer. And then like clockwork, I was offered another order of mac.  Not too shabby to enjoy two ramekins of mac and two crafty beers for $10 and tip! I also want to point out that the front section of Miles indoors has portraits of pups on human bodies. I like the fun little, decorative edge to the wine bar. I have the sense that even though it can be fancy, they know how to have a little fun.  I will have to return for a cheese plate and some vino on Wednesdays when it's 20% off a bottle.",4.0
"I stopped in to Miles with a girlfriend on a weeknight and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was warm and relaxed,  and the cocktails were great. I appreciated the small, but fun menu. Sometimes you want a fancy grilled cheese and also some Pâté. We had both and everything was delicious. Our bartender was nice and they placed good music from what I can remember. It's a great neighborhood spot and worth checking out for sure.",4.0
Amazing Cocktails & Great Music on an off night. Bartender was super chill & had one of the best playlists I've heard in the area (heavy vibes). We had 4 different cocktails and enjoyed all of them (the violet one was my fav),5.0
"Windswept, driven by cold and ennui, we were blown across the soft amber glow of Miles' threshhold. As we settled down in our leathery bar stools, we noticed an astounding array for exquisitely painted dog portraits. What a treat! It's invigorating, bracing, even overwhelmingly unthinkable that such dishes of olives, meat & cheese plates, and sturdy, thick, sumptuous & sexy glassware filled with fy'ry inebriating potions could coexist in the sphere of one imbibery. Like, it's pretty good.",5.0
"Nice little low key bar in Bushwick. I'm a fan of the cocktails, nice and strong. We also ordered the chicken liver pate, and while portions were generous (only $6), the pate was lacking in flavor. That was the only negative, would come here way more often if I lived nearby. Will be back though!",4.0
"Fantastic bar with a solid drink menu and welcoming but trendy atmosphere. I live in brooklyn but not in the neighborhood but this bar is well worth the travel.I drink whiskey and mezcal and was happy to find several unique cocktails with both, all of which were fabulous. I'd also like to give a shout out to the bartender, Steven who was both knowledgeable, chill and kind.Went here on a Monday night with a friend and we had a wonderful time. Music was banging too, they just had someone's playlist on but there were jams after jams. And don't forget free mac and cheese during happy hour on mondays!This place is a gem and I will definitely be returning.",5.0

A few people came and went, but I'd say the bar was half empty for most the night (so weeknights are best if you want to avoid crowds). I started off with the Old Fashioned and then switched to red wine. The sandwiches smelled great but weren't in the cards for me that night.

"Did not like this place at all. The only good thing about this place was the decor. It's definitely a cute spot and the playlist was on point. I think the concepts they have for the menu was cool as well, but nothing was outstanding. After all, it is a bar. The bartender was extremely, extremely rude. The drinks sucked, to be quite honest. Way, way, way too strong and I know it's dumb to complain about that, but they weren't drinkable at all and we wound up paying for the drinks and not even finishing a quarter of it. It's really a shame because the place could have so much potential given its decor, concepts, and music, but the service really just ruined it all and we did not feel welcome whatsoever. Maybe others have had a different experience, but I definitely will not be coming back. There are many bars like this that have the same concept and friendlier service.",2.0

"Jackpot! I've got 3 types of bars that I'm usually in the mood for. 1) krazy karaoke dance party time bars, 2) locavore/craft food and drink type place 3) divey pub where you can hang out with friends. Miles fits in with #2, locavore/craft food and drink. There's even a charcuterie section of the menu! I like snacks and this menu has them. There's also a sandwich called Sophia Petrillo (for those not in the know, that's my cat's full name).  Although the bar menu is exactly the sort of thing I like seeing, the biggest standout is the ambiance. The sidewalks leading to Miles pass convenience stores and tacky signs. When you step into Miles, you get the feeling that you're in another world. The decor is classy and contemporary. There are lots of little interior touches that tell you time and thought was put into creating a mood for customers. There's a couple long, lightly stained wooden tables with stools and candles in mason jars that serve as an extension of the bar. The effect is the impression that things at Miles are simple but that they've thought of it all. You can see white tiles lining the kitchen walls, serving as sign that things are kept clean and there will be attention to detail. Got a date? Take her to Miles. They sell Magners cider in bottles.",4.0

I found the beer i chose to be fantastic. I felt really good about the small cheese plate we had as well. The ambiance is an 8 out of 10. It's small, not too loud and i didn't feel really cramped. My only tiny complaint (and this is more about going out in Bushwick than the location) is that i felt old! I looked around and knew i was the oldest person there (and HINT, i'm not THAT old.) So if you're going there to meet people in their 30s, i don't think this would be the locale. But nice place to go with a friend in their 30s... if you're just talking to them for the night.",4.0
"First time here...pretty crazy how I grew up in this area and seeing all these establishments developing is mind blowing...for good of course..this bar is pretty cozy chill bar. Waitress asked everyone to show your ID before serving a drink but it appears to me she took it to heart as she didn't care how old you looked lol..I'm just saying maybe she can be bit friendlier, you are a bartender.",1.0
The bartender on staff that night (Thursday) was very friendly and could make a hell of a drink.  The place is small  with simple decor however its very appealing (minus the overload on the dog pictures above the door entrance) they make over priced grilled cheese sandwiches and serve it with store brought chips (9$). From my view at the bar I was very impressed with how clean the cold cut slicer was.  The gentleman even cleaned it after every use (which makes up for the over priced grilled cheese if your a germaphobe like myself) this is a place i would definitely go back for drinks,4.0
"I can't say enough about this place!  Bushwick has tons of good bars but this one might head the list for me.  Great vibe, beautiful wines, cocktails with a funky throwback vibe, they spin vinyl on Tuesday (bring an album, they play it start to finish!), mac & cheese Mondays, an amazing dog portrait gallery (and in case you didn't know, Miles is the name of the owner's dog), I could go on and on.  And Jacob the bartender on Tuesday nights is de-lite-full-icious----love him to pieces!",5.0
"Really chill fun bar, drinks are amazing!",5.0
"I loved this spot. Plenty of wine without being stuffy or pretentious, plus an equal amount of cocktails and beer for all tastes. It's a small, warm spot, and I love the weekly specials they have (like bring your own record night and all you can eat Mac and cheese night). Worth a venture out for and I'll absolutely be back for more.",5.0
"Super chill atmosphere, tunes from the 80s & 90s, which is kind of fun & a really nice bartender (gal when I was there)... wish the beers were a bit cheaper, but they're average & besides, I always wish for cheaper beers!",4.0
Came to Miles for cocktails with a friend. After a couple rounds of cocktails we decided to order a cheese and charcuterie plate. The Gouda was amazing! After that our tummies weren't satisfied so we decided to order a grilled cheese sandwich. PHENOMENAL. Definitely plan on coming back.,5.0
"I was looking for a place to have a nice cocktail around my neighborhood and we found this place here on yelp..this was our experience:Nice decoration - The place feels warm and cozy (one star for that) but the music selection is bad. Too hipster popWorst Bartender EVER! - The bartender girl is amazingly rude. I can live with that if you make the good cocktails but this was not the case. She only knows s to garnish them (Another star for that). She will give you a mean look if you ask her for anything that is not on the menu. She can see you in front of her and will ignore you for at least 5 minutes, not even to tell you give me a second, or just to ask you what do you want? I felt really uncomfortable there waiting for her while she was making two drinks and the bar wasn't crazy busy. Then she comes to my table to take my menu (my phone was inside the menu) and throws my phone on the floor and doen't even bother to apologize. She was really defensive and just told me ""It was inside the menu"". She didn't even help me finding it. She just stayed there waiting for everyone else to find it. The cocktails where sub par. We had at least 2 each, plus some food. Left the bar with zero buzz and still hungry. Waste of money. IF YOU'RE A COCKTAIL PERSON, THIS IS NOT YOUR JOINT. Cocktails have to taste good AND get you drunk. These where ""ok"" and had very little alcohol in them.Food was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary. Since we still needed a cocktail fix, we went to THE BEST cocktail bar so far in all NY....with THE BEST bartender ever who EARNS his 40% tip.*Note to all bartenders out there: be nice to your guests. You're not doing anyone a favor by serving booze. Theres hundreds of bars to go to. EARN your tips. The more rude you are, the less people will tip you. They're called TIPS for a reason...not 'mandatory extra money for pouring liquid.'",2.0
The first time I visited I thought the service was subpar.I came back a few months later and the service was better. It's a great establishment with a lovely ambiance. The food options are somewhat limited but the quality makes up for it. The bartender does know how to make some pretty delicious drinks.,4.0

"Best thing to happen to Bushwick in years! Bushwick has been a sea of dive bars and hipster bars, but Miles has somehow managed to develop it's only little niche. I usually go before 10, so if you go before 10, you'll find the light is good enough to read a book. Depending on the bartender working, the music may be classic gems spun on real vinyl records or an ipod with a kind of ""oh yeah, I remember that song..."" play list.The drinks are reasonably priced-- if you're short on cash order Session. It's a nice little beer that's cheap (not in a gross Pork Slap or PBR kind of way) and packs a little punch. Are you Vegan? You'll enjoy the Peak Organic IPA. Not a beer person, very nice wine selection and fresh ingredients for the cocktail connoisseur. I'm tempted to remove a star because they have removed the super yummy (and crazy cheap) $3 hummus plate, but the sandwiches are good (about $9 comes with chips). Looking for something lighter? Go for a cheese plate or a sausage plate both they are $4-$5. So how can this place be so damned good and not be crawling with hipsters? Okay, the annoying people are usually there after 10 and depending on the night of the week, they may invade the space earlier. Still some how this place is just a tad more chill than Tandem.

"Love this place. Come for the yummy cocktails (the ""Violette Beauregarde"" is one of my top 10 cocktails of all time), stay for the beer/shot special ($6 for Brooklyn summer ale and the well liquor of your choice), and for the love of god, please order the cheese. There is nothing better in life than a solid cheese board. And while Miles isn't the best cheese I've had, it's very, very good for the area. I like to go in and order 1 cheese ($4) and one meat ($5), then make a meal out of the lovely arrangement. Seriously, I'd rate the accoutrements to the cheese/meat as the best I've ever had  - Roberta's bread, fig jam that has the addictive properties of crack, delicious mustard and cornichons. 4/5 stars only because I'm fairly picky with what I rate as perfect, and Miles is a leeeetle too expensive to be a 5/5 place. Also, I've had a snotty bartender once who seemed more interested in talking with her franz than, y'know, being a bartender. Oh, but the other times, the service has been top-notch. PS: to the bartender I had two weeks ago, when my friend M and I were both sick as dogs and sniffling our way through heaps of bar napkins - thanks for not, like, giving us the evil eye (obviously our sniffling/coughing wasn't the greatest for the 'atmosphere').",4.0

"Passed by this place a few times on the way home from Morgantown, and took a mental note to drop by. Dim and candlelit, this place definitely had curbside appeal.

I mean, the combined power of all of these factors could not be sexier. We pretty much ordered the works: bottle of wine, both meats, cheese plate, pumpkin soup, short ribs, and cheesecake, all for about $70. Some moderate damage, but well worth it. The meats and cheese were curated well; the cheese was a little on the mild side for our taste but pleasantly subtle. The soup was rich and tasty (though did require a good helping of S&P), and the rib meat fell right off the bone. The salad could have used a more distinct vinaigrette but its simplicity was a good foil to the full, heavy flavor of the rest of the meal. And the cheesecake was super cute, served in a short canning jar. The service was friendly, though when more people were filing in, the bartender's dual role as bartender and server became noticeably compromised. We didn't care too much, but if this place really starts cranking, they will do better with an additional hand. Decor was pared down but was cozier once more people came.

"I moved to Bushwick in January of 2012, I was glad to see that Miles opened up down the street almost as soon as I was unpacked.

The drinks can be a bit pricey when you remember what neighborhood you're in, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying a few drinks every now and then.",4.0
I love the new addition to the neighborhood. The food looks so good! Got there a little too late to try it but it looks amazing (from other people's plates!). The wines they have picked out are great and the atmosphere is perfect. I was already there 2 times in one week!,4.0
"My favorite bar in Bushwick, partially because it's right by my house but also because it's just a chill spot. The vibe here depends on when you go. During the week, it can be a great place to get dinner and drinks with a friend. Chill and quiet (though sometimes the music is really loud). On the weekends, it can get packed but it's still fun. Great drinks, so much variety. I love you, Miles.",5.0
"This is a great little place that recently opened in my neighborhood. It's a welcome addition and so far, their menu has been spot on. The food is freshly made, slow-cooked and absolutely delicious. I can't wait for them to expand the menu. Likewise, the drinks are killer and their Happy Hour is one of the best in the area. 2-for-1 Sierra Nevadas? Yes, please.",4.0
