"I love going to eat at pokito! Really delicious food and cocktails and super friendly bartenders and waitstaff. Not to mention the interior of the place is so special! Painted floors, cool lighting, comfortable atmosphere. Every time I go I try to order something different. Their menu usually has a variety of small plates so you can try lots of different dishes. My favorite drink is definitely the ""rick ross"" (a spicy pear lemonade). Whatever you decide to order make sure to add some yucca fries! Theyre the bomb. Another thing that I loved about my experince at Pokito is that they were very accomodating to my pescatarian diet-- if I wanted to have fish instead of meat they were really cool with me switching it out.",5.0
"I've heard about Pokito for a while now being that I only work a few blocks away.   Decided to give them a try and order some delivery being that I had a discount from Caviar.  Glad I gave them a try because the food is delicious!!  Delivery was massively quick with a friendly delivery guy.  They don't have a huge menu, but what the do have is worth is.  I was slightly bummed that they called to tell me they didn't have any coconut rice (as their menu stated they did).  How can you not have that staple??  I really love the Asian-Latin American twist on the food.  I really only have two words when it comes to this place.  YUCA FRIES!!!  Hot damn they are amazing!  Really soft and fluffy on the inside and the Gochujang mayo (great heat) goes PERFECTLY with them!  I can eat them and use that dip for days on end.  I also got the market bowl.  It was $12 and consisted of grains, grilled sesame eggplant, Japanese yam, seared greens, shiitake, and house pickle.  It was out of this world but they barely filled the take-out container.  You hardly get anything for twelve bucks.  Total rip-off but I must say it was delicious.  I would love to give this place another try.  Have a dine in experience.  If you enjoy Asian and Latin American fusion, then definitely give Pokito a try.",4.0
"LOVE THIS PLACE. Has a very unique feel and is aesthetically awesome. The staff is super friendly and cute. The best part is the menu, though. The food is so different and absolutely delicious. The cocktail menu has its own twist on the classics plus a few of their own specialty cocktails. Have been here a handful of times already and will continue to go and bring friends and family there!",5.0
"Strongly recommended. Tiny place, great service, quirky decor and really delicious food. Nice bar with carefully crafted cocktails.",5.0
Pokito is EVERYTHING I ate here a couple of months ago after drinking down the street at miss favela.  I had the egg plant dish with brown rice which was very tasty. Revisited Pokito a week ago and had empanadas with guava. All the food is very tasty and the aesthetic is calm and cool and relaxed. I love their decorations and use of light. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because waiter kind of messed up our bill. He was kind at least. Overall recommend this place highly!,4.0
"Everything is great here, except for the food. This place is a prime example of when fusion is attempted but the components of the dishes don't quite come together. You can't just throw things together and hope it works. Good food requires thought and effort, and based on what I had here, it's clear that there was effort, but not so much thought. We had the ceviche, eggplant unagi, and crispy rice. Ceviche was probably the best thing, but the large slices of raw radish threw things off. I was surprised by the keebler crackers that came with it. This is still brooklyn right? Or is mass produced shelf stable food in again? Regardless, no points docked there, just mild confusion. Eggplant unagi had 0 unagi but a few pieces of well cooked eggplant that were too salty on top of seemingly unflavored brown rice. Bits of bonito flakes on top didn't add much. I felt like I missed the point of the dish. Lastly, the crispy rice was not what I expected at all. A chunk of rice that was toasted to crispiness on the outside, with an array of yu choy and sliced fruits, topped with excellently grilled salmon. I was again confused because it didn't tie together, someone just decided to put it all together because it looked pretty. Which it did. I was so excited for this place, but I'm definitely not coming back.",3.0
"This is my new favorite place in Williamsburg :). The snacks are delicious and the staff is super friendly and laid back. My friends and i relaxed late into the evening over drinks and we didn't feel any rush to leave. The interior is so beautiful, I felt like i was in a whole different, more tropical, city.",5.0
"Amazing food & drink, love the interior.Came with a group and we tried lots. Everything was really wonderfully seasoned/balanced, intensely fresh and overall just fucking delicious.The crispy rice with salmon was d o p e. I eat a lot of salmon, and can say without exception that this was the most tender, buttery, deliciously cooked salmon I've had in at least a year or two. Just wonderful. Everything in the dish went together beautifully - the radishes looked like rose petals & tasted dreamy, nice sweetness from the kiwi, and amazing turnip greens. Everyone else at the table got the shrimp congee and loved it. Yucca fries were r e a l l y delish and perfectly salted. Also was into the eggplant. Cocktails were strong- loved the sage / sour, a very smoky Margarita, and the aperol spritzers were nice too.overall: GO HERE!!!!!",5.0
"What a gem this place is - I can't believe it took us this long to try it!I came here with my partner on a Wednesday night, the place was pretty empty (which, after eating here surprises me). Our server (also the barman) was warm and efficient. The menu is refreshingly brief with about 7 or 8 items total. We ordered three dishes, the curry empanadas, the fish tacos and the crispy rice. All three were spot on, and perfect for sharing. The empanadas were crispy and umami. The fish tacos were delicious (but could have done with just a touch more acid) - but the star of the show was the Crispy Rice. What a clever dish - simple, healthy and tasty. The salmon was perfectly cooked, the brown rice mixed with the crispy ""bottom of the rice cooker"" rice was just perfect - the bok choy was crunchy and had a lovely taste of the grill. And to top it all off, the prices are super reasonable. We had three dishes and two cocktails for just over 60 bucks. Can't wait to come back - this is exactly how fusion should be done.",5.0
"Had a fantastic meal here. Love the Japanese/Latin twist, keep those yucca fries coming. Cocktails were strong, Presidentes were cold, and each dish was better than the next. Get the yucca fries and ceviche to start, then the crispy brown rice and fish bowl, and then the congee. The specials were on point too. Homemade hot sauce and casabe to start was a nice touch. One thing I'm waiting for is dessert! Check Pokito out ASAP. And I hear their brunch is awesome too. Can't wait to try it.",5.0
"Wow, we got so lucky with this place!  Had tickets to a show at Living Room and got there to find out the band was on two hours later than expected. Decided to get dinner first and remembered seeing ""good margaritas"" attached to ""someplace starting with a 'P' on South 4th"" on Google Maps.  Feeling like Mexican, we wandered over...Holy amazeballs, this place was INSANE.  First, it wasn't Mexican, it was some Japanese/South American fusion, second, the cocktail program was legit. Great decor, friendly service and the food was unique without being out-there weird.  Finding this place by accident was truly a Williamsburg miracle, and we felt like we had seen a messiah when we saw the prices.  I don't know if I'll be back since this isn't really my hood, but I'll be recommending it to anyone heading that way and nearby friends!  My only caveat, it needs a bit more ventilation, the owners did a GREAT job fitting everything comfortably into a tiny space but by they could use a bit more ventilation when frying fish.",4.0

"Excellent food and drinks. This place just feels special, the interior is different in a fun way and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I've been a few times and all the food is good, I especially like the congee and the yuca fries. They changed the menu up a bit recently and all the new additions seemed just as good. My friends got the tacos and raved about them. The drink menu is different and inventive, the sage and sour is delicious. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd definitely be a regular.",5.0
"Pokito is a newish Asian Fusion hole in the wall in South Williamsburg, and the food is goooood. Since it's such a small restaurant I was worried my friends and I would have to wait, but we walked in and got seated immediately. All three of us went for the Crispy Rice Bowl, which we all licked clean. For dessert, our adorable waiter recommended we get the Guava Empanadas, and I'm pretty sure I'll be dreaming of them until I can get back there.",5.0
"The absolute most creative spot in Williamsburg. Its so discreet on the surface that you'd miss it every time, but inside is an absolute gem. The decor is very Caribbean in spirit; lively, colorful, and inviting. Lots of odds and even at play texture-wise in the same way that the cuisine dance between Latino classics and asian-fusion influences. The empanadas are absolutely ahead of their time, the entire menu merits consideration, and Morir Soñando. Just order a Morir Soñando, please.",5.0

We stopped in for a late night bite and got the salmon and congee. I liked both dishes though I thought the dish was a bit peppery. Portions were perfect.,4.0
Really good empanadas. Awesome yuca fries and plantains. Also really great matcha drink I think it's called the matcha mama,5.0
"This place is awesome. If you like laid back atmosphere that's aesthetically easy on the eyes then come here. Small plates Asian/Latin fusion style and strong cocktails. Had the Shrimp Congee and it was delicious and well-balanced. Empanadas delish and all dishes come from the downstairs kitchen via a ""Dumb Waiter"". Simple menu with class and decently priced!",5.0
