"Service was okay. We ended up waiting more than we needed to because we had been standing outside like the rest of the crowd and the server didn't think to come out and ask for us. We were also never offered bread for our table before our meal. We ordered two pizzas and the fried calamari. The calamari was pretty good. I really liked how there were a variety of different things- we got fried broccoli, artichokes, shrimp, fish, and calamari! The amount of sauce they give you is pretty stingy, though.The margherita pizza was really good! The special pizza had some kind of green sauce that tasted like liquid celery/spinach, but it was really overpowering and quite frankly the only thing we tasted... The pizza was still pretty good. The dough was quite chewy and delicious!",4.0

"Came here recently for, I think, the fourth time. And while, in general, I love this place, my review this time is mixed. We started with a very nice salad that was a large bowl filled with red watercress, walnuts and goat cheese. I had a house red that was not particularly impressive. To make it even less so, they serve it in a little water glass while, if you order anything other than a house wine, you get a real wine glass. Not too subliminal this message, methinks. My dining partner ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, if I remember correctly, that, very disappointingly happened to be a little oxidized. Happily, our dinners were better than our wine choices. I had the tagliatelle with a Bolognese sauce. My son-in-law had a spaghetti marinara that had a dark garlicky sauce that was rich and absolutely delicious!",3.0
"The hype is real.Saraghina is an innovative pizza place that really excels in experimental, silly pies. The crust is thin, the red sauce is tangy, and the ambiance is very comfortable. It's good for a date or good for groups. Skip the appetizers so you can get more pizza. I was a huge fan of the focaccia special - It's basically another pizza, but topped with goat cheese, caramel, sea salt, pink peppercorns, and microgreens. I haven't ever had anything quite like it before.",4.0
"Was really looking forward to try their pizza since a friend insisted how it is better than Roberta's.Pizza tastes great but i wish the temperature could be hotter. Despite it just came to our table, i picked up the first slice and it's like lukewarmAlready. Barely could we finish the first slice, we decided to ask the server if he could reheat the pizza.It was until 15 mins later, another server returned the pizza looking a bit burnt which we understand but the pizza is still way under the temperature. Can you imagine how disappointed that you ordered a pizza with mozzarella cheese and the cheese is already cold and become so chewy upon the first bite? ColdPizza on winter night!??? Thats how disappointed i was eating this pizza.We also ordered a can of soda which the server forgot to bring until we had finished the wholePizza. So i asked to cancel the order politely but another server still brought the soda to our empty table after. No sorry, no apologize, no nothing! I guess this is quiet the Brooklyn attitude.I am not sure if the kitchen of this place is super cold during winter or if the server/runner is too busy to run food to tables when pizza is ready so why the pizza is already cold at the table. I guess i should just stick with Roberta's for good pizza.   .\/.",3.0

"Came to Brooklyn for an event and when in New York is a must to have pizza... Opened up yelp and saw that this place was highly recommended by Yelpers ...When inside ordered house salad and a pizza ... House salad was OK it was fresh so I guess it was good nothing special...The pizza was bland nothing special about it... I think your local pizzeria has better pizza... It was bland no flavor ... No taste stood out ....Yelpers raved about how great this place... I didn't taste what all the fuss was about..At least not the food ,service was great but the pizza not so much..PS. The pizza needs some flavor",3.0

"Upon walking into saraghina, my friend and I were taken by the rustic, cozy atmosphere presented by both the decor, but also the staff. Everyone was very humble and mild mannered. It did not feel like other restaurants in trendy Brooklyn neighborhoods who are inauthentic. We were quickly seated, offered water, and enjoyed some of the best bloody Mary's in Brooklyn. However, I don't think I will be returning. I ordered blueberry & ricotta pancakes ($11). Not wildly expensive by any means. But when they came to the table, I was surprised by the unusually small plate of feebly, thin pancakes (topped with some blueberries) and decorated with whipped cream. It looked nice. However, for $11, and a $10 Bloody Mary, I was ready to have breakfast. Whole I admit I can quickly inhale a diner-portioned breakfast, I'm also quick to understand and recognize appropriately portioned food. My friend had ordered a burger ($15) with added bacon (addition $2, $17). When he received his food, another problem of proportions. A very average burger. Not bad by any means, but I'm no way worth $17. He, less insatiable than I, had also been a bit put off by the portion of his nearly $20 meal. I will end with praise. Saraghina is a great spot. Maybe not for breakfast, but if what you need, after a long night (or not) is a nice hot coffee and a Bloody Mary, head on in. But sit at the counter, and maybe don't bank on satisfying your appetite.",3.0
"Had such a wonderful dining experience here this past weekend! After a long day of exploring Manhattan, my cousin really wanted to show me her ""neighborhood spot"" for dinner. Only a 15min walk away from her new apartment in Brooklyn, we got to the restaurant as the dinner rush died down. There was still a wait, since we had a larger party, but there's a fully stocked bar that acts as a very welcome waiting area for anyone looking to get a few drinks in before a meal (aka me). Saraghina's atmosphere is comfy, cozy, and chill, with its staff reflecting those same vibes. Also, super helpful since one of our friends forgot her phone when we left the restaurant and our waiter (shoutout to Jeremy) held on to it for her.  Not to mention, the food was delicious!

"This is a beautiful restaurant, bigger than it seems as the kitchen sits in the center. There's rooms.

The service was a little slow, but I would more describe it as ""relaxed"", and I was able to catch up with my friends while we waited to order! The menu is well curated and there's a LOT to try. Pizza: We had a winter vegetable pizza, topped with mozzarella, ricotta, butternut squash, collards, onions and garlic. The squash and caramelized onions were sweet, the ricotta and mozzarella rich, and the collards crispy. It was very balanced and good. Fried calamari: This isn't just calamari - it's also fried fish (haddock that day, I believe) and vegetables. It comes with a dipping sauce, and it's incredible. We squeezed lemon over it and it was perfectly seasoned, salted, everything. Cheese Plate: Definitely one of the better cheese plates I've had. It came with some sort of parmesan, two softer nutty cheeses, and a really soft goat or sheep cheese (that's my guess). There was orange marmalade, walnuts, and crostini served with it.  Roasted Sunchokes: served with almond puree and mustard aioli and frisee. We took a gamble on this because none of us have had a jerusalem artichoke, but they taste almost just like fingerling potatoes. The aioli was fantastic. This is a must try, if you're looking for something different! I ordered a pilsner on draft, which was so refreshing to drink with pizza. Pro tip- there's a great little Saraghina store next door, and you can buy $1 pastries in the evening, and also buy coffee beans which if you bring to the restaurant, they will grind for free.

"I've been to Saraghina a number of times at this point, and kept coming back because it always provided a great experience: both food and atmosphere-wise. However, after my most recent brunch there I think I'll take some time to come back. Here's why:- The service was a flop. As somebody who worked in the service industry, I always refrain from being mean or over-demanding to my servers. It took a while to place our order after we were given our menus. - The food came out very slowly and poorly timed. I was with one other person and he received their order about 10-15 mins before I received my own. By the time I got my food, he was about 3/4 done with his food.- I made eye contact with a couple of the servers, and it seemed like they were trying to avoid me. We didn't get two of our orders out, so even in attempting to remind them that our orders were forgotten we faced two wait times: one for the server to give us attention, and the other one waiting for food to come out (food that was poorly-timed to begin with). It's a real shame, because Saraghina has been a true gem in this area of Brooklyn and it would be unfortunate to see it fail because of poor service.",2.0
"I've lived up the street from saraghina for years and just now stopped in. I'm not sure why it took me so long. Maybe because it seemed like a hipster haven.

Whatever the reason, I am very upset at myself for not stopping in sooner. The pizza is so fresh and not overpriced at all. And friend and I split the margherita pizza. My only regret is not getting my own. Yes I would have been stuffed but my tastebuds would have been overjoyed.",4.0

The final straw was someone leaning across my dinner with their elbow in my face, to pick up the cocktail menu, so I asked to move slightly to the side, which I was told was fine and was left to pick up my dinner and drinks and belongings and move them across the bar myself.My red wine was served in a rocks glass (short glass) which is a little too hipster for my tastebuds. I ate the lasagne which was filling and very creamy. The fresh bread with butter was really nice. But all in all my dining experience wasn't an enjoyable one. I think this place may be better visited as a group. I get the impression that the yard is a nice place to sit for dinner.",2.0
"Why you should come here:  Saraghina captures ""The New Brooklyn"" at this moment better than most any other restaurant.  It is a great place to take out-of-town visitors to give them New Brooklyn memories they can take home with them.  There is often a wait on weekend nights and sometimes for brunch but the cocktails are good and can tide you over.Recommended Cocktail: September in Milano, a nice smooth base with just a hint of spice makes this a winner again and again.Recommended Wine: Full carafe of the house red - nice, bold and dry. Depending on your pizza, the flavors can overpower many of the subtler wines on the menu.Recommended Pie(s): To me, the crust is the star of Saraghina so a Margherita is really a joy.  If you want something more, despite the extreme flavors, the Coppa & Carciofi ends up pretty balanced.Ambiance: The layout of the restaurant creates strange lighting and unique spaces that having been changing every so often as the management has experimented with the layout.  The space feels intimate despite being rather noisy.Recommendation: Come for an early dinner with a friend or two, sip a cocktail or two while you wait and enjoy a large pie and a Misto.",4.0
"Yummmmmy!! Chill ambiance low lighting Christmas lights nice vibe good music...Service was good can't complain..Drinks were amazing.. I had the margarita Italiano made with rosemary tequila and it was phenomenal I had to order another round even though I wasn't planning on it...To eat : special pizza w/ chorizo, pickled something (can't remember) and cheese 10/10 A+Burrata - burrata is burrata. Hard to fuck up. Really good for cheese lovers. Tasted fresh but just came over lettuce and the presentation wasn't that great. I've had better but still good!! Risotto - yes. Love Gorgonzola so it was great and the balsamic helped. Only thing is it was a bit liquidy. It should have been more coarse like a cheesy rice. Great flavor though I will definitely be back!!!! So so good!!!",4.0
"I fell in love with this place last year after ordering a personal size vegetable pizza. It was so good and everything on the pizza taste freshly picked and prepared!!!! After this experience and a few recommendations, I decided to venture into trying their coffee and I'm glad that I did. This place is perfect for those days when you want to take a mental trip to Italy. I sit there and often feel as if I'm sitting at a cafe somewhere in the city of Venice while my taste buds are swept away by the taste of authentic Italian cuisines. I love it!!!!!",4.0

"Very overrated. The pizza wasn't as incredible as everyone had made it out to be. More than anything, the service was such a let-down. The waiters are very entitled to the exaggerated level.. I came alone and yes I was willing to spend a lot- I was hungry. But they saw me as a cheap check and decided to not come around. But it took them 20 minutes to get my order, 30 to bring me a coffee.. literally isn't worth it. I left heart broken because of my expectations but never let the hype get in the way of treating paying customers with respect..",2.0
"I've been to Saraghina a number of times at this point, and kept coming back because it always provided a great experience: both food and atmosphere-wise. However, after my most recent brunch there I think I'll take some time to come back. Here's why:- The service was a flop. As somebody who worked in the service industry, I always refrain from being mean or over-demanding to my servers. It took a while to place our order after we were given our menus. - The food came out very slowly and poorly timed. I was with one other person and he received their order about 10-15 mins before I received my own. By the time I got my food, he was about 3/4 done with his food.- I made eye contact with a couple of the servers, and it seemed like they were trying to avoid me. We didn't get two of our orders out, so even in attempting to remind them that our orders were forgotten we faced two wait times: one for the server to give us attention, and the other one waiting for food to come out (food that was poorly-timed to begin with). It's a real shame, because Saraghina has been a true gem in this area of Brooklyn and it would be unfortunate to see it fail because of poor service.",2.0
"I've lived up the street from saraghina for years and just now stopped in. I'm not sure why it took me so long. Maybe because it seemed like a hipster haven. Or maybe because I assumed it was over priced and over raved about. Or maybe because it's so close to home that I didn't consider it. Whatever the reason, I am very upset at myself for not stopping in sooner. The pizza is so fresh and not overpriced at all. And friend and I split the margherita pizza. My only regret is not getting my own. Yes I would have been stuffed but my tastebuds would have been overjoyed.",4.0

"An adorably intimate outpost with top notch pizza unceremoniously stuck into an otherwise drab yet up and coming neighborhood. No, I'm not talking about Roberta's eight years ago. Although if Roberta's is a bellwether, then Bed-Stuy (or more specifically the even less gentrified Stuyvesant Heights) has got some transformation on the horizon. With candlelight tables and shabby-chic wooden adornment, Serghina has perfected the urban-rustic atmosphere.  We ordered a beet salad, the octopus, and of course a margarita pizza. All were flawlessly scrumptious. After polishing off a few expertly mixed negronis, we rounded out the evening with a divine meringue desert dish. Because Sereghina is cash only, I had to dash across the street to an ATM in what could have been a Chinese place or a chicken joint-- there was a guarded anti-theft take-out window that blocked the public from seeing into the establishment. As I nervously got out cash, there was a women incomprehensibly communicating with the wall as halogen lights flickered. The 2 minute ATM odyssey served as a stark reminder that I was deep in the cultural desert that is the stabby part Bed-Stuy, albeit having found magical oasis of wood-fired pizza and craft cocktails.

"Last Friday, June 12th 2015, I was part of a 17 person, family dinner here. It was the day before my girlfriend's nephews wedding. We gathered here as a sort of ""rehearsal dinner"". I flew in just 2 days prior from Portland, OR and had never been to Brooklyn before. I was told we were going out for pizza. When we arrived I found out that we were in for so much more than pizza. This ended up being one of the best meals of my life. Truly. It was 8 or 9 courses (so many I lost count). I will also quickly interject that our primary waiter (we had several) was just fantastic. He knew everything about every dish and was able to answer every question we had about each of the dishes. He also did this very happily and with joy. He was great!It started with a charcuterie and fromage plate. This included several meats and cheeses along with a wonderful assortment of olives. This alone set my night off as they were wonderful. I could have dined on this and a nice glass or two of red wine but this was only the beginning! I will try to remember the order of the courses. I know that soon after this we were served a mixture of fresh, raw vegetables. Snap peas, green beans, fiddleheads, fava beans and they were tossed in a light olive oil. Fantastic.A simple (by NO MEANS lackluster) spaghetti made with home made pasta and a sauce consisting of two types of fresh tomatoes, basil and oregano. Simple but utterly delicious. Octopus ceviche with vegetables. OMG! The most tender, melt in your mouth octopus I've ever had (maybe my favorite course of the night)Brick oven, hand tossed pizza. Whole basil leaves, incredible sauce, this too did not disappointI grilled white fish (I never found out what kind of fish) served with the head and also with vegetables. Tender, perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and so moist and flaky on the inside.I should add that as we ate, carafes of the very tasty Cabernet Sauvignon house wine kept being delivered to the table. It was very well balanced and a perfect compliment to the whole meal.Just when I thought I could eat no more, it was announce that the final course was being brought out..... RIBEYE STEAKS! Good lord, grilled to absolute perfection! Medium rare and seasoned properly with salt and pepper. I know I am missing a thing or two from the night but can you blame me? Senses in total overload. I am a total foodie. I love to cook and I love to eat and Saraghina was one of the finest dining experiences of my life. If you're in Brooklyn, you have to go here. If you're not, take the subway, take a cab, steal a bike but get there. You will be overjoyed by the experience.",5.0

"One of the best place we've tried in NY.First advice, come before 8pm or the place will be crowded. We arrived at 7.30, have been prompted we could wait 20min for a table of 2.We took place at the bar where we ordered drinks. Soft drinks are cheap, cocktails are at reasonable prices.The guy in charge of the bar was nice, efficient, always smiling and joking, even when it was rush hour.He asked if we wanted to eat here, rather than waiting for a table. As the atmosphere was perfect, we decided to give it a try. BEST CHOICE EVER.We ordered a Prosciutto pizza and a Crostini toast. The second dish have been served quite fast, as the pizza arrived a bit later, because it was rushing time in the pizza oven. Honestly, the serving time was more than correct, and they apologized twice for the waiting time. Some should take notes of how these young fellas run their business...Anyway, everything went good till now, but was it good? The most important part is here...It was EXCELLENT. Everything was fresh, the pizza pie was perfect and thin, wood oven cooked, good olive oil, great fresh mozzarella cheese.We finished with a hot chocolate, and it was good too, and fastly served.Finally, the check. $35 for 2 is more than reasonable for a good dinner, good atmosphere, good people and good music! Gave 15% tip without any hesitation.I couldnt recommend this place more. Go there if you're a cool people, you'll feel like at home, but you'll eat better :-D",5.0

"Really disheartened by my experience today. I am going to preface this review by saying that I am a waiter and have worked in restaurants for years, so I am very understanding. I've been wanting to try Saraghina for a while now. I live in the neighborhood and have been trying to go with my boyfriend for months. Today, on a day off to myself, I decided to go. I was sat immediately in the garden area. There were 6 other tables in the area and two servers. I sat at my table with the menu closed for TEN minutes. In those ten minutes, no one came up to me, no one acknowledged my presence. As a waiter myself, I know that when I am in the weeds and I have a new table, I make it a point to go to that table and say to them, ""hello there, my name is Anthony, give me a few minutes and I will be with you"" this lets the guests know that you actually care about them. So I had to flag down a waiter who was bussing a table to come take my order. I got a glass of wine, the romana salad and the marguerita pizza. The salad was delicious, except a few bites into my salad I notice the apple slices that come with the salad still have the sticker on it! I let a waitress know and she brings me a new salad. When the pizza comes, it is disappointingly greasy, and the crust lacks any crunch you expect from a pizza oven. The waitstaff never checked in throughout my meal to see if I enjoyed what I ordered. When I asked for the bill, I noticed they charged me for everything. I really don't mind paying for what I ordered of course, but the smart thing for the restaurant to do when I waited an inordinate amount of time for the restaurant to acknowledge my presence and for my salad to still have the apple stickers on it would be to AT LEAST comp the glass of wine I ordered. If I were the server, I would go immediately to my manager and ask what we could do for the guest. I was disgusted, paid my bill and left. I'm never coming here again.",2.0
"The pizza here is more on the gourmet side than places like Grimaldi's, so it does taste different than if you're expecting classic NY pizza. If you like fresh ingredients though and appreciate tasting the natural sourness of the tomatoes in the pizza sauce, Saraghina's is the right place to be. The restaurant btw has a hipster atmosphere here, but i liked the mood they created with the oldies music and restaurant decor. I didn't seem to encounter the poor service that others have mentioned in the reviews so I guess I'll just count myself lucky this time. Thanks to that, we really loved our pizza experience. We found our food to arrive quickly and servers were always around when we needed them. My friends and I ordered the Margherita and also the Funghi e Prosciutto. Both were great but I loved the mushroom pizza more. I did notice that there wasn't as much prosciutto on our pizza as compared to a yelp picture I saw, but the mushrooms were just so fresh and flavorful, that I'll just kind-of forgive them for skimping out on the prosciutto this time. There are other Italian dishes besides pizza here, and my friends actually ordered some ziti pasta. The pasta looked like it was going to be great in the meat sauce, but I was surprised when it tasted on the plain side. However, 5/5 stars still holds because the pizza is just so good here. I forgot to mention but both pizzas came delivered to our table still very hot and DELICIOUS...ugh nothing beats pizza still warm from the oven. I'd definitely come back to Saraghina's.",5.0
"Cash only****During a recent visit to NYC with a few friends, it was suggested by one of them who lived in Brooklyn to visit this place. Make sure you go there with an empty stomach and please take advantage of their wood fire oven and order a pizza!!! There pizza selection is phenomenal, as well as the selection of cheese and cured meat for appetizers. Service was a little off that night, took them a long time to take or order, bring out the food and even get us the bill.. Quality of food did compensate for the service but it was definitely something we were not pleased about.. Other than that I do think that if you're in the neighborhood you need to visit it!!",5.0

It was very well balanced and a perfect compliment to the whole meal.Just when I thought I could eat no more, it was announce that the final course was being brought out..... RIBEYE STEAKS! Good lord, grilled to absolute perfection! Medium rare and seasoned properly with salt and pepper. I know I am missing a thing or two from the night but can you blame me? Senses in total overload. I am a total foodie. I love to cook and I love to eat and Saraghina was one of the finest dining experiences of my life. If you're in Brooklyn, you have to go here. If you're not, take the subway, take a cab, steal a bike but get there. You will be overjoyed by the experience.",5.0
"One of the highlights of the neighborhood, which means the wait can sometimes be long. Usually pretty happy with everything, but occasionally the pizza is a little underdone for my taste. Good cocktails, like the ambiance which is like rustic Brooklyn urban farmhouse.",4.0
"One of the best place we've tried in NY.First advice, come before 8pm or the place will be crowded. We arrived at 7.30, have been prompted we could wait 20min for a table of 2.We took place at the bar where we ordered drinks. Soft drinks are cheap, cocktails are at reasonable prices.The guy in charge of the bar was nice, efficient, always smiling and joking, even when it was rush hour.He asked if we wanted to eat here, rather than waiting for a table. As the atmosphere was perfect, we decided to give it a try. BEST CHOICE EVER.We ordered a Prosciutto pizza and a Crostini toast. The second dish have been served quite fast, as the pizza arrived a bit later, because it was rushing time in the pizza oven. Honestly, the serving time was more than correct, and they apologized twice for the waiting time. Some should take notes of how these young fellas run their business...Anyway, everything went good till now, but was it good? The most important part is here...It was EXCELLENT. Everything was fresh, the pizza pie was perfect and thin, wood oven cooked, good olive oil, great fresh mozzarella cheese.We finished with a hot chocolate, and it was good too, and fastly served.Finally, the check. $35 for 2 is more than reasonable for a good dinner, good atmosphere, good people and good music! Gave 15% tip without any hesitation.I couldnt recommend this place more. Go there if you're a cool people, you'll feel like at home, but you'll eat better :-D",5.0

"Really disheartened by my experience today. I am going to preface this review by saying that I am a waiter and have worked in restaurants for years, so I am very understanding. I've been wanting to try Saraghina for a while now. I live in the neighborhood and have been trying to go with my boyfriend for months. Today, on a day off to myself, I decided to go. I was sat immediately in the garden area. There were 6 other tables in the area and two servers. I sat at my table with the menu closed for TEN minutes. In those ten minutes, no one came up to me, no one acknowledged my presence. As a waiter myself, I know that when I am in the weeds and I have a new table, I make it a point to go to that table and say to them, ""hello there, my name is Anthony, give me a few minutes and I will be with you"" this lets the guests know that you actually care about them. So I had to flag down a waiter who was bussing a table to come take my order. I got a glass of wine, the romana salad and the marguerita pizza. The salad was delicious, except a few bites into my salad I notice the apple slices that come with the salad still have the sticker on it! I let a waitress know and she brings me a new salad. When the pizza comes, it is disappointingly greasy, and the crust lacks any crunch you expect from a pizza oven. The waitstaff never checked in throughout my meal to see if I enjoyed what I ordered. When I asked for the bill, I noticed they charged me for everything. I really don't mind paying for what I ordered of course, but the smart thing for the restaurant to do when I waited an inordinate amount of time for the restaurant to acknowledge my presence and for my salad to still have the apple stickers on it would be to AT LEAST comp the glass of wine I ordered. If I were the server, I would go immediately to my manager and ask what we could do for the guest. I was disgusted, paid my bill and left. I'm never coming here again.",2.0
"The pizza here is more on the gourmet side than places like Grimaldi's, so it does taste different than if you're expecting classic NY pizza. If you like fresh ingredients though and appreciate tasting the natural sourness of the tomatoes in the pizza sauce, Saraghina's is the right place to be. The restaurant btw has a hipster atmosphere here, but i liked the mood they created with the oldies music and restaurant decor. I didn't seem to encounter the poor service that others have mentioned in the reviews so I guess I'll just count myself lucky this time. Thanks to that, we really loved our pizza experience. We found our food to arrive quickly and servers were always around when we needed them. My friends and I ordered the Margherita and also the Funghi e Prosciutto. Both were great but I loved the mushroom pizza more. I did notice that there wasn't as much prosciutto on our pizza as compared to a yelp picture I saw, but the mushrooms were just so fresh and flavorful, that I'll just kind-of forgive them for skimping out on the prosciutto this time. There are other Italian dishes besides pizza here, and my friends actually ordered some ziti pasta. The pasta looked like it was going to be great in the meat sauce, but I was surprised when it tasted on the plain side. However, 5/5 stars still holds because the pizza is just so good here. I forgot to mention but both pizzas came delivered to our table still very hot and DELICIOUS...ugh nothing beats pizza still warm from the oven. I'd definitely come back to Saraghina's.",5.0
"Cash only****During a recent visit to NYC with a few friends, it was suggested by one of them who lived in Brooklyn to visit this place. Make sure you go there with an empty stomach and please take advantage of their wood fire oven and order a pizza!!! There pizza selection is phenomenal, as well as the selection of cheese and cured meat for appetizers. Service was a little off that night, took them a long time to take or order, bring out the food and even get us the bill.. Quality of food did compensate for the service but it was definitely something we were not pleased about.. Other than that I do think that if you're in the neighborhood you need to visit it!!",5.0
"The management here is lacking.  There were no waiters- we were served by hostesses and busboys for our lunch.  They were incredibly nice but not servers.  It was more like everybody was covering for the other.SERVICEWe waited almost 35 minutes for pizza and there were only 3 or so parties consisting of one or two people.  They clearly forgot us because the busboy repeatedly asked us what we ordered and promised it would be out in ""5 minutes"" and assured us ""don't worry- life is great"" A kid was roaming and grabbed our pizza crust - later his mom chased him and grabbed our cutlery from our table and moved it!!  There should have been more waitstaff to control the dining area.When the 'server' asked how my food was- I told her not good and she walked off!  I assumed that she didn't know the protocol when the food is burnt and the ingredients are missing.PIZZAThe pizza was mediocre.   I ordered the Margherita.  Sauce tasted fantastic.  Crust was burnt and not in a rustic flavorful way.   More so in a 'oops we forgot the order toss in in there and cook ASAP way'.  For $13, the equivalent of 2 good slices, the 2 sprinkles of basil leaves on a pizza based on BASIL =  a huge disappointment.  And the basil was burnt to the point it shriveled up and tasted like dry seasoning.  Which sucks when you walk somewhere to taste fresh sweet basil as a topping.BEERBeer selection was awful- only 2 draft picks!$9 drafts at noon while showing the World Cup? In Brooklyn?In Conclusion...Do yourself a favor and caveat emptor when considering this joint- check back in later when the manager is working.  It's got potential but it probably got too relaxed with high ratings.  And if you do go- hopefully the staff doesn't take a hit in tips- they were really nice!Not worth the slice.",2.0
"I stopped in at Saraghina with my brother on a recent weeknight to grab a couple pizzas for take-out. I ordered the margherita and he had the ortolana.While we waited for our pizzas, we had a couple beers at the bar. The bartender was very friendly, and we both appreciated being given a small glass of water without asking. Our cashier was a turd with an avant-garde haircut and a terrible attitude. The pies were well above average even after an 8 block walk home, but a bit greasy. The mozzarella and sauce melt together nicely on the margherita, but the crust and bottom could've used much more char, or at least another minute in the oven. my brother wasn't overwhelmed by his ortolana, but definitely didn't find fault with it. Not the best napolitano style place I've tried in New York, but not bad by a long stretch. Quality ingredients and a nice space, just a little... uneven. At least one reviewer claims they accept credit cards, but this wasn't the case when we visited. Their website also states cash only.",4.0
"I came, I saw, I yawned, and I spent way too much on a cadillac margarita that tasted like mop water. I actually would like my money back (all $16-17). I tried to explain to another bartender how sorely upset I was about the bauched margarita but he seemed too preoccupied and didn't want to ruffle feathers. So I decided to come home and right a review. I live very close (Malcolm X/Halsey) and it would be nice to go to a bar that could muster up the moxy to mix together a lemon-lime, tequila-based elixir that's not too sour or too grainy (because of the poorly chosen tequila). But I get it, the hipsters of WillyB have found their way to BedStuy and the bartenders are left to only serve craft beers and whiskey drinks; therefore, tequila drinkers get no love. A great margarita will bring out the flavors of the tequila. The peppery and grassy notes that I'm very accustomed to. You had this reposado (1921?), it was gross. How about getting something like Herradura, Espolon, Don Julio, and you can't go wrong with 1800. These tequilas are made from 100% agave and individually they bring out the agave cactus' various characteristics. In addition, the liquer that was used was all wrong. When I have a cadillac margarita, it's made with Grand Marnier, and sometimes, Cointreau. You have some off brand that did not work well with the tequila. Or the drink as a whole. Now, if yall need some help on ways to make a good Cadillac margarita yall can message me and I can come over and meet everyone and I'll do a workshop that will address the key elements of a great margarita ;).I hope to be back for a better cadillac margarita.

I'm sorry- it's 2016, it's time to take cards. There's no excuse why they don't. Also- this isn't a tiny Mom-and-Pop limited business joint that would justify a cash-only policy. Get real. If the local coffeeshop and independent yoga teachers can swipe your card with Square, then you guys can upgrade to taking cards. Or maybe there's a good reason ($$$$$) why you refuse to?",3.0
"I'm a fan. I've visited several times and have never been disappointed. Brunch and dinner both, equally delicious. I'll be back soon!PW",5.0
"I can finally cross Saraghina off my must try pizza list. This restaurant is almost too charming to deal with, but the atmosphere adds to the pizza experience. The wait on a Saturday night was about 15-20 minutes, but it went fast and the hostess was very sweet. Our waiter was happy to see us and checked in through out the meal. I had the ortolana (woo veggies) and my date the prosciutto & funghi, and we split a half litre of the house red. The pizza had a great chewy crust, and the mozzarella was the stuff of dreams. The litre of wine is such a good deal, and helps add a cozy/romantic vibe to your meal (well, at least it did for mine). Once seated, we didn't feel rushed or forgotten. Cash only, but they have an ATM onsite in case you forget. Would love to come and see how they do brunch.",4.0
"Great decor, love the rustic modern look thru out. There's backyard space n excellent service. The pizza is very good as well as the calamari. The energy of the place was comfortable enough for me to bring my 3 kids on a Wednesday nite the second time around.",5.0
Great place for drinks and a small bite or a full meal.  It is really cozy and comfortable in here and the service is laid back but attentive to your needs.  I really liked their pizzas and salads the most.,5.0
"Brunch on Memorial Day weekend...the food was really good. Nice selection of yummy pizzas...a stellar margarita...French toast for dessert is always a solid way to end a meal and Saraghina kills it here. The service was terribly terribly slow and I'm just going to say that in willing to chalk it up to it being under staffed for the holiday and absolutely give it another go. This time, it the big backyard!! Cash only folks...don't forget! There's an ATM just in case.",4.0
"I want to love you, Saraghina. I want to.Update: I went back and tried the pizza; it was delicious. Seriously. My partner and I split some calamari and a half-liter of house wine, which was great. Then we both got food poisoning! Both of us were unbelievably sick for almost a day afterwards. So, that sucked. I would have overlooked it if it was just one of us, but seriously. Clean up your kitchen and store your seafood responsibly! It's hard to keep eating your food when it doesn't stay down.",2.0

"This is my local bar, and I can't get enough of this place. Great for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and now, COCKTAILS! Branden is a great bartender, he always takes care of us when we come by. Although it's a bit small, the atmosphere is perfect.",5.0

Been here a few times and absolutely love the ambiance. The food is also really good. I recently tried the marinara pizza (no cheese) and it was a delicious light summery treat. Highly recommend this place for breakfast (love their coffee). Only downside is I got attacked by Mosquitos on the patio and the waiter brought me bug spray!,4.0
"Off the charts great food. My recommendation is to have every person get something different so that plates can be shared. The best sandwich here is the Havana. It's so good that you may not be able to eat it in front of polite people. Flying food and elbows is all folks will see. And the pizza is incredible. The regular brunch stuff holds up well but isn't anything to write home about, it's just good. But because they do everything else so well you almost forgive this.",5.0
"I've been going to this place fora few years and though the food is very good the service is so bad I will not be going back.  I don't quite understand why a business that holds such a high standard for quality of ingredients would allow all the FOH people to look and act like a bunch of snotty hipster brats who just rolled out of bed.  While eating here you are guaranteed to be annoyed by extremely slow and sporadic table service, rude staff, and on more than one occasion I have had to ask a manager correct my bill because we had been over-charged for items mysteriously added to our ticket.  Bottom Line....The  bartenders are talented and show a passion for their work. The food is very good, but in no way worth the lofty price tag when the service staff would be better suited to work a college dining hall.  If you do risk it...double-check your bill.",2.0

Also, all the salads are delicious (the watercress, crab, and avocado one is my favorite) and for dessert I usually always go with the tiramisu (but I also like the chocolate mousse).The service is usually really good and we like all the waiters (some have been working there since the start). However, it does get really crowded on weekends for brunch and dinner. Atmosphere is really nice and during the spring/summer the garden patio is open.ALSO, the bar is open in the mornings for coffee and I stop in nearly every day for an iced coffee (and sometimes, a pastry).

Four of us went for a leisurely brunch on Sunday and no complaints at all.

"$18 for a small pizza is giving the finger to most of the community living in this neighborhood. They can't afford it. This will be rectified soon. They are being quickly pushed out by people who can. Even if you can afford it, even if your heart is cold enough not to care that the rising tide only lifts white boats as it gradually washes out the black community, it's still not worth it. Good ingredients, poor execution. Of course those Wall Street pricks on a balcony overlooking the Occupy protesters didn't give a shit that they were drinking overpriced champaign either. Their ill-gotten gains came cheap (for them), and it was so worth drinking it right in the protesters' faces. For some added irony this is written on the outside wall, for all the neighbors who can't afford to come in to see every day: ""If life doesn't give you a door, climb out of a window.""",1.0
"Solid ""eh."" No vegan options, had to ask for something special. The house white wine was not very good. And the server rushed us.. Came to our table three times to ask us if we were ready yet, when we clearly weren't. It's worth it to come here if you live in the neighborhood (since there's not much else) but they should add at least one vegan option.",3.0
"I moved away from this neighborhood less than a year ago and miss Saraghina terribly. This was a go to spot for me and my friends. The pizza is DELICIOUS (try the prosciutto & funghi and the coppa & carciofi pizzas), the cocktails are yummy,and when the weather is nice you can't beat the patio out back. The only drawback is that it's cash only, but they have an ATM inside.",4.0
"There's a lot of good to say about this restaurant.  The atmosphere is nice and homey, with a great outdoor space in back.  The old, nearly falling apart tables are, while neat in theory, a bit obnoxious to deal with when sitting at - but in the grand scheme, that's neither here nor there.The pizza is very good.  I'm not talking NYC good, I'm talking Italian good.  A friend of mine suggested that their first time the pizza crust was a bit crunchier, which I prefer.  While they don't quite salt the dough enough, it was still very good.  They do an excellent sauce, and the ingredients seem very fresh.  The flat bread with ricotta with an extra dash of salt is very refreshing.The house cabernet is enjoyable and simple, and more importantly, affordable.  $15 for a half liter is hard to come by in NYC (eating/drinking out anyway).  Though, as for the prices in general, everything feels about 10% too expensive. The food is absolutely good, but the trek to and location of the restaurant don't seem to be calculated here.  I have no doubt that Saraghina doesn't struggle, but as a customer that would like to return, that'd be a point worth noting.  I'll be back one day.",4.0
"Of course, the Neapolitan pizza coming fresh out of the wood-fire oven is fantastic, but there's so much more to the Sarahina. The goat cheese salad, the beets, the burrata, the cauliflower... all of those are amazing. Highly recommended.",5.0

"$18 for a small pizza is giving the finger to most of the community living in this neighborhood. They can't afford it. This will be rectified soon. They are being quickly pushed out by people who can. Even if you can afford it, even if your heart is cold enough not to care that the rising tide only lifts white boats as it gradually washes out the black community, it's still not worth it. Good ingredients, poor execution. Of course those Wall Street pricks on a balcony overlooking the Occupy protesters didn't give a shit that they were drinking overpriced champaign either. Their ill-gotten gains came cheap (for them), and it was so worth drinking it right in the protesters' faces. For some added irony this is written on the outside wall, for all the neighbors who can't afford to come in to see every day: ""If life doesn't give you a door, climb out of a window.""",1.0
"Solid ""eh."" No vegan options, had to ask for something special. The house white wine was not very good. And the server rushed us.. Came to our table three times to ask us if we were ready yet, when we clearly weren't. It's worth it to come here if you live in the neighborhood (since there's not much else) but they should add at least one vegan option.",3.0
"I moved away from this neighborhood less than a year ago and miss Saraghina terribly. This was a go to spot for me and my friends. The pizza is DELICIOUS (try the prosciutto & funghi and the coppa & carciofi pizzas), the cocktails are yummy,and when the weather is nice you can't beat the patio out back. The only drawback is that it's cash only, but they have an ATM inside.",4.0
"There's a lot of good to say about this restaurant.  The atmosphere is nice and homey, with a great outdoor space in back.  The old, nearly falling apart tables are, while neat in theory, a bit obnoxious to deal with when sitting at - but in the grand scheme, that's neither here nor there.The pizza is very good.  I'm not talking NYC good, I'm talking Italian good.  A friend of mine suggested that their first time the pizza crust was a bit crunchier, which I prefer.  While they don't quite salt the dough enough, it was still very good.  They do an excellent sauce, and the ingredients seem very fresh.  The flat bread with ricotta with an extra dash of salt is very refreshing.The house cabernet is enjoyable and simple, and more importantly, affordable.  $15 for a half liter is hard to come by in NYC (eating/drinking out anyway).  Though, as for the prices in general, everything feels about 10% too expensive. The food is absolutely good, but the trek to and location of the restaurant don't seem to be calculated here.  I have no doubt that Saraghina doesn't struggle, but as a customer that would like to return, that'd be a point worth noting.  I'll be back one day.",4.0
"Of course, the Neapolitan pizza coming fresh out of the wood-fire oven is fantastic, but there's so much more to the Sarahina. The goat cheese salad, the beets, the burrata, the cauliflower... all of those are amazing. Highly recommended.",5.0

"Essentially, this place embodies decent food with a hipster vibe. We ordered the spaghetti, margarita pizza, and market salad.

The pizza was your typical thin crust, but it got pretty soggy after a couple minutes as we ate the salad first. In terms of the quality of the market salad, it was very simple- mixed greens with tomatoes and an olive oil based dressing. The customer service was cool. The guys working were down to earth and helpful. What I didn't really like about the place, though, was how dim the lighting was, making it hard to see the food in front of us. I was just about to take a sip of my water when I look over and see a huge dust ball laying on the table. I guess it might've fallen from the vent or fan, but it kind of made the rest of the night unappetizing.

It's like the ideal neighborhood place. We started with mussels in a red sauce. The black olives were a nice touch. And our waiter kept bringing us more bread to dip in the leftover sauce. That simply won my heart. Then I got a brick-pressed cornish hen with fries and a salad that I believe was a special and if it was, I'm so sorry. Because it was perfect. The way those fries soaked up the juices from the chicken...good lord. My boyfriend got a pizza which was also great and we got a half liter of red wine for $15, which was an okay deal.I could not afford to do this every weekend, but that will only make it more special.Take your mom.",5.0
"I came hoping I was going to fall in love... DIDNT HAPPEN. First of all the service was waaay too laid back for me. We were greeted and seated then left to rot. We continuously made eye contact with the ONLY two servers on the floor and still nothing. Exactly 9 mins later someone finally came to take our order. We ordered the spicy spiked hot chocolate and a tea. The hot chocolate was pretty good nothing special. Now our food I ordered the Salcicca and my husband got the burger (whoopty doo). Anyway 15mins later here comes my pizza....but where is the burger? I sat and tried to wait for his food but I was too hungry. 7mins later here comes his burger. I laughed. It looked like a nasty lil hockey puck. I laughed so hard I was in tears.He tried to eat it but the problem was the middle was way too soft and pink and the outside was burnt. Oh yeah and it was the size of a slider.  He ordered the pizza.Now with all of this happening there's a couple sitting behind us getting pretty hammered talking about us. How my husband complained about his burger and he shouldn't have ordered that from an italian restaurant also my husband thinks he's cool with his cowboy hat. We ignored him.So my husband ordered a pizza of his own and loved it. I also loved mine. So I was in a better mood and decided to order a mimosa. Now this is what really did it for me. Apparently they must've said ""Hey take this mimosa to the black girl"" cuz it went to THE WRONG TABLE. If they had table numbers it would've came if they said take it to the couple it would've came. But it went to the only other black girl in the restaurant. And it sat for 10 mins. And she didn't touch it. We said nothing and asked for our bill, remember the couple behind us well, the guy is the manager. This is where the 2 stars come in. The manager didn't charge for the burger nor the mimosa.

"I was first introduced to Saraghina 4 years ago, and have tried to make it out to Bed-Stuy at least once a year just to come back here. Now, I can't tell you exactly what I get every time as I tend to forget and also often order from the specials. The food has been in my opinion, mind-blowingly good every time. We always end up ordering a pizza just because Saraghina has some of my favorite pies around (although I honestly wouldn't come just for the pizza). The Copoccola is my personal favorite but i always mix it up and never get dissapointed. The drink menu is not bad, but not too impressive. I'm not a cocktail person, but they have a few of those. Wines are good and priced rather well, too. House wine is an option as well that seems to be ignored by a lot of establishments. Wish they had a little more on the beer side of the spectrum, but it's ok the way it is. Not going to remove a star just on that. I've always enjoyed the service because the servers and hosts were always friendly and patient and we've come in some big, and sometimes annoying groups of 6-8. Once or twice the food took a VERY long time to come out, but that's the price I'm willing to pay for very good food. On top of that, the food does come out fresh rather than looking and tasting like it's been sitting for a while. If the risk of a long wait wasn't worth it, we wouldnt keep coming back.",5.0

"Wow we were in Bed Stuy last night checking out the hood.   My partners and I are looking to open a restaurant here and a friend took us to this fabulous place. First we popped into the bakery and were stunned by the decor, which looked like a store in Connecticut and the produce was amazing. We bought beautiful loaves of baked bread and corneti deserts.  I couldn't believe we were still in Brooklyn.  Next we went into the restaurant. Mike the waiter was friendly and attentive.  He recommended a fabulous bottle of red wine, which we drank voraciously. We had eaten earlier at a Taco place but we were still hangry.    So we ordered two pizza margaritas.   They were so delicious we couldn't get over it!   My one friend is a real stickler about pizzas and this brick oven pie was a hit for him.  He's an admitted Manhattan snob who rarely  leaves the ""enchanted island,"" and was nervous about visiting the hood.  He had to admit, grudgingly, that there was nothing like this pizza in Manhattan. He was soon at ease and stuffing his face.  We enjoyed it tremendously.  Then finished with espressos which tasted like we were on the Via Veneto.  We'll be coming back soon.",5.0
"Saraghina is one of my favorite restaurants in my neighborhood, BUT they need to take credit card already. God I love the decor. I would love to know the background on the building. Looks like they build the authentic Italian pizza restaurant from a Carriage house circa WWI. Wish they had more salads too but prosciutto and fungi pizza is my favorite.",4.0
"Love, love, LOVE this restaurant! Great food and staff!",5.0
"How delighted I was when Saraghina opened its bakery. They make a micca studded with flaxseed and sunflower seeds that I buy every time I go, which is several times a week. It's a big round loaf (they just introduced a smaller oblong version) and has a superb crackly ridged flame-licked crust and an interior that is dense and moist enough when fresh from the oven to leave a tacky residue on your bread knife. This is not a bad thing--the bread remains good for a couple days due to its seed-rich dough. (Thereafter you can coax it back to deliciousness by toasting it.) Slicing this micca is a pleasure because it releases such a wholesome, appetizing corn-flaky aroma, a delicious complex cereal scent that I'm at a loss to properly describe.     Saraghina also sells a peerless baguette, its crust crisp and slashed, the inside a perfect balance between firm and cottony, releasing an appetizing yeasty whiff when broken. My ritual with this loaf is as such: I cut cold butter into pieces, place it in a mortar, sprinkle it with a little coarse sea salt and mash it with the pestle until it is pale and spreadable but still cool. Then I slice aged Gouda or goat Gouda with a Benriner mandoline into wide sheer rippling ribbons. This way it comes to room temperature quickly and its flavor develops. The toothsome baguette with fresh butter (that contains tiny bursts of salt) and fragrant Dutch cheese makes a breakfast or lunch that's very hard to beat.    But back to the bakery: In the bread department I haven't ventured beyond these two delicious loaves but I have tried a very nicely conceived individual-sized chocolate ganache tart with little meringue turrets, and I applaud the pastry chef for the not-too-sweet filling (decadent yet chaste) and perfectly executed faintly crunchy ripply-edged crust. In addition to other pastries, the bakery sells quite a few other comestibles: two pleasing olive oils that you tap yourself from stainless steel drums, jumbo dried white Greek beans, red and black rice (this intriguing dark rice stains the water blood-red when you cook it), a sapore del piave (I haven't found this floral, nutty grating cheese recently-- please bring it back), burrata, jams, sausages and the like. If you're a bread-fearing type, the rich, fragrant coffee from an espresso machine should serve as an inducement to pay a visit.    Fortunately this is not one of those cash-only New York businesses with the toy ATM that eats a couple of your dollars in exchange for dispensing bills; there's a little iPad-type device that accepts your finger-drawn signature, presents a tip option and will send a receipt by email.    One caveat: sometimes the bread is ready only in the afternoon hours, a little odd, in my opinion, for a bakery.",4.0

"Just had a really delicious dinner at Seraghina. The vibe was laid back, with friendly service and a lovely rustic interior. I opted for two of the specials: the spring beans and the cavatelli. The spring beans dish was light but substantial enough lunch, or to share as an appetizer with the table. It consisted of green fava beans and fiddle headed ferns, which i've been intrigued by at the farmer's market, but always chicken out of buying. There were also slicers of cheese (pecorino I think). It was garnished with full mint leaves and drizzled in olive oil. It's rare i'd go back to a place for the salad alone, but this was such a flavorful and seasonal dish, it was enough to make me want to be a regular! As for the cavatelli, it was a ricotta cavatelli with mushrooms and a truffle sauce. The cavatelli was perfectly cooked and the sauce was flavorful without being overbearing. The portion was great for sharing. I also tried a sip of my friend's cocktail, the name of which escapes me. It was a green basil flavored bourbon drink, and was so deliciously herbal and refreshing.

"Saraghina might be my favorite place to eat in New York City. Tucked away in the middle of Bed-Stuy, Saraghina manages to serve the best Italian food in an amazingly perfect atmosphere. The lighting is fantastic; and the décor is very unique and attractive. It's a great place for a first date (did I mention great lighting?). I've also taken a group of 6-7 people and it was fine. The service is impeccable. The pizzas are wonderful. For me, the best pizza in New York is between Saraghina & Roberta's. They also do great espresso.  An Italian friend of mine says that Saraghina is the closest thing to eating in Italy in all of New York. Wow. And, be aware (non-New Yorkers) that the good Italian food has left Little Italy awhile ago. The service: very knowledgeable about wine and the menu. Most of the servers are rooted in the Italian Euro-type of amazing style of hospitality; it is truly admirable. They are happy to educate about the menu, they smile, they look like they're having some fun, and they're happy to be there - but also working hard. The perfect combination for servers, in my opinion.The Negroni is quite possibly the best in the world.

"went for the first time after seeing it, right in my area. everyone was really nice, the bartender was great! waiter was great also. my only disappointment was no pasta on the menu.. at least it wasn't that night. I was excited to hear they are expanding with a bar.the pizza was awesome!!!",4.0
"Wow we were in Bed Stuy last night checking out the hood.   My partners and I are looking to open a restaurant here and a friend took us to this fabulous place. First we popped into the bakery and were stunned by the decor, which looked like a store in Connecticut and the produce was amazing. We bought beautiful loaves of baked bread and corneti deserts.  I couldn't believe we were still in Brooklyn.  Next we went into the restaurant. Mike the waiter was friendly and attentive.  He recommended a fabulous bottle of red wine, which we drank voraciously. We had eaten earlier at a Taco place but we were still hangry.    So we ordered two pizza margaritas.   They were so delicious we couldn't get over it!   My one friend is a real stickler about pizzas and this brick oven pie was a hit for him.  He's an admitted Manhattan snob who rarely  leaves the ""enchanted island,"" and was nervous about visiting the hood.  He had to admit, grudgingly, that there was nothing like this pizza in Manhattan. He was soon at ease and stuffing his face.  We enjoyed it tremendously.  Then finished with espressos which tasted like we were on the Via Veneto.  We'll be coming back soon.",5.0
"Saraghina is one of my favorite restaurants in my neighborhood, BUT they need to take credit card already. God I love the decor. I would love to know the background on the building. Looks like they build the authentic Italian pizza restaurant from a Carriage house circa WWI. Wish they had more salads too but prosciutto and fungi pizza is my favorite.",4.0
"Love, love, LOVE this restaurant! Great food and staff!",5.0
"How delighted I was when Saraghina opened its bakery. They make a micca studded with flaxseed and sunflower seeds that I buy every time I go, which is several times a week. It's a big round loaf (they just introduced a smaller oblong version) and has a superb crackly ridged flame-licked crust and an interior that is dense and moist enough when fresh from the oven to leave a tacky residue on your bread knife. This is not a bad thing--the bread remains good for a couple days due to its seed-rich dough. (Thereafter you can coax it back to deliciousness by toasting it.) Slicing this micca is a pleasure because it releases such a wholesome, appetizing corn-flaky aroma, a delicious complex cereal scent that I'm at a loss to properly describe.     Saraghina also sells a peerless baguette, its crust crisp and slashed, the inside a perfect balance between firm and cottony, releasing an appetizing yeasty whiff when broken. My ritual with this loaf is as such: I cut cold butter into pieces, place it in a mortar, sprinkle it with a little coarse sea salt and mash it with the pestle until it is pale and spreadable but still cool. Then I slice aged Gouda or goat Gouda with a Benriner mandoline into wide sheer rippling ribbons. This way it comes to room temperature quickly and its flavor develops. The toothsome baguette with fresh butter (that contains tiny bursts of salt) and fragrant Dutch cheese makes a breakfast or lunch that's very hard to beat.    But back to the bakery: In the bread department I haven't ventured beyond these two delicious loaves but I have tried a very nicely conceived individual-sized chocolate ganache tart with little meringue turrets, and I applaud the pastry chef for the not-too-sweet filling (decadent yet chaste) and perfectly executed faintly crunchy ripply-edged crust.

My fiancé and I stayed in New York for our very first time over New Years and were DYING for some real Italian New York pizza! This little gem was amazing and the perfect place for a date night. Dim lighting and candles at every table and the service was fantastic. We got the Salsiccia pizza and it was so delicious we ate the whole thing! Followed by a chocolate martini for me and the tiramisu for my man. Talk about being in heaven! Wouldn't choose any other pizza place but this one next time we visit!,5.0
"Good service. Rustic, charming atmosphere inside and on garden patio, old signs, pictures, furnishings, etc. Music is 80s pop, rockabilly, and jazz standards by the great artists. Beautiful for brunch. Country bread with florentine and Benedict is lovely. Scones and cakes were good. Salad was lacking some freshness and had some rotted bits. Every thing else seemed fresh and tasty. Pizza is very good. The special typically has seasonal produce. The two craft beers on draft seem to change often.I would return because the pasta selections look amazing. So does dessert and I'll save room for that someday.",4.0
Love the atmosphere and hidden place:) their pizza is delicious!,4.0
The lobster roll is soooo yummy. The po boy sandwich was also good.. But I recommend they use less lettuce and more of their lemon caper tartar sauce. The bread is also yummers.,4.0

On Wednesday morning (8/20/14) I had breakfast there and everything was just delicious.  Had the Americano(coffee) eggs with salmon an oven roasted tomatoes and avocado. My date did enjoyed his breakfast too. I wish i could tell you what it was but i was so into my plate that i dont remembered. U can tell everything was organic and tasted so light. I really enjoyed the breakfast. The only thing I didn't like was our waiter was very slow. So if u in a hurry better tell them in advance. I know for sure im going back again for breakfast.,5.0
"Such a nice addition to the neighborhood. There's a lot of restaurants popping up. Most are pricey and blah. This one is moderately price and really good.

Wow--I am writing this review in the hopes that management reads it. I first want to say that I have loved Saraghina for years but the past few months I feel they are slipping and it has me wondering is there a new chef or management. My husband and I ordered 2 pizzas--a Napoli and a Salsiccia. The pizza was cold and soggy. Even heating it up in our oven didn't help. The pizza doesn't even taste the same lately. The dough was disgusting. It seems someone slapped this together with no care at all. This pizza used to be very tasty. It just doesn't have any pizazz anymore. We won't be ordering from Saraghina for awhile but will wait to see if they get it back together. And I'm giving it 3 stars and that is really because I hate to give them less--they used to be so good.,3.0
"I just moved to Brooklyn this afternoon. Since my last trip to NY I have been craving the Indian curried Duck that I devoured in Manhattan during spring break. After unpacking, I could decide whether to find and Indian place or to go with a classic NY pie. I opted for the latter and began my search for a pizzeria in my neighborhood with good reviews. I came across this place and began my adventure to pick up the Prosciutto and Funghi pie that I ordered in advance. DELICIOUS. The crust was chewy and slightly charred which lent a unique flavor to the salty bite to the prosciutto. The ratio of mozzarella to mushroom was perfect ( needless to say the shrooms were well seasoned and meaty in texture). The pie was finished with sporadically placed basil leaves that gave a classic Italian spice to the marinara sauce. Good pie + walking distance = happy girl!",5.0

As for the food, we shared an Ortolana and a forgettable appetizer. The Ortolana pizza was burnt on one side and a little cold. I was underwhelmed but willing to try again. Two nights ago I ordered pickup since I live a few blocks away and ordered the Market Salad, the Fave E Cicoria and the Salsiccia. Once again, I was extremely underwhelmed. The pizza was missing  sausage on half of it and once again it was burnt and needed some seasoning. I'm sure at one time this place was good but they've gotten seriously lazy.

(which, come to think of it, is fine because everyone loves leftover pizza, especially THIS pizza).Not blown away by their brunch menu (or the prices) but what's wrong with eating pizza for brunch??And now for the bloody mary-  it's a good one, and if you haven't had it and you consider yourself a bloody mary connoisseur, you have to try this one.  I'm not going to tell you it's the best I've ever had, (although some people will) because to me it's not.  But it is definitely something different, thanks to those san marzano tomatoes and the oregano, which, I'll admit, threw me off at first perhaps because it reminded me too much of pizza.  But then it quickly grew on me and now I find myself occasionally craving for one since nobody else does them the way they do.If you drink more than one bloody mary at brunch, either you're trying to have that kind of a day, or it was just that good and you want another despite not needing the alcohol.  This bloody is not cheap but it was good enough for me to order a 2nd.The service here is kinda strange.  I've been told that everyone working here has some share in ownership, but I find that kinda hard to believe because it's a mixed bag, and while most of them are great, there are a few that I know I wouldn't want to be partners with if we were going to owner/operate our business.This neighborhood isn't exactly plentiful with good restaurant options yet, but even if it was, Saraghina would still stand out, and if you happen to find yourself craving pizza in this part of town, this is without a doubt the best optionAlso f@#$ Grimaldi's.  With wonderful places like Saraghina, I don't know why anyone in their right mind would go to Grimaldi's unless unless you actually like waiting that long for a lesser pizza that comes with a bigger attitude.",4.0

"Our theory is that this place has suffered from its  success.   We tried it because it has mixed reviews but many very strong ones.   The pizza is fine.  Hard to mess up wood fired pizza with a decent crust recipe.  But that is all.  Absurdly few basil leaves on the Pizza Margherita.  And we agree with the reviewers who refer to the watery sauce.But let's talk about the wildly indifferent service.  Another Yelp reviewer has called it ""chill.""  We call it ""desultory.""  We waited quite a while for our waiter to wait on us even though the place was not busy.  He passed us numerous times without saying a word.  When he did finally stop at our table he just sort of stood there waiting to take our order.  His greatest energy was spent as we were leaving, energetically clearing our table and making a big crack sound with our glasses as though he couldn't wait for us to leave.  We saw this at a neighboring table as well. I hope the owner will read these negative reviews and start having employee meetings rather than getting friends to respond with fives and raves.  This place has a lot of potential to be a wonderful place again but the staff needs training and the recipes need to be improved.",2.0
"This place was not marked with a sign in front. Just a chalkboard type of siding.  The indoor decor was very cool, interesting,  and rustic. The staff was very kind. While waiting for a table the bartender poured us some water, and we didn't even ask. We ordered two pies (they are bar pies), and a half carafe of a house white wine. The pizza was OK, but not at all what I would call great. I've certainly had better. Service was a little slow. I would go back to at least try appetizers. I was a little disappointed since there was so much talk about this place! I gave them a third star just because the outdoor patio is quite lovely. I was there at dusk, so we saw it with and without the lighting. My total was $50.",3.0

When i dine at Saraghinas  my meals take longer than acceptable and on one occasion they forgot about our table.  This is not a relaxing meal.  If you're looking for a stress free meal skip right over this place however if you're lighthearted and in the mood to enjoy a bottle of wine while you wait, this place is pretty chill.

"I hate to say it, but Saraghina let me down this morning. I've eaten dinner here twice before and been very impressed with the pasta and pizza, so I brought by boyfriend here for brunch today expecting to be wowed. No such luck. We ordered eggs florentine and french toast. French toast was fine but not special, and the portion was small for the price. Eggs were downright bad - over cooked, tiny amount of hollandaise sauce, extremely tough bread. At one point I was using to much force to try and cut through it that my hand slipped and slammed my hand into the plate rather painfully. Just no fun to eat. Service was also unforgivably slow. Overall, felt like $40 for two people should've gotten us a nicer meal, especially at a restaurant that executes some of its menu so well.

"The pizza is a good Neopolitan-style, thin chewy crust with a more subtle sauce, right amount of cheese.  There's a beautiful back patio with shade, ivy fencing, old signage, very much a popular scene in warmer weather, crowds on weekend evenings and after 8 on weeknights.  Haven't had a bad glass of the house wine, and they do a nice cappuccino.  Morning menu, free wifi, a good spot to spend a couple hours.  Stop into their newly opened bakery around the corner on Halsey for warm bread, cheese and Italian imports.",5.0

"Great food!   Horrible service, even with a number of staff running around.  We had brunch here a few weekends ago and were celebrating so we ordered a bottle of wine off the menu but they were out.  That's understandable so we went through a few more, also out.  We ended up ordering the most basic & simple mimosa in hopes to just have something, it had been 20 minutes since we sat down.  We were disappointed that the food came out another 10 min later & still before the first drink.  (We were planning on a few mind you).  So we asked a different server and by the end of our meal we finally received our mimosas.  I generally don't complain, but I did and it fell on deaf ears.  So, I felt I should do an honest yelp review in hopes that the Manager knows that the even though they have killer food, my partner & I will not return due to poor service.    Also, if we were willing to pay $60 for a bottle and only got 1 drink, you completely lost out on additional revenue my friend.",2.0

"Our theory is that this place has suffered from its  success.   We tried it because it has mixed reviews but many very strong ones.   The pizza is fine.  Hard to mess up wood fired pizza with a decent crust recipe.  But that is all.  Absurdly few basil leaves on the Pizza Margherita.  And we agree with the reviewers who refer to the watery sauce.But let's talk about the wildly indifferent service.  Another Yelp reviewer has called it ""chill.""  We call it ""desultory.""  We waited quite a while for our waiter to wait on us even though the place was not busy.  He passed us numerous times without saying a word.  When he did finally stop at our table he just sort of stood there waiting to take our order.  His greatest energy was spent as we were leaving, energetically clearing our table and making a big crack sound with our glasses as though he couldn't wait for us to leave.  We saw this at a neighboring table as well. I hope the owner will read these negative reviews and start having employee meetings rather than getting friends to respond with fives and raves.  This place has a lot of potential to be a wonderful place again but the staff needs training and the recipes need to be improved.",2.0
"This place was not marked with a sign in front. Just a chalkboard type of siding.  The indoor decor was very cool, interesting,  and rustic. The staff was very kind. While waiting for a table the bartender poured us some water, and we didn't even ask. We ordered two pies (they are bar pies), and a half carafe of a house white wine. The pizza was OK, but not at all what I would call great. I've certainly had better. Service was a little slow. I would go back to at least try appetizers. I was a little disappointed since there was so much talk about this place! I gave them a third star just because the outdoor patio is quite lovely. I was there at dusk, so we saw it with and without the lighting. My total was $50.",3.0

"I live in the neighborhood so I've had the opportunity to eat here a few times. Eating out is a hobby of mine. I use it as therapy to get over long days. When i dine at Saraghinas  my meals take longer than acceptable and on one occasion they forgot about our table.  This is not a relaxing meal.  If you're looking for a stress free meal skip right over this place however if you're lighthearted and in the mood to enjoy a bottle of wine while you wait, this place is pretty chill.

"I hate to say it, but Saraghina let me down this morning. I've eaten dinner here twice before and been very impressed with the pasta and pizza, so I brought by boyfriend here for brunch today expecting to be wowed. No such luck. We ordered eggs florentine and french toast. French toast was fine but not special, and the portion was small for the price. Eggs were downright bad - over cooked, tiny amount of hollandaise sauce, extremely tough bread. At one point I was using to much force to try and cut through it that my hand slipped and slammed my hand into the plate rather painfully. Just no fun to eat. Service was also unforgivably slow. Overall, felt like $40 for two people should've gotten us a nicer meal, especially at a restaurant that executes some of its menu so well. Won't ever be back for brunch.Also, what is up with not taking credit cards? So irritating and bad for customers.

"The quintessential neighborhood restaurant, Saraghina has it all: lovely ambience and decor; efficient, unobtrusive, and friendly service; and perhaps most importantly, a can't-miss menu featuring top-notch Neapolitan-style pizzas. They're all terrific, but personal favorites include the Bufula (blobs of fresh buffalo mozzarella), the Coppa & Carciofi (generous slices of spicy coppa and roasted artichokes), and the Marinara (anchovies, strong garlic, plump black olives.) The cozy patio and intimate dining rooms evoke the feeling of being a guest in a warm country home. Perfect summer date spot - if you can't get laid after a meal here, you're doing something wrong.",5.0
"I've been reading all the rave reviews about this place and, since I love pizza, I decided to try it out on a Saturday afternoon.I ordered the margherita while my girlfriend ordered the prosciutto & funghi pizza.  Coming out of the oven..the pizzas looked great.  Individually, all the ingredients and the crust, were good.  Collectively...it failed.  The reason:  there was just a lot of liquid content that caused the crust to get soggy.  There's no way for you to pick up a slice without all the toppings on it sliding off.  even the margherita...the tip would flop and there would go all the sauce and all the cheese.  Underneath the pizza was a pool of liquid on my plate.  The prosciutto & funghi pizza...even worse.  It ruin what could've been something great.I felt like the wateriness diluted some of the flavors and really kept it from coming together.  You could taste the individual ingredients on it's own but it never combined and elevated to become something more.  it was cheese...sauce...crust...it never melded together to become PIZZA.While this place wasn't bad there's too many other good artisinal pizza places that get it right that I find it hard to recommend this place.---uploaded photos including one of the liquid that was left under my pizza",2.0
"Quite good! Went here with my boyfriend for the first time for dinner last weekend. It was a Saturday night and very busy, but we were seated right away and service was surprisingly (though not especially) prompt. Also, a lot of their waiters are really pretty, kind, Italian-speaking women, which is fun :) The wait staff wasn't particularly organized, so we had to seek out passing waiters a few times, but we weren't in a rush and they were very sweet so this wasn't a huge problem.We got the soft cheese appetizer, which was delicious. It came with bread (though only 3 pieces, we had to ask for more but I don't think they charged us for extra), tomatoes, and great olive oil. I got a margharita pizza and boyfriend got a pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms. They were both really tasty, a solid 4.5/5. The pizzas are slightly too-big to eat by yourself and slightly too-small to split with someone else, so we got 2 knowing there'd be leftovers (which we were okay with!). I've had better prosciutto but it was still good. And the crusts are some of the best I've had - really soft bread, not the dry powdery crunch-fests you normally find with artisanal pizza.There's something to be said for the location and feel of the place. In Bedstuy, it's somewhat of an oasis - there's not a lot of other places like this around. I instantly fell in love with the decor of the place - it's full of interesting and ecclectic objects and furniture. We were seated in the courtyard/garden outside, which was lovely. It was lit with nice string lights and decorated with antique pieces. It would be an excellent place for a romantic date, especially if you live in the area and don't have many other options.The one weird complaint I had about this place was that for some reason, they were burning incense! We noticed it instantly and it kind of suppressed our appetites. It didn't smell good and it was overpowering. That, combined with the fact that this place is CASH ONLY and the wait staff is a little disorganized, makes me take away a star. Other than that, the food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the wait staff is friendly. We'll definitely be back to try their delicious looking brunch. I'd recommend this rustic, romantic place!",4.0
I really wanted to fall in love.... I mean really!  I needed a pizza fix. Have driven by many a time and promised myself forever that I would eventually.  Get my carbs in line so I could enjoy them fully. OK.  I had the mixed salad... Liked it.  Can't remember super deets but obvious to see from the salad offerings and vegetable dishes a whole lot of delicious is going on there.  Now to the pizza... I had the prosciutto and funghi pizza..as well as my partner with some meatballs on the side. I don't know but I just didn't like the sauce... Something  about that sauce just didn't make me want to order that pizza again.... So now the saving grace or Graces .... Praise the good Lord!!!!  I absolutely positively loved the tirimisu. And the cheese cake with raspberry and amaretto crust... I only had a taste but well deserving of a return....  Also the wine my waiter chose was awesome and accompanied meal quite nice as well as decor and service. For that you get the 4 stars.... I'll visit again... I believe in second chances.  Lol,4.0

"Love the pizza, decor and atmosphere of restaurant. They brought an authentic Italian flare to the historical brownstone neighborhood that I live in. I don't eat cheese or meat but they have a few non dairy options that I enjoy. I do wish they delivered their pizza.",4.0

"The quintessential neighborhood restaurant, Saraghina has it all: lovely ambience and decor; efficient, unobtrusive, and friendly service; and perhaps most importantly, a can't-miss menu featuring top-notch Neapolitan-style pizzas. They're all terrific, but personal favorites include the Bufula (blobs of fresh buffalo mozzarella), the Coppa & Carciofi (generous slices of spicy coppa and roasted artichokes), and the Marinara (anchovies, strong garlic, plump black olives.) The cozy patio and intimate dining rooms evoke the feeling of being a guest in a warm country home. Perfect summer date spot - if you can't get laid after a meal here, you're doing something wrong.",5.0
"I've been reading all the rave reviews about this place and, since I love pizza, I decided to try it out on a Saturday afternoon.I ordered the margherita while my girlfriend ordered the prosciutto & funghi pizza.  Coming out of the oven..the pizzas looked great.  Individually, all the ingredients and the crust, were good.  Collectively...it failed.  The reason:  there was just a lot of liquid content that caused the crust to get soggy.  There's no way for you to pick up a slice without all the toppings on it sliding off.  even the margherita...the tip would flop and there would go all the sauce and all the cheese.  Underneath the pizza was a pool of liquid on my plate.  The prosciutto & funghi pizza...even worse.  It ruin what could've been something great.I felt like the wateriness diluted some of the flavors and really kept it from coming together.  You could taste the individual ingredients on it's own but it never combined and elevated to become something more.  it was cheese...sauce...crust...it never melded together to become PIZZA.While this place wasn't bad there's too many other good artisinal pizza places that get it right that I find it hard to recommend this place.---uploaded photos including one of the liquid that was left under my pizza",2.0
"Quite good! Went here with my boyfriend for the first time for dinner last weekend. It was a Saturday night and very busy, but we were seated right away and service was surprisingly (though not especially) prompt. Also, a lot of their waiters are really pretty, kind, Italian-speaking women, which is fun :) The wait staff wasn't particularly organized, so we had to seek out passing waiters a few times, but we weren't in a rush and they were very sweet so this wasn't a huge problem.We got the soft cheese appetizer, which was delicious. It came with bread (though only 3 pieces, we had to ask for more but I don't think they charged us for extra), tomatoes, and great olive oil. I got a margharita pizza and boyfriend got a pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms. They were both really tasty, a solid 4.5/5. The pizzas are slightly too-big to eat by yourself and slightly too-small to split with someone else, so we got 2 knowing there'd be leftovers (which we were okay with!). I've had better prosciutto but it was still good. And the crusts are some of the best I've had - really soft bread, not the dry powdery crunch-fests you normally find with artisanal pizza.There's something to be said for the location and feel of the place. In Bedstuy, it's somewhat of an oasis - there's not a lot of other places like this around. I instantly fell in love with the decor of the place - it's full of interesting and ecclectic objects and furniture. We were seated in the courtyard/garden outside, which was lovely. It was lit with nice string lights and decorated with antique pieces. It would be an excellent place for a romantic date, especially if you live in the area and don't have many other options.The one weird complaint I had about this place was that for some reason, they were burning incense! We noticed it instantly and it kind of suppressed our appetites. It didn't smell good and it was overpowering. That, combined with the fact that this place is CASH ONLY and the wait staff is a little disorganized, makes me take away a star. Other than that, the food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the wait staff is friendly. We'll definitely be back to try their delicious looking brunch. I'd recommend this rustic, romantic place!",4.0
I really wanted to fall in love.... I mean really!  I needed a pizza fix. Have driven by many a time and promised myself forever that I would eventually.  Get my carbs in line so I could enjoy them fully. OK.  I had the mixed salad... Liked it.  Can't remember super deets but obvious to see from the salad offerings and vegetable dishes a whole lot of delicious is going on there.  Now to the pizza... I had the prosciutto and funghi pizza..as well as my partner with some meatballs on the side. I don't know but I just didn't like the sauce... Something  about that sauce just didn't make me want to order that pizza again.... So now the saving grace or Graces .... Praise the good Lord!!!!  I absolutely positively loved the tirimisu. And the cheese cake with raspberry and amaretto crust... I only had a taste but well deserving of a return....  Also the wine my waiter chose was awesome and accompanied meal quite nice as well as decor and service. For that you get the 4 stars.... I'll visit again... I believe in second chances.  Lol,4.0
"Very, very good pizza; especially the cappacolla. Lovely ambiance, very rustic and simple. However, the wait staff can be a little snooty. When I began to order an ""appetizer/starter"" I was curtly cut off with, ""have you been here before?"" to which I replied that I had. She then said, ""then you know how it works here, right? It'll come out when it comes out."" So, the food is delicious and it's a very lovely space but someone needs to teach the wait staff to be a little more gracious and polite.",5.0
"It pains me to leave a less than superb review for what used to be my favorite neighborhood staple. However, for whatever reason, over the last year the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. We recently ordered the octopus appetizer-$18-and not only was it a strange amalgam of flavors that didn't make sense (potato, octupus, & something else i can't remember), it was virtually was unedible. This was after the week or two before ordering the broccoli rabe appetizer and receiving a portion suitable for a child-- far less than one should receive for $12. Also, the pizza is mediocre at best. I've had every pie on the menu hoping to find a winner, but the style of cooking leaves the cheese barely cooked and it often arrives cold. I have even asked for it be cooked more (once during ordering, and a separate occasion when it came to the table tepid), and was fed some story about the ""mother yeast not being good too cook too long"". I'm leaving this review with the hope you guys get your act together-- the neighborhood has noticed. I can't help but think the only people that go here anymore are the true incarnations of gentrification-- rich yuppies with undiscerning palates because they have too much money to know the difference.",2.0

"Was brought here by friends a few Sunday's ago and we had a great lunch! This was our friend's hangover pizza spot, so we knew it was going to be tasty. They were doing brunch, so although the place is quite big with a second room in the back, we had to wait about 30 minutes for our party of 4. We got some drinks at the cute little bar; my mimosa was delicious with fresh squeezed OJ and my 2 friends really enjoyed their bloody mary's. We ate in the back room in a cozy booth. We let our friends do the ordering, and we ended up with Fried Calamari & Shrimp, a Mahgerita Pizza & another pie with Capicola and fresh Motz on it. Man, this was such a great Sunday lunch. The mimosas kept flowing, and the crust on the pizza was perfectly crispy with a nice char. The sauce was flavorful and different, and the toppings were fresh and delicious. The calamari and shrimp were also pretty tasty. Since this place is 10 minutes from my apartment, I wish I could give it 5 stars.. but the service was a bit lacking.

Although there is no A/C, it didn't feel that hot, perhaps because we went there on a rainy night.The pizza menu offers marinara, margherita, ortolano, capocollo, prosciutto e funghi, and bufala. After eating some olives, VH and I tried the ortolano (i.e. with vegetables: zucchini and eggplant) pizza. The pizza is a 12"" pie which is fine for two. The dough is excellent: thin, crisp, and crusty, nicely charred. A winner! Unfortunately the sauce was too liquid, which resulted in a soggy pizza. The cheese on the pizza was also not completely melted. By the way, the basil tastes better if it is put fresh on the pizza, after the pizza has been in the oven, not cooked at 700 degrees. Burnt basil tastes like burnt paper. The verdict: their pizza needs a lot of work...We then tried the baked clams, which were good: a solid, if not particularly inventive, dish.The dessert menu is very underwhelming: tiramisu' and a choice of ice cream. We passed.Service was friendly but somewhat erratic; they had a lot of people for a rainy Wednesday night and were perhaps a bit overwhelmed.The place has potential, and it definitely deserves support (in a neighborhood dominated by fast food joints, Saraghina is a much needed breath of fresh air).

By this measure, Saraghina is a success; delicious crust, fresh-tasting ingredients - all very solid. We had high hopes for the prosciutto y funghi and it was just... not good. Not even fine.

"CASH ONLY!Gentrification at it's finest. It's a white oasis in Bed-Stuy, if that's your thing.  Personally, I like the diversity and flavor of Bed-Stuy as is, but Saraghina offers something different.  Saraghina would be nothing to look twice at in any other part of NYC but in this area where there is a need for some culinary and dining diversity it hits the mark and scratches the itch.Nice brunch, nice ambiance.  You can really kick back in this rustic, chic, countryside feeling dining room.  I like to linger over a cheese plate and a nice chilled white wine.  My kids love the organic yogurt with fruit and granola.  The pizzas are dynamite.  Lots of variations for meat lovers and vegetarians.  There's a very neo-classical Euro feel and the service is good without being too intrusive.  The decor has lots of soothing and fun old skool detail.  It's spacious and yummy.Great for groups or a date.And a reminder again... CASH ONLY which is a pain in the ass.",3.0
"I've come here a total of 6 times, usually for lunch or a quik coffee and cheesecake with , and have always had a great experience and wonderful service. However ths last time I went made it EXACTLY that... The Last Time!!I went for dinner with my mom to celebrate my new job. We ordered 2 pizzas (one for there and one to go), 2 desserts, 2 cappucinos, fried calamari and polpo salata...and it all went downhill from there.It took over 1h 45m just for the cappucinos to arrive...That's not the bad part.Then it took an additional hour for the polpo salata and the calamari to arrive...That's not the worse part.It then took ANOTHER HOUR for the BEYOND BURNT pizza to arrive...And that''s still not the worse part.After my mom and I told them we would take the dessert and our 2nd pizza to go, this waitress just plopped the pizza and the bag on the table and went to get our bill... And that's STILL NOT what did them in.What did them in was that after spending $85 for TWO PEOPLE and giving them waitress a 15% percent tip, which was more than I could honestly afford, the b*tch had the nerve to come back to our table as we're putting on our jackets to go and tell me, OUT LOUD SO EVERYONE COULD HEAR HER, that my tip was not enough and that she needed us to give her more money. If you've ever been to Saraghina's you know how loud it can be. After she announced that, you could literally hear a pin drop 3 blocks away... I felt so embarassed as I'm hearing people saying ""How rude."", ""Did she really just say their tip wasn't enough"", ""She should be lucky to have gotten a tip."" I dug in my wallet for my last $5 and handed it to her sayng that was all I had left. (Which was true. That was for me to put on a metrocard so that I could go to work.) She snatched it out my hand and dismissed me.I was so hurt that I went home and remained quiet the entire night. My mom went back the next day and demanded to speak to the manager who apologized and told us he was sorry and that the next time, ask for him and he will be the only one to wait our table.. Sorry, there won't be a next time. Your waitress screwed it up for you. I've told everyone as I'm telling you: DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT!

This place is amazing! I have been wanting to come here for years and finally the opportunity presented itself!  I'm so glad that it did. I work at PUBLIC Restaurant and in comparison this place does a great job in educating their servers.  Our server was Jeremy. While he was young he was very knowledgeable and attentive but not overly so.  We had 4 courses and got out for less than $200!!  That's a steal if you ask me!  I can't tell you how happy I am that we live so close and can walk there!  The drinks at the bar are also awesome to watch being made and the bartender (while busy) was still very pleasant!  I don't know if they can do a better job next time!  I challenge them :),5.0

Nicely prepared, balanced flavor, went well with the sourdough bread they served as a snack.And finally, the pizza. My measure of a pizza restaurant is always their margherita. By this measure, Saraghina is a success; delicious crust, fresh-tasting ingredients - all very solid. We had high hopes for the prosciutto y funghi and it was just... not good. Not even fine. The prosciutto was not great quality and completely overpowered the other flavors; we left more than half of the pie behind.Overall - we'll go back. Nice spot not too far from home, atmosphere is nice and relaxed, non-prosciutto pizza is tasty.",4.0
"I've been going to this place for years now & the food is just awesome.  Fantastic pizzas (especially the prosciutto & mushroom pie - my fav), fresh house-made pastas & table wine that goes down nice & smooth.  Salads have always impressed, but what I really loved on my most recent visit was the service.  Had I done this review a year ago, it would have been 4 stars, but in my visit last week, I experienced the best service I've ever had there.  Can't wait for my next visit!",5.0
Neighborhood gem!!!! God this place makes me happy!! Their pizza is everything anyone can wish for. Great wine. Great desserts. Great salads too! Beautiful interior and great for kids. An absolute must meal for me at least once a month.,5.0
"CASH ONLY!Gentrification at it's finest. It's a white oasis in Bed-Stuy, if that's your thing.  Personally, I like the diversity and flavor of Bed-Stuy as is, but Saraghina offers something different.  Saraghina would be nothing to look twice at in any other part of NYC but in this area where there is a need for some culinary and dining diversity it hits the mark and scratches the itch.Nice brunch, nice ambiance.  You can really kick back in this rustic, chic, countryside feeling dining room.  I like to linger over a cheese plate and a nice chilled white wine.  My kids love the organic yogurt with fruit and granola.  The pizzas are dynamite.  Lots of variations for meat lovers and vegetarians.  There's a very neo-classical Euro feel and the service is good without being too intrusive.  The decor has lots of soothing and fun old skool detail.  It's spacious and yummy.Great for groups or a date.And a reminder again... CASH ONLY which is a pain in the ass.",3.0
"I've come here a total of 6 times, usually for lunch or a quik coffee and cheesecake with , and have always had a great experience and wonderful service. However ths last time I went made it EXACTLY that... The Last Time!!I went for dinner with my mom to celebrate my new job. We ordered 2 pizzas (one for there and one to go), 2 desserts, 2 cappucinos, fried calamari and polpo salata...and it all went downhill from there.It took over 1h 45m just for the cappucinos to arrive...That's not the bad part.Then it took an additional hour for the polpo salata and the calamari to arrive...That's not the worse part.It then took ANOTHER HOUR for the BEYOND BURNT pizza to arrive...And that''s still not the worse part.After my mom and I told them we would take the dessert and our 2nd pizza to go, this waitress just plopped the pizza and the bag on the table and went to get our bill... And that's STILL NOT what did them in.What did them in was that after spending $85 for TWO PEOPLE and giving them waitress a 15% percent tip, which was more than I could honestly afford, the b*tch had the nerve to come back to our table as we're putting on our jackets to go and tell me, OUT LOUD SO EVERYONE COULD HEAR HER, that my tip was not enough and that she needed us to give her more money. If you've ever been to Saraghina's you know how loud it can be. After she announced that, you could literally hear a pin drop 3 blocks away... I felt so embarassed as I'm hearing people saying ""How rude."", ""Did she really just say their tip wasn't enough"", ""She should be lucky to have gotten a tip."" I dug in my wallet for my last $5 and handed it to her sayng that was all I had left. (Which was true. That was for me to put on a metrocard so that I could go to work.) She snatched it out my hand and dismissed me.I was so hurt that I went home and remained quiet the entire night. My mom went back the next day and demanded to speak to the manager who apologized and told us he was sorry and that the next time, ask for him and he will be the only one to wait our table.. Sorry, there won't be a next time. Your waitress screwed it up for you. I've told everyone as I'm telling you: DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT! If I wanted to be treated crassly by Italians, I'd attend family reunions more often!",1.0
This place is amazing! I have been wanting to come here for years and finally the opportunity presented itself!  I'm so glad that it did. I work at PUBLIC Restaurant and in comparison this place does a great job in educating their servers.  Our server was Jeremy. While he was young he was very knowledgeable and attentive but not overly so.  We had 4 courses and got out for less than $200!!  That's a steal if you ask me!  I can't tell you how happy I am that we live so close and can walk there!  The drinks at the bar are also awesome to watch being made and the bartender (while busy) was still very pleasant!  I don't know if they can do a better job next time!  I challenge them :),5.0

"Great neighborhood place with terrific ambiance.  Sat in the garden which was nice. Had pizza which was very good, the crust was thin, but not as thin as at a lot of the brick oven places I usually go to and I liked that added bit of thickness.  Toppings were great...artichoke and sausage, delicious.  Had the tiramisu for dessert which was also great.Service was relaxed but friendly and just had a great time overall.   One note, this is a kid-friendly place and there were several toddlers there when I dined, so if you don't like to hear screaming kids while you eat, just check to see if any are around before you take a seat.  It wasn't bad but the kids there tonight were a bit rambunctious.",4.0

First of all, we didn't have a cake, my friend just had cookies. Seeing as we didn't need you to light a candle, get plates, or slice anything, what the hell was that for? Anyway, besides being horrified by the surprising fee, the manager argued with me saying that it's a standard. Okay...10 dollar cake fee, fine, 40 dollars? Nope. After arguing with me for ten minutes he finally just begrudgingly said take 40 dollars off then. I'm grateful for it, don't get me wrong, but would I, friends, or coworkers return after being disrespected as a customer? Most certainly not.",1.0

The octopus was tender and still warm and the dressing was light. The watermelon & feta salad was also very good. The gnocchi was light and fluffy, and the two pizza we ordered was delicious. It was more of a Roman style where the crust was thin and the edges where less bready than say the Neapolitan cousin.

"I have been to this place before and it was great. However, today it was the worst dining experience of my life. First we started with the wrong menus which was probably an honest mistake.

I think she sent the kid who does the dishes to bring out the pizza and he seriously put the pizza onto the table next to ours.

In a nutshell, the pizza is too thin and wet. It won't be so bad if it wasn't a little expensive for what we are getting... and in NY it shouldn't be hard to find better alternatives. I also go the salad and most of the leaves were wilted. I'm not sure if it's because of the dressing or the quality of the greens but it looked unappetizing. I try not to complain (so I didn't) but I wish I asked them to take it back. In a nutshell: I'll only go back if 1. The people I'm with insist 2. I'm famished with no groceries at home 3.

"It started on a Saturday morning. We decided it would be a great idea to go to brunch. We looked online for options, and settled for this place. We have been here before and have never had a good experience, but we thought we would give them another chance. The Brunch menu seemed very promising and I was craving a pizza.Once we arrive, we were greeted by the host and she told us that there is going to be a 20 min wait for a table. We opted to wait outside, the day was beautiful , although it would have been nice to sit down during our wait, but there was only one bench, which was being occupied.We were seated rather promptly and we were eager to eat. We sat down at 2:15pm and here the waiting began. There was no sign of a server or anyone for another ten minutes. Our server gingerly arrives and we order our food rather quickly. I order the pork sausage pizza without olives and a mimosa, and my girlfriend opted for a chicken panini and a french drip coffee. We waited. and waited, and waited and eventually we get our drinks. 20 min for a coffee and 30 minutes for the mimosa.  We were disturbed at how much time it took for our simple drinks to be brought over to us, but we assumed that maybe the server had somehow forgotten the order? But we let it pass we just want to eat. And the pizza at the table next to us is rather tempting. So a full 50 minutes goes by, we have been at the restaurant for over an hour, and still there is no sign of our meal. Now we are worried if we don't get our food we will be late for work. Finally we see our server and explain that we need to go. She apologizes and says the kitchen is completely backed up.,and that they have been overwhelmed. I understand completely, but we just do not have the time for a leisurely siesta, and someone should have had the courtesy to talk to us earlier. I do not think waiting an hour for a meal is normal. We tell the waitress we must leave and ask her for  the check. We wait for an additional 10 min for the check, and as we get up to make our way to the counter to find someone to collect our money, the food arrives. We ask them to wrap it up so we could take it home. I feel defeated, but I am still hungry. And alas I open the box to look inside to find my pie with olives on it. At this point I'm furious, my Saturday was ruined. We wasted our afternoon just sitting in their establishment without having a meal to show for it. They insist that we not pay, and the server apologizes yet again. But, I believe that a manager should have been proactive and not have us leave unfed. Is it too much to ask for a simple brunch meal in under an hour?",1.0
"I came back last night 10/14/2013. I had the Bufala & the prosciutto & funghi pizzas. Both were tasty but unfortunately I got very sick.

I've had a lovely dinner here perhaps a year ago - all around fine. Then in late September the service was so lousy despite several waiters walking around seemingly unbusy - that my friend and i left. This was a sunday afternoon and i hope the evening staff is better.,3.0
"I recently moved back to BedStuy after years of living in the East Village and was delighted to find this place.  The atmosphere is welcoming and has lots of funky décor details.  Although the atmosphere is great, the food is what you go for.  The first night we did take out, the coppa and carfioci and salsicca were excellent.  The next time we ate at the restaurant and the calamari, risotto of the day, the endive pear salad, and the squash soup, all were great!  Few down falls, service is subpar and inexperienced; I would shy away from asking them for suggestions as they have little knowledge of what is on the menu.  The second downfall is they are cash only, but that isn't the end of the world. I don't miss think I'll be missing our old pizza haunt, Motorino as much as I thought!",4.0
"My original post was a year ago. Restaurant has greatly improved. The fish po boy is delish!!Older post:I've dined here a few times and each time I HOPING it will be better. In a nutshell, the pizza is too thin and wet. It won't be so bad if it wasn't a little expensive for what we are getting... and in NY it shouldn't be hard to find better alternatives. I also go the salad and most of the leaves were wilted. I'm not sure if it's because of the dressing or the quality of the greens but it looked unappetizing. I try not to complain (so I didn't) but I wish I asked them to take it back. In a nutshell: I'll only go back if 1. The people I'm with insist 2. I'm famished with no groceries at home 3. I'm famished with no groceries at home and someone else is paying :)",4.0
"I'd give Saraghina three and a half stars if I could, but I'm rounding up because the pizza is just that incredibly delicious. And the atmosphere is just that unbelievably adorable. The service, on the other hand, is totally atrocious.

The employees definitely very friendly but I. Just. Don't. Understand. Why. They. Are. So. Slow. Saraghina management, take note, because I'd certainly hate to see you lose your business. Keep up the fantastic work on the food, though.",4.0

Really charming inside, but more importantly, DELICIOUS. Great service from Italian hosts and servers (or people that are paid to do a great impression), and varied menu (not just pizza). We kept it simple though because we were a lot of people and wanted to share - ended up getting  a plain margarita and the one with the anchovies, which I was nervous about, but was savory and delicious.We were lucky to sit in their beautiful garden. check it out while the weather is still good!",5.0

"It started on a Saturday morning. We decided it would be a great idea to go to brunch. We looked online for options, and settled for this place. We have been here before and have never had a good experience, but we thought we would give them another chance. The Brunch menu seemed very promising and I was craving a pizza.Once we arrive, we were greeted by the host and she told us that there is going to be a 20 min wait for a table. We opted to wait outside, the day was beautiful , although it would have been nice to sit down during our wait, but there was only one bench, which was being occupied.We were seated rather promptly and we were eager to eat. We sat down at 2:15pm and here the waiting began. There was no sign of a server or anyone for another ten minutes. Our server gingerly arrives and we order our food rather quickly. I order the pork sausage pizza without olives and a mimosa, and my girlfriend opted for a chicken panini and a french drip coffee. We waited. and waited, and waited and eventually we get our drinks. 20 min for a coffee and 30 minutes for the mimosa.  We were disturbed at how much time it took for our simple drinks to be brought over to us, but we assumed that maybe the server had somehow forgotten the order? But we let it pass we just want to eat. And the pizza at the table next to us is rather tempting. So a full 50 minutes goes by, we have been at the restaurant for over an hour, and still there is no sign of our meal. Now we are worried if we don't get our food we will be late for work.

"Having lived not so far from here, we were excited to try it (there aren't many decent offerings around here, Peaches aside). Went for brunch when we first moved into the hood and it was fairly good. Brunch sammys were good and the coffee was, well, average. Did take out one night and for a Pizza joint, very disappointing. We got a Margherita and a Prosciutto. Both were soggy in the centre with a pool of liquid. The topping fell straight off the Marg!! As for the prosciutto, it wasn't Prosciutto!! It was actually some kind of smoked ham. We came for dinner a few weeks later and we were both sorely disappointed. Service was disinterested and scarce. Food was average to not bad. The veal ragu pappardelle was essentially over reduced bolognese sauce with stodgy pasta. Got a special pizza which had to be eaten with a knife and fork due to the sloppiness of the sauce!! Our entrees were sat on the pass for a few minuted while our (French??) server was chatting to the bartender. I almost did a Curb Enthusiasm and grabbed our food!Never again. If you want good pizza for similar prices, jump on the A to Broadway and take the L to Morgan. Roberta's kills this place and I suspect the only reason Saraghina still exists is because there aren't a great deal of options around.",2.0

"This is a response to all the people who are complaining that Saraghina is in an ""out of the way spot"" or ""hard to get to"" and thus there prices should be lower.  First of all that does not make any sense.  Just because they are in an area where there are not a lot of other restaurants like it doesn't make the price of imported Italian cheese or fresh seafood lower.  High quality doesn't magically become cheaper for restaurants because you traveled out of your way to get here.  They serve a quality product in an awesome neighborhood for an understandable and reasonable price.And why people complain about this restaurant being far away or in the netherlands of Brooklyn boggles me.  Personally, for me, it is around the corner and a trek to Park Slope for pizza is way more of a schlep.  True, I don't pay $2,000 for my apartment and my neighbors aren't all 30 something yuppie transplants but that doesn't mean that it is in the boondocks and THE HUGEST HASSEL IN THE WORLD TO GET TO (it is literally blocks away from the A/C.)  Sorry if this seems like a tangent but I don't think this is a valid reason to complain about this restaurant At.

"I feel like NYMag and TONY are Bed-Stuy's biggest publicists! I found out about this pizza place from one of their features. Spot is decorated w/ a raw rustic theme... as if all their furniture and art were sourced from flea markets and the Salvation Army. It's quaint but def. only something that could exist in BK. i loved the Christmas tree in the back room. Menu is simple, i.e., minimal choices. Makes it a lot easier to order your dinner. I ordered the pizza of the day (spicy itialian sausage, olive, some kind of cheese and another ingredient) and the margherita. Pizza was thin crusted - I eat a lot so sharing two pizzas with two people (DON'T LAUGH!) was just enough food. ingredients were fresh and plentiful to the point that each slice drooped making it hard to eat.but, I wish we could harken back to the golden days before truffle oil.. to $2.5 slice of cheese pizza and be satisfied. now it's $40 pizza dinners.

"This is one of the pizzerias people rave about in these parts, so on a nearly spring-like Saturday afternoon, we decided to take a walk down here from Ridgewood.The aesthetic is a bit ""let's try to be shabby and rustic and mis-matched on purpose,"" but whatever.Our waitress comes up to our table after we've been seated a couple minutes: ""Do you know what you want?,"" said with nary a fake smile. We go for the bufala pizza and some house wine.Our water glasses continue to sit there empty, so we ask for some water a bit later. ""Sure,"" she says, with a tone of disdain.The pie was beautiful. Slightly sloppy in the middle, and the sauce was a bit bland and tomatoey, but overall good quality and a nicely charred crust and buffalo mozarella. It was good. Not mind-blowing, but up there.Even total attitude when getting the check, though.In my girlfriend's words, ""what a b****."" Really hate to say it, but I had to agree. I don't expect much from servers, but man, if you hate your job so much that you are actually *rude* to the people you are, you know, paid to, uh, serve,  you've got to find a new one, lady.

All the workers are good looking and give great service! Beer and wine selection is great. The rustic nook gets 5 stars for being delish and right around the corner!,5.0
"Having lived not so far from here, we were excited to try it (there aren't many decent offerings around here, Peaches aside). Went for brunch when we first moved into the hood and it was fairly good. Brunch sammys were good and the coffee was, well, average. Did take out one night and for a Pizza joint, very disappointing. We got a Margherita and a Prosciutto. Both were soggy in the centre with a pool of liquid. The topping fell straight off the Marg!! As for the prosciutto, it wasn't Prosciutto!! It was actually some kind of smoked ham. We came for dinner a few weeks later and we were both sorely disappointed. Service was disinterested and scarce. Food was average to not bad. The veal ragu pappardelle was essentially over reduced bolognese sauce with stodgy pasta. Got a special pizza which had to be eaten with a knife and fork due to the sloppiness of the sauce!! Our entrees were sat on the pass for a few minuted while our (French??) server was chatting to the bartender. I almost did a Curb Enthusiasm and grabbed our food!Never again. If you want good pizza for similar prices, jump on the A to Broadway and take the L to Morgan. Roberta's kills this place and I suspect the only reason Saraghina still exists is because there aren't a great deal of options around.",2.0
I have never had a bad meal here. It's the go to spot for dinner amongst my group of friends in Bushwick. We love you guys!,5.0
"Always awesome food. Always awesome drinks. It's not papa johns, so they aren't piling buckets of cheese on top of your pizza, it's not Pizza Hut so you aren't getting giant ice laden glasses of water. It's artisanal food, and is served as such. Brunch there is especially delicious.",5.0
"This is a response to all the people who are complaining that Saraghina is in an ""out of the way spot"" or ""hard to get to"" and thus there prices should be lower.  First of all that does not make any sense.  Just because they are in an area where there are not a lot of other restaurants like it doesn't make the price of imported Italian cheese or fresh seafood lower.  High quality doesn't magically become cheaper for restaurants because you traveled out of your way to get here.  They serve a quality product in an awesome neighborhood for an understandable and reasonable price.And why people complain about this restaurant being far away or in the netherlands of Brooklyn boggles me.  Personally, for me, it is around the corner and a trek to Park Slope for pizza is way more of a schlep.  True, I don't pay $2,000 for my apartment and my neighbors aren't all 30 something yuppie transplants but that doesn't mean that it is in the boondocks and THE HUGEST HASSEL IN THE WORLD TO GET TO (it is literally blocks away from the A/C.)  Sorry if this seems like a tangent but I don't think this is a valid reason to complain about this restaurant At. All.Keep rockin on Saraghina!",5.0
"I feel like NYMag and TONY are Bed-Stuy's biggest publicists! I found out about this pizza place from one of their features. Spot is decorated w/ a raw rustic theme... as if all their furniture and art were sourced from flea markets and the Salvation Army. It's quaint but def. only something that could exist in BK. i loved the Christmas tree in the back room. Menu is simple, i.e., minimal choices. Makes it a lot easier to order your dinner. I ordered the pizza of the day (spicy itialian sausage, olive, some kind of cheese and another ingredient) and the margherita. Pizza was thin crusted - I eat a lot so sharing two pizzas with two people (DON'T LAUGH!) was just enough food. ingredients were fresh and plentiful to the point that each slice drooped making it hard to eat.but, I wish we could harken back to the golden days before truffle oil.. to $2.5 slice of cheese pizza and be satisfied. now it's $40 pizza dinners. CASH ONLY",3.0
"This is one of the pizzerias people rave about in these parts, so on a nearly spring-like Saturday afternoon, we decided to take a walk down here from Ridgewood.The aesthetic is a bit ""let's try to be shabby and rustic and mis-matched on purpose,"" but whatever.Our waitress comes up to our table after we've been seated a couple minutes: ""Do you know what you want?,"" said with nary a fake smile. We go for the bufala pizza and some house wine.Our water glasses continue to sit there empty, so we ask for some water a bit later. ""Sure,"" she says, with a tone of disdain.The pie was beautiful. Slightly sloppy in the middle, and the sauce was a bit bland and tomatoey, but overall good quality and a nicely charred crust and buffalo mozarella. It was good. Not mind-blowing, but up there.Even total attitude when getting the check, though.In my girlfriend's words, ""what a b****."" Really hate to say it, but I had to agree. I don't expect much from servers, but man, if you hate your job so much that you are actually *rude* to the people you are, you know, paid to, uh, serve,  you've got to find a new one, lady. The worst service I have ever had this side of Tina's in Bushwick. No, worse-- they just ignore you, at least, not make you feel like you are somehow bothering them by purchasing their goods and services. You make it a downer to eat here.She acted super nice to the little kids who were there with parents, so maybe it is our fault for being too old and uncute.Anyway the food was pretty damned good, and I'd come back here. The dude who actually brought out our pizza was chill.",4.0

I enjoyed the food, service and had a great chat with the waiter. The ambience was rustic, charming, and relaxed - somewhat on the romantic side.

"BedStuy, oh BedStuy! Places like Saraghina may just make me move over here! Now forget the long ridiculous lines at Robertas! Came here on a Friday night around 8 after being bummed from the long wait at Peaches Hot House (have yet to try), no lines, just a 5 min wait at the bar.  The four in our group each ordered a house mixed drink at the bar. Can't remember the names but we were all pretty happy with our drinks. The bartender can really make his drinks, but I think its getting to his head a bit. He was a little TOO serious about being able to make any drink we wanted. Anyways, nothing to lose a star about. So we ordered a salad (forget which one)  which was pretty good and mussels to start. Nothing spectacular, but they were good. My wife and I split the Prosciutto and Funghi pizza and the shrimp dish. The Pizza was great! The shrimp was also pretty good, but the portion size was small, thankfully we split the pizza.  The food was really just 4 stars but the service was really above and beyond. Let me explain:So as the bus boy was picking up the bowl of mussels after we had finished, he spilled a few drops onto my friend's jeans as he lifted it over him. He apologized and my friend was cool about it and said it was fine, small mistake that happens sometimes. As we ordered another round of drinks, the waiter came by and told my friend that his drink was on the house. Nicely played, good job. But that wasn't it, as we asked for the check the waiter gave my friend a card and told him that the dry cleaning on his clothes would be on them! Now, I've heard of places that may do this, but I was not expecting it here in BedStuy.  Its great to be in Brooklyn and enjoy good food without the hipster pretense you'll find in Williamsburg.

"Saraghina is charming and warm, and the food on the menu is chosen with creative taste, and well executed. Their waiters are friendly, their wine list is good. My girlfriend and I go often. Tonight, we ordered Fritto Misto, an appetizer with fried shrimp and squid. It comes with a small saucer of a delicious, rich sauce to dip the fried frutti del mare in. After we finished the contents of the saucer, we asked for a little more for the remaining squid and shrimp. The waiter informed us that that would be an extra $ 1.50. That was disappointing, not because of the $ 1.50, but because of the spirit, or lack of it.I think if a restaurant whose owner recently claimed on a video on nytimes.com he worries the charm of the neighborhood (Bed-Stuy) may suffer through increasing gentrification, and decides to become petty, seems to be the tipping point from cool to not-cool.

"Have visited this restaurant twice and will never return. On the whole the food is very good, though the pappardelle wasn't rolled quite thin enough by perhaps a notch or two but that's nitpicking. The issue was the staff. Understand that none of the following offenses are a big deal, save for the obvious. However, once compounded one upon the other, the effect was disastrous. Upon walking in the door I was uncertain as to whom I should turn to in regards to seating. The woman behind the counter may or may not be a hostess but she is definitely unpleasant. The person who turned out to be the host was incredibly awkward. I think he thought he was being cool but it was just uncomfortable. The bartender, though talented and a great conversationalist, needs to pay a bit closer attention to the health code. While making a drink for my friend he licked his finger .and then used the same hand to pick up and place a garnish on the drink. I'm not one to peg folks on a rag lying around or some such thing but that was not OK by anyone's standards. Once at the table service was slow and cold. Drinks and food came  out at a somewhat expected rate but refills and check ups did not. After the meal and plates were cleared it took quite some time to get the check. Only after flagging down a server did we get our bill. Upon reflection I believe all of these problems in service bely some sort of deeper issue within the business.

"After my parents passed away, I was, without surprise, an absolute train wreck. How I managed it is a story for another place and time.

I lead with that because Saraghina is the kind of place that you would close your eyes and think about when you're a distraught wreck. There is something very simple, comforting, and right about this place and it really puts you at ease to be there.

"I am from Chicago and every year on my trip to New York I visit this joint.  Taking the subway system it looks a little rough at the stop which should be noted for those using public transportation.  Also there was no signae on the building on my last visit.  If I did not know where I was going I would not have known this was a restaurant.  That said the food, the waiters, the ambiance is excellent.  Everything was great.  It's one of hte most wonderful dining experiences I have had.  And it is why every year I make a special out of the way trip to this spot.  The food is fresh and excellent in taste.  The workers are friendly and warm.  And the atmosphere at night is wonderful.  It's lowly lit with candles.  And it's cash which is would be a criticism.  I love this place!",4.0
"I'm that heretic from out of town who simply doesn't enjoy most NY-style pizza places. I'll take my sweet tea over your pie any day! This made me a little leery when a friend asked us to meet him at Saraghina, but my socks were blown right off.First off, Saraghina isn't trying to be NY-style pizza or any sort of American pizza at that. It's meant to be more like Italian pizza (the south of Italy to be precise) and it succeeds with a flair unmatched by any other place I've been to stateside. They offer a buffalo cheese - not mozzarella, mind you - that is nearly impossible to find in the states but is beautifully presented here (tastes great as well). The toasted gorgonzola appetizer was also delicious and a great start to the meal. I loved the added touch of the communal water bottle for pouring into your glass - truly the Italian way of handling things!The pizza I ordered was the buffalo, which consisted of melted slices of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a think but fresh layer of tomato sauce on a very thin, crispy crust. If you've never been to Italy, it's hard to explain that this IS the Italian way. Hardly a crust, crispy with a touch of flour... it was such a throw back that when I walked outside, I expected to hear Italian and see the Vatican outside the door.

"This restaurant was clearly designed with lots of love and attention. The space is artful and romantic with little to no pretension. Saraghina is probably one of the most spacious eateries in the city, which is good because it means there is never a wait. In the summer, the garden is the place to be. In most restaurants, the ""garden"" is a slab of concrete in the back where you listen to air conditioners hum. At Saraghina, the garden is lush, expansive, and calm. Definitely grab a table there if you can.I love the margherita pizza - I don't eat meat, so I can't offer much info on most of the other pizzas, though they look and smell pretty darn good. The kitchen won't take any special requests or substitutions for your meals, but I've never been dissatisfied. The other dishes on the menu tend to be okay but not great; remember you're there for the pizza, not pasta. However, if you have room in your belly, I recommend the fave and cicoria - it's a small dish of sauteed dandelion greens and pureed fava beans (kind of like hummus). It's a little spicy and super savory. Yum!Sometimes the service is slow, but the staff are consistently welcoming, helpful, and accommodating. If you want to pass the time while you wait for your food, order a carafe of the house red.",5.0
"This is an excellent restaurant and a fun little trek out for an adventurous, even romantic dinner. I didn't do much 'trekking' when I lived around the corner, but was thrilled to have Saraghina around in an otherwise residential area. In short, the food is good, ambiance is extraordinary, and the service is average.I've stuck to the classics on their menu. The margherita pizza, market salad, and have dabbled with the calamari and desserts. I once ordered the orecchiette bolognese. It was flawless, but I'm just a bigger fan of the pizza: the margherita pizza sauce was subtle and sweet with a perfect thin crust that was charred at the bottom.

"Saraghina IS pizza. A wood fire splendor. This small place in Bed-Stuy is a diamond in the rough. My host had mentioned it to me before I even got to New York. I knew if the locals raved about it, it must be worth something.Saraghina's size surprised me. I walked into to find a couple of tables the kitchen and a few single seats by the wood fire stove. There were two families milling about and a few people waiting for their take-out pizza. It was a busy night so I had to wait for a bit before a waiter could seat me. The staff was nice enough to let me know a waiter was coming. Someone came and asked me if I wanted to sit inside or outside. It was a cool night so I picked outside. I followed her through a narrow hallway and Saraghina opened up. There was another bigger dining area and as you continued there was a large outside patio. Both areas were full of laughing groups. No kidding it was a busy night.I was seated and handed my menu. Soon my water glass was filled. I browsed the menu and quickly zoned in the pizza. There are maybe eight or nine choices. I thought the pizza with Italian ham, artichokes, basil, and mozzarella sounded fantastic. A waitress came to take my order and I told her what I wanted. She explained this pizza came with an olive oil base and not a red sauce. I am thankful she mentioned that because I wanted red sauce. She directed me to a similar pizza and I ordered that instead. While I was waiting there was a cat that snuck its way through the fence and was running around the patio. Most of the patrons were so captivated with their conversations they missed it. The ambiance made me feel as if I was in Italy, or what I assumed could pass for Italy. My pizza arrived and it was a mass of red sauce, cheese, basil, and ham. It looked splendid. I tore off a piece and bit in. Hot with fresh ingredients, the flavors melted together wonderfully and the crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Much of the edge was burnt to perfection. The red sauce was a magnificent choice. It was obvious this was no canned bullshit. This was the real deal homemade made with sweat and love sauce. Despite it being packed I was asked frequently how I was doing. Whenever I am able to get back to New York I will visit Saraghina again.",4.0

"I'm sad to have to do this, but it can't be helped. I was thrilled when this place opened and had at least a few lovely meals here in the beginning. Now I come here less and less. Months go by between visits before I break down and come again, each time hoping to be pleasantly surprised and have another lovely meal here. Every time we walk out shaking out heads. I doubt I'll go there again.The backyard is charming and they have decent house wines by the carafe. The food used to be quite good. More and more I would only describe it as ""not bad."" Considering that there's not the widest selection in the neighborhood, ""not bad"" would actually be good enough for a meal now and then. But the service has gotten TERRIBLE. Really, really bad. Distracted, brusque, forgetful, rushed, and sometimes rude. Tonight didn't start off on a good foot when we couldn't get the server to make eye contact and he walked away while we were in the middle of talking to him. However, both myself and the friend I was eating with have worked in the service industry before and can be pretty forgiving. ""He seems distracted, they must be understaffed tonight,"" we told each other.But it was downhill from there. At no point in the service did he look at us when he spoke to us and even seemed hostile when doing things like asking if everything was okay. We sat for ages waiting to place our order and had to flag him down to do so. Then the entrees came before the appetizers. Then he cleared our small share plates and silverware before we were done eating our appetizers. We tried to say something, but because he was looking away and darted off quickly, he didn't notice. We ate the rest of our octopus salad with our fingers. A few moments later a different staff member came and cleared the remaining plates and asked if we wanted dessert. We said no, we ready for the check. Fifteen minutes went by. No check. We flagged down our actual server and said we were ready for the check. He said he'd be right back with it. Twenty minutes went by. At this point it was getting quite late and there was no staff member in sight in the backyard so we gathered our things and walked to the hostess area and explained we had been waiting for our check for some time, but needed to leave. We interacted with three people in this process: one was nice enough, the other two made as feel like we were hugely inconveniencing them. No one apologized or acted at all concerned.In the end it took over two hours for a quick meal of salad and pizza. And they were not understaffed, we counted five employees on the floor of the not huge backyard.GO TO CELESTINO!",1.0

"UNEXPECTED TREASURE ( in the middle of nowhere). I heard great things from friends that don't live in the hood but were willing to travel deep into bed-stuy to eat here  The decor is really cool! Rustic barn-chic! Very affordable for amazing quality food! Our bill was only $45 for a shareable salad (insalata zucco = INCREDIBLE), substantial  14"" (delicious sausage) pizza and 2 FANTASTIC cocktails! Cash only - Boo!Arriving early is recommended. It gets packed quickly. We got there at 6pm on Sunday to an empty restaurant. It was full by 6:30/7. I HIGHLY recommend this place! I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because it's located in the middle of nowhere which requires a bit of time to get to.",4.0
"This restaurant was clearly designed with lots of love and attention. The space is artful and romantic with little to no pretension. Saraghina is probably one of the most spacious eateries in the city, which is good because it means there is never a wait. In the summer, the garden is the place to be. In most restaurants, the ""garden"" is a slab of concrete in the back where you listen to air conditioners hum. At Saraghina, the garden is lush, expansive, and calm. Definitely grab a table there if you can.I love the margherita pizza - I don't eat meat, so I can't offer much info on most of the other pizzas, though they look and smell pretty darn good. The kitchen won't take any special requests or substitutions for your meals, but I've never been dissatisfied. The other dishes on the menu tend to be okay but not great; remember you're there for the pizza, not pasta. However, if you have room in your belly, I recommend the fave and cicoria - it's a small dish of sauteed dandelion greens and pureed fava beans (kind of like hummus). It's a little spicy and super savory. Yum!Sometimes the service is slow, but the staff are consistently welcoming, helpful, and accommodating. If you want to pass the time while you wait for your food, order a carafe of the house red.",5.0
"This is an excellent restaurant and a fun little trek out for an adventurous, even romantic dinner. I didn't do much 'trekking' when I lived around the corner, but was thrilled to have Saraghina around in an otherwise residential area. In short, the food is good, ambiance is extraordinary, and the service is average.I've stuck to the classics on their menu. The margherita pizza, market salad, and have dabbled with the calamari and desserts. I once ordered the orecchiette bolognese. It was flawless, but I'm just a bigger fan of the pizza: the margherita pizza sauce was subtle and sweet with a perfect thin crust that was charred at the bottom. Sobering Note: a carafe of wine between two people will turn your evening sloppy since it is an entire liter (vs a standard 750 ml bottle of wine)",4.0
"Incredible food, amazing ambiance. I love this place, I go here all the time for the last 3 years. I don't know why all the bad reviews for service, I always have a great time. The pizza capocollo is to die for, and the homemade pastas too. They also got a new bar, and their cocktails are delicious!",5.0
"Simply the best pizza, EVER!  I can eat the whole pie and not feel puffy or dying for thirst hours later. It's because they take the time and allow the yeast in the dough to rise and fall before actually use the dough to make their yummy pizzas...the owners of this place know what they are doing! Plus their Burratina and their pasta dishes are always on the money. Truly love it, I've been a fan since they opened!",5.0

"Saraghina IS pizza. A wood fire splendor. This small place in Bed-Stuy is a diamond in the rough. My host had mentioned it to me before I even got to New York. I knew if the locals raved about it, it must be worth something.Saraghina's size surprised me. I walked into to find a couple of tables the kitchen and a few single seats by the wood fire stove. There were two families milling about and a few people waiting for their take-out pizza. It was a busy night so I had to wait for a bit before a waiter could seat me. The staff was nice enough to let me know a waiter was coming. Someone came and asked me if I wanted to sit inside or outside. It was a cool night so I picked outside. I followed her through a narrow hallway and Saraghina opened up. There was another bigger dining area and as you continued there was a large outside patio. Both areas were full of laughing groups. No kidding it was a busy night.I was seated and handed my menu. Soon my water glass was filled. I browsed the menu and quickly zoned in the pizza. There are maybe eight or nine choices. I thought the pizza with Italian ham, artichokes, basil, and mozzarella sounded fantastic. A waitress came to take my order and I told her what I wanted. She explained this pizza came with an olive oil base and not a red sauce. I am thankful she mentioned that because I wanted red sauce. She directed me to a similar pizza and I ordered that instead. While I was waiting there was a cat that snuck its way through the fence and was running around the patio. Most of the patrons were so captivated with their conversations they missed it. The ambiance made me feel as if I was in Italy, or what I assumed could pass for Italy. My pizza arrived and it was a mass of red sauce, cheese, basil, and ham. It looked splendid. I tore off a piece and bit in. Hot with fresh ingredients, the flavors melted together wonderfully and the crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Much of the edge was burnt to perfection. The red sauce was a magnificent choice. It was obvious this was no canned bullshit. This was the real deal homemade made with sweat and love sauce. Despite it being packed I was asked frequently how I was doing. Whenever I am able to get back to New York I will visit Saraghina again.",4.0

"I'm sad to have to do this, but it can't be helped. I was thrilled when this place opened and had at least a few lovely meals here in the beginning. Now I come here less and less. Months go by between visits before I break down and come again, each time hoping to be pleasantly surprised and have another lovely meal here. Every time we walk out shaking out heads. I doubt I'll go there again.The backyard is charming and they have decent house wines by the carafe. The food used to be quite good. More and more I would only describe it as ""not bad."" Considering that there's not the widest selection in the neighborhood, ""not bad"" would actually be good enough for a meal now and then. But the service has gotten TERRIBLE. Really, really bad. Distracted, brusque, forgetful, rushed, and sometimes rude. Tonight didn't start off on a good foot when we couldn't get the server to make eye contact and he walked away while we were in the middle of talking to him. However, both myself and the friend I was eating with have worked in the service industry before and can be pretty forgiving. ""He seems distracted, they must be understaffed tonight,"" we told each other.But it was downhill from there. At no point in the service did he look at us when he spoke to us and even seemed hostile when doing things like asking if everything was okay. We sat for ages waiting to place our order and had to flag him down to do so. Then the entrees came before the appetizers. Then he cleared our small share plates and silverware before we were done eating our appetizers. We tried to say something, but because he was looking away and darted off quickly, he didn't notice. We ate the rest of our octopus salad with our fingers. A few moments later a different staff member came and cleared the remaining plates and asked if we wanted dessert. We said no, we ready for the check. Fifteen minutes went by. No check. We flagged down our actual server and said we were ready for the check. He said he'd be right back with it. Twenty minutes went by. At this point it was getting quite late and there was no staff member in sight in the backyard so we gathered our things and walked to the hostess area and explained we had been waiting for our check for some time, but needed to leave. We interacted with three people in this process: one was nice enough, the other two made as feel like we were hugely inconveniencing them. No one apologized or acted at all concerned.In the end it took over two hours for a quick meal of salad and pizza. And they were not understaffed, we counted five employees on the floor of the not huge backyard.GO TO CELESTINO!",1.0

"I was craving a thin crust pizza on a saturday night after a long week of studying and came across some good Yelp reviews for Saraghina. We ate a Margarita with sausage which was mouth watering.

Once, my pizza came out a little crispy..that was a no go, I had them re-do, excuse me, me no like burnt pizza. Desserts are aight, tiramusu has been my best bet thus far.

The service has gone way downhill. I agree with a lot of the other recent reviews about the service being rude and abrupt. I came a few weeks ago and our server was rude, cocky and made the whole experience very unwelcoming. We were first greeted and sat by a very pleasant girl who took our drink order. As someone very sensitive to service (and a Brooklyn waitress), I was happy because she was sweet, relaxed and efficient. Wasn't freaking out. Wasn't rude. But I guess she was the busser because some other jerky dude ended up being our ""waiter"". When we first ordered, we were deciding between 2 salads and he was completely impatient and not helpful at all, even when we tried to engage and ask him questions (which is what a server is for at a good restaurant, by the way. Not just to bring food. I KNOW that people ask sometimes annoying questions, but that's what you're there for! To talk about the food and make the experience nice!). We were talking amongst ourselves and trying to ask him. His answers were condescending (he'd repeat the ingredients on the menu- yea, no shit there's dandelion greens in the dandelion greens salad...), and he said several times in a very irritated tone: ""do you need me to come back?"" and he kept looking around - never making eye contact. No. We told you several times we were ready and have been waiting a half hour for you to come over. Just wanted to hear more since BK menus are typically very basic with little explanation. And because that's what you're there for. We would be talking and he'd come up - no ""excuse me"", nothing subtle just would jolt up to our table and ""ARE YOU DONE?"". We would ask for something and he would obviously be annoyed ""IS THAT ALL OR ARE YOU GOING TO WANT SOMETHING ELSE?"". I know it might sound like innocuous server questions, but it's the tone! This kind of stuff happened several times. He also was so cocky with other tables and I have no idea why- dude doesn't even know how to do a wine service (let alone open the bottle) properly. Saw it twice. It was so off-putting and he was so unpleasant that I was inspired to ask his name from another server. I'll probably call the manager and ask who the hell hired him and why. Came again and they weren't busy at all but he was there. Abrupt again and definitely made us feel like we were bothering him. His tone and attitude- all completely rude. For no reason. I'll probably just find out when he's working and not come then, because the food is still awesome. Wine glasses are small, pizzas are good sizes and priced well.",2.0

The pizza crust is chewy and smoky, but the sauce turns the middle 1/3 of the pizza into a soupy mess. I had to eat this with a fork and knife, which made it feel less like real pizza. Also, the prosciutto was not what I was expecting. It was more like low quality ham. I'd recommend not getting it.We did however, get the Bufala pizza, which was pretty extraordinary. I wish that they had included more basil, but you can't get it all.

"Michele Iuliano, the chef and owner of Luzzo's in the East Village gave his secret dough recipe to the owners of Saraghina.  I am a big fan of Luzzo's and find their wood and coal oven pizzas to be fluffy, crisp, and delicious. It's true Neapolitan style combined with a little taste of NY coal oven pizza.And Saraghina is just as good.  It's in the middle of Bedford-Stuyvesant, not quite the NY destination spot yet.  The exterior made me think of a dive bar on a residental street. But inside, as we were led further into this maze of a restaurant, I felt like I was at summer camp.  The tables, chairs, open rooms, and vintage signs gave the place a comfy, laid-back, rustic vibe.  It was reminiscent of the ski-lodge feel of Roberta's, but less stuffy.There are two separate menus: one for pizza and one for other (daily) offerings.  We chose a tagliatelle with squid and pesto dish. And the Capocollo Pie.The pasta dish was a bit disappointing.  The pesto tasted a little off and the squid was sliced strangely so that it resembled a chewy vegetable rather than a cephalopod.  The tagliatelle was also slightly overcooked and soft.  Their wine selection was underwhelming. By the glass, they really only had white or red.  And neither option was good enough to stand up to their pizzas. We tried them both.But we didn't come here for the wine or the pasta. The wood oven that welcomed us in reminded me that it was all about the pizza.The capocollo pizza is basically a margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil) with the addition of capocollo ham.  When the pizza arrived, the ham emitted the aroma of cooked bologna (was I the only kid who did that?)But the salty spicy flavors from the earthy ham was a great complement to the sweet sauce, rich cheese, and smoky crust.  And oh, the crust.  Delicious. It had a stiff, crispy char that fell softly away as you pulled it apart. It was maybe a bit doughier than Luzzo's pie, and just as delicious.Each time another dish (or glass of wine) appeared on the table, the mustachioed waiter delivered it with a ""Voilá!"" It was definitely more creative than saying ""Enjoy"" or ""Bon Appetit!"" but I felt like I was at a magic show. Which I guess wouldn't be too far off.  When I was at summer camp (before heating up the bologna in the microwave), I'd expect a pizza meal with maybe a rabbit being pulled out of a hat. Anything to keep me entertained. And Saraghina does just that.-eatthisny",4.0

"Tu Vuo' Fa l'Americano! Americano! Americano!Between the rustic feel of old Napoli, the sweet smell of basil and crisp taste of an ice cold Peroni, there's nothing more I feel like doing than belting out some Italian jazz the second I step in from the gritty Bed-Stuy streets into this Italian transformation chamber.From the floors to the ceilings, this place oozes old school Italia. There's a lot of small, intricate and intimate spaces throughout this large space - truly imitating Italian bistros and pizzerias - to enjoy a quiet dinner for two or an evening of drinks and food con amici.The specialty here, without a doubt, is their pizza. I got the ortolana - a thin-but-simply-amazing crust, with tomato sauce, zucchini, and eggplant, sprinkled with dollops of mozzarella. I expected a personal pie, but was overwhelmed by the ginormous 8-slicer that was placed before me. Trust me, after my first bite, I wasn't upset that I would have some leftovers to take home. The crust was simply divine - the perfect mixture of soft and crispy. The veggies had a slow-cooked taste to them. And who could resist fresh mozzarella? Yeah, I didn't think so.They have a list of different specials everyday, and I opted for the soft cheese with bread and olive oil. Even though I was sitting on a nondescript corner lot in Bed-Stuy, I felt as though I was back in Napoli on the coast, staring at the Mediterranean con il mio regazzo italiano.The Peroni speaks for itself. I never was and am still not a big beer drinker, but this birra italiano truly puts a smile on my face whenever I can get it - most bars/restaurants in NYC claim they have it on their menus, but are always unshockingly ""out of stock"" when I order it.Yeah, the service here is pretty awful. I can see that they try to be decent, but hey, let's face it. You're in an authentic Italian restaurant with Italian waiters. Be prepared for a long, drawn out meal without much attention. Sit back and savor the company and the delicious food brought before you - and learn to enjoy what eating out is all about.Cash only, and bring more than you think you'd need for a pizza joint in the hood. But if you want a taste of old school Napoli without the 10 hour flight and jet lag, stop by Bed-Stuy for a true NYC mini-getaway. You'll be singing Carosone in no time.",4.0
"Tasty food in a funny spot that feels cozy despite the bare and worn down-looking decor.  We started off with a delicious cheese plate and a perfectly dressed salad.  Had the Prosciutto (think thicker ham slices as opposed to paper-thin slices) & Funghi and Salsiccia. Both were delicious. The outer crust was nice but the center of the pizza was floppy-wet. Still good eating though.Although the servers were all nice, they were not the best servers. They took away our empty coffee cups without asking if we wanted refills (we did.) and we had to chase someone down to get our check.  Cash only, which is kind of a drag.

"I live right around the corner from this place. I've eaten here several times since they've opened - even referred friends to this place. While I love their food, the reason they are not getting 4 or 5 stars from me is because they do not seem very accommodating at all. I called to ask if a certain item was on the menu, the lady couldn't tell me. She said I had to come in.  They do not deliver - which is fine, but they do not let you place your order over the phone so you can just go pick it up, so, you have to sit and wait in the heat (no air conditioning in the front) while they make your order and they are a cash only establishment. So, while their pizza and pasta with bolognese sauce is DE-LISH...they could do a little better on being a little more accommodating to ALL clients.  Not just the ones that come into the establishment.",3.0

"This place can be good or can be bad depending on when you go, and what you are trying to do. I've been here twice and had totally different experiences. Both times I sat in the back on the outdoor patio which is a must. The outside decor is really cute, almost feels like a secret garden. Much nicer then inside, and is one of the main selling points of this place. The first time I went was for dinner and was good (would've given 4 stars). Got pizza and wine and sat and talked, ate, and drank for hours. The second time I went was for a weekend lunch and was bad (would've given it 2 stars- the second star for the ambiance alone). Got the calamari sandwich (no flavor, don't get it!), and my friend also didn't like her grilled veggie sandwich. Service was EXTREMELY slow and poor. Never saw our waiter again after he took our order. Had to keep flagging down other waiters passing by. Overall, just a bad experience. After talking to some folks who live in the area, they confirmed this: service is slow here. Only go when you just want to have a slow chill, hang and eat experience, and expect to spend a long time.

"Everything we tried at Saraghina was pretty close to mind-blowing, and being a large party, we tried a lot. From the appetizers and specials, the well-cooked vegetables stood out the most to me.

The pizzas were fantastic, too - except for the oddly unappealing Ortolan with zucchini and eggplant. The Capicola stole the show - made me want to put that delicious salty ham on everything I eat.The service was good, but like I said, we were a big group so I can't really speak for the typical dining experience.

As such, this is the area that gets hot in the summer. The back room is my favorite, with big family-style tables and really cool decor, hard to explain, just lots of reclaimed wood and other building materials, the place has this old time, antique-y feel that just feels... authentic. And the back yard is cute and pleasant enough for a summer meal.The pizzas are really good, and they come out very quickly. Sometimes a little soggy but the sauce is so tasty that I actually don't mind so much. But if you come here for just pizza you are really not getting the full experience -- be sure to order several of the side/special dishes and share them with everyone at the table. Service is a little uneven, very Euro style. Basically, they bring the food out really fast, sometimes out of desired order, and then will let you just sit there forever unless you flag someone down. Also, went here once with a vegan friend, and there really is very little to eat, even for a vegetarian, as many of the veggie dishes include bits of meat (prosciutto, pancetta, etc.), and they seem hesitant to accommodate special dietary requests.No longer BYOB, they have an underwhelming but also inexpensive wine list, just a few basic goodies chosen to pair well with the food. I basically just order carafes of the house wine, it's a pretty good deal.Oh, and leave room for the tiramisu. Trust me.Overall, I do like it... a lot.

The hostess was polite and I could tell she and our waiter wanted to provide good service. The inside of the place is very lower east side vibe- the hipster I'm not trying too hard. I do wish they tried a little harder because where I'm sitting there is a cabinet I was facing that looks like someone dragged it in from a a dumpster- there's no reason it actually needs to look dirty to produce a low key vibe. A fresh coat of paint isn't going to hurt anyone. I will also say- what's up with the cash only policy?",3.0
"Drop everything and eat here! I really think that this is the best pizza on earth. It is perfect in every way. Crust, sauce, and cheese are all the best. If I don't eat here at least twice a month then my time on earth isn't being used well. Capocollo pizza all the way. I challenge anyone to find a better pizza.  Plus, the decor is soooooo charming. This is a great place to bring friends, family, go on a date, have a business lunch or dinner. It's simply the best. There is good pizza, great pizza, and then there is heavenly pizza. There are a few places that make heavenly pizza and this is one of them.",5.0
"Part of my job is to write neighborhood highlights and people always suggest this place for Bed-Stuy, and since I live here, I finally made it to check it out. It's not right off a train stop, so it's still not a breeze to get to, even if you're in the 'hood. We got there around 9:30 on a Monday, and the place only 1/4 full, which was fine by me. The servers didn't look happy to see us, but were pleasant enough. Service was fast, probably because they wanted us out of there, but whatever, the hours say til 11.It's pretty cute and rustic in there, the table wine was good and cheapish, as said in other reviews. For the pizza, it was soggy in the middle, but I think the flavors were there and I don't mind the sogginess too much, but if you do, then don't get the pizza.The main reason I'm not impressed is the pizza selection isn't that creative. I get that they are doing classic Italian fare with nice ingredients, but that's not enough to be special in NY..there were two, maybe three veg pizza options, and only one had a vegetable on it (zucchini, which is notorious for making pizzas soggy! not risking it at a place where pizzas are already said to be soggy). Anyway, I wish there were some interesting options on the main menu, including something vegetarian that isn't the margeherita (my boyfriend said it was good, so I'm not dissing, but there one million other options possible). I got the Capocollo  (spicy ham) and it was tasty, maybe even more so cold at midnight since it wasn't so floppy.I think Paulie Gees, Roberta's and Forcella (and RIP Motorino) in the Williamsburg area all have more creative options for cheaper prices.",3.0

"I can see how Saraghina gets such dashing reviews, seeing as there really aren't many great restaurants in the area. Unfortunately, my dining experience left much to be desired... I stumbled in here for brunch on a weekend only because Peach's Hothouse was closed. Since we already trekked all the way out to Bed-Stuy, we were eager to find a decent place in the neighborhood to satisfy our hunger. My initial impression of Saraghina was great - a rustic, spacious restaurant with seemingly simple and comforting Italian food. In addition to their pizzas, they offer a brunch menu on the weekends with your usual standbys like french toast, eggs benedict, sandwiches and a burger. Most of the brunch entrees fell in the range of $11-$16, which wasn't bad but seemed a bit pricey for an out-of-range restaurant in Brooklyn. Anyway, I ended up ordering the eggs any style with home fries, mixed greens, and substituted the bacon for sausage (for an additional fee). I requested my eggs to be soft scrambled, which actually came out quite perfect, very tender and fluffy. The homemade sausage I received was tasty as well, nicely grilled with a ton of fennel and cumin flavor. The bf ordered their burger, medium rare, served with fries. While his burger had good flavors from the roasted tomatoes, the beef was cooked to an unfortunate medium well. The fries on the side appeared to be only once fried, yielding an unpleasant al dente texture that almost tasted raw.  This review would have fared better based on the food alone, but the service was quite slow on our visit... It took almost 40 minutes for our dishes to come out, and this was after one waiter brought over the wrong order, only exacerbating my hunger and yearning. We also didn't realize they were cash only until after the meal, so it was kind of a pain having to go to an ATM down the street just to retrieve a couple 20s. Perhaps Saraghina shines in their pizza and I visited at the wrong time, but I really don't think I will return when there are so many great pizza restaurants in closer proximity with comparable prices.",2.0
"There is clearly artistry at work in this little neighborhood pizzeria/restaurant. The capocollo pizza I tried last night was a visual work of art, almost worthy of framing. And true to the Neapolitan standards for pizzamaking.Unfortunately, that artistry translated poorly to the flavor department. The tomato sauce was just too sour (a common fault with Naples-style pizzas) - and combined with the saltiness of the capocollo, the flavor experience was one which I would not look forward to repeating, despite the wonderful mozzarella, fresh basil, and fairly worth crust. I think the pizza would also have been tastier if there had been more generous use of spices.Service was also somewhat scatterbrained. In one case, for example, the pizzaiolo poured a liberal douse of olive oil onto a pizza right after he had taken it from the oven. A few moments later, when one of the servers came from the back to pick up the pizza, he poured yet another generous serving of olive oil on the same pizza. (And you wonder why some pizzas seem so oily!)In my case, I made the mistake of asking to sit with a handful of other diners in the front (so I could watch the pizzaiolo tending the woodburning oven) instead of in the garden. If you have a choice, choose the garden - that's where the staff's attention is focused.",3.0

They've all made me very happy. The mussels are also really delicious. I would skip dessert though. I love going here in the summer, due to the welcoming back garden. The staff is okay, not always the most helpful, but they're good enough. I just wonder why almost everyone is foreign. Everyone seems to be from Poland, France, etc., which is cool, but considering the neighborhood, it's just a little annoying, that there's virtually no reflection of the people that live in the area.",5.0

We decided to seat ourselves, and then not one member of staff even approached our table in another 5 minutes. So the service kinda sucks.

Not knock my socks off and bend over my tastebuds good, but definitely quality pizza. I had the bufala, and she got the prosciutto and funghi. The bufala was good, although it was a bit on the saucy side, making the pizza a little soggy in the middle. Her prosciutto was cut way too thick, and was actually surprisingly bland. The mushrooms were sauteed well and had a decent bit of flavor. By far the best part of the pizza is their crust. It's light, flaky, with a good char on the bottom. I just wish they didn't destroy it by drowning it in sauce. So to sum it up: meh-to-bad service, good-to-great pizza, but not amazing.

"For a horseman of the gentrification apocalypse, a pretty sweet ride. My mother practically cried when I brought her to Saraghina. For the first time, visiting me in Bed-Stuy, she felt at home. And why not? Walking in here is like walking into a pizzeria in Alphabet City, from the perfectly-pitched level of casual distressing to the vintage cookbooks in the adorable bathroom to the hand-written menus to the ice bucket they'll give you for the wine you've brought. And most of the staff - and clientele - feel imported too, lured by the restaurant's inclusion on New York's Top 20 or just by the novelty.If I sound ambivalent, it's not because of anything the restaurant's done - well, save maybe the imported staff, and for all I know they're all friends and family - but merely because it's such a harbinger, and that's always bittersweet. Peaches Market or Bread Stuy feel rooted in the neighborhood; this isn't, and I'm sure it's not the last to take advantage of affordable real estate and a burgeoning population of people attracted by the cheap brownstones and convenient trains. But I'm being the worst sort of hypocrite, because I'm obviously part of the exact same phenomenon (indeed, I'm only projecting) and I'd be lying if I said I hadn't already been three times since Saraghina opened.And, in fact, it's very good: I've had fresh muscles, little clams broiled with bread crumbs and garlic, and reasonably tasty artichokes. The pizza's soft, substantial, with a tasty sauce and milkily fresh mozz: I like the prosciutto and mushroom, which is hearty and savory. Service has been a little hit-or-miss, ranging from spot-on during a busy evening, to oddly spacey on a nearly-deserted one.

And most of the staff - and clientele - feel imported too, lured by the restaurant's inclusion on New York's Top 20 or just by the novelty.If I sound ambivalent, it's not because of anything the restaurant's done - well, save maybe the imported staff, and for all I know they're all friends and family - but merely because it's such a harbinger, and that's always bittersweet. Peaches Market or Bread Stuy feel rooted in the neighborhood; this isn't, and I'm sure it's not the last to take advantage of affordable real estate and a burgeoning population of people attracted by the cheap brownstones and convenient trains. But I'm being the worst sort of hypocrite, because I'm obviously part of the exact same phenomenon (indeed, I'm only projecting) and I'd be lying if I said I hadn't already been three times since Saraghina opened.And, in fact, it's very good: I've had fresh muscles, little clams broiled with bread crumbs and garlic, and reasonably tasty artichokes. The pizza's soft, substantial, with a tasty sauce and milkily fresh mozz: I like the prosciutto and mushroom, which is hearty and savory. Service has been a little hit-or-miss, ranging from spot-on during a busy evening, to oddly spacey on a nearly-deserted one. But it's exactly what you want in a neighborhood restaurant: affordable, tasty, casual, simple. Even if it has nothing to do with that neighborhood.",4.0
"I just have to say that I just enjoyed one of the best pizza's around. I honesty can say that! I know everyone has their favorite but give it a try. I travel and I eat pizza where ever I go, and this pizza is AMAZING! It was my first visit, recommended by the locals. You can't go wrong. The staff are pleasant and friendly, along with great food and welcoming ambiance. Please do not go in looking for specialty pizza's, it is simple, fresh and uncomplicated. Will be a fan for life. Schitze :)",5.0
"I recently had a lovely pizza meal in the backyard of Saraghina.I like the rustic feel of the interior and the backyard is very pleasant. I quite enjoyed the pizza here. Very tasty. Although, I will have to return to provide a more detailed analysis of the menu items. Overall, I was pleased with the food and the service. Other diners in the yard also looked pleased and relaxed. I'll definitely be back!",4.0
"THE BEST PIZZA IN NEW YORK, PERIOD.The selection is not crazy or anything, but it doesn't need to be.  The pies here are ridiculously delicious.  Everything that they use is fresh and tasty.  The Margehrita or Procuitto/Fungi pies are the best.  Please do yourself a favor and head out to Bedstuy to have this amazing pizza",5.0
"Saraghina- we had a good period in our relationship for the last year but you gotta keep it clean in the kitchen. You don't want to catch another C from the Health Dept- do you? I don't know if it was the liquified gorgonzola or the shrimp, but something attacked my intestinal track and now I'm laid out. Not a good look. Rethinking my rethinking of that no seafood on Sunday rule.",1.0
"I get the same thing every time. The Capocollo pizza is basically the best - light, tangy, chewy with a nice kick of spice after each bite. I also can not resist their Market Salad. It is also nice and tangy with some kind of mustard in it with beautiful yellow and red grape tomatoes and another finishing kick - more tangy lemon zest in almost every bite. For dessert, their Tiramisu is probably the best... The decor is amazing, the owner Kiko (I believe) designed and built most of what you see. It should be featured in a design magazine, in my opinion. The garden makes you feel like you are in a small town in Italy, but really, you are right in the heart of Bed-Stuy.",5.0

"I love that this place is 10 minutes away from my place. It's Italian meets boho, Brooklyn rustic. My favorite dish was the marinara pizza with the anchovies and basils on top.

"Let us think of pizza like drugs. There are a few kinds, and then there are few players. There's classic, old-school styled joints like John's on Bleecker and Grimaldi's; they serve the stuff that Domino's imitates, the ""glass-grade"" stuff. There's the single-size places like Motorino, Roberta's and Saraghina; they're a bit more creative, think of them like hybrid-combo gourmet shit. Then there's the places that suck and they know it but it's okay because they only sell to tourists; they're serving stems and seeds. Although Saraghina is new to the game, she's a serious competitor for not only her pies. She's not as creative with her pizza creations as Roberta's, but her supplementary dishes might be better. Going in a big group allowed us to try most of the menu, and the only thing I didn't really enjoy was the watermelon salad. Then there's also the environment; whereas Roberta's is kind of like doing the deed on the rush-hour train, Saraghina is like meeting on bikes in a park. This is partly because of the difficulty in getting there though. It's not in a neighborhood as gentrified as Bushwick (who'd have thought?), and at dinner we definitely argued about whether we heard gun shots or fireworks on the ride over. Unfortunately the prices do not quite correspond to the accessibility, a factor that when weighed against the convenience of Motorino or Roberta's is quite unfavorable.",4.0
"My wife and I went here in early June while we were on our honeymoon, and were surprised to find a tiny piece of Naples in the middle of Bed-Stuy.We shared a margherita pizza, which was good, but pale and under-baked. I haven't had enough Neapolitan pizza to say whether this was a fault in the pizza or in my appreciation of it, but it wasn't to my taste. The dandelion greens with fava puree and parmesan was delicious! The smooth, salty-cheesy favas with slightly bitter dandelion greens and plenty of olive oil was an edible distillation of spring/early summer. Brilliant! The house red was great too!A final note: the place is cash only. Not a problem for me at a standup sliceria, but once a restaurant gets into the $15/person and up range, I would appreciate it if they took credit.",3.0
"i was about to give this place another chance, but after reading the reviews they seem to still have the same problems.. we were completely ignored for 30 minutes, the pizza took over an hour to arrive, during that wait we had to GRAB a waiter to get our drink order. he never came back to our table to see if we needed anything. they obviously arent working for tips here, and i agree that whomever owns this place should read these reviews. your waiters suck. it's been over 2 years and they still suck. i will add the pizza was good, but not worth the wait and attitude.",1.0

"Welcome to the hood, Saraghina!I've been here twice: once with a large group on a quiet week night and another with one other person on a busy Sunday evening. Had the chance to try every kind of pizza. The verdict? Uber-yum!!When I went with the big group on the quieter night, service was wonderful. However, while the servers were attentive and movin' during the Sunday evening visit, they were not exactly accomodating per table and not quite ""cool."" But, food's always great, enjoyed the lighting, and will have to try their other plates.Also had the panna cotta, tiramisu, and the Italian creme brulee (too lazy to look up the name! hah). All were pretty tasty and nice sweets to complement the meal. Not too heavy, not too tiny either. Good portions. However, not a must have either. Still, yummy enough.Altogether? I think it's a nice little gem in the stuy. But, I hope no more like it open around within the vicinity... Ya know what I mean??Mmm pizza... Must watch 8 1/2 now.",4.0
"Just tried this place last night for the first time, after hearing several friends rave about it. As others have already commented, great pizza, great rustic vibe. It rivals Roberta's (its closest comparison), though perhaps doesn't surpass it. And the service is just fine. Get real folks. It's a busy place, and the servers seem stretched. They were as attentive and pleasant as one could possibly expect at a place like this. Finally, while its true that the Bufala pizza is a tad watery in the center, a) it was delicious all the same and b) the other pizzas (of which friends and I sampled a bunch) were not. Enjoy. Seriously good stuff.",5.0
"Very Italian, for what it's worth - thin pizza with few, but very fresh and tasty ingredients, thin sauce. Room temperature water and no A/C. Service lacks urgency. If you want a New York style experience, go elsewhere. If you want to feel like you're eating in Naples, find your way to Bed-Stuy. The backyard/garden is a great place to chill - you will be there for a while, so try to sit outside if the weather permits.",4.0
"I live around the corner so this has become a regular place for me.The food has been consistently good.  The pizza style is not exactly new york but the variety and quality are excellent.  Wines are cheap but tasty.  Octopus salad has been good many times over.  Its always lively and the staff are almost always courteous.The decor is cute, maybe a little too much.  I'd give it 4 stars if they would buy some more comfortable vintage chairs and tables.  Many of the chairs feel like they are going to break.  Same for some of the tables.  Some of which are too short and others are too tall relative to the chairs.  After an hour of eating well only to bang your knee on the furniture or feel smashed between chair and table virtually every time is annoying.",3.0
"The pizza was great, I shared the margharita pizza with my sister but I wish I had gotten my own to eat all by myself. The overall atmosphere was pleasant, and Saraghina is definitely a place both where the family can get together and have a fun meal and two people can have an intimate date by themselves.My only complaint is that while the staff was friendly, they definitely did not cater to their customers' needs during my visit. It took forever for our waiter to even notice we had finished our meal, and only then did he tell us that the place only took cash payments. We did not see any signs or indications that this was the case, and my sister had to leave and get cash from a nearby store. The waiters and waitresses seemed to rush between tables and overall Saraghina seemed very understaffed.",3.0
"After many months of waiting, Saraghina has finally opened in this unlikely spot, and, yes, it's good. It's not yet great, but it's good, and it has a lot of potential.The best comparison is to Roberta's, a gourmet pizza place in an unlikely comparison, and once Saraghina gets fully up and running, I think it might give Roberta's a run for it's money. The space is rustic in the right sense, there's a backyard and a patio, and, as I mentioned, the pizza is good.Based on my experience, though, the locals don't quite know what to make of it. It's cash only, BYOB, it doesn't do slices, and they only do take-out early in the evening, before the kitchen gets slammed.The service seems new and not quite ready for the rush, and only having one chef making the pizza in full view seems like a recipe for disaster, but thus far, it's working out. The prices are reasonable, and they're working on getting a wine and beer license. These things take time, so until then, it's BYOB. I recommend picking up from Olivino a couple blocks away.I'm excited to have a place this good and with this much potential on the block, and will definitely be going back often.",4.0
"My brother lives in the neighborhood and has been raving about this pizza. So during my visit, we have dinner there...it's amazing! He says best pizza in the country, I say best pizza in NY. First, let me start by saying the decor and ambiance in this place is awesome. The white walls, the eclectic furniture, the woodsy decor-all great. Then there is the brick oven with the wood fire for the pizzas. Only good pizzas come out of ovens like that! And the service, it was excellent. They were very friendly and attentive. So let me get to the food. The menu has some starters, the pizzas, deserts, a nice wine list. We started with the octopus in olive oil and sea salt. DELICIOUS! Even better when you take your pizza crust and dip it into the the sauce. You have 7 choices for pizza, and they are all tasty. We tried the Margherita, Capacolla, Prosciutto and Funghi, and Marinara with Anchovies. All the pizzas are thin, Ala Rome, with nice bubbles on the crust. They come out fast, and you end up eating the whole pizza fast! I would definitely come to this pizza spot again when I am in Bed-Stuy. In the meantime, I will be wishing for one to open up near me.",5.0

"Let's get one thing out of the way upfront - people don't generally travel to BedStuy for the restaurants.  But Saraghina seems to be changing all that with a simple formula goes something like this:1) Hand select fresh, local ingredients where possible.2) Keep dishes simple and focus on quality, rather than creativity3) Create a cool environment consisting of one part country store, one part cozy tavern and one part randomness4) Make some of the best wood-powered pizza this side of the adriatic5) Put a little love into the look and feel of the bathroom (you know an owner cares when they spend time thinking about the bathroom)Having spent a considerable amount of time wining, dining, sipping and supping my way around italy, i can safely say that you won't be disappointed with Saraghina, no matter where you're traveling from. I could eat five of their marinara pizzas in one sitting.",5.0
"Pizza is the first order of business at Saraghina's, a sprawling, charmingly rustic spot on an unassuming block in Bed-Stuy.  I realized only recently that I favor Neapolitan pies if I'm not going for vodka sauce.  Theirs is spot-on - we opted for the eggplant (& squash?), delicately flavored with lovely dollops of cheese, great sauce, and an excellent crust.  Their brunch menu is a bit sparse - the french toast was rich and tasty, but get the syrup on the side:  it's overly sweet with the bananas and strawberries.  Quality market salad, good house white & awesome cup of coffee.  A wee pricey for the 'hood, but definitely worth the trip.  The garden was a great place to be for the first muggy day of the year.  I'm so glad to see spots like this popping up.",4.0
"I know I'm going to have rocks thrown at my head for this one, but I just wasn't impressed for the price.The crust was reaching for that crispy-chewy I came to love in Italy.  It made it to the chewy part, but crispy was apparently a bit out of reach.  The end result just had me gasping for water.The mozzarella left much to be desired.  It was waxy for my taste.  Overall, it was good pizza, but not in the ranks where I wouldn't blink at dropping about forty bucks for two pies.",2.0
"Oh man. This is good stuff. The outside looks like some crappy dive bar, but, inside, it's open and welcoming. This place serves up some mighty fine pizza. I miss the days of BYOB (very, very much), but this is some seriously good pizza. The Italian waitstaff can be a little uneven, but they're all super approachable and helpful. It feels like they're a team, rather than a bunch of snooty independent contractors, which is a nice change. It feels like a cross between a secret garden and Naples. The pies aren't big, but the crust is chewy but still a little charred on the bottom. the sauce is mellow and definitely not overstated, and it really sets off the mozzarella. It's simple stuff done well. Highly recommended, especially for Bed-Stuy residents who are tired of traveling for decent food. It's proof that restaurants *can* pop up around here and serve the existing neighborhood, while being good for the neighborhood.

"When Saraghina arrived a few years ago I was excited and with good reason- the pies were high quality. The man behind the oven was Italian and worked that beautiful oven like a charm. Things were good and delicious for a time...........then came the days when Saraghina was a big hit. Everyone in the area loved it, people even traveled from around Brooklyn to get some of this great pie. But something went amiss. Gone was the Italian owner from the red hot pizza oven. In his steed was another guy and the waitstaff all hipsters. Something was wrong. Pizzas became gooey liquidy messes when they were once delicious crispy Neapolitan pies. Servers looked at you like you listened to Kenny G instead of Arcade Fire. It deeply saddened me. I stopped going. That was a few months ago. It's strange how a place can start out so promising and then completely disappoint you. The portions have become small, the prices have increased, and the pies are still a liquid mess. It's a sad state of affairs at Saraghina. And now all I can say is how dare they ripoff Fellini and disgrace the name Saraghina!!!!!!",1.0
"Distinctly different, quaint, happy and surprisingly wonderful in a little corner of Bed-Stuy...  I truly loved it here.Cappuccino could have been less milky, but the ""ferrari of espresso"" machines made up for the latte-ness of my drink with its sex appeal.I came for Brunch.  I will go again and again for dinner.  From Bed-Stuy with Love.  Happiness in the Hood.",4.0
"The pizzas are pretty good- not great - but good. Love the building and the decor. Went at prime time on a Saturday night and even though they were busy we still got seated right away. The service was friendly (unlike Franny's!!!) but they send the starter and pizzas at the same time. Not really enough space on the table and not quite sure what to start with first. Will certainly go back, but hopefully they will have better communication/coordination between the back and front of the house.",4.0

"Let's get one thing out of the way upfront - people don't generally travel to BedStuy for the restaurants.  But Saraghina seems to be changing all that with a simple formula goes something like this:1) Hand select fresh, local ingredients where possible.2) Keep dishes simple and focus on quality, rather than creativity3) Create a cool environment consisting of one part country store, one part cozy tavern and one part randomness4) Make some of the best wood-powered pizza this side of the adriatic5) Put a little love into the look and feel of the bathroom (you know an owner cares when they spend time thinking about the bathroom)Having spent a considerable amount of time wining, dining, sipping and supping my way around italy, i can safely say that you won't be disappointed with Saraghina, no matter where you're traveling from. I could eat five of their marinara pizzas in one sitting.",5.0
"Pizza is the first order of business at Saraghina's, a sprawling, charmingly rustic spot on an unassuming block in Bed-Stuy.  I realized only recently that I favor Neapolitan pies if I'm not going for vodka sauce.  Theirs is spot-on - we opted for the eggplant (& squash?), delicately flavored with lovely dollops of cheese, great sauce, and an excellent crust.  Their brunch menu is a bit sparse - the french toast was rich and tasty, but get the syrup on the side:  it's overly sweet with the bananas and strawberries.  Quality market salad, good house white & awesome cup of coffee.  A wee pricey for the 'hood, but definitely worth the trip.  The garden was a great place to be for the first muggy day of the year.  I'm so glad to see spots like this popping up.",4.0
"I know I'm going to have rocks thrown at my head for this one, but I just wasn't impressed for the price.The crust was reaching for that crispy-chewy I came to love in Italy.  It made it to the chewy part, but crispy was apparently a bit out of reach.  The end result just had me gasping for water.The mozzarella left much to be desired.  It was waxy for my taste.  Overall, it was good pizza, but not in the ranks where I wouldn't blink at dropping about forty bucks for two pies.",2.0
"Oh man. This is good stuff. The outside looks like some crappy dive bar, but, inside, it's open and welcoming. This place serves up some mighty fine pizza. I miss the days of BYOB (very, very much), but this is some seriously good pizza. The Italian waitstaff can be a little uneven, but they're all super approachable and helpful. It feels like they're a team, rather than a bunch of snooty independent contractors, which is a nice change. It feels like a cross between a secret garden and Naples. The pies aren't big, but the crust is chewy but still a little charred on the bottom. the sauce is mellow and definitely not overstated, and it really sets off the mozzarella. It's simple stuff done well. Highly recommended, especially for Bed-Stuy residents who are tired of traveling for decent food. It's proof that restaurants *can* pop up around here and serve the existing neighborhood, while being good for the neighborhood. That's up for debate, of course, but I hope more quality places -- though hopefully some more affordable ones -- show up soon, too.",5.0

"Went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't too crazy in there. But despite that, the service was kind of slow.  I had to repeat various orders to 2 different guys several times.  The food was okay.  Got the grilled octopus which was swimming in a medley of tomatoes, onions, and celery.  Tasty, but slightly salty.Also got the salsiccia pizza (some sort of meat and olives on it). It was alright. Again, salty, but that's probably because of the olives. I've definitely had better pizza.We tried ordering dessert but it was taking FOREVER for the tiramisu and panna cotta to arrive. I asked about the dessert for the 2nd time, and they said it was on the way. It wasn't really on the way, so we cancelled it.  When we did that, the waiter seemed really peeved.  Whatevs.It's a cute and cozy restaurant, and they gave my friend's kid some colored pencils and coloring sheets, so that was cool.  It's a nice addition to the neighborhood, but I don't feel a particular need to go back.",3.0
"Though I'm close-by it took a while for me to get to Saraghina.  I remember when it was being worked on and outside it looked like a shack for so long that I thought it was still closed. Well, that was almost 2 years ago now.  So on my second foray there, I finally sat and had dinner with a friend.  The pizza is very good and very fresh, but it's not amazing like so reviewers have said.  Is that because I don't eat meat?  I dunno.  I do wish the menu made more sense.  Then, as we sat way in the back, I saw things on the board there that weren't even on the menu. It needs better organizing to make it more understandable. I saw someone with a calzone looking thing and thought, ""Damn, I would've liked to have known about that.""  Or maybe I'm illiterate (I'm not).  That said, though I pass by often, I never realized HOW BIG it is in there and how comfortable. That alone would make me want to go back and actually sample something else and maybe even enhance my star meter, though hopefully they'll be less kids around next time - it was like a Mommy and Me meeting exploded in there.",3.0

"Saraghina is a special place. For one, it is a gorgeous environment, adorned with rustic wood boards, vintage chairs, exposed Edison bulbs, and antique signs (in one word, it rocks the Brooklyn ""artisanal"" aesthetic). Beyond that, it occupies a curious space within the otherwise incongruent Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. It's an outpost of artisanal New ""Breuckelen"" in an otherwise un-gentrified non-high end part of the city. But maybe that's the beauty of it; it is different enough (there are no other ""fancy"" restaurants for a few block stretch) and signifies the change that makes Brooklyn so interesting (love it or not). The food: well, the menu is accessible rustic Italian, with a killer pizza section. If Roberta's and Motorino share the prize of perfecting the crisp thin crust new school pizza, Saraghina occupies the other end of the spectrum: light and airy dough. For this alone, a food pilgrimage is merited. Adding locally sourced ingredients, seasonal toppings, and decidedly non-classic combinations (prosciutto and mushroom or eggplant and pepper) makes it, well, kind of interesting. But as purists go, the best way to enjoy Saraghina's flavor is to drink a Brooklyn Lager and sit next to the raw warmth of the pizza oven, watching your Edison bulb flicker overhead, and sinking your teeth into the classic tomato mozzarella margherita pizza. An added plus is that a meal for four, with three shared pizzas, beer and even some greens will barely set you back past $20-$25/head.",4.0

"3 1/2 starsit's a bit of a labyrinth to get to the backyard.  there's the smallish front room, a hallway, a quick right, then a left to enter the main dining area.  behind that is a bar  (with no seating, only showcasing desserts) and then a left to the outdoor seating.  usually in this type of labyrinth i expect to spot at least one minotaur, but we did not.the outdoor seating is really where it's at.  everything's (mostly) covered with large umbrellas so it's still a good bet even on days that it's much too sunny and bright.we tried the bufala and the prosciutto & funghi (sans prosciutto) pizzas.  the bufala was the star of the show.  the buffalo mozzarella was rich, creamy, and just made the pie.  the sweet and chunky san marzano tomato sauce and the fresh basil were nice as well, but i could have gone for a little more basil.  the olive oil on top was mild and seemed even a little sweet.  the funghi pie was decent, but not nearly as good.  i was hoping they'd use wild mushrooms, but they were, i believe, just regular button mushrooms instead.  maybe with the prosciutto, if it was strongly flavored would mute out the more expensive wild mushrooms.  i'll have to try it next time with prosciutto and see.the crust is thin, with delicious little char spots on the bottom, and it held up well with the bufala pie, but not as much with the funghi pie.  there's a selection a selection of (mostly) italian beers and wines.  when trying to decide between a couple of beers, our server told me that the menabrea italia wasn't available anywhere else, so i went with that and was happy with my decision.for dessert ,the tiramisu was little lighter than i'm used to, and it was a welcome change.  i'd definitely get it again.service is top-notch.  we didn't just have one server, any server walking by would ask if we needed anything.  couldn't be happier with how things are run.of course, something had to mar the experience:  hyperactive children with parents subscribing to the ""let them roam wild"" philosophy.  there is no exaggeration when i tell you that this little boy and girl were doing laps around the tables.  finally, we had enough.as the little boy walked by for maybe the 15th time, i said ""get lost!""  he went back to the table and watched me with puzzlement.  then he told his sister, who decided to do enough laps for both of them and she proceeded to power walk around the tables.  finally, i said ""beat it, stupid!"" and she quickly ran to her table and said ""that man over there said ""beat it stupid!""  the parents laughed.  they knew their kids were assholes.the best part though, happened before they all left.  the boy and the girl started whispering to one another in what looked like conspiratorial tones.  finally, they stood up, held hands, and did a final, defiant ""fuck you lap"" around the restaurant.  that was kind of cute.",3.0

I even took my mom (who is a critic to nth degree) and she was swooning when we left. My faves are the Salsiccia and the Capocollo (hammy goodness). I even liked the octopus (big deal for me...). RUN, don't walk and getchoo some pizza!",5.0
"3 1/2 starsit's a bit of a labyrinth to get to the backyard.  there's the smallish front room, a hallway, a quick right, then a left to enter the main dining area.  behind that is a bar  (with no seating, only showcasing desserts) and then a left to the outdoor seating.  usually in this type of labyrinth i expect to spot at least one minotaur, but we did not.the outdoor seating is really where it's at.  everything's (mostly) covered with large umbrellas so it's still a good bet even on days that it's much too sunny and bright.we tried the bufala and the prosciutto & funghi (sans prosciutto) pizzas.  the bufala was the star of the show.  the buffalo mozzarella was rich, creamy, and just made the pie.  the sweet and chunky san marzano tomato sauce and the fresh basil were nice as well, but i could have gone for a little more basil.  the olive oil on top was mild and seemed even a little sweet.  the funghi pie was decent, but not nearly as good.  i was hoping they'd use wild mushrooms, but they were, i believe, just regular button mushrooms instead.  maybe with the prosciutto, if it was strongly flavored would mute out the more expensive wild mushrooms.  i'll have to try it next time with prosciutto and see.the crust is thin, with delicious little char spots on the bottom, and it held up well with the bufala pie, but not as much with the funghi pie.  there's a selection a selection of (mostly) italian beers and wines.  when trying to decide between a couple of beers, our server told me that the menabrea italia wasn't available anywhere else, so i went with that and was happy with my decision.for dessert ,the tiramisu was little lighter than i'm used to, and it was a welcome change.  i'd definitely get it again.service is top-notch.  we didn't just have one server, any server walking by would ask if we needed anything.  couldn't be happier with how things are run.of course, something had to mar the experience:  hyperactive children with parents subscribing to the ""let them roam wild"" philosophy.  there is no exaggeration when i tell you that this little boy and girl were doing laps around the tables.  finally, we had enough.as the little boy walked by for maybe the 15th time, i said ""get lost!""  he went back to the table and watched me with puzzlement.  then he told his sister, who decided to do enough laps for both of them and she proceeded to power walk around the tables.  finally, i said ""beat it, stupid!"" and she quickly ran to her table and said ""that man over there said ""beat it stupid!""  the parents laughed.  they knew their kids were assholes.the best part though, happened before they all left.  the boy and the girl started whispering to one another in what looked like conspiratorial tones.  finally, they stood up, held hands, and did a final, defiant ""fuck you lap"" around the restaurant.  that was kind of cute.",3.0

And then, there is also a garden where we can sit outside. I had a pizza, Prosciutto and Funghi ($16), OMG. This is one hell of pizza that I wish I only had a mouth without stomach so that I can eat forever. It was a medium plus sized and a lot more than I can handle. I took the half to go. Generious spread of the italian Prosciutto (Italian import) with portobella mushroom & Basil. Pizzas here are thin crusted but not too thin so that you can hold up. Yumm. The crust is very crispy but I love love love the Prosciutto the most. Sometimes, I am not a big fan of Prosciutto when it is too salty. But this one is fresh and not at all salty but rather taste more like ham without being so smoked or preserved. Love it. Love it. Love it....... My friend had a scrambled eggs with some bacons.

"i went there for lunch with friends a couple of months ago.  If you don't want pizza, then don't go there for lunch.  There is little else on the menu to choose from besides pizza.  Also, they do NOT tolerate changes to the menu (i.e. no cheese, etc.) I don't eat pizza, so I got a crab salad, which was good, although nothing special, and was overpriced.  My friends said the pizza was some of the best pizza they'd ever had.  Unfortunately, the service was not great.  My friends who enjoyed the pizza were also turned off by the poor service.  None of us plan to return.  If you like pizza and don't care that much about customer service, it's worth checking out.",3.0

The front room is an utterly charming, rustic wood-enhanced room with two corner banquettes for 6, a row of dueces, and a bar in front of the wood-fired oven - which before summer, wasn't too hot, and made you feel like you'd stepped into some cozy, secret farm kitchen in an Italian village. For summer, they've opened the large cafe area in the back, as well as a double-sized garden dining area - both offering simple but ingenious design elements (old Borscht Belt camp signs, vintage farm equipment, large planters with full trees and flowers in bloom) and a more spacious and temperature-friendly environment.The service here is indeed still spotty; I think they underestimated how popular the place would get in such a short period of time, and it's unclear if the all-Italian wait staff has any prior table-waiting experience.

Light, pillowy crust, lightly charred (but not burned) in the wood-fired oven; fresh ingredients, and my absolute favorite is the capicolla - a type of Italian ham that lands in flavor and texture someplace between Spanish serrano and Italian salami - which is also topped with tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella. This pie is for grown-ups what Kit Kat bars are to kids - a wonderful, gooey, flavorful treat with a crisp bite in the crust. I have also tried the margherita, the eggplant, and the proscuitto varieties, all similarly tasty and fresh. I haven't yet bothered to try the entree specials - as the novelty of such great pizza place only 2 blocks away from my house hasn't yet worn off - but the appetizers, such as the fennel salad and a fresh mozzarella salad with fresh basil and bread for dipping in the milk-like cheese were both tasty (a word of warning: this fresh mozzarella cheese is not for everyone: I loved it, but my husband didn't like the drippy nature of the homemade cheese). Yes, it's BYOB, but to me that's NABD - not a big deal. In fact, I like having the ability to choose my own wine and bring it along, and it certainly keeps the price of the meal down.

I haven't yet bothered to try the entree specials - as the novelty of such great pizza place only 2 blocks away from my house hasn't yet worn off - but the appetizers, such as the fennel salad and a fresh mozzarella salad with fresh basil and bread for dipping in the milk-like cheese were both tasty (a word of warning: this fresh mozzarella cheese is not for everyone: I loved it, but my husband didn't like the drippy nature of the homemade cheese). Yes, it's BYOB, but to me that's NABD - not a big deal. In fact, I like having the ability to choose my own wine and bring it along, and it certainly keeps the price of the meal down. We'll see what happens as the place evolves - and I look forward to being able to order pies to go - but for now, getting it right in the kitchen is a great place to start.",4.0
"Wow! Really impressed by this amazing restaurant right near our house, and even though I can walk there from my house,  I disagree with an earlier reviewer who said it wasnt worth a trip from the city. Great atmosphere, great outdoor space, and busy but not manhattan crazy on a Friday night.  The grilled Octopus salad was one of the best of many I've had.  4 stars is because the service was a tad bit slow, but friendly.  Two of us BIG boys ate a lot, plus wine and the bill was just a little over 100 bucks.",4.0
"I love this place, I go every time I'm back visiting friends in Bed Stuy.  The food is tastey and totally reasonable and the staff is super sweet.  We always have this girl with a a gorgeous accent and yet more gorgeous curly hair.  Also, their shaken iced coffee is a life saver on a hot morning.  The decor is charming and their table wine(I've only had the white) is pretty good.  I'd absolutely recommend this place and I'll definitely be back.  It's nice to see such a charming place in Bed Stuy, hopefully it's a sign of more good things to come.",4.0
"OMG!  Saraghina is my ""Go-to""  spot to ""think-n-drink""!  It seems like I'm compelled to wake up, get my morning coffee and muffin fix and get some writing done here everyday!  THE best cafe Americano and THE best... and when I say THE best... THE BEST pastries and pizza ever!  I make it a point to be there when Pascal brings out those freshly baked muffins, made FROM SCRATCH straight from the kitchen.  They're never too sugary and sweet, and made just right -- even more amazing warm!  Again, the pizzas are amazing too and they are freshly made to order.  The atmosphere is rustic and cozy plus the staff a all friendly, even the patrons all seem civil and cordial to one another.  Sarahgina, the BEST pizza, pasta, and pastries hangout in Bed-Stuy!!!",5.0

"Their pizza is definitely superior to the average NY Slice but it's not so good that I would travel out of my way to try it.  Especially since this place has the most confused waitstaff I have ever encountered.  The service was a comedy of errors, apps coming out after entrees, a lost waiter trying to serve us another table's pizza after we had finished dessert...  They were all young, sweet, very apologetic, and luckily I was with a group of people who weren't uptight about such things but I could definitely see how others could get upset over all the bumbling.  I did really enjoy the specials.  There were some nice seasonal dishes on the list.  The desserts were kind of sad though.  They all came swimming in pools of half-melted ice cream.  So not a place to take a date or your mother, etc.  But if you live nearby and want to have a casual meal, Saraghina is a nice option to have.",3.0

We were having a nice conversation and didn't quite realize the wait. The aforementioned Italian man gave us and the other few people in the place creame-filled doughnuts topped with sugar. My grandparents own a doughnut shop, so I've always been picky about my doughnuts. But these were fantastic! We finally got our pizza and it was so fresh and summery for a snowy winter afternoon.

The pizza was a little soggy but then they brought us back a pie that was just right. One thing I didn't like when they first opened was that my family was stared at by other customers as if we not native to the community African American=Bed Stuy. Not like we were in Park Slope.

"Wow, Saraghina.  We live in the neighborhood, and we probably get Seraghina take out twice a month.  The pizza is outstanding: Grimaldi's style but smokier.  Really, this is better then Grimaldi's pizza.  I always get the Bufala margherita pizza, which is incredible.  The pasta specials (which change daily) are outstanding.  In particular I've enjoyed an amazing spaghetti with clam sauce, and a kind of thick pasta with beef ragu.In warmer weather, we'll sometimes eat there (instead of take out), because the space is so incredibly charming/ romantic.  But we have kids, so we don't want to ruin the charm/ romance for everyone else...  (Note to parents: go between 5 and 6pm and the place is full of other families.  Go after 7 and you will seriously annoy the other [child-free] patrons.)  In all seriousness, the decor is stunning: has a sort of rustic Italian barn feeling.  During the summer, the garden is so gorgeous, it feels like you're transported to another world.Here are the only cons (which in my mind don't detract from my five star rating because the food is so outstanding):1. They don't take orders over the phone.  I mean, I understand that they don't deliver, but it would be SO much easier if we could order before we come to pick up instead of ordering there and then waiting for the food.  This is a pizza place, after all...2.  It's expensive, especially for Bed Stuy.  Spending $17 on a personal pizza is a little ridiculous.  But there are so few other options nearby, that we do it.  Like I said above, the food is worth it, but if it were a little cheaper we'd be able to eat there more often.3.  It's doesn't cater to (or attract?) locals.  Sometimes we go there and feel like we're the only people who actually live in Bed Stuy.  I mean, of course I LOVE that people come to the neighborhood to eat, because it's great for the local economy.  But it would be nice to see more locals frequenting the establishment, a la Peaches down the street.",5.0

The pizza was a little soggy but then they brought us back a pie that was just right. One thing I didn't like when they first opened was that my family was stared at by other customers as if we not native to the community African American=Bed Stuy. Not like we were in Park Slope. Seems the atmosphere is more relaxed and reality has set in. Now the only thing I wish the would put their grade from the health department up ad not brush the issue under the rug.,3.0

"pizza was very good, reminded me of Roberta's in Bushwick.  didn't have that many food options but the Pizza Margherita was really tasty.",4.0
"Wow, Saraghina.  We live in the neighborhood, and we probably get Seraghina take out twice a month.  The pizza is outstanding: Grimaldi's style but smokier.  Really, this is better then Grimaldi's pizza.  I always get the Bufala margherita pizza, which is incredible.  The pasta specials (which change daily) are outstanding.  In particular I've enjoyed an amazing spaghetti with clam sauce, and a kind of thick pasta with beef ragu.In warmer weather, we'll sometimes eat there (instead of take out), because the space is so incredibly charming/ romantic.  But we have kids, so we don't want to ruin the charm/ romance for everyone else...  (Note to parents: go between 5 and 6pm and the place is full of other families.  Go after 7 and you will seriously annoy the other [child-free] patrons.)  In all seriousness, the decor is stunning: has a sort of rustic Italian barn feeling.  During the summer, the garden is so gorgeous, it feels like you're transported to another world.Here are the only cons (which in my mind don't detract from my five star rating because the food is so outstanding):1. They don't take orders over the phone.  I mean, I understand that they don't deliver, but it would be SO much easier if we could order before we come to pick up instead of ordering there and then waiting for the food.  This is a pizza place, after all...2.  It's expensive, especially for Bed Stuy.  Spending $17 on a personal pizza is a little ridiculous.  But there are so few other options nearby, that we do it.  Like I said above, the food is worth it, but if it were a little cheaper we'd be able to eat there more often.3.  It's doesn't cater to (or attract?) locals.  Sometimes we go there and feel like we're the only people who actually live in Bed Stuy.  I mean, of course I LOVE that people come to the neighborhood to eat, because it's great for the local economy.  But it would be nice to see more locals frequenting the establishment, a la Peaches down the street.",5.0
"absolutely delish - i loved every moment and each bite. i had heard rave reviews, both personal and published, about saraghina so i was excited yet wary of potential New Year's Syndrome/Everyone Loves This Movie disappointment striking. butttt, instead i was totally captivated. carafes of wine were flowing, the pizzas were perfetto, the dandelion greens appetizer was outstanding, and to top it all off the cute italians christened us with limoncello and pompelmo-limoncello at the end! mille grazie ragazzi!",5.0
"Best European-style pizza I have had in New York, cute backyard, and looks like it will be cozy inside in the winter. Worth a detour, and for those who don't know the neighborhood, take a moment to walk around and see the beautiful houses.",4.0
"the rain falls and turns oil-stained concrete into a mirror of the neon midnight world and I find the small Italian eatery tucked away on a residential street in Bed Stuy where the wood-stoked pizza oven illumines more brick walls and bebop hums from the garden out back and the font of the letters is slender like the woman sipping red wine next to me. she complains that they wont put spinach on her pizza and I pretend to be on her side, but secretly side with them",5.0
"As a neigborhood resident, I was happy to see Saraghina arrive.  I've been twice since they opened. I won't be going back until I see the NYC DOH letter grade of C upgraded on the window.  They have 33 violations, which has increased from 2 during the first DOH visit.  There were multiple violations listed in RED which is a huge no-no.  I also don't like the feeling of being ""transported to another place [read: neighborhood/city]"" as everyone else seems to enjoy who posts here.  This is Bed-Stuy, and I believe the neighborhood lends itself to a restaurant rather than detracts from it.  I hear now that the owner is leaving to open another restaurant.  Hopefully he is leaving behind a manager who can clean up their acts and get rid of the vermin.  It would be nice if they could hire from the neighborhood where they operate also. Oh, I forgot, none of us are white, young & Italian speaking.... hmmmm.",1.0
"My wife and I just came home from our trip to Rome, Sorrento, Sicily and Venice.  We had pizza (of course) in each city.  We came home with such an appreciation for Saraghina because it rivals the best we had while away.  Whenever we miss Italy we will be sure to have dinner at Saraghina!!",5.0
"Arrived in Brooklyn for a short stay August 2010 from UK. Didnt know the area and the ladies wanted me to book a hotel in Manhatten that night. I pursuaded them to stay and we went to Saraghina's for our first meal and they were hooked. Excellent food, really good helpful staff. Don't be put off by the exterior facade Saraghinas is a really nice place to go. The menu is a bit limited but what is on it they do really well. We went twice in four days.",4.0
"The place is quaint and decorated nicely. We (my husband, daughter and I) ended up there because the wait for nearby Peaches was over 45 minutes. We visited on a Saturday afternoon. Very slow and quiet, nice atmosphere. However, when the bill came, we were taken aback. It was WELL over $60! A lot over, in fact. Ordered 2 pies, some nutella with bread and only 2 glasses of wine. It was ok. Service was great because we were the only ones in there. We may go again, after we win the lottery.",2.0
"4 solid stars, sadly, holding back a quarter star due to cash only policy.  that said, this place is lovely with a charming decor that mixes european flea markets with rustic hudson valley weekend getaways.  you'd never guess that the back dining area was once a garage or that the front of the house was a greasy-spoon fast food establishment.  or so our waiter said, and charming as he was (as was everyone working there, actually, easy on the eyes, too), i might believe him anything.  thankfully, we heeded his suggestion that the pizzas were large-ish by some standards even though they were considered personal-sized.  don't know who polishes off a whole pie by themselves because we had 2 pies split 4 ways, and really, there was little room left in my tummy for more.  though i really wanted there to be because the pizza was tasty with the right kind of thin, charred pillow-y but pliant crust and topped with simple but honest (and yummy) ingredients.  pizza deep in bed stuy beats greenpoint's hands down.",4.0
