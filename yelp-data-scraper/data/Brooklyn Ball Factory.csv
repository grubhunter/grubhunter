"Living pretty much across the street from here and feeling too lazy to go anywhere far for lunch, my brother and I gave this place a try.Upon walking up to the place you are greeted by a set of large, antique-ish metallic doors that seemed out of place but I guess it's a part of the hipster tradition of doing things before they are cool right? Behind the doors is a cozy cafe environment with seating for about fifteen people at a time and tables big enough for groups of two. There is rooftop seating but since it's winter no one was dining upstairs. The amount of seating available throughout the day depends on how busy they are and your cold tolerance.My brother ordered the Meatball Bento and I ordered the Grilled Pork Betty(typo?) and Macha Latte. The soups included with the bento boxes came first to the table which was a vegetable medley type broth that was light and not too flavorful but the warmth of it made it very enjoyable on this cold day. The Macha Latte came next scalding hot in a paper coffee cup. Once it cooled down enough and I tried the drink, I liked it. It was sweet and creamy with a strong taste of macha powder but not really any coffee taste. Again, perfect for the cold day. But for the price tag of $4.75? mehhhhh. Lastly, the bento boxes came in a plastic container reminiscent of school lunch trays but much more aesthetically pleasing. Both bento boxes that came included sides of stir-fried veggies, quinoa-infused white rice, edamame, pickled celery, plain  salad. Nothing that really tasted out of the world but it does the job of adding variety and appealing colors to the meal. The main attraction which were the pork belly and meatballs in our respective meals were a much more memorable experience. The pork belly was well seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and had a flavorful teriyaki-like sauce. Being the one who was writing the Yelp review, I convinced my brother to willingly give me a meatball to try. After trying it, I actually liked it a bit more than the pork belly. Although not much different from the conventional meatball that you may find in other restaurants, the taste of it with the sauce that it came with, (which I am convinced is probably an apple-soy based sauce,) added a second layer to the flavor and really made the meatball Brooklyn Ball Factory's own.Overall, the service was fast, quick, and painless. The location was a bit funny for me being right across from the elementary school I attended. The food was good but not fantastic. The price for the food we ordered was around $35 after taxes and tip, which is a bit pricey but around the ballpark for the restaurants around the area. I would definitely recommend this place to people who need a place to try out with a single other person such as a significant other or friend.",4.0
"Stuck between a three and a four star review for Brooklyn Ball Factory, I decided to lean towards a four star review this time. I found the food to be a three star quality, but the concept, organization, and ambiance of the place to be a four and a half star quality as reflected on yelp. FOOD: I got the bento box with the tempeh quinoa to continue on replacing some of my meals with vegan/vegetarian options. The bento box itself was nicely done and reminds me of times when I would get bento boxes in Japan/Taiwan. A salad, soup, pickled vegetables, grilled vegetables, rice (and quinoia in this case), and the tempeh was included in the bento lunch special. The sauce used in the tempeh was pretty strong, but not bad. I thought it could have toned down the salt. The rice/quinoa mixture on the other hand was a bit dry in my opinion. Perhaps the quinoa absorbed more of the moisture, but picking up the rice made it difficult to eat with chopstick. SERVICE: Great! Overall, the ambiance is very Brooklyn and the cafe speaks to its demographic in Williamsburg. What a great find!",4.0
"I'm gonna be honest from the outside it looks like shit. But if there's anything about what makes Brooklyn so special is the hidden gems with spectacular product. This place is one of them. 5 stars for how great they make coffee. The girls who work here are super cute, Japanese and amicable. I usually go for a black iced coffee but opted for the unusual sounding maple coffee. Amazing! The amount of mindfulness they put into every cup is amazing. Totally worth $4. I wish I was hungry because everyone here seemed to be chewing down on some delicious grub. The kitchens smelt smoky and amazing. FYI - 8$ minimum for credit but there is an atm machine.",5.0
Great quality coffee. Their green tea white chocolate muffins are great wish they didn't run out so fast.,5.0
"Had some incredible lunch today at the Brooklyn Ball Factory. The Service counter girls are friendly. The place is a little small inside due to the large work area in the back of the restaurant, my other gripe is the chairs and table are not comfortable. But the food is really good for Asian fusion. I ordered the pork belly bento which was worth every penny and my girlfriend had the Japanese fried chicken bento all I have to say is yummy! great use of seasoning that creates delicious food.",4.0
You have to try their ice matcha latte! Its the best matcha I've ever had. I'll usually order two when I go. I come from Crowne Heights to get this. The food is really good there too! Must go!,5.0
"The coffee here is always on point! Really friendly staff that always aim to please. The space is kind of small (on the ground floor) but they have a roof top that is open when weather permits. I've ordered the salmon bento box a few times, to go, and it's been excellent each time. The 'pour over' coffee is worth the wait. There are good coffee spots in the area but this one is a standout!",5.0
"Wonderful place with absolute perfection put into everything they do. Staff skilled and friendly, beautiful understated decor with a thrill of artisanal antiquity, coffee impeccable and the food absolutely out of this World. My favourite place in Brooklyn.",5.0
"Came here by chance on a weekend visit to East Williamsburg. They have a nice rooftop space you can take your food or drinks up to. Not a super scenic view, but the roof has a nice garden and some cool graffiti art which makes it a calming space to getaway and enjoy your morning.Had the hot green tea and the iced yuzu drink which were both great. They also have bento boxes that come with a soup, salad rice, and your choice of protein. Tried the meatballs which come in a heavy, savory sauce and are pretty tasty. Also had the pork belly which was surprisingly tender (~$12 each). If you're in the area, it's a great place to grab a quick bite of Japanese food or some coffee/tea.",4.0
"I've walked by this place oh-so-many times on the way to Nam Nam (great banh mi!!!), but was always too lazy to take a look. Glad I made the visit tonight. I love it.The shop is beautifully minimalist. High ceiling. White walls. Potted plants and magazines on a wooden bar. Rooftop access. Basically everything an Instagrammer could ask for. A very relaxing vibe. I probably could sit there all day long and contemplate the meaning of life, the universe and everything.We didn't get to try any of the food as our group came in as they were closing up (yeah, we're those people). But the drinks are magnificent. Good selection of tea and coffee available for consumption. They seem to take their coffee pretty seriously. I would think so with the plethora of brewing equipment on display: copper v60, siphon, Kyoto drip tower etc. So naturally, I had an iced tea, the ""Hoji"". It was wonderful. Had a sip of my friend's Kenya pour-over and it was great too. They use 95RPM coffee.The barista was very friendly, and almost forgot to charge us (until we reminded him, cause we're honest people). Also gave me info on one of the cute little Fuji Royal grinders that I spotted.I will definitely be back to check out the rest of the stuff.PS: I love how chaotically organized the coffee bar was.",5.0

"All of the restaurants in this mini empire of restaurants bare some elements of the ""Japanese hipster"" trend, but at the Brooklyn Ball Factory, things really take flight.There's an expensive water filtration system designed to remove certain minerals in the cooking and coffee, an expensive machine to make said coffee and management straight out of a Muji catalog.It's all a bit silly, and would completely fall under the weight of its own pretension if the product wasn't up to snuff. I don't drink coffee, but I have sampled my way around the slowly evolving menu. On a recent visit I wasn't able to sample the curry (I remain surprised at how often this professional operation is out of certain food items) but instead returned to the meatball rice plate.Not a traditionally Japanese dish by any means, the very hearty and slightly sweet balls come with a large, bitter salad, plenty of rice and an elevated take on miso soup. It's a very good deal, even more surprising considering the rather steep coffee prices.Less innovative dishes and Japanese classics available here at the same level. There's no evidence of the boring flavors and dry meat that led to Samurai Papa a few blocks away being a massive letdown.The best thing about the Ball Factory it is roof space. I don't think many guests realize that the Ball Factory serves alcohol, but they do have a beer on draft on a couple on bottles. Coming out here on a spring afternoon, with the wrap around wooden benches and fresh breeze, the most surprising thing is that there aren't more people here. Don't tell anyone.",4.0
"The more accurate rating would be 4.5 stars but due to the great service and ambience I feel good about 5 stars!

"Japanese meatballs on a rooftop in East Williamsburg? This place is as great as it is random.The small spot has a few seats as you walk in, right in front of the counter/kitchen where you place your order, but it's more fun to enjoy your meal in the rooftop garden. It doesn't have the nicest view (mostly neighboring projects), but it is a very nice, pleasant way to enjoy the tasty menu of Japanese staples and other random stuff cooked fresh by the very friendly Japanese staff:- Meatball Sandwich ($9)Given the name of the eatery, this was appropriately the best thing we had, by far. Still, the name of the place is misleading as this is the single meatball item you can order here. Anyway, this gets you a sturdy hero roll stuffed with two massive meatballs, topped with fermented apple sauce and some greens. The meatballs, a mix of chuck and short rib, are so juicy and flavorful, and are the one must order item.- Pork Shabu Shabu Bento ($12)Consisting of a decent-sized pile of the thinly sliced, fatty meat, along with soup and some salad and a hearty scoop of rice, this was another solid option, but not quite as tasty as the sandwich. I'm not the biggest Shabu Shabu person, so I probably should've chosen one of the several other available proteins instead.- Japanese Curry Rice ($8.50) with Chicken (+ $3)This was nearly identical to the bento box, but just with some curry sauce on the side instead. The chicken was much tastier though, making this a much better option.- Milky Toast ($3)These 3 long strips of sweet, crusty bread are great. This is a nice item to enough on the side, especially if you don't get a sandwich and want some bread to go with your rice.- Rosemary French Fry ($4)This was the one major failure, a carton of shockingly undercooked and soggy fries. There was an occasional one that was at least slightly browned and worth eating, but they were mostly pale and nearly raw.- White Chocolate Cranberry Oatmeal Cookie ($1.50)On our way down after the meal, we tried one of the few varieties of cookies available at the counter. This was a pretty decent cookie, with huge discs of white chocolate and a faint cranberry flavor.After a good sampling of the menu, I think I see now why they named this place the Brooklyn Ball Factory, as the meatballs were the best. I would come back, but probably just to get the meatballs again. And maybe to try the Shaved Ice for dessert.",4.0
"Very unique - confluence of awesome coffee, relaxed vibe, Japanese flare, friendly service and a rooftop!  Hello Brooklyn.  I had the veggie sandwich which was not bad -  good portion sizes relative to the cost.  The rooftop is more akin to someone's apartment building roof as oppose to what you would imagine in a retail setting.

"Visiting Brooklyn Ball Factory in the morning is certainly the highlight of my day.

The staff all come say hello and give Meatball a big, warm welcome. When my friend arrives, we spend time bullshitting on the bench out front, patiently awaiting our coffee, which is not only delicious but very reasonably priced. Every morning, my friend and I trade off who's picking up the tab but never do we forget to tip. How can you not when the folks behind the bar treat you like family?

I'm writing this review of my Sunday morning breakfast which is very minimal but delish. For under $10 you can get an amazing coffee special of the day (this one is a dark roast with maple that I watched the barista make with tender loving care) and a yummy croissant with salmon and capers and sauce. It's just what I needed this morning. For breakfast they also have lots of muffins and pastries. Decor is lovely. Staff is super friendly. Music has been killing it.

Soup was a little thin but at the free-ninety-nine price point, who am I to complain?The atmosphere is brooklyn chic. Modern industrial minimal. Two four seater tables on backless bar stools made of weathered wood and iron. Three of those stools face a counter space.

Soup was a little thin but at the free-ninety-nine price point, who am I to complain?The atmosphere is brooklyn chic. Modern industrial minimal. Two four seater tables on backless bar stools made of weathered wood and iron. Three of those stools face a counter space. Cute upstairs area but it was baking on a hot summer day so didn't stay up there long. $27 for both entrees, rosemary fries, soup, an aranciata, and a glass bottle coke. Definitely a good deal.Friendly service staff - Great place will be back!",4.0
"I was in the neighborhood and just wanted to go for a quick meal so I looked for some places on Yelp and found the Brooklyn Ball Factory. The place has a clean industrial feel to it. I walked in and ordered the salmon bento with a draft beer. The food is delicious. The bento comes with rice, a small salad, soup, some vegetables and salmon. It tasted amazing and I would highly recommend the place if you're in the area (or even if you're not). The price is pretty fair ($17 for my meal and a draft beer). The people working here are also very friendly and helpful. A 'must-taste' for anyone that's in the area!",5.0
"Oh I really like this place!!!  Especially in warm weather, their rooftop dining area is SUPER cute!  This place serves some comfort Japanese food in the form of sandwiches or bentos.  I had the meatball ball bento which came with soup and several small items.  My date had the pork shabu shabu which he really liked.  I tasted it and it was indeed good!Prices were on point too, items avg 10-12 bucks.  Also their yuzu ginger iced tea is yum!Definitely coming back to try all their other stuff.",4.0
"If you don't like the cost of the coffee you know little to nothing about the quality of coffee you are getting. The Japanese pride themselves on precision and attention to detail. They make everything small batch, by hand, with specially purified water. It's not mass produced cold brew syrup crap. You'll still pay the same for said syrup crap at any other coffee spot in the city. People who think this is expensive probably think folgers is good. One of the best iced coffees I've had in NYC, I'd even go so far as to say anywhere aside from select spots in New Orleans or the Bay Area. The food is ridiculously good as well. Try Samurai Papas down the street for more expansive food options as this is their night time restaurant, ball factory serves as their prep location. This is one of the best spots in the 5 Burroughs.",5.0
"I had the grilled pork bento to go. Pork was cooked a little watery but still very tasty. Love the mixed grain rice. Also you get a few small dishes (very small portion though) on the side with a miso soup. So I just wish the food portion can be bigger, especially the rice. Overall food is healthy, delicate, fresh and delicious. Williamsburg needs more decent yet not pricey Japanese places like this!",4.0
"Came here on a Friday night around 8pm. Cool interior; modern space. Was a little too  chilly to use the outdoor area, but I could tell it'd be fantastic on a sunny day.Despite the friendly staff and cool decor, the food was terribly disappointing. The rosemary fries were soggy, resembling a pile of steamed potato strips as opposed to french fried potatoes. It's also worth mentioning the fries were crinke cut, and did not resemble those pictured on yelp at all. Lastly, they were incredibly over-seasoned. We were a group of three and none of us were able to eat more than a few pieces. They were kind enough to refire another order of fries, which came back with less seasoning, but were still soggy and mushy, not a crispy fry in sight. Sadly, I'm led to believe it's just the way it's done here. The rest of the meal was hard to enjoy, I think all our palates were burned out by the initial salt attack from the rosemary fries. I'm gonna give this place another shot, in all honestly the pork shabu bento looks delicious. Fingers crossed!",2.0
"This is really a 3.5 star place than a solid 4 but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Their coffee/tea and sweets are top notch but their savory food leaves much to be desired. I really wanted to love this place and feel a little bad for writing a slightly negative review because the atmosphere is awesome and the employees are super nice and very helpful.I had the pork sandwich and rosemary fries. The flavors in the sandwich were good but the bread was overly toasted which was enough to leave my gums sore and the fries were soggy which I am not a fan of at all. Someone told me that soggy fries is an east coast thing so that may be why they do that here. My girlfriend had the curry which she also thought was underwhelming.The drinks and the sweets are a whole other story, the milky toast and iced matcha latte are must try items. Their Yuzu ginger mint ice tea is also great as well as their pound cake. I hear good things about their shaved iced which I will try as soon as the weather heats up a bit.",4.0

"Food and coffee are good. Prices for food are pretty reasonable. Prices for coffee are steep. Iced coffee was $4 and it wasn't that much honestly. However, the food is priced reasonably, especially considering how good it is. Big issue besides the price of the coffee is their evening hours. Closing at 5 seems somewhat odd considering a lot of local customers probably get home around then or after, many of whom would like a place to go to do some laptop work or have a nice evening coffee or tea. Tempted to give 4 stars because of the rooftop but I'm not that easy to persuade.",3.0

"Husband and I came here after reading a pretty cool review of this place on the NYT, and we definitely enjoyed our time here!Why we liked it:1. Cool atmosphere, interesting decor/vibe, great rooftop terrace2. Not too busy/hectic when we visited on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.3. Food was neatly packed in little boxes, whether you got the bento box or just the sandwich.4. Great little menu that isn't overwhelming.5. GREAT strawberry milk shaved ice. Definitely hit the spot on a summer's day.Now for the reason why we weren't wowed: food was good and tasty, but was not amazing for the price you pay for it. (Sandwiches are $9+, bento boxes are $11.50+). The size was also not big enough to feed those boys with real appetites. For girls, perfect/filling size.I had the pork shabu shabu sandwich - the meat was really good and not too salty. They provided extra sauces if you needed more flavor. The ciabatta bread was also nicely toasted. While watching them prepare our food, it almost seemed to us that everything was pre-cooked, packaged, and just reheated when ordered. At least it didn't actually taste like it was pre-cooked!My husband had the meatball bento box, which came with rice, soup, and to be honest, I can't remember what else. He liked it, but I couldn't eat the meatballs since they didn't seem thoroughly cooked through enough for a pregnant lady!Would we be back?

"Toasty warm inside with cool decor and incredibly polite, friendly service. The hoji-cha latte is amazing for $4 (if you're vegan remember to tell them, because as well as regular milk they add sweetened condensed milk to make it extra delicious), or you can get a regular tea for $2.50 in a giant cup. They've added one vegetarian option (I think it's like a sprout bento?) to their menu, and one vegan - the teriyaki tempeh burger, which is two slabs of tempeh with this ridiculous peanutty sauce and radishes and greens and om nom nom. $9 There's also wifi and bench seating if you wanna roll out your laptop and stay a while - everything is served in cute cardboard bento boxes as a matter of course so you can decide to take out or eat in at any point. They don't deliver yet, but they're working on that and they've applied for their liquor license so hopefully delicious sake will soon join the menu. Highly recommend.",5.0
