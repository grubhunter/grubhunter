"The UBE DOUGNUTS are BOMBMAZING! Cousin ordered 4 dozen for our trip to the Poconos about a month ago. I could not stop taking another bite. Another night I went to dinner, I had the duck Adobo, Spam fries and Ube dessert was a good night spent.I would highly recommend.",5.0
"Came here with high hopes. The atmosphere was intimate and very chill for brunch with no wait at all to be seated which was great. Underground hip hop was playing softly in the background. Dialated People's, I believe. Took me back to 2003. Pretty cool I guess. I was so excited to try the Mango Souffle Pancake with Ube Ice Cream. Excited and hungry. I waited 25 minutes for my plate to arrive. The waiter did check on me to apologize for the long wait for my plate. When my pancake arrived, I took my first bite after patiently waiting and believing the wait would be well worth it and was sadly disappointed. I kind of felt like I was just eating bland bread with some mangos mixed in. The Ube Ice Cream on top definitely helped to give me some type of flavor to my dish but overall I was bummed out. I guess with all of the hype I was just expecting to have this dish blow my taste buds and mind. That isn't what happened though.Maybe one day I will return to try their now famous Ube Donut or the Ube Bread Pudding. Both of them seem they would be winners.",2.0
"Made the trek out to BK on an early Saturday morning to try out Manila Social Club for brunch!My group of 4 were the first in line when we arrived at 10:30 AM. Tons of people started showing up soon after though - so looks like 10:30 AM is the sweet spot to arrive. They open at 11 AM for brunch. We waited a short amount of time before the chef came out to introduce himself, thank us all for coming, and start taking everyone's name down on their list. It was easy & orderly and at 11 on the dot, we were in!My group split a bunch of the dishes so we could try a lil bit of everything:- Lumpia Shanghai: Filipino eggrolls - can't go wrong! Would recco.- Mango Souffle Pancakes: Ice cream for breakfast! Light and fluffy - reminds me of those Japanese cakes you can pick up at the Chinese bakeries.- Best Biscuits & Gravy: Super interesting take on the good ol' biscuits and gravy. Gravy held pieces of meat and was the perfect savory dish. Definitely get to share, would be wayyy heavy for one person!- Meat & Eggs with Longanisa: Super yummy marinaded chunks of meat - also probably too heavy on its' own but great to share.- Side of SPAM fries: because c'mon, they're Spam fries.All in all, a delicious and not-so-bad-on the wallet meal. Come early and be prepared for food coma throughout the entire day!",4.0
"If I could give this more stars, I would.There's an abundance of brunch places in New York, but nothing quite compares to this French Filipino restaurant in Williamsburg. Everything from the food to the contemporary interior to the exceptional hospitality could not be any more amazing. My friend was in town and I wanted to take her to something I've been wanting to try for sometime. There was a lot of food hype on social media, so I was excited to check it out for myself. It was Sunday morning, so I decided to call in for reservations. The girl on the phone said it would be an hour, but she was nice enough to put my name and phone number down on the list. She then called me when a table opened up. Much better than standing in a long line, if you asked me. They sat us at the counter, which was perfectly fine for us, because we had an AWESOME server Sammy. Sammy could not have been any more accommodating and awesome. It really made the brunch experience that much better, to a point where we felt like we were basically having brunch with Sammy. It was so great. Besides the experience, the food was hands down incredible. They'll start you with a few rolls and Ube butter, which I wish I had a tub of since It's amazing. I can't begin to describe the taste, but It makes me want more. I ordered the pancakes, which is this huge pillow of Filipino dough (so light and airy) with pieces of pineapple mixed in and ube ice cream on top. My friend ordered the french toast, which was deep fried (omg) and topped with ice cream. Just amazing. By the end, we were looking at our half eaten food as pillows. It's surprisingly a lot of food that left us in food comas.The only thing that would make this place 10000x better is when they get their liquor license. That will be a good day. Thanks so much for brunching with us, Sammy. We can't wait to come back for more ube and food! :)",5.0
"So much better than last time, particularly the mango soufflé pancake.My previous review praised everything except the pancake, but this time, it came out super fluffy and lighter than air! I wasn't sure if I was imagining things, but I compared the photo of the dish from my previous visit to this time around, and there was a visible difference. It was most certainly almost burnt at the bottom last time, and this time, they were way more generous with the mangos.Service was a bit slow (but still very friendly), but they told us that it's because the mango pancake takes a while to make. My advice would be to ask for the other food before the pancake comes out (if your table is going to be sharing anyway).",5.0
"Came here right when it opened for brunch but just a little too late since all the tables were already full and ended up sitting at the bar :[. If we waited for a table it would have been another hour and a half and who has the time for that. I got the tofu and eggplant scramble($14), while my friends got the French toast($14) and the mango soufflé pancakes($14). As we waited for our food to arrive we got some bread with ube butter. Yummm. I'm not sure what ube is still but I know it's delicious and a beautiful purple color! when the food came we couldn't help but admire the beautiful presentation! My tofu and eggplant scramble was seasoned wonderfully and came with sautéed rice in some kind of sauce. It all blended well together and was a wonderful savory dish! I tried a bite of the French toast which was crunch and the syrup under was super sweet. Unless you have a serious sweet tooth this might be a little much for you since it does come with icecream also and the bottom piece is drenched in syrup. The mango soufflé pancake was DELICIOUS! Light and fluffy when you eat it. The mangos perfect. And the scoop of ube icecream in the middle. Basically the breakfast of dreams!The staff was super friendly throughout most of the meal and made conversation with us and informed us about upcoming events which  was nice. The one thing that made me want to take off a star was the hostess. She basically ignored us when we asked her for the drink menu and wasn't particularly nice. When she did finally hear us she just placed it in front of us and walked away dismissively. It's really a shame cause I really believe customer service is a huge part of any restaurant!I will be back for more brunch and definitely to try some of those ube doughnuts!!",5.0
"As a mom, I need to plan it really well when taking the little ones out, especially going somewhere with lots of hype. As for Manila Social, coming out for Sunday brunch means: 1. leaving the house early, 2. arriving 30 minutes before opening, 3. find parking, and 4. making sure we got on line until doors open. Everything went as planned, until the unexpected 50 minute wait for our one and only appetizer to finally come out. Every party that sat down when we did were finished and gone by the time we got our entrees.Lumpia Shanghai - I have to say my favorite part of the meal were these little egg rolls. Every bite was crispy, and super juicy. The duck and sausage filling is money. Delicious, and definitely appetizing.Mango Souffle Pancake - My girlfriends and I have been wanting to come to MSC because of this pancake. The color contrast of purple and orange was very appealing. The ube ice cream melted quickly and seeped into the airy souffle. I found the souffle itself lacking sweetness, but nothing like syrup can't fix, it is a pancake, right? This wasn't as amazing as we thought it was, but my little ones enjoyed having ice cream for breakfast!Tocino - I got the Tocino with sunny side eggs (Kay looooves runny yolk). The sweet pork paired okay with the garlic fried rice. I wish the rice had more garlic, though. I loved that the pea shoots added freshness and extra texture to the rice.Black Striped Bass - Although I did not try this dish, 3 of my friends ordered this, and 2 of them came out undercooked. Kindly notified the server, and he came out with a whole new plate with a bigger piece of fish.  Spam Fries - Nothing like good ole spam, cut into fries and deep fried, put back into its can, and served with this spicy mango sauce. Only gonna be crazy and order it this one time, now I can use this idea and make this at home sometimes.",3.0
"We arrived on Saturday afternoon about 3:30 PM for brunch and was seated immediately. No wait, no crowd. Kudos to Sam for the exceptional service and hospitality!First off we are huge fans of Filipino & French food so we came here with very high expectations. The complimentary biscuits with Ube spread was unique and tasty. The texture was soft was very easy to spread onto the biscuits. It was just the right amount of sweet, allowing us to make use of all the spread onto two biscuits. Spam Fries $7 - Hot & Crispy spam fries served fresh out of the can! Loved the creativity and Instagram-worthy presentation. Surprisingly, these did not taste like a mouthful of sodium in every bite--not salty, but delicious! The spicy mango sauce was a great pair. Solid choice for an appetizer-highly recommended!Mango Soufflé Pancakes $14 - Fluffy, colorful, and HUGE. There was no way my fiancé was going to finish this by herself and even with my help, I wasn't able to take down this beast. The soufflé takes some time to make, but expect nothing less than extraordinary when it arrives. There was a nice big scoop of Ube ice cream which was spectacular. Mangoes were fresh and sweet. Meat & Eggs (Tocino) $14 - The tocino was amazing--kind of reminded me of the Chinese char siu with a much flavorful and sweet glaze. The garlic fried rice was perfect and the scrambled eggs were fluffy and melted in my mouth. Portion was good and I was very satisfied after this meal. We loved the ambiance, top-notch food & service! We enjoyed every bit of the Filipino/French experience here. Thank you Sam & the chefs! I would love to come back to try the Ube Donut!",5.0
"My friends & I have been anticipating going to Manila Social Club for a while now but working around 10 people's schedule, yeah you know how hard it can get... so last night called for good grub & good company.Manila Social Club did not disappoint. AT. ALL.We ordered appetizers to share and we just got hungrier... Way to entice our appetites, haha! :9 Delicious fat sticks of avocado tempura fried to perfection, lumpia stuffed w/ sweet longanisa (I must say, veryyyyy nice touch) & juicy spam fries all bursting w/ flavor, just to name a few. Oh, yes, deeeeelish!As for the mains? Get the duck. Get the foie gras. Get the surf & turf. Ahhhhh, just bring a group of friends & order everything! So dericious! The presentation is beautiful. The flavor is 100% there. And the service? Sam was our waiter last night and he was amazing & helpful w/ all his suggestions.The only thing I might not have been fond of was the ube bread pudding. The coconut ice cream was delish & I loved the ube syrup but the bread pudding was a bit too bread-like for my taste. That ube donut though was WOW!Thanks for a good time, Manila Social Club. We'll be back for more! :D",5.0
"One of the best brunch experiences I've had so far!My boyfriend and I had brunch with our friends at Manila Social Club. We made reservations for noon on a Sunday and surprisingly, it wasn't crowded at all. The restaurant is very simple, cozy, and just feels relaxing. The staff are very friendly, super nice, and laid back. We were given biscuits and ube butter to start off. These were probably the best biscuits I've had because they were fluffy and had a little sweetness to it. The ube butter complimented the biscuits very well. The ube butter had a smooth and melt-in-your-mouth texture, not too sweet. I really liked it!  I could eat a container of ube butter and still be happy.My boyfriend ordered the Tres Leches and it can be served iced or hot, but he got the drink hot. This was an interesting concoction, definitely different in terms of taste. I got the Ube Latte (ube infused with simple syrup) and it can be served iced or hot. I never had a drink like this before. It was a little too sweet with me even when I mixed it. We ordered three appetizers. The Lumpia Shanghai are Filipino eggrolls filled with duck and longanisa (sausage/chorizo). It came with two types of sauce - one was spicy and the other tasted like a fish sauce. The Lumpia Shangai were crunchy, fresh, and yummy! It's almost always a must have in a Filipino restaurant.We also had the Longanisa Sliders which are sliders with daikon pickles and lotus chips. The Longanisa Sliders were adorable, moist, and just really delicious. Who would ever though lotus chips would or could taste so good? Entrees:My boyfriend ordered the mango souffle pancake which is also one of the popular menu items at Manila. The Mango Souffle pancakes looked like a giant,fluffy cookie with chunks of mango embedded inside. I tried it and loved every bite of the pancake and there's that Ube again, extremely yummy!One friend ordered the roasted vegetable Paella which looked absolutely vibrant and hearty. The paella tasted yummy, good vegetarian option if you like. His girlfriend and I ordered the French Toast Espesyal. The French Toast is deep-fried with black & blue jam, mango syrup, and macapuno ice cream (coconut). I don't typically order sweet dishes like pancakes, waffles, or French toast for brunch, but this sounded really good. In my own opinion, I kind of regret ordering this dish because it was just too sweet for me and pretty damn filling. Side Dishes:My boyfriend and our friend ordered the Garlic Rice as a side dish. We all felt it was a little bland, definitely not enough garlic flavor in the rice.We also ordered the Longanisa Hash as a side order too. Now this was another dish I was crazy about after I ate it. Everything was cut into perfect bite size. The Longanisa Hash was delicious and just full of flavor.The Spam Fries was listed as a side dish under Manila's menu, but we treated it like an appetizer. I almost always order Spam Fries at a Filipino restaurant. First off, love love love the presentation and creativity behind it. The Spam Fries weren't salty at all. Possibly one of the best Spam Fries I've had so far!Overall, we really enjoyed our time and experience at Manila Social Club. I definitely want to come back for dinner and try their dinner menu. There's something just different and genuine about Manila Social Club compared to two other Filipino restaurants I've been to so far.",5.0
"My bf surprised me for a valentines dinner last night. I have no idea this is gonna be the place. When we get there I'm like where is this? He told me ""Manila social club"". I'm like what???? I didn't thought its gonna be good for a valentines dinner. I found out that its a private event for valentines. Crew/owner/servers is very welcoming. When we get their they greeted & seated us. They have specific set of menu last night. Food:Fried oyster over an absinthe roasted chayote slaw & kinilaw-- a filipino ceviche with tuna, dragon fruit, calamanisi dressing and an apple blossom. I'm a Filipino & know how real kinilaw taste like. This one taste very unique. It has a twist that makes it taste perfect. The dragon fruit makes it a little sweet. The chayote slaw for the fried oyster is a bit sweet too. Everything taste good & glad to try this interesting dish. Arroz caldo en route-- filipino rice porridge with foie gras & black winter truffle baked into a light pastry crust. For me this one taste decent. Lobster palabok-- butter poached lobster, rice noodle dressed in a lobster fumet, scallions, pork belly crumbles. This is my main dish. Omg!! Delicious! I finished everything on my plate. Everything in it explains how good it is. Venison bisteak-- venison chop with yun choi, beluga lentils, and pearl onion. My bf's dish. I took a bite & it was slammim, Its mouthwatering. The venison meet is so tender. Its the best!!Dessert:Ube bread pudding with raspberry whipped cream. Chocolate, espresso, hazenut delice with a fresh raspberry, coconut panna cotta with crumble chocloate biscuit. For drinks they gave us wine & cristal champagne. Love it!! I'm so glad my bf brought me here. Our valentines date was amazing. The ambience is relaxing. Food is great! Service is amazing. At the end of the night chef Bjorn gave us a complimentary ube donut & its yummy! They're all great.Thank you Manila Social Club for this wonderful experienced. Were going back for your brunch soon!",5.0
"This place lived up to the hype. The style is kinda like ""New Filipino"", I would say. Ube everything. Mango everything. And it wasn't even pricey. Dinner review:LOVED: 1) SPAM FRIES - Wow! Loved these spam fries served in their original spam can, with this amazing spicy mango sauce and banana ketchup -- GET THIS!2) SHANGHAI LUMPIA - they make this with longanisa inside!! One of my faves of the night. GET THIS!3) PANCIT PRANSES - duck meat was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and with foie gras on top. GET THIS!4) SHORT RIB KARE - meat fell off the bones. yes. 5) BISTEAK TAGALOG - MEAT! YES. 6) BLACK STRIPED SEA BASS - the absinthe really added to the flavor, it's indescribable! 7) CRAB DAUPHINE - I loved the corn custard!!!LIKED: 1) Sliders - the bun wasn't that great but liked the meat inside.2) Tempura avocado - get this if you love avocados! 3) Surf & Turf - pork belly and tuna sashimi!!! 4) Tocino on a stick - meat on sticks. Of course, you must get garlic fried rice. Dessert was ube bread pudding, liked the ice cream but the bread part was too hard for me. AND ORDER THEIR UBE DONUTS.",5.0
"After hearing so much wonderful things about this place, my friend and I secured ourselves a reservation on a Wednesday evening at around 9 PM. It wasn't busy at all but we waited at least 30-45 minutes for our appetizer to come. Shortly after (about 3 minutes later), they brought out the entrees. Clearly, there was some sort of miscommunication in the restaurant because the entrees came out COLD, which was a HUGE HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and a HUGE HUGE FAIL on their part. More to speak, they were out of almost everything!, from drinks to sides to entrees. Just our luck, huh?We ordered the Duck Adobo ($23) and Short Rib Kare ($24) -- since they ran out of the Rabbit. There isn't much to say about the two dishes because once again, they came out cold. However, if you're not into fatty meat, you can pass on the Short Rib Kare. My friend did not enjoy it. To be fair though, I did enjoy their Longanisa Sliders, served with Lotus Chips. They're not your typical finger foods. I can eat the Lotus Chips all day. As a matter of fact, I asked if I could take some to go but of course, they ""ran out.""Overall, Manila was a disappointing experience. It's sad because they have the potential to be a better restaurant. By the way, in terms of the overall experience, I would've given them only 2 stars; the third is really for their innovativeness. Try their mocktails.",3.0
"I was invited to join in on the (monthly) Donuts and DJs event.  Little did I know, I ran into many friends who were there to support the event and the family's endeavour. Fantastic donuts and a unique venue give rise to my 4.8/5.0 rating.While I have heard of Manila Social Club (MSC) before, thanks to friends who have stopped in for brunch, I found it daunting to make the trek to Williamsburg and North Brooklyn.  MSC stands amid a sea of eclectic eateries in Billyburg but they do something uniquely special.  Expect it to be an experiential affair, after all, as the decor draws from DelaCruz's grandma's home in Davao Oriental, Philippines and the food draws from French and Filipino roots.  Björn classifies it as ""New Filipino"" as it's not strictly Filipino or American.  The DelaCruz siblings were brought together when they first opened the restaurant, stemming from Chef Björn DelaCruz's series of popup dinners.  The dining public has responded in kind as February serves as their one year anniversary in this space, serving brunch, lunch, and dinner.The event kicked off with local DJs (DJ Tinyfox, DJ GETLIVE) doing their vinyl sets while donut-hungry patrons lined up outside for ""Ube Bae"" and seasonal Filipino-inspired flavors that were rolled out- Calamansi-Gin and St Germaine-Poppyseed being among them.  The donuts were light and fluffy, fragrant and frosted with just the right amount of ube, calamansi, St. Germain. Decadent much? Heavenly, yes, they're crullers, and I love them so but for $3 a pop, it's still well worth it since the event is free to the public. Also, who can turn down 90s hip-hop? C'mon!  What seals the deal for me is that everyone is welcomed in like family, and this is what sticks in my mind with the MSC.The venue is limited in size (up to 60 at a time) but didn't stop patrons from lining up in the cold harsh dead of winter for a taste of ube. I'm floored. While many had not anticipated this amazing a turnout, I expect it to grow to a fevered pitch in the coming months ahead.  (Note to self: Must return to try their cuisine) 4.8/5.0",5.0
"First of all, huge shout out to the hospitality from Toki! Next, another gigantic shout out the Ube Donut!Location: resided at Williamsburg North, Manila Social Club seems to be the new fav among social media. First instagram, and now with its 24 -k gold - 100-dollar/donut-ad, I urged myself to go all the way to Brooklyn and have some donut fun there. It was close to Metro Ave, right by the corner of Hope Street! The store is pretty small, so I bet it would very crowded for a saturday brunch! The decoration is very asian-wise. Some plants with wooden chairs and table? are superb.I was longing for their Ube donut for a long time so I pre order two weeks ago in order to get a chance to get these donuts. I received the email yesterday knowing that my donut's are ready to pick up.And with short check in and pay the bill, I was able to get my donut .Donut:This Ube Donut is distinctive. I have never had Ube before. So I was not sure what's the real flavor like. But this thing is good. Shell is crispy, inside is moisture. Oh, dear, love it.I possibly will come back for their brunch. Very picture on yelp here seems attempting.",5.0
"This review is for their weekend Brunch menu.Came here out of impulse on a Saturday about 2-3 weeks ago and i guess it's a good thing we got there early as there was already a line 15 minutes before opening. (Hint get there early!)For appetizers we ordered Avocado Tempura and Lumpia Shanghai (Suggestion: A dab of foie gras paste on the side of the plate would probably bring more flavor to the lumpia)For our entrees, we ordered the Mango soufflé pancakes, French Toast Espesyal and Tocino with a side of Longanisa hash and bacon. We very much enjoyed what we ordered, the portions for the appetizers and entrees were adequate. I wouldn't recommend the French toast espesyal if you don't have a sweet tooth.Very friendly staff, but kitchen is somewhat slow which I understand as they prepare/cook your meal accordingly. Table turnover is slow hence wait time is longer. My suggestion is to relax, order some drinks at the bar and enjoy your company.Probably the only issue I had was when we got our bill. The amount on the receipt that we got from that was first handed to us didn't match the charged amount receipt. They charged less from the original bill, which I don't mind paying less lol, but I'm an honest person and had the server fixed the bill to the correct amount. Of course had the scenario been reverse it would've been a different story. Anyways check your receipts carefully and happy eating! I'm already looking forward to try their dinner menu one of these days.",4.0
"This place is right at the heart of Williamsburg, couple of blocks away from the Bedford Ave station, so it was pretty easy to find. There isn't a huge sign with the restaurant name on it, but you can see a cute golden pineapple hung right in front by the door.Came here for brunch on a Saturday around 3:45. The given time for brunch was from 11-4pm, so it was really nice that they still sat us even though it was close to the end. The place isn't the most spacious, so seats quickly filled up and we had to sit by the bar. No biggie though! eating at the bar was just as nice because of the lighting and beautiful decor.After we sat, we were immediately given some water and pandesal with ube butter- so. good. There was three of us, so we decided to just order a lot and share. We ordered the Avocado Tempura, Spam Fries, Torta Talong, Longanisa with Garlic Rice and Eggs, and the Mango Souffle Pancake. They are still working on their liquor license, so we got mocktails. I can't remember the exact names but they were mango, pineapple, and coconut. All of them were sooooo good, so I can only imagine with alcohol included.Let me tell youuuu, the food was amazing. Great flavor along with the presentation; I enjoyed looking at the food as much as I enjoyed eating it! haha. I love how they included the pickled daikon with the avocado tempura. The idea on putting the spam fries in the can is dope, and I also loved how they included banana ketchup. The torta talong i feel like isnt for everyone, but i grew up eating eggplant so i love it. the longanisa with garlic rice and eggs is like a staple filipino breakfast so that was a must have. and the ube icecream went perfectlyyyyyyyyyy on top of the mango souffle pancake- must try for everyone.We took our time to eat and really enjoy the place. We were the last ones to leave and the staff didn't kick us out even though they were closing.Manila Social Club is soooo bomb! I'll be back for sure. The service was really good. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. Had a couple conversations with them here and there. The place is kept nice and clean. Plus the amazing food?! Just really good vibes. What more can you ask for.",5.0
"I was a huge fan of Miller's, so when I found out that they've been replaced by a new Filipino-French restaurant, I knew I had to try them out. Manila Social Club, located on the corner of Hope Street in Williamsburg, serves brunch on Saturday and Sunday from 11am - 4pm. We arrived right in the middle of brunch time and wait about 15 minutes before we snagged two seats by the bar.Once you order, they bring over complimentary biscuits with ube spread. The ube spread was so good! It was sweet and buttery and spread so evenly on my biscuit. I'm not usually a fan of biscuits, but I gobbled them right up.We started with an order of the Lumpia Shanghai ($8.00) to share. Lumpia is sort of a Filipino egg roll of an assortment of goodies wrapped inside. These came with longaniza, or a type of Spanish sausage similar to chorizo. The lumpia were perfectly bite-sized and tasted amazing with the dipping sauces.We also ordered a side of Spam Fries to nibble on while we waited for our appetizers. I'm convinced these ""fries"" aren't made with real Spam because it wasn't overly salty or had the processed texture known to Spam. Regardless, they were very tasty - not too salty at all.For my entrée, I had the Mango Soufflé Pancakes with Ube Ice Cream. They offer this dish with syrup, but you don't even really need it because the ube ice cream is more than enough. The pancakes are very moist and soft - when smeared with the cold ube ice cream, it almost melts in your mouth. I really like how there are little mango chunks in the pancake.I think there was a mix up with the orders and our entrée orders didn't get processed until much later in our time at the restaurant. The manager comp-ed our appetizers since we waited 20-30 minutes for our entrées. They didn't have to, but it was a really nice gesture and showed how well-versed they are in customer service. I really appreciated that they proactively did that without any further prompting from us besides a casual inquiry on our food. I highly recommend Manila Social Club - be sure to try anything with Ube!",5.0
"Manila Social Club has won me over! Arrived with my boyfriend during brunch hours on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated within tens minutes. First I just want to say that the service here is superb! I think we had a chance to talk to everyone who worked here. (I believe they're a family) They welcomed everyone with warm greetings and complimentary bread rolls. The ube butter that came along with the rolls was slightly sweet and my boyfriend loved it.I pretty much decided on the mango souffle pancake with ube ice cream from the moment I found out about Manila Social Club. My boyfriend took a few more minutes to make up his mind and finally ordered the Meat & Eggs (Tocino with Garlic Fried Rice, scrambled eggs, pea shoot and radish salad). I also got the ube latte which is on a separate drink menu. The coffee itself was okay, with a good amount of creaminess from the milk. The ube infused simple syrup forms a rich purple layer at the bottom of the glass.The mango souffle pancake is as ""light as a cloud"" as it claims on the menu. It's not as dense as your usual pancake and feels more likely a fluffy and light cake, with a subtle sweetness. The mango was a bit sour but I think it balanced the sweetness of the pancake very well. The beautiful purple ube ice cream was definitely the star of the show and almost acted as the syrup for my pancake. I didn't put on additional syrup even though it was provided. The bit of black sesame seeds on top of the ice cream was a good touch as well. I almost wish I can just order some of this ube ice cream to eat on its own.My boyfriend really enjoyed his meal. The garlic fried rice is really garlicy so you might want to have gum handy. The tocino meat is similar to a pork belly, from what I tasted. Seasoned and cooked very well, and a generous portion. My boyfriend actually said ""there's almost too much meat"" and that he wished there was more rice. But that's good news for meat lovers!I have yet to try the ube doughnuts here. I've been eyeing them for a while but couldn't find someone to split a box with me ($40 for 12)  and I really regret that I hesitated to order. They're basically sold out for the next three weeks! I'm leaving New York soon, so when will I ever get to try those ube doughnuts? I'm sad. I wish they would make a few extra every day that can be ordered separately for dine in/brunch. And maybe one day I'll get to try the golden cristal ube doughnuts too ($100).I will definitely be recommending my friends to visit Manila Social Club!",5.0
"I honestly think Manilasocialclub is the #bestbrunch in Brooklyn. They use flavors from the Philippines to bring an exciting new twist to standard brunch dishes. The interior is super adorable with dark wood & lots of greenery. It's not very big inside so as they get more popular I can see the wait times skyrocketing but for now it wasn't bad at allFood:-The meal is started off with complementary biscuits fresh from the oven topped with ube butter (an ingredient in many of the brunch choices). The biscuits were fluffy & warm & amazing, butter was just the right amount of sweet-mango soufflé topped with ube ice cream, which was out of this world. It's fresh made so it takes a bit longer to come out but well worth the wait. I don't think I've ever eaten something that tastes like that before-bacon/egg/garlic fried rice was amazing. I know it's shocking but according to my boyfriend there was too much bacon! It was a brunch miracle. The egg was perfectly cooked with a great runny yolk to drip over the rice which was just the right amount of garlickyI can't wait to try this place out for dinner",5.0

Lobster palabok-- butter poached lobster, rice noodle dressed in a lobster fumet, scallions, pork belly crumbles. This is my main dish. Omg!! Delicious! I finished everything on my plate. Everything in it explains how good it is. Venison bisteak-- venison chop with yun choi, beluga lentils, and pearl onion. My bf's dish. I took a bite & it was slammim, Its mouthwatering. The venison meet is so tender. Its the best!!Dessert:Ube bread pudding with raspberry whipped cream. Chocolate, espresso, hazenut delice with a fresh raspberry, coconut panna cotta with crumble chocloate biscuit. For drinks they gave us wine & cristal champagne. Love it!! I'm so glad my bf brought me here. Our valentines date was amazing. The ambience is relaxing. Food is great! Service is amazing. At the end of the night chef Bjorn gave us a complimentary ube donut & its yummy! They're all great.Thank you Manila Social Club for this wonderful experienced. Were going back for your brunch soon!",5.0
"This place lived up to the hype. The style is kinda like ""New Filipino"", I would say. Ube everything. Mango everything. And it wasn't even pricey. Dinner review:LOVED: 1) SPAM FRIES - Wow! Loved these spam fries served in their original spam can, with this amazing spicy mango sauce and banana ketchup -- GET THIS!2) SHANGHAI LUMPIA - they make this with longanisa inside!! One of my faves of the night. GET THIS!3) PANCIT PRANSES - duck meat was cooked to perfection, medium rare, and with foie gras on top. GET THIS!4) SHORT RIB KARE - meat fell off the bones. yes. 5) BISTEAK TAGALOG - MEAT! YES. 6) BLACK STRIPED SEA BASS - the absinthe really added to the flavor, it's indescribable! 7) CRAB DAUPHINE - I loved the corn custard!!!LIKED: 1) Sliders - the bun wasn't that great but liked the meat inside.2) Tempura avocado - get this if you love avocados! 3) Surf & Turf - pork belly and tuna sashimi!!! 4) Tocino on a stick - meat on sticks. Of course, you must get garlic fried rice. Dessert was ube bread pudding, liked the ice cream but the bread part was too hard for me. AND ORDER THEIR UBE DONUTS.",5.0
"After hearing so much wonderful things about this place, my friend and I secured ourselves a reservation on a Wednesday evening at around 9 PM. It wasn't busy at all but we waited at least 30-45 minutes for our appetizer to come. Shortly after (about 3 minutes later), they brought out the entrees. Clearly, there was some sort of miscommunication in the restaurant because the entrees came out COLD, which was a HUGE HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and a HUGE HUGE FAIL on their part. More to speak, they were out of almost everything!, from drinks to sides to entrees. Just our luck, huh?We ordered the Duck Adobo ($23) and Short Rib Kare ($24) -- since they ran out of the Rabbit. There isn't much to say about the two dishes because once again, they came out cold. However, if you're not into fatty meat, you can pass on the Short Rib Kare. My friend did not enjoy it. To be fair though, I did enjoy their Longanisa Sliders, served with Lotus Chips. They're not your typical finger foods. I can eat the Lotus Chips all day. As a matter of fact, I asked if I could take some to go but of course, they ""ran out.""Overall, Manila was a disappointing experience. It's sad because they have the potential to be a better restaurant. By the way, in terms of the overall experience, I would've given them only 2 stars; the third is really for their innovativeness. Try their mocktails.",3.0
"I was invited to join in on the (monthly) Donuts and DJs event.  Little did I know, I ran into many friends who were there to support the event and the family's endeavour. Fantastic donuts and a unique venue give rise to my 4.8/5.0 rating.While I have heard of Manila Social Club (MSC) before, thanks to friends who have stopped in for brunch, I found it daunting to make the trek to Williamsburg and North Brooklyn.  MSC stands amid a sea of eclectic eateries in Billyburg but they do something uniquely special.  Expect it to be an experiential affair, after all, as the decor draws from DelaCruz's grandma's home in Davao Oriental, Philippines and the food draws from French and Filipino roots.  Björn classifies it as ""New Filipino"" as it's not strictly Filipino or American.  The DelaCruz siblings were brought together when they first opened the restaurant, stemming from Chef Björn DelaCruz's series of popup dinners.  The dining public has responded in kind as February serves as their one year anniversary in this space, serving brunch, lunch, and dinner.The event kicked off with local DJs (DJ Tinyfox, DJ GETLIVE) doing their vinyl sets while donut-hungry patrons lined up outside for ""Ube Bae"" and seasonal Filipino-inspired flavors that were rolled out- Calamansi-Gin and St Germaine-Poppyseed being among them.  The donuts were light and fluffy, fragrant and frosted with just the right amount of ube, calamansi, St. Germain. Decadent much? Heavenly, yes, they're crullers, and I love them so but for $3 a pop, it's still well worth it since the event is free to the public. Also, who can turn down 90s hip-hop? C'mon!  What seals the deal for me is that everyone is welcomed in like family, and this is what sticks in my mind with the MSC.The venue is limited in size (up to 60 at a time) but didn't stop patrons from lining up in the cold harsh dead of winter for a taste of ube. I'm floored. While many had not anticipated this amazing a turnout, I expect it to grow to a fevered pitch in the coming months ahead.  (Note to self: Must return to try their cuisine) 4.8/5.0",5.0
"First of all, huge shout out to the hospitality from Toki! Next, another gigantic shout out the Ube Donut!Location: resided at Williamsburg North, Manila Social Club seems to be the new fav among social media. First instagram, and now with its 24 -k gold - 100-dollar/donut-ad, I urged myself to go all the way to Brooklyn and have some donut fun there. It was close to Metro Ave, right by the corner of Hope Street! The store is pretty small, so I bet it would very crowded for a saturday brunch! The decoration is very asian-wise. Some plants with wooden chairs and table? are superb.I was longing for their Ube donut for a long time so I pre order two weeks ago in order to get a chance to get these donuts. I received the email yesterday knowing that my donut's are ready to pick up.And with short check in and pay the bill, I was able to get my donut .Donut:This Ube Donut is distinctive. I have never had Ube before. So I was not sure what's the real flavor like. But this thing is good. Shell is crispy, inside is moisture. Oh, dear, love it.I possibly will come back for their brunch. Very picture on yelp here seems attempting.",5.0
"This review is for their weekend Brunch menu.Came here out of impulse on a Saturday about 2-3 weeks ago and i guess it's a good thing we got there early as there was already a line 15 minutes before opening. (Hint get there early!)For appetizers we ordered Avocado Tempura and Lumpia Shanghai (Suggestion: A dab of foie gras paste on the side of the plate would probably bring more flavor to the lumpia)For our entrees, we ordered the Mango soufflé pancakes, French Toast Espesyal and Tocino with a side of Longanisa hash and bacon. We very much enjoyed what we ordered, the portions for the appetizers and entrees were adequate. I wouldn't recommend the French toast espesyal if you don't have a sweet tooth.Very friendly staff, but kitchen is somewhat slow which I understand as they prepare/cook your meal accordingly. Table turnover is slow hence wait time is longer. My suggestion is to relax, order some drinks at the bar and enjoy your company.Probably the only issue I had was when we got our bill. The amount on the receipt that we got from that was first handed to us didn't match the charged amount receipt. They charged less from the original bill, which I don't mind paying less lol, but I'm an honest person and had the server fixed the bill to the correct amount. Of course had the scenario been reverse it would've been a different story. Anyways check your receipts carefully and happy eating! I'm already looking forward to try their dinner menu one of these days.",4.0
"This place is right at the heart of Williamsburg, couple of blocks away from the Bedford Ave station, so it was pretty easy to find. There isn't a huge sign with the restaurant name on it, but you can see a cute golden pineapple hung right in front by the door.Came here for brunch on a Saturday around 3:45. The given time for brunch was from 11-4pm, so it was really nice that they still sat us even though it was close to the end. The place isn't the most spacious, so seats quickly filled up and we had to sit by the bar. No biggie though! eating at the bar was just as nice because of the lighting and beautiful decor.After we sat, we were immediately given some water and pandesal with ube butter- so. good. There was three of us, so we decided to just order a lot and share. We ordered the Avocado Tempura, Spam Fries, Torta Talong, Longanisa with Garlic Rice and Eggs, and the Mango Souffle Pancake. They are still working on their liquor license, so we got mocktails. I can't remember the exact names but they were mango, pineapple, and coconut. All of them were sooooo good, so I can only imagine with alcohol included.Let me tell youuuu, the food was amazing. Great flavor along with the presentation; I enjoyed looking at the food as much as I enjoyed eating it! haha. I love how they included the pickled daikon with the avocado tempura. The idea on putting the spam fries in the can is dope, and I also loved how they included banana ketchup. The torta talong i feel like isnt for everyone, but i grew up eating eggplant so i love it. the longanisa with garlic rice and eggs is like a staple filipino breakfast so that was a must have. and the ube icecream went perfectlyyyyyyyyyy on top of the mango souffle pancake- must try for everyone.We took our time to eat and really enjoy the place. We were the last ones to leave and the staff didn't kick us out even though they were closing.Manila Social Club is soooo bomb! I'll be back for sure. The service was really good. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. Had a couple conversations with them here and there. The place is kept nice and clean. Plus the amazing food?! Just really good vibes. What more can you ask for.",5.0
"I was a huge fan of Miller's, so when I found out that they've been replaced by a new Filipino-French restaurant, I knew I had to try them out. Manila Social Club, located on the corner of Hope Street in Williamsburg, serves brunch on Saturday and Sunday from 11am - 4pm. We arrived right in the middle of brunch time and wait about 15 minutes before we snagged two seats by the bar.Once you order, they bring over complimentary biscuits with ube spread. The ube spread was so good! It was sweet and buttery and spread so evenly on my biscuit. I'm not usually a fan of biscuits, but I gobbled them right up.We started with an order of the Lumpia Shanghai ($8.00) to share. Lumpia is sort of a Filipino egg roll of an assortment of goodies wrapped inside. These came with longaniza, or a type of Spanish sausage similar to chorizo. The lumpia were perfectly bite-sized and tasted amazing with the dipping sauces.We also ordered a side of Spam Fries to nibble on while we waited for our appetizers. I'm convinced these ""fries"" aren't made with real Spam because it wasn't overly salty or had the processed texture known to Spam. Regardless, they were very tasty - not too salty at all.For my entrée, I had the Mango Soufflé Pancakes with Ube Ice Cream. They offer this dish with syrup, but you don't even really need it because the ube ice cream is more than enough. The pancakes are very moist and soft - when smeared with the cold ube ice cream, it almost melts in your mouth. I really like how there are little mango chunks in the pancake.I think there was a mix up with the orders and our entrée orders didn't get processed until much later in our time at the restaurant. The manager comp-ed our appetizers since we waited 20-30 minutes for our entrées. They didn't have to, but it was a really nice gesture and showed how well-versed they are in customer service. I really appreciated that they proactively did that without any further prompting from us besides a casual inquiry on our food. I highly recommend Manila Social Club - be sure to try anything with Ube!",5.0
"Manila Social Club has won me over! Arrived with my boyfriend during brunch hours on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated within tens minutes. First I just want to say that the service here is superb! I think we had a chance to talk to everyone who worked here. (I believe they're a family) They welcomed everyone with warm greetings and complimentary bread rolls. The ube butter that came along with the rolls was slightly sweet and my boyfriend loved it.I pretty much decided on the mango souffle pancake with ube ice cream from the moment I found out about Manila Social Club. My boyfriend took a few more minutes to make up his mind and finally ordered the Meat & Eggs (Tocino with Garlic Fried Rice, scrambled eggs, pea shoot and radish salad). I also got the ube latte which is on a separate drink menu. The coffee itself was okay, with a good amount of creaminess from the milk. The ube infused simple syrup forms a rich purple layer at the bottom of the glass.The mango souffle pancake is as ""light as a cloud"" as it claims on the menu. It's not as dense as your usual pancake and feels more likely a fluffy and light cake, with a subtle sweetness. The mango was a bit sour but I think it balanced the sweetness of the pancake very well. The beautiful purple ube ice cream was definitely the star of the show and almost acted as the syrup for my pancake. I didn't put on additional syrup even though it was provided. The bit of black sesame seeds on top of the ice cream was a good touch as well. I almost wish I can just order some of this ube ice cream to eat on its own.My boyfriend really enjoyed his meal. The garlic fried rice is really garlicy so you might want to have gum handy. The tocino meat is similar to a pork belly, from what I tasted. Seasoned and cooked very well, and a generous portion. My boyfriend actually said ""there's almost too much meat"" and that he wished there was more rice. But that's good news for meat lovers!I have yet to try the ube doughnuts here. I've been eyeing them for a while but couldn't find someone to split a box with me ($40 for 12)  and I really regret that I hesitated to order. They're basically sold out for the next three weeks! I'm leaving New York soon, so when will I ever get to try those ube doughnuts? I'm sad. I wish they would make a few extra every day that can be ordered separately for dine in/brunch. And maybe one day I'll get to try the golden cristal ube doughnuts too ($100).I will definitely be recommending my friends to visit Manila Social Club!",5.0
"I honestly think Manilasocialclub is the #bestbrunch in Brooklyn. They use flavors from the Philippines to bring an exciting new twist to standard brunch dishes. The interior is super adorable with dark wood & lots of greenery. It's not very big inside so as they get more popular I can see the wait times skyrocketing but for now it wasn't bad at allFood:-The meal is started off with complementary biscuits fresh from the oven topped with ube butter (an ingredient in many of the brunch choices). The biscuits were fluffy & warm & amazing, butter was just the right amount of sweet-mango soufflé topped with ube ice cream, which was out of this world. It's fresh made so it takes a bit longer to come out but well worth the wait. I don't think I've ever eaten something that tastes like that before-bacon/egg/garlic fried rice was amazing. I know it's shocking but according to my boyfriend there was too much bacon! It was a brunch miracle. The egg was perfectly cooked with a great runny yolk to drip over the rice which was just the right amount of garlickyI can't wait to try this place out for dinner",5.0
"Our favorite Filipino restaurant in Williamsburg so far! The staff here are the most friendly, warm, welcoming and hospitable. The dinner here was excellent; the dishes were presented well, tasted great and left us with a food coma.Their spin on authentic Filipino dishes are creative and unique. The Kare Kare was served on a plate in a smaller portion rather than in a stew with a side of rice. The spam fries were presented stylishly in the tin can and included two sauces (one was ketchup, the other a slightly spicy sauce). The lumpia were light and crisp and also served with two sauces (one spicier than the other). The tocino on a stick was paired well with red onions but does not come with a side of rice. We enjoyed a warm, ube bread pudding at the end, which made us melt inside.The mocktail drinks here were my favorite; I am a huge fan of fruity and sweet drinks. One of them was even garnished with star fruit, which was my first time trying it. We dined while there was a photo shoot going on inside the restaurant for a New York Times article; it was a cool experience to watch the process and the lighting did not negatively effect our dining experience at all.We will definitely come here again for the brunch selection (especially the mango & ube pancakes and the ube latte). The ube and gold donuts are also highly appealing, though you should be aware that one gold donut is $100 and a dozen is $1,000 (since there is champagne and 24 karat gold dust involved)!Edit: We just came back for brunch and it was a great meal. We had the sea bass breakfast platter (with eggs, rice, etc.) and the mango ube soufflé. The brunch also started with pandesal (buttery, slightly cheesey bread) with ube butter. Delicious!",5.0
I really wanted to fall head over heels in love with this place but unfortunately it just didn't happen. For drinks we ordered the iced ube latte and calamansi drink. I don't feel that the ube syrup added any distinct flavor to the latte except for sweetness. The calamansi drink was quite refreshing.For food we ordered the lumpia shanghai and a meat and eggs platter with tocino as the meat.  The lumpia was fine but nothing absolutely amazing about it. The platter though...the garlic fried rice wasn't hot. Some of it was lukewarm and some of it was even cold. We were the last party to be seated for brunch service so I don't know if that had any effect on the temperature of the food but it really shouldn't have been cold. I'd like to visit for dinner service to see the difference and try some other dishes in order to give it another chance.,3.0
"I'm glad I was lucky enough to get a spot for brunch here on a Saturday afternoon. By the time i got there, it was 2pm which was already on the late side of brunch. Although a seat wasn't guaranteed, we were told that we would receive a call 10minutes before 3pm in case someone doesn't show up. Luckily enough, we did receive a call and were seated by 3pm. The staff here is incredibly warm and nice. My BF and I had bread roll with ube butter complimentary. To me, it tasted kind of like a creme puff and a mix with taro. Although it was 3pm, I ordered the mango soufflé pancake with the ube icecream. It had a very light, sponge cake like texture with mango pieces mixed in and on top, a scoop of ube icecream. It was amazing. The pancake was so soft, it melted in my mouth. My BF had the longanisa. It is a type of sausage, with fried rice. I had a couple bites of his, and it was really delicious. For the appetizer, we ordered the longanisa sliders. We were already pretty full from the entree (appetizer came out last). So we ended up taking most of the sliders home. Parking was relatively easy for us to find. Try to get here earlier so you don't need to wait so long!Ps- you need to preorder for the donuts ..",5.0
Love their brunch menu. Mango pancake is a must try. Delicious übe sweet butter. Spam fries were ok..gimmicky. Scrambled eggs with garlic fried rice was delicious.,4.0
"Over the past few years, Filipinos have become quite spoiled as more and more cutting edge restaurants serving Pinoy food have popped up in the city. 8 years ago, I would have been just ridiculously happy with any place serving longsilog but with Maharlika, Jeepney and Pig & Khao serving exciting riffs on Filipino comfort food, I've gotten more picky.Today we tried one of the newest Pinoy spots, Manila Social Club, located in one of Williamsburg's scene-iest areas, steps away from Roebling Tea Room, Fette Sau and Momofuku Milk Bar. I thought it was a cool looking spot: bright and airy, no Filipino vibe overkill. The brunch wait is LONG at over an hour on a Saturday but we called ahead and put our name down in advance so that we could chill at home until our table was free.On to the food ... We thought that there were some missed opportunities for greatness. Our favorite part of the meal was the complementary pan de sal and ube butter, which was so yummy but could have been heavenly had they had warmed up the pan de sal. Their lumpiang Shanghai was one of the best I've ever had, stuffed with longganiza - that needs no tweaking. The spam fries were well presented but at the end of the day something we could easily have made from home. For our entrees, we each had some version of silog - that classic Filipino combo of garlic fried rice, fried egg and meat. The tocino was good while the longganiza was average. The garlic rice could have been more garlicky (spoken like a true Pinay). We thought that they should have made the effort to serve the food with any of the many funky Filipino vinegars available in the US - something like pinakurat or even just the Datu Puti that's already had tons of chili and garlic marinating in it. All in all, we thought the silog dishes were good but nothing to write home about.I guess we also missed an opportunity to taste this spot's greatness by failing to order their popular soufflé pancakes and French toast. Something to come back for!Service was very pleasant and courteous, but most of the time it was difficult to flag down a server when we needed one. It is extremely busy so we understand ... but given this spot's huge popularity, they could probably benefit from adding on an extra server on the weekends.We've tried their ube doughnuts when a friend ordered a bunch one weekend. They're yummy enough but our group agreed it could be improved with ube filling to punch up the ube factor.At the end of the day, I'm always happy to see more Filipino spots thriving in New York. Manila Social Club is a very welcome addition to the scene and it's great to see them thriving. A few more tweaks though and this spot could truly be great!",4.0
"When does a dining experience become more than just the meal? For my 100th review, Manila Social Club ticks off all the items of a great dining experience by crafting food that is both familiar but new and special to my heart (and stomach): Filipino.Strictly speaking if I were to rate Manila Social Club solely on Filipino food, it wouldn't be rated this high. What Manila Social Club does so well is take the traditional food Filipinos know and love that your family grew up eating and have such fond memories of and elevate it for a broader audience. I'd call it accessible Filipino food. The Filipino food movement is growing and Manila Social Club is one of many great restaurants taking part in it. Whenever I describe Filipino food to people who haven't tried it before, it sometimes is hard to describe in a few words. Though there is one dish you can always talk about, the national dish called adobo. Filipino-style adobo must always have a medley of garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce. Once those ingredients are in it, the dish varies greatly. I enjoy making a pork adobo for its simplicity. Yet Manila Social Club has a duck adobo that is stunningly composed. It has a velvety sunchoke puree, earthy shiitake mushrooms, and bitter yu choy all under a moist, perfectly seared duck with the adobo sauce surrounding it.  Mix it all together and you have an unforgettable entrée worthy of one of the best things I ever eaten. Side note: Filipinos eat most meals with white rice though the adobo doesn't really need it. You can ask for a bowl though. Although the duck adobo takes the crown of best dish at Manila Social Club, there are other items on the dinner menu worthy of exploring. For an appetizer, the crab dauphine is more French than Filipino with its sweet corn custard, chive oil, and delicate pieces of lump crab but that doesn't stop it from being delicious. The short rib kare-kare is a good dinner entrée but because it is a take on the boiled oxtail and mixed vegetable stew with peanut sauce I so love dearly, it doesn't hit the same high notes of the duck adobo. The parsnip puree and asparagus sesame hazelnut oil velouté have a fragrant, hearty richness but doesn't particularly mesh with the peanut sauce. However, I can't fault the amazing Chef Bjorn doing something completely different with it.Then there's brunch. The mango soufflé pancake is a sweet tooth's breakfast paradise with its airy allure and topped with a scoop of that majestic purple ube ice cream. Beware though if you don't have two stomachs like me, I'd advise this as a shared brunch item. If you're looking for a savory option, the tocilog with house cured pork, garlic fried rice, and fried egg is a staple breakfast/brunch/whenever meal Filipinos really dig in with our hands aka kamayan and you should too (just kidding but Filipinos do eat with their hands sometimes). For dessert, the ube bread pudding baked on brioche and layered ube paste with warm ube crème anglaise and coconut ice cream is heavenly and delightfully purple. The temperature contrasts and balanced sweetness of the bread pudding makes for an amazing bite. Last but not least the ube bae doughnuts. I had the chance to attend the first DJs and Donuts event thanks to an invite by co-owner Sam where I tried the doughnuts.  My family and friends know I'm a doughnut fiend and the ube bae doughnuts are fantastic. The glaze has the ube flavor and the dough has a lightness similar to the mango soufflé. I'd probably eat a dozen in one sitting if I had some. Circling back about dining experiences, Manila Social Club has a cool Brooklyn ambiance. They play old school hip-hop and R&B but the decor is classic and chic. You may like it, you may hate it but that's how it's done there which is called fine causal. The  staff then completes the whole experience. You're in good hands when Sam is around because he has that welcoming Filipino personality embedded in him. The staff are attentive but also personable so striking a conversation just makes the meal that much better. Manila Social Club, you are true gem. Thank you for the experience and hopefully many more to come. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",5.0
"My friend and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. After a few unsuccessful tries to make dinner reservations, we decided to try our luck for brunch. After arriving around 11:30am on Saturday, we were told that the wait would be approximately 1.5 hours. Even though it seemed like an extremely long wait, we decided to stick it out in order to finally try the place. Eventually, the hostess called us around 12:15 and we were seated at the bar. Normally I like to review the food first and save the other aspects of the restaurant (i.e. service, atmosphere and other miscellaneous issues) for the end of the review. However, given our experience, I want to highlight the service aspect first.  We had an extremely bizarre experience with our server, as he actively ignored us. We were seated at the end of the bar, he constantly engaged in conversation with the two patrons seated next to us, and checked in with a number of tables behind us. But the only time we heard from him was when we flagged him down to take our order (15 min after we were seated), when he refilled our coffee and when he took our plates away. We never received the complementary bread and ube butter that were on all other tables, and I had to flag him down for a water refill.  Moreover, the hostess and a number of other waiters (since we were seated right in front of the credit card machine) checked in and asked if we needed anything. Our server never checked in once, but he stopped to talk to the people next to us numerous times and even offered them a complimentary dish, when we didn't even get bread.  It was so confusing, I wondered if we offended him somehow.  Anyway, I wanted to highlight that because I thought it was so unusual, and I decided to subtract a star because of that. I do want to stress that everyone else in the restaurant, especially the hostess, were very friendly. It's just that our waiter seemed particularly standoffish with us and that's something I've never experienced before. Now on to the food:Mango soufflé pancake - my absolute favorite dish. It is a fluffy pancake dotted with bits of mango and topped with a scoop of ube ice cream. It was absolutely amazing and unique. Lumpia Shanghai - usually my favorite Filipino dish, I thought this version was a tad too sweet, but liked the two accompanied dips. Longasia with Garlic rice - loved the longasia (Filipino sausage), but not crazy about the rice, which I thought was a bit undercooked. Torta Tagalong - the omelette was light and fluffy, but under seasoned.  Spam Fries - loved the presentation, lightly fried spams cut into fries shape and placed into an empty spam can. Super creative and fun. The decor was charming, I liked the pineapple accents. The space was small, but the tables were well spaced out. Overall, I thought the food was interesting and beautifully presented. There aren't many Filipino restaurants in NYC, particularly ones that target a wider audience rather than a more traditional Filipino place such as Krystal's or Jeepney. I would like to come back and try the dinner menu, but would ask to be seated at a different server's station.",3.0
"I really didn't care for the salmon that I had here, but I'm giving Manila Social Club for the following reasons:-service was exceptional-my boyfriend's veggie paella was good-ube bread pudding was yummy -atmosphere was a nice break from the typical spot in Williamsburg these daysThe main thing I want to say about this place is that the service was amazing. Our waiter was super friendly and gracious. He always a smile on his face and was excited when we ordered bread pudding! He was very attentive--he brought us complimentary lotus chips, which were addictive, and amazing mango salsa right when we sat down, and immediately brought us more just as when finished the first bowl. I only wish that I had ordered something else, because my salmon just didn't have much flavor at all, and the puree that it came with was too bitter. It was also pricey for what it was. I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt because everything else that we had was good, and from the other reviews, it looks like brunch may be better. I think the online menu may be different from their current menu? I might be wrong though.",4.0
"I came to Manila Social Club with a large group of friends for dinner last week and was able to try most of the (meat) dishes. Favorites were the lumpia shanghai filled with longanisa, the pancit pranses (duck confit and foie gras over noodles), and surf & turf. The other dishes were good but a few needed a touch more salt/seasoning. It was fine though because I rather like controlling my own salt intake.Ube donut was nice and fluffy sort of like a croissant. The ube bread pudding was a bit bread-y for my taste, but once broken down into tiny bites drenched in the ube creme anglaise, it was decent. To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding to begin with, but I definitely would have tried to drink the sauce if I wasn't in front of people.Anyway as dinner ended, I thought ""if dinner is this good, brunch has to be better!"" So I went for brunch today and I must say, it was amazing! Complimentary biscuits and ube butter were brought immediately to the table and it was so so good. From now on, I want ube butter with bread. For breakfast, lunch, dinner. Whenever bread is involved.The mango souffle pancake IS like a cloud! The menu isn't lying! I used my fork and it felt like it was sliding into nothing. Took a bite and it was pillowy. And then there were the chunks of mango and ube ice cream. I was worried this dish would be too sweet but it was perfect. There was a subtle sweetness. You know what would have made this better though? Some ube butter on top... or on the side.. for those bites of souffle that don't have any ube ice cream on it. I think I'll request it next time.I hadn't read anything about the ""Best Biscuits & Gravy"" so we decided to take a chance, and I'm glad we did! It was a solid choice. A huge bowl of longanisa gravy with a biscuit, 2 eggs, and a longanisa - you can't go wrong. Another favorite was the longanisa hash. Sam told us it was really good with hot sauce so he brought out some homemade stuff made from Thai chili and wasabi. He was right. I started to dip the spam fries and lumpia into it as well.I already have in mind what to order next time I'm back. Sam and the others were all very hospitable and made sure glasses were always filled and checked in to see how we liked everything. There was never any rush and they answered any questions we had. It's best to get there early; otherwise you may have a long wait ahead of you. I can't even imagine what summer will be like... so go now!",5.0
"A cozy little spot to get some tasty Filipino food in Williamsburg. Came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch around 1:30pm and were told the wait could be anywhere from 45 mins to an hour but decided to put our number down anyways in case people dropped off the list. After wandering the area for about a half hour, we got called saying they had a table ready for us.We ordered the lumpia shanghai for an appetizer and were feeling like something savory- so I went with the longanisa with garlic rice and over-easy eggs. My boyfriend went for the tocino with garlic rice and over-easy eggs. Both the lumpia and entree servings were pretty generous and looked like they were played with care. Both meats tasted a little less fatty than I'm used to- which, all-in-all,  isn't a bad thing.I'll definitely be back to try the spam fries (when I'm mentally prepared for that), and to pick up a few ube doughnuts for special occasions. Also, I'm about to try and recreate that insanely good ube butter that accompanied the pandesal they served us.",4.0
"Our favorite Filipino restaurant in Williamsburg so far! The staff here are the most friendly, warm, welcoming and hospitable. The dinner here was excellent; the dishes were presented well, tasted great and left us with a food coma.Their spin on authentic Filipino dishes are creative and unique. The Kare Kare was served on a plate in a smaller portion rather than in a stew with a side of rice. The spam fries were presented stylishly in the tin can and included two sauces (one was ketchup, the other a slightly spicy sauce). The lumpia were light and crisp and also served with two sauces (one spicier than the other). The tocino on a stick was paired well with red onions but does not come with a side of rice. We enjoyed a warm, ube bread pudding at the end, which made us melt inside.The mocktail drinks here were my favorite; I am a huge fan of fruity and sweet drinks. One of them was even garnished with star fruit, which was my first time trying it. We dined while there was a photo shoot going on inside the restaurant for a New York Times article; it was a cool experience to watch the process and the lighting did not negatively effect our dining experience at all.We will definitely come here again for the brunch selection (especially the mango & ube pancakes and the ube latte). The ube and gold donuts are also highly appealing, though you should be aware that one gold donut is $100 and a dozen is $1,000 (since there is champagne and 24 karat gold dust involved)!Edit: We just came back for brunch and it was a great meal. We had the sea bass breakfast platter (with eggs, rice, etc.) and the mango ube soufflé. The brunch also started with pandesal (buttery, slightly cheesey bread) with ube butter. Delicious!",5.0
I really wanted to fall head over heels in love with this place but unfortunately it just didn't happen. For drinks we ordered the iced ube latte and calamansi drink. I don't feel that the ube syrup added any distinct flavor to the latte except for sweetness. The calamansi drink was quite refreshing.For food we ordered the lumpia shanghai and a meat and eggs platter with tocino as the meat.  The lumpia was fine but nothing absolutely amazing about it. The platter though...the garlic fried rice wasn't hot. Some of it was lukewarm and some of it was even cold. We were the last party to be seated for brunch service so I don't know if that had any effect on the temperature of the food but it really shouldn't have been cold. I'd like to visit for dinner service to see the difference and try some other dishes in order to give it another chance.,3.0
"I'm glad I was lucky enough to get a spot for brunch here on a Saturday afternoon. By the time i got there, it was 2pm which was already on the late side of brunch. Although a seat wasn't guaranteed, we were told that we would receive a call 10minutes before 3pm in case someone doesn't show up. Luckily enough, we did receive a call and were seated by 3pm. The staff here is incredibly warm and nice. My BF and I had bread roll with ube butter complimentary. To me, it tasted kind of like a creme puff and a mix with taro. Although it was 3pm, I ordered the mango soufflé pancake with the ube icecream. It had a very light, sponge cake like texture with mango pieces mixed in and on top, a scoop of ube icecream. It was amazing. The pancake was so soft, it melted in my mouth. My BF had the longanisa. It is a type of sausage, with fried rice. I had a couple bites of his, and it was really delicious. For the appetizer, we ordered the longanisa sliders. We were already pretty full from the entree (appetizer came out last). So we ended up taking most of the sliders home. Parking was relatively easy for us to find. Try to get here earlier so you don't need to wait so long!Ps- you need to preorder for the donuts ..",5.0
Love their brunch menu. Mango pancake is a must try. Delicious übe sweet butter. Spam fries were ok..gimmicky. Scrambled eggs with garlic fried rice was delicious.,4.0
"Over the past few years, Filipinos have become quite spoiled as more and more cutting edge restaurants serving Pinoy food have popped up in the city. 8 years ago, I would have been just ridiculously happy with any place serving longsilog but with Maharlika, Jeepney and Pig & Khao serving exciting riffs on Filipino comfort food, I've gotten more picky.Today we tried one of the newest Pinoy spots, Manila Social Club, located in one of Williamsburg's scene-iest areas, steps away from Roebling Tea Room, Fette Sau and Momofuku Milk Bar. I thought it was a cool looking spot: bright and airy, no Filipino vibe overkill. The brunch wait is LONG at over an hour on a Saturday but we called ahead and put our name down in advance so that we could chill at home until our table was free.On to the food ... We thought that there were some missed opportunities for greatness. Our favorite part of the meal was the complementary pan de sal and ube butter, which was so yummy but could have been heavenly had they had warmed up the pan de sal. Their lumpiang Shanghai was one of the best I've ever had, stuffed with longganiza - that needs no tweaking. The spam fries were well presented but at the end of the day something we could easily have made from home. For our entrees, we each had some version of silog - that classic Filipino combo of garlic fried rice, fried egg and meat. The tocino was good while the longganiza was average. The garlic rice could have been more garlicky (spoken like a true Pinay). We thought that they should have made the effort to serve the food with any of the many funky Filipino vinegars available in the US - something like pinakurat or even just the Datu Puti that's already had tons of chili and garlic marinating in it. All in all, we thought the silog dishes were good but nothing to write home about.I guess we also missed an opportunity to taste this spot's greatness by failing to order their popular soufflé pancakes and French toast. Something to come back for!Service was very pleasant and courteous, but most of the time it was difficult to flag down a server when we needed one. It is extremely busy so we understand ... but given this spot's huge popularity, they could probably benefit from adding on an extra server on the weekends.We've tried their ube doughnuts when a friend ordered a bunch one weekend. They're yummy enough but our group agreed it could be improved with ube filling to punch up the ube factor.At the end of the day, I'm always happy to see more Filipino spots thriving in New York. Manila Social Club is a very welcome addition to the scene and it's great to see them thriving. A few more tweaks though and this spot could truly be great!",4.0
"When does a dining experience become more than just the meal? For my 100th review, Manila Social Club ticks off all the items of a great dining experience by crafting food that is both familiar but new and special to my heart (and stomach): Filipino.Strictly speaking if I were to rate Manila Social Club solely on Filipino food, it wouldn't be rated this high. What Manila Social Club does so well is take the traditional food Filipinos know and love that your family grew up eating and have such fond memories of and elevate it for a broader audience. I'd call it accessible Filipino food. The Filipino food movement is growing and Manila Social Club is one of many great restaurants taking part in it. Whenever I describe Filipino food to people who haven't tried it before, it sometimes is hard to describe in a few words. Though there is one dish you can always talk about, the national dish called adobo. Filipino-style adobo must always have a medley of garlic, vinegar, and soy sauce. Once those ingredients are in it, the dish varies greatly. I enjoy making a pork adobo for its simplicity. Yet Manila Social Club has a duck adobo that is stunningly composed. It has a velvety sunchoke puree, earthy shiitake mushrooms, and bitter yu choy all under a moist, perfectly seared duck with the adobo sauce surrounding it.  Mix it all together and you have an unforgettable entrée worthy of one of the best things I ever eaten. Side note: Filipinos eat most meals with white rice though the adobo doesn't really need it. You can ask for a bowl though. Although the duck adobo takes the crown of best dish at Manila Social Club, there are other items on the dinner menu worthy of exploring. For an appetizer, the crab dauphine is more French than Filipino with its sweet corn custard, chive oil, and delicate pieces of lump crab but that doesn't stop it from being delicious. The short rib kare-kare is a good dinner entrée but because it is a take on the boiled oxtail and mixed vegetable stew with peanut sauce I so love dearly, it doesn't hit the same high notes of the duck adobo. The parsnip puree and asparagus sesame hazelnut oil velouté have a fragrant, hearty richness but doesn't particularly mesh with the peanut sauce. However, I can't fault the amazing Chef Bjorn doing something completely different with it.Then there's brunch. The mango soufflé pancake is a sweet tooth's breakfast paradise with its airy allure and topped with a scoop of that majestic purple ube ice cream. Beware though if you don't have two stomachs like me, I'd advise this as a shared brunch item. If you're looking for a savory option, the tocilog with house cured pork, garlic fried rice, and fried egg is a staple breakfast/brunch/whenever meal Filipinos really dig in with our hands aka kamayan and you should too (just kidding but Filipinos do eat with their hands sometimes). For dessert, the ube bread pudding baked on brioche and layered ube paste with warm ube crème anglaise and coconut ice cream is heavenly and delightfully purple. The temperature contrasts and balanced sweetness of the bread pudding makes for an amazing bite. Last but not least the ube bae doughnuts. I had the chance to attend the first DJs and Donuts event thanks to an invite by co-owner Sam where I tried the doughnuts.  My family and friends know I'm a doughnut fiend and the ube bae doughnuts are fantastic. The glaze has the ube flavor and the dough has a lightness similar to the mango soufflé. I'd probably eat a dozen in one sitting if I had some. Circling back about dining experiences, Manila Social Club has a cool Brooklyn ambiance. They play old school hip-hop and R&B but the decor is classic and chic. You may like it, you may hate it but that's how it's done there which is called fine causal. The  staff then completes the whole experience. You're in good hands when Sam is around because he has that welcoming Filipino personality embedded in him. The staff are attentive but also personable so striking a conversation just makes the meal that much better. Manila Social Club, you are true gem. Thank you for the experience and hopefully many more to come. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",5.0
"My friend and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. After a few unsuccessful tries to make dinner reservations, we decided to try our luck for brunch. After arriving around 11:30am on Saturday, we were told that the wait would be approximately 1.5 hours. Even though it seemed like an extremely long wait, we decided to stick it out in order to finally try the place. Eventually, the hostess called us around 12:15 and we were seated at the bar. Normally I like to review the food first and save the other aspects of the restaurant (i.e. service, atmosphere and other miscellaneous issues) for the end of the review. However, given our experience, I want to highlight the service aspect first.  We had an extremely bizarre experience with our server, as he actively ignored us. We were seated at the end of the bar, he constantly engaged in conversation with the two patrons seated next to us, and checked in with a number of tables behind us. But the only time we heard from him was when we flagged him down to take our order (15 min after we were seated), when he refilled our coffee and when he took our plates away. We never received the complementary bread and ube butter that were on all other tables, and I had to flag him down for a water refill.  Moreover, the hostess and a number of other waiters (since we were seated right in front of the credit card machine) checked in and asked if we needed anything. Our server never checked in once, but he stopped to talk to the people next to us numerous times and even offered them a complimentary dish, when we didn't even get bread.  It was so confusing, I wondered if we offended him somehow.  Anyway, I wanted to highlight that because I thought it was so unusual, and I decided to subtract a star because of that. I do want to stress that everyone else in the restaurant, especially the hostess, were very friendly. It's just that our waiter seemed particularly standoffish with us and that's something I've never experienced before. Now on to the food:Mango soufflé pancake - my absolute favorite dish. It is a fluffy pancake dotted with bits of mango and topped with a scoop of ube ice cream. It was absolutely amazing and unique. Lumpia Shanghai - usually my favorite Filipino dish, I thought this version was a tad too sweet, but liked the two accompanied dips. Longasia with Garlic rice - loved the longasia (Filipino sausage), but not crazy about the rice, which I thought was a bit undercooked. Torta Tagalong - the omelette was light and fluffy, but under seasoned.  Spam Fries - loved the presentation, lightly fried spams cut into fries shape and placed into an empty spam can. Super creative and fun. The decor was charming, I liked the pineapple accents. The space was small, but the tables were well spaced out. Overall, I thought the food was interesting and beautifully presented. There aren't many Filipino restaurants in NYC, particularly ones that target a wider audience rather than a more traditional Filipino place such as Krystal's or Jeepney. I would like to come back and try the dinner menu, but would ask to be seated at a different server's station.",3.0
"I really didn't care for the salmon that I had here, but I'm giving Manila Social Club for the following reasons:-service was exceptional-my boyfriend's veggie paella was good-ube bread pudding was yummy -atmosphere was a nice break from the typical spot in Williamsburg these daysThe main thing I want to say about this place is that the service was amazing. Our waiter was super friendly and gracious. He always a smile on his face and was excited when we ordered bread pudding! He was very attentive--he brought us complimentary lotus chips, which were addictive, and amazing mango salsa right when we sat down, and immediately brought us more just as when finished the first bowl. I only wish that I had ordered something else, because my salmon just didn't have much flavor at all, and the puree that it came with was too bitter. It was also pricey for what it was. I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt because everything else that we had was good, and from the other reviews, it looks like brunch may be better. I think the online menu may be different from their current menu? I might be wrong though.",4.0
"I came to Manila Social Club with a large group of friends for dinner last week and was able to try most of the (meat) dishes. Favorites were the lumpia shanghai filled with longanisa, the pancit pranses (duck confit and foie gras over noodles), and surf & turf. The other dishes were good but a few needed a touch more salt/seasoning. It was fine though because I rather like controlling my own salt intake.Ube donut was nice and fluffy sort of like a croissant. The ube bread pudding was a bit bread-y for my taste, but once broken down into tiny bites drenched in the ube creme anglaise, it was decent. To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding to begin with, but I definitely would have tried to drink the sauce if I wasn't in front of people.Anyway as dinner ended, I thought ""if dinner is this good, brunch has to be better!"" So I went for brunch today and I must say, it was amazing! Complimentary biscuits and ube butter were brought immediately to the table and it was so so good. From now on, I want ube butter with bread. For breakfast, lunch, dinner. Whenever bread is involved.The mango souffle pancake IS like a cloud! The menu isn't lying! I used my fork and it felt like it was sliding into nothing. Took a bite and it was pillowy. And then there were the chunks of mango and ube ice cream. I was worried this dish would be too sweet but it was perfect. There was a subtle sweetness. You know what would have made this better though? Some ube butter on top... or on the side.. for those bites of souffle that don't have any ube ice cream on it. I think I'll request it next time.I hadn't read anything about the ""Best Biscuits & Gravy"" so we decided to take a chance, and I'm glad we did! It was a solid choice. A huge bowl of longanisa gravy with a biscuit, 2 eggs, and a longanisa - you can't go wrong. Another favorite was the longanisa hash. Sam told us it was really good with hot sauce so he brought out some homemade stuff made from Thai chili and wasabi. He was right. I started to dip the spam fries and lumpia into it as well.I already have in mind what to order next time I'm back. Sam and the others were all very hospitable and made sure glasses were always filled and checked in to see how we liked everything. There was never any rush and they answered any questions we had. It's best to get there early; otherwise you may have a long wait ahead of you. I can't even imagine what summer will be like... so go now!",5.0

"A couple of my friends and I came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon around 12:00 PM - we ended up waiting for almost 2 hours (this place is super tiny).We ordered the following: Spam Fries, Mango Souffle Pancake, Ube Latte, Black Striped Bass, Torta Talong and Longanisa Hash. Before I review the main dishes, let me talk about the complimentary sides:Ube Marshmallow - light and fluffy, thumbs up!Biscuit with Ube Spread - this was GOLD. I'm sort of ashamed to say this was my favorite dish but I'm going to say it anyways! The ube spread was so good and it worked so well with the soft biscuit. GREAT comboNow let's move on to the main dishes:Spam Fries - this was really good! It came with two different types of sauce - one was spicy and one was sweet. Both went really well with the spam fries!Mango Souffle Pancake - I was so excited to try this dish from seeing pictures prior but I was really disappointed. WAYYYY too dry for me and not enough taste. I hardly tasted the mango. The ube ice cream was the best part.Ube Latte - slightly disappointed as well as I did not taste any ube in the latte at all. It tasted like a regular latte to me (and yes I did mix it!)Black Striped Bass/Torta Talong - my friends ordered it and I did not get to taste it but according to them - it was good!Longanisa Hash - my second favorite dish! This dish was very different from the other hash I ate before. The taste was unique and overall I would give this dish a 10/10!I also want to mention that the service here is exceptional but the wait for food was almost an hour (plus the almost two hours we waited to get seated). Overall, I do not think this place is worth the wait AT ALL. However, I do see that you can make a reservation for dinner (no reservations for brunch) so maybe I'll come back to try their dinner menu!",3.0
"I came here on a surprise date with my husband on a Saturday night around 7pm. It was pretty empty when we walked in, probably due to the rain. I loved the fried chips they give out for free. Delicious. I ordered the spam fries and they were seriously a DREAM. And I can't believe how creative the chef is!For the main course, I had kare-kare with a side of garlic rice. I honestly couldn't believe how tender the meat was, it literally fell of the bone. It's the perfect amount of rice, meat, sauce, etc. Definitely try this dish!We ordered the ube bread pudding which was HEAVENLY. The manager even gave it to us on the house because it took a little longer to cook than normal. Amazing customer service.If you're looking for a new place to try in Brooklyn that is cozy and has great service, definitely stop by here!",5.0
"Let me get one thing out of the way first: YOU MUST PRE-ORDER THE UBE DONUTS.  Like a week in advance.  They only distribute them on Fridays.  I was utterly disappointed by this fact, and NEED potential patrons to understand this.  Now that this is clear, let me continue my review.Came all the way to Brooklyn -- from Manhattan, and really from LA -- to try this place, but was greeted with a 10+ minute wait even though multiple tables were available.  (Reading the other reviews, it seems like I should have been happy with such a short wait.  For context, I came here on a Sunday at about 2:00 pm.)  I sat in the small waiting area, and saw what I was waiting for... The hostess was at the far end of the restaurant, teaching a guy who would turn out to be my waiter how to fold the napkins to set my table.  DGAF about your napkins.  Get me seated and eating.When I was finally seated, I learned that basically half of the menu was unavailable.  This is annoying, but unfortunately par for the course at Filipino restaurants.  I don't know why I expected things to be different in New York.  As a Filipina myself, nothing infuriates me more than being unable to order whatever I want off the menu.  Neither of the fish breakfast dishes were available, not even calamansi juice...!  But apparently they had a calamansi mocktail that they were able to serve me.  It included calamansi juice, honey, and club soda.  Tell me why the mocktail was $6, and the juice was $4, when the mocktail has LESS actual calamansi ingredients?!  Get out of here.  (Side note: a couple came in to the restaurant to just grab a drink at the bar, but they were turned away.  I couldn't overhear whether this was because they don't have a liquor license yet, or if they just don't serve booze during the day.  Either way, whaaaat?)Also, if you're going to hire non-Filipino employees, they should be familiar with Filipino dishes.  I asked if the Sirloin Steak and Eggs was prepared like tapa, since tapa is a pretty standard Filipino breakfast item, and my personal favorite.  The white dude who took my order had no idea what I was talking about.  I clarified by asking how the steak was seasoned.  He said, ""Uh, I think it's just salt and pepper?""  He didn't offer to ask the chef how it was prepared, but he should have done that at least.  Go ahead and call this racist if you want to, but just know that it is a plea for waiter education.  How would you handle answering this question for someone that had allergies?I would have given this place just one star for the disappointing service and lack of ube donuts, but the food was alright.  My fiancé's Longanisa and Eggs was average, but better when I asked for vinegar to dip the sausage in.  I really enjoyed the Torta Talong -- it was very smoky and a pretty good portion size.  The garlic fried rice it was served with was tasty, too.Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to go back home to Lola... Her service is much better, and I'm never disappointed by the lack of options.",2.0
"Yes, yes, yaaaaaas! I have so many good things to say about this place. My boyfriend and I came in for brunch on a Saturday afternoon, and that only made me want to come in for a dinner service. When we walked in, we could see that it was very lively and bright. The interior looked like something designed by someone on HGTV. Seriously, so pretty. It's not a huge space, but they have an open floor plan and lots of seating. There was a wait for a table, so we decided to go for seats at the bar. It was actually very spacious AND the chairs were pretty comfy - cushioned and they had a back to it. A plus in my book! Service was great as well - I love that the owners/managers are so involved in their restaurant. They actively engaged in conversation with us while running around to make sure things went as smoothly as possible. They had a recent article in NYT, and they still seemed humble and happy to be there. And now for the food: - Croissant with Ube butter: this came complimentary, and it was one of my favorite items from the meal. The croissant was hot, fresh and flaky. And these weren't some baby croissants. They were about the size of my head. I love, love, loved the Ube butter. So simple, but definitely a great unique touch. It was delicious. - Spam Fries: cut up pieces of spam, served with banana ketchup and a mango chutney. As a Filipina, Spam is a breakfast staple for me. I like that they straight up served it in a spam container. No frills - that's exactly what it is. - Longanisa Sliders: 3 small sliders to an order along with some lotus chips and banana ketchup. Longanisa can get greasy, but the daikon pickles cancelled out the sweetness and added a touch of freshness. Those lotus chips were addicting! - Mango Soufflé: one of their signature items in the menu! I saw it when we came in, so I had to order it. Served with maple syrup and some Ube ice cream on top, it fees more like a dessert. Not that I have a problem with that!",5.0
"I ordered a dozen of Ube donuts for New Years and what can I say they were amazing. The moment you untie the purple nylon ribbon and lift the top of the box, it is visually stunning (dark purples and browns) and the smell of the donuts overcomes your senses and makes your mouth water.  The donuts were soft, chewy and just the right amount of sweetness. I have yet to go for brunch. The donuts are an indulgent treat. The owners are charming and super passionate about their restaurant. I met Toki and Romeo, they made my order pick up smooth and enjoyable.",5.0
"My girlfriend and I came here with another couple, after making a last minute decision to switch venues, and I'm glad we did.  The first thing we noticed as soon as we came in was the gold-leaf plated donut.  We took pictures of the donut and found out that they actually do sell it for like $100 or something.  After a few minutes, we got a seat and instead of bread, we got a bowl of croissants with ube butter.  I've never had ube before, but the butter was quite sweet and the croissants were decently flaky.  We also ordered iced ube lattes; the espresso, sadly, overpowers the ube flavor.  As far as the food goes, we ordered a bunch of stuff: We got spam fries and longanisa sliders as appetizers.  The spam fries came with banana ketchup and mango chutney to dip with.  Both dips were quite good, though I preferred the banana ketchup.  For entrees, I got the tocino with fried eggs and garlic fried rice and my girlfriend got the mango souffle pancakes.  The other couple got the biscuits and gravy and the french toast.  They were all very delicious.  My tocino with fried eggs and garlic fried rice was definitely a great choice.  The tocino tasted like chinese char siu, but sweeter; the eggs were cooked as ordered - over easy; and the garlic fried rice was really savory and flavorful!  It certainly isn't your typical american brunch food, but it still hit the spot!  The other dishes were also good, but I don't remember them as well.  The mango souffle pancakes came with a scoop of ube ice cream, which was light in flavor and very floral. My girlfriend really liked it, describing the flavor as ""if taro and coconut had a baby.""Anyway, food was delicious and we chatted up with the owners after the meal.  They mentioned that they have a bunch of different types of bakery goods for sale which need to be pre-ordered.  That included ube donuts and a bunch of other pies.  The other couple made an order for the donuts, but we didn't.  If we didn't live so far away, we probably would've ordered a dozen ube donuts.  Overall, I loved this place.  The food and the service were both great.  Would definitely recommend!",5.0
"Awesome cuisine...using French technique with inspired Pilipino combined to make a ""New American"" delicacy!!MacaPano ice cream was  delicious...very rich in flavor ..made of very rare coconut using the stringy center of the mutated coconut with meat all the way through the center!!A family-run restaurant business.. Very attentive to our table and described each of the dishes in delicious detail.The chef has amazing talent.

"This place is definitely on point on all aspects! From the taste to the service... everything was excellent. Big thanks to the host Michael who was super friendly and made it possible for us to try the brunch menu. All the staff were friendly and very welcoming explaining any questions we had. The Pandesal with Ube butter were complimentary. The Ube gave the butter a nice sweetness to the palette. The Calamansi Honey Drink was very refreshing with the hint of kumquat and honey. Lumpia Shanghai were made of pork and duck which was very crunchy and good. Spam fries were nicely cut to the shape of french fries and crispy without having the overly oil taste. The presentation with the spam tin was cute.For the main dish we ordered the Tocino with eggs & the Longanisa with eggs which both came with the Garlic Fried Rice. The Tocino was right on point. Although the cut is the pork shoulder, it was not too fatty in taste. Definite thumbs up on the Garlic Fried Rice. Combine each bite with the meat/egg/fried rice as it brings out all the flavors and compliments each other very well.The only bad thing i can say about this place is that the Ube donuts are Made to Order Only!  Will definitely come back for Ube Donuts and to try the Dinner Menu!",5.0
"Came here for brunch and was quite amazed at how good everything was! We ordered the lumpias and fried avocado tempura to start. Both very good with different sauces to complement each dish. For entrees, we ordered the mango soufflé pancakes with a scoop of ube ice cream and French toast espesyal. The soufflé pancakes reminded me of the mini Chinese egg cakes you get from Chinatown back in the days. It was very fluffy. The French toast was lightly fried with starfruit jam and mango glaze with a scoop of macapuno ice cream. A must get!The ube latte was a bit too sweet for my taste. We even asked for extra espresso to help tone down the sweetness but it was still very sweet. The calamansi drink was very good and refreshing! Best part was the croissant served with ube butter!",4.0
"The executive chef's passion and innovation can be tasted in every single bite. We went to dinner the first time and then we went for brunch. We ordered some of the greatest hits...and loved every single thing. --the ceviche is simple, fresh and palate cleansing.--duck was tender, well seasoned and to die for!!! I looooved it!! This was my favorite dish. --We ordered the mango pancake soufflé for brunch. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes. I prefer savory and spicy over sweet. Pleasantly surprised...they are so light, fluffy and the mango was the perfect complement. --avocado tempura with pickled onion and daikon was creamy with just right amount of acidity. --We indulged and bought the 24K cristal ube donut. It's not just a marketing ploy, it's a very well made and tasty donut. We will see you soon Manila Social club!",5.0
"A couple of my friends and I came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon around 12:00 PM - we ended up waiting for almost 2 hours (this place is super tiny).We ordered the following: Spam Fries, Mango Souffle Pancake, Ube Latte, Black Striped Bass, Torta Talong and Longanisa Hash. Before I review the main dishes, let me talk about the complimentary sides:Ube Marshmallow - light and fluffy, thumbs up!Biscuit with Ube Spread - this was GOLD. I'm sort of ashamed to say this was my favorite dish but I'm going to say it anyways! The ube spread was so good and it worked so well with the soft biscuit. GREAT comboNow let's move on to the main dishes:Spam Fries - this was really good! It came with two different types of sauce - one was spicy and one was sweet. Both went really well with the spam fries!Mango Souffle Pancake - I was so excited to try this dish from seeing pictures prior but I was really disappointed. WAYYYY too dry for me and not enough taste. I hardly tasted the mango. The ube ice cream was the best part.Ube Latte - slightly disappointed as well as I did not taste any ube in the latte at all. It tasted like a regular latte to me (and yes I did mix it!)Black Striped Bass/Torta Talong - my friends ordered it and I did not get to taste it but according to them - it was good!Longanisa Hash - my second favorite dish! This dish was very different from the other hash I ate before. The taste was unique and overall I would give this dish a 10/10!I also want to mention that the service here is exceptional but the wait for food was almost an hour (plus the almost two hours we waited to get seated). Overall, I do not think this place is worth the wait AT ALL. However, I do see that you can make a reservation for dinner (no reservations for brunch) so maybe I'll come back to try their dinner menu!",3.0
"I came here on a surprise date with my husband on a Saturday night around 7pm. It was pretty empty when we walked in, probably due to the rain. I loved the fried chips they give out for free. Delicious. I ordered the spam fries and they were seriously a DREAM. And I can't believe how creative the chef is!For the main course, I had kare-kare with a side of garlic rice. I honestly couldn't believe how tender the meat was, it literally fell of the bone. It's the perfect amount of rice, meat, sauce, etc. Definitely try this dish!We ordered the ube bread pudding which was HEAVENLY. The manager even gave it to us on the house because it took a little longer to cook than normal. Amazing customer service.If you're looking for a new place to try in Brooklyn that is cozy and has great service, definitely stop by here!",5.0
"Let me get one thing out of the way first: YOU MUST PRE-ORDER THE UBE DONUTS.  Like a week in advance.  They only distribute them on Fridays.  I was utterly disappointed by this fact, and NEED potential patrons to understand this.  Now that this is clear, let me continue my review.Came all the way to Brooklyn -- from Manhattan, and really from LA -- to try this place, but was greeted with a 10+ minute wait even though multiple tables were available.  (Reading the other reviews, it seems like I should have been happy with such a short wait.  For context, I came here on a Sunday at about 2:00 pm.)  I sat in the small waiting area, and saw what I was waiting for... The hostess was at the far end of the restaurant, teaching a guy who would turn out to be my waiter how to fold the napkins to set my table.  DGAF about your napkins.  Get me seated and eating.When I was finally seated, I learned that basically half of the menu was unavailable.  This is annoying, but unfortunately par for the course at Filipino restaurants.  I don't know why I expected things to be different in New York.  As a Filipina myself, nothing infuriates me more than being unable to order whatever I want off the menu.  Neither of the fish breakfast dishes were available, not even calamansi juice...!  But apparently they had a calamansi mocktail that they were able to serve me.  It included calamansi juice, honey, and club soda.  Tell me why the mocktail was $6, and the juice was $4, when the mocktail has LESS actual calamansi ingredients?!  Get out of here.  (Side note: a couple came in to the restaurant to just grab a drink at the bar, but they were turned away.  I couldn't overhear whether this was because they don't have a liquor license yet, or if they just don't serve booze during the day.  Either way, whaaaat?)Also, if you're going to hire non-Filipino employees, they should be familiar with Filipino dishes.  I asked if the Sirloin Steak and Eggs was prepared like tapa, since tapa is a pretty standard Filipino breakfast item, and my personal favorite.  The white dude who took my order had no idea what I was talking about.  I clarified by asking how the steak was seasoned.  He said, ""Uh, I think it's just salt and pepper?""  He didn't offer to ask the chef how it was prepared, but he should have done that at least.  Go ahead and call this racist if you want to, but just know that it is a plea for waiter education.  How would you handle answering this question for someone that had allergies?I would have given this place just one star for the disappointing service and lack of ube donuts, but the food was alright.  My fiancé's Longanisa and Eggs was average, but better when I asked for vinegar to dip the sausage in.  I really enjoyed the Torta Talong -- it was very smoky and a pretty good portion size.  The garlic fried rice it was served with was tasty, too.Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to go back home to Lola... Her service is much better, and I'm never disappointed by the lack of options.",2.0
"Yes, yes, yaaaaaas! I have so many good things to say about this place. My boyfriend and I came in for brunch on a Saturday afternoon, and that only made me want to come in for a dinner service. When we walked in, we could see that it was very lively and bright. The interior looked like something designed by someone on HGTV. Seriously, so pretty. It's not a huge space, but they have an open floor plan and lots of seating. There was a wait for a table, so we decided to go for seats at the bar. It was actually very spacious AND the chairs were pretty comfy - cushioned and they had a back to it. A plus in my book! Service was great as well - I love that the owners/managers are so involved in their restaurant. They actively engaged in conversation with us while running around to make sure things went as smoothly as possible. They had a recent article in NYT, and they still seemed humble and happy to be there. And now for the food: - Croissant with Ube butter: this came complimentary, and it was one of my favorite items from the meal. The croissant was hot, fresh and flaky. And these weren't some baby croissants. They were about the size of my head. I love, love, loved the Ube butter. So simple, but definitely a great unique touch. It was delicious. - Spam Fries: cut up pieces of spam, served with banana ketchup and a mango chutney. As a Filipina, Spam is a breakfast staple for me. I like that they straight up served it in a spam container. No frills - that's exactly what it is. - Longanisa Sliders: 3 small sliders to an order along with some lotus chips and banana ketchup. Longanisa can get greasy, but the daikon pickles cancelled out the sweetness and added a touch of freshness. Those lotus chips were addicting! - Mango Soufflé: one of their signature items in the menu! I saw it when we came in, so I had to order it. Served with maple syrup and some Ube ice cream on top, it fees more like a dessert. Not that I have a problem with that!",5.0
"I ordered a dozen of Ube donuts for New Years and what can I say they were amazing. The moment you untie the purple nylon ribbon and lift the top of the box, it is visually stunning (dark purples and browns) and the smell of the donuts overcomes your senses and makes your mouth water.  The donuts were soft, chewy and just the right amount of sweetness. I have yet to go for brunch. The donuts are an indulgent treat. The owners are charming and super passionate about their restaurant. I met Toki and Romeo, they made my order pick up smooth and enjoyable.",5.0
"My girlfriend and I came here with another couple, after making a last minute decision to switch venues, and I'm glad we did.  The first thing we noticed as soon as we came in was the gold-leaf plated donut.  We took pictures of the donut and found out that they actually do sell it for like $100 or something.  After a few minutes, we got a seat and instead of bread, we got a bowl of croissants with ube butter.  I've never had ube before, but the butter was quite sweet and the croissants were decently flaky.  We also ordered iced ube lattes; the espresso, sadly, overpowers the ube flavor.  As far as the food goes, we ordered a bunch of stuff: We got spam fries and longanisa sliders as appetizers.  The spam fries came with banana ketchup and mango chutney to dip with.  Both dips were quite good, though I preferred the banana ketchup.  For entrees, I got the tocino with fried eggs and garlic fried rice and my girlfriend got the mango souffle pancakes.  The other couple got the biscuits and gravy and the french toast.  They were all very delicious.  My tocino with fried eggs and garlic fried rice was definitely a great choice.  The tocino tasted like chinese char siu, but sweeter; the eggs were cooked as ordered - over easy; and the garlic fried rice was really savory and flavorful!  It certainly isn't your typical american brunch food, but it still hit the spot!  The other dishes were also good, but I don't remember them as well.  The mango souffle pancakes came with a scoop of ube ice cream, which was light in flavor and very floral. My girlfriend really liked it, describing the flavor as ""if taro and coconut had a baby.""Anyway, food was delicious and we chatted up with the owners after the meal.  They mentioned that they have a bunch of different types of bakery goods for sale which need to be pre-ordered.  That included ube donuts and a bunch of other pies.  The other couple made an order for the donuts, but we didn't.  If we didn't live so far away, we probably would've ordered a dozen ube donuts.  Overall, I loved this place.  The food and the service were both great.  Would definitely recommend!",5.0
"Awesome cuisine...using French technique with inspired Pilipino combined to make a ""New American"" delicacy!!MacaPano ice cream was  delicious...very rich in flavor ..made of very rare coconut using the stringy center of the mutated coconut with meat all the way through the center!!A family-run restaurant business.. Very attentive to our table and described each of the dishes in delicious detail.The chef has amazing talent. Every dish is a thoughtful cornucopia of flavors that unleash the blend of Lete & Sebu with fine Parisian pastries across your palette. You will not be disappointed, if you can get in (call and make reservations)",5.0
"This place is definitely on point on all aspects! From the taste to the service... everything was excellent. Big thanks to the host Michael who was super friendly and made it possible for us to try the brunch menu. All the staff were friendly and very welcoming explaining any questions we had. The Pandesal with Ube butter were complimentary. The Ube gave the butter a nice sweetness to the palette. The Calamansi Honey Drink was very refreshing with the hint of kumquat and honey. Lumpia Shanghai were made of pork and duck which was very crunchy and good. Spam fries were nicely cut to the shape of french fries and crispy without having the overly oil taste. The presentation with the spam tin was cute.For the main dish we ordered the Tocino with eggs & the Longanisa with eggs which both came with the Garlic Fried Rice. The Tocino was right on point. Although the cut is the pork shoulder, it was not too fatty in taste. Definite thumbs up on the Garlic Fried Rice. Combine each bite with the meat/egg/fried rice as it brings out all the flavors and compliments each other very well.The only bad thing i can say about this place is that the Ube donuts are Made to Order Only!  Will definitely come back for Ube Donuts and to try the Dinner Menu!",5.0
"Came here for brunch and was quite amazed at how good everything was! We ordered the lumpias and fried avocado tempura to start. Both very good with different sauces to complement each dish. For entrees, we ordered the mango soufflé pancakes with a scoop of ube ice cream and French toast espesyal. The soufflé pancakes reminded me of the mini Chinese egg cakes you get from Chinatown back in the days. It was very fluffy. The French toast was lightly fried with starfruit jam and mango glaze with a scoop of macapuno ice cream. A must get!The ube latte was a bit too sweet for my taste. We even asked for extra espresso to help tone down the sweetness but it was still very sweet. The calamansi drink was very good and refreshing! Best part was the croissant served with ube butter!",4.0
"The executive chef's passion and innovation can be tasted in every single bite. We went to dinner the first time and then we went for brunch. We ordered some of the greatest hits...and loved every single thing. --the ceviche is simple, fresh and palate cleansing.--duck was tender, well seasoned and to die for!!! I looooved it!! This was my favorite dish. --We ordered the mango pancake soufflé for brunch. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes. I prefer savory and spicy over sweet.

Their food is tremendous and portion sizes are quite large. If you ever get to come to this place, be sure to make a reservation or come right when they open.

"First time trying the Ube Donut, I love Ube that's why I tried theirs and I loved it!! It's not machine made and pure handmade. Donut is on point and I would recommend this to everyone.!! Thank You",5.0
"The lack of reviews may be because it's relatively new and the location. The brunch menu seemed limited at first but it's honestly comparable to a lot of brunch menus in Lower Manhattan. They gave us a free starter of croissant and two spreads (jam and ube). My first time trying ube and I was sold on the flavor and fluffy texture of the spread. I noticed that for dinner they tend to give a free starter plate of lotus root chips to dip in mango salsa. It's great to see restaurants willing to do this.We ordered the Lumpia Shanghai, Garden Paella and Eggplant & Tofu Scramble. I definitely recommend the Lumpia Shanghai especially if you like longanisa (sweet Filipino sausage). It was so good I wanted to order a second one. The two main dishes we ordered missed the bar unfortunately. I'm a big paella fan but it lacked so much flavor. If you're vegetarian you'll probably enjoy it more. However I will give pointers for their plating and presentation. And the interior is beautiful. It may just be the items we ordered weren't fit to our taste. From the photos and reviews here it seems dinner menu may be better. If I come back I would definitely try the Mango Soufflé Pancakes (with ube) and the sides of Longanisa Hash and Spam Fries.",3.0
Complimentary lotus chips with mango salsa that I could eat all day!  Salad with ginger? dressing was loaded with avocado. Vegetable lumpia was crisp and went well with mayo and sweet chili dip.

"I came with 3 others for brunch on a Saturday at 12:30 and were quoted an hour wait but they took our numbers so we went to a coffee shop to wait.The space is small but it was decorated well and service was friendly.

For our entrees, we got the Mango souffle pancakes, Tocino, Longanisa, and the Grilled mackeral.Overall, we enjoyed everything that we tried. We only had minor complaints where the grilled mackeral was a little too salty and the rice wasn't cooked well (the grains were hard).But the Tocino and Longanisa was amazing and we devoured them even though we were stuffed.2 of us also ordered mocktails that looked so pretty and were enjoyed by their drinkers though I didn't try them so I have nothing to say about them.",4.0
"I knew I had to come here when I saw that they offer spam fries. Plus, I was really curious about the mango souffle pancakes and mocktails (menu for it is not online).Came in right at the start of brunch. There are 5 tables that can fit up to 4 people. A big table that can hold about 6-7 people plus the bar area. A relatively small but cozy place.

If I wanted to moisturize the pancakes a little, I just used the ube ice cream on top. Was in love with the chunks of mangoes in each bite. Calamansi Honey Mocktail - 5/5 - I thought I was drinking a very unique soda. It was citrusy but not overwhelmingly tart. Mmm!French Toast Espesyal - 3/5 - A bit too heavy to be a brunch item.

I will be signing up for that.  This place is a family owned company. They are all really passionate about food and the story for the food and ingredients.  Very well thought out, loved it so much!

I will be signing up for that.  This place is a family owned company. They are all really passionate about food and the story for the food and ingredients.  Very well thought out, loved it so much! So glad a Filipino joint is in Williamsburg!! I hope the neighborhood can embrace the warmth and hospitality of the Filipino culture which comes out in the food.",5.0
"If you're going to walk in for a meal, be prepared for an hour+ wait. I have tried a couple times and ended up leaving. The last time that I did go, I called in advance to be put on the waitlist (recommended, as they do not do rsvp for brunch). I actually called when I was still home to get an estimate of how long the wait would be (1.5 hr till a table for 2 opened up). They will call you when your table is ready and you'd better be there when it is or else your table will be given away. Oh! Sitting at the bar would probably minimize your waiting time. If you wait at the restaurant, they have little mango hard candies at the front for you to munch on - I wish I grabbed extra.I would describe this spot as a modernized, Filipino-inspired, Western-infused joint. It's not really traditional nor is it cultural so if that's what you're going for, this isn't it. I came here for brunch. They served complimentary bread and ube butter - let's just say that I would come here JUST for the ube butter. I can't believe that I've only JUST discovered such a savory sensation, it just makes me wonder what else I've been missing out on in life. The food did take a while to come out but the ube butter did a good job of keeping us distracted. I ordered the Black Striped Bass which was served with garlic fried rice, 2 eggs, pea shoot and radish salad. I REALLY liked my dish, the garlic fried rice was bomb, the salad complemented the taste, and the bass was soft and tasty - not at all dry. But I do feel that the fish could be cooked a little more. My boyfriend had the Tocino meat and eggs dish, he also liked his dish and said it was delicious. Our meals alone were filling but of course we had to order the Mango Soufflé Pancakes (it was what we really came to try) - SO GOOD but I did think the mangoes were a little too sweet almost sour but the sweet kick wasn't so bad. It was more of a sponge cake than a pancake. We had to take most of it to go since we were so stuffed. The ube ice cream was a delicious touch to the pancakes. The pancake was soft on the inside and a little crispy on the outside but not very - perfection. I also ordered coffee, I thought it would be some kind of Filipino coffee but it wasn't anything special. I wish I knew about the Ube Iced Latte; I would have loved to try it but it wasn't on the menu nor was it on the drink menu given. Unless you want the pancakes served first, I suggest that you request that your entrees come out first and the pancakes after because the soufflé pancakes take a while to be made. I wish we were recommended this so that we didn't have to wait so long for everything to be served together. The staff was accommodating and nice, the place was clean.I would recommend this place but call in advance to minimize your waiting time! Either call in advance or go early - like 1030am early. I am giving it 4 stars because the food was good, the staff was average, the interior was nice but nothing special, there was soft music playing. One thing for sure is that I will be trying the infamous Ube Donuts in the near future - you can place an order and pick up only on Fridays, orders are by dozen, and you'll be placed on a waitlist (so definitely order in advance if you're ordering for a specific occasion).",4.0
"yummm! fresh and filipino fusion? i'll take that! we made a reservation for brunch party on a sunday afternoon. it was surprisingly not packed located in williamsburg a few minutes off the metropolitan ave on the g line. i was browsing online hoping to find a restaurant that's a bit out of the ordinary and randomly found this place! we came as a party of 6 and probably the biggest party in the restaurant. it's not a huge place but spacious enough that you don't have to squeeze and eat elbow to elbow next to strangers. ambient is cool and a bit hippy which i personally like  a lot and service is great! waiters were attentive and what more the food is delicious as well! really nothing to complain.we each got a coffee to start. I got the ube ice latte. which is sweeten by ube syrup that runs in purple color incase if you don't know what ube is..(purple yam). this is really sweet but i like it a lot! and am sure you can't find this easily elsewhere.other people in our group each got different coffees.-americano..latte..cappucino..espresso etc etc. (they have a good selection) but no alcohols, i assume they do not have their liquor license yet? not sure but either way we didn't need alcohol that day so it was alright! we ordered 2 orders of spam fries to start. there were delicious!!! i especially love the fact that it came with the tinted spam can. it's super cute and great to share! ($7) each!and we also ordered the fried french toast that comes with ice cream to share. for main course we got the tocino with garlic rice etc (off the brunch menu) - some type of filipino porksomeone got the grilled fish (very fresh)steak (was good as well) and spam rice - yummmoverall we had a great time and would def return!",5.0
"I got to eat here for brunch today which was no small feat. The doors open at 11am, and I was there for 10 minutes beforehand when there no less than 25 people waiting outside vying for a seat/getting a name of the list. I reach out to Sam who graciously reserved me a table in the morning because I had dined here a few times before, but have never been able to make it for brunch. I'm here dining with a couple of my gays for a day of brunching and antiquing when I run into another friend (an Instagrammer) who crossed the river to try her hand at getting into brunch.Our waiter, bless his heart, still don't know his name, he served me during dinner the first time I ate here presented us some pandesal & ube butter to start, which I would pass on -- the true gem here is the lotus chips served at dinner. The table orders the spam fries ($7) + avocado tempura ($12). The spam fries were good but similar to my former review, even with a table for three we didn't finish them. There was a couple left in the tin. They're snackable and great, just know with their fat content, it's going to make you feel satiated much quicker so don't let them spoil your appetite. The avocado tempura was delicious per usual, the heat of the sauce cut by the tartness of the pickled daikon and the creamy avocado is just fantastique!For our main dishes, I order the mango soufflé ($14) and promptly told my friends they were not allowed to order the same thing as me (I don't want photos of the same dish). They ordered the roasted vegetable paella ($12) and the torta talong ($12). The mango soufflé was light, airy, and had a very subtle taste topped with an ube ice cream. It was perfect & beautiful to boot. The presentation on the torta talong was on point, and the dish tasted great as well. I can't say any bad things about that. However, the roasted vegetable paella was slightly disappointing. My friend looks across the table at me and says he doesn't think his dish is seasoned. I take a few bites of the vegetables, and I taste no seasoning on them. The seasoning on the rice was very subtle. I called over the waiter for some salt + pepper for him. He didn't mind so much because we're all trying to get our bodies ready for Fire Island so light dish of vegetables and rice is solid either way.The only other thing I would call out was after clearing our table, our waiter immediately laid down our bill without asking if we'd like anything else. I'm sure in part this is to mitigate any loitering because it's such a small space with such a high demand. I've pretty much gotten to try 75% of the menu now, and the highlights I'd definitely go back for are the mango soufflé, the avocado tempura, the duck adobo, and the regular ube doughnut.",4.0
"My visit here compelled me to write my first review. The food was thoroughly enjoyable - had the Calamansi honey mocktail which, as a calamansi lover all my life, I thought was amazingly refreshing; the Tocino, less sweet than what I'm used to in the Philippines but nevertheless solid, and the absolutely to-die-for mango soufflé pancakes, which was like a piece of heaven in every bite.The food aside, I'm writing this review because of the service. Our pancakes took about 30 minutes to arrive because of some complication in the kitchen. The owner of the restaurant came to our table to personally explain the delay, and gave us the brunch on the house. And I saw her doing this individually for every table affected in the restaurant. I didn't have cash on me to tip at the time but I'm definitely going back!",5.0
"Think I may have found my new little haven. Went here for brunch as my boyfriend discovered the place through Urbandaddy. The mango soufflé pancakes caught my eye as the thing to try and I'm so glad I did. It made me think that I no longer have to bother with the wait at Clinton St. Bakery and this had taro ice cream on top to boot. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious and also was topped with chopped mango. Boyfriend got the French toast which also was good. It was unique because it was fried and that starfruit jam was also excellent. Langonisa hash helped to curb all the sweetness going on. It was a bit oily, but it is sausage. The potatoes and greens help cut through it. When I last went, they only had virgin drinks. If you're all about getting slizzered, you're going to have a bad time, but if you actually care about getting delicious brunch without the aid of drinks, this is the place. Definitely, definitelyyyy have to come back here for dinner!",5.0
"This was everything I hoped for AND MORE! Absolutely loved Manila Social Club.Finding a modern Filipino restaurant is tough to find, and is definitely a step up from the popular ones in the city like Jeepney etc etc. The restaurant is small, like the other reviews mentioned, so when I showed up on a Saturday morning at 1045, all the tables were taken (or reserved for a party coming in at 11), the owner pulled a seat from the entrance so I could eat at the bar. I'm excited to see the space when the patio opens up and they get their liquor license (boozy brunch, yes please!).I ordered the mango soufflé pancake and it was heavenly. I wish I ordered the spam fries, but I was nervous that it would be a lot to eat, but considering how hungry I was... I really have to come back again and order a full meal!One thing I found funny/I don't fault the server/bartender at all, is that he tried to explain what a pandesal (Filipino bread) is. I'm Filipino, and grew up eating pandesal, so I found it cute that I got a mini tutorial on Filipino bread LOL. With that said, the ube butter + pandesal is delicious. I wanted to eat the butter by itself when I finished the bread, but I had to remind myself and say no hunni, it's not the best idea to eat a week's helping of butter in 5 mins.I'm planning on coming back asap and planning a brunch here when I get a big enough group for a reservation. This was my 2nd time trying to get in after the 1st time where my friends and I were quoted 2 hours (ended up getting a txt that he had a table 45 mins later), but whatever.. it's a new restaurant, you really can't fault anyone when you have a surge of customers that all want in-- Kudos to the owner and his team, can't wait to be back!",5.0
"Unfortunately I was not as pleased with this place as I hoped to be. Overall, a very average brunch experience. * Long wait time with poor estimation of time (""It's going to be a couple of hours"")* Once seated, we had to ask for menus and tableware* Not a lot of food options and dishes were not that tasteful - honestly, primarily very oily * The rice was the best part of both of our dishes (torta talong and tofu/eggplant scramble) :(Haven't tried their donuts (you have to order them online, and they are back ordered by a month), so that may be a redeeming factor.",2.0
Just stopped by for a donut tasting event on a Tuesday evening! The line was very long - waited over an hour - hopefully future events wont be so crowded but the donuts were delicious! Super light and airy inside and very tasty! I hope they offer more beverages in the future like tea / matcha or something - only had coffee & water.,4.0
Horrible management. Could have handle it a bit better. Didn't give us any information about how long we will be seated. Told us we would be seated once the table leaves. We were an hour before we close but there were still reservation that was coming in and then the host told us that the kitchen was running out of food? I work in a high-end restaurant and I felt like there should be more information given to a guest instead of making them wait for 15-20 mins and then rejects them after. Very disappointed.,1.0

For appetizer, we got the Tocino and something else that I completely forgot, but I had no complaints. They came out very quickly too. The wait time for the actual entree was a bit longer than expected but it was alright, the place was full. My steak was absolutely fabulous. Everything about it was good; the sauces/caramelized onions/Bok Choy. Excellent. My boyfriends pancit on the other hand, I was not a fan of. He enjoyed it very much. But being a Filipino myself, the noodles were far too thick and the sauce was a little too lemony. For dessert we shared the bread pudding with the ube sauce and that absolutely killed us.

A little sad that there isn't a bar yet, but their ""mocktail"" menu did not disappoint. The drinks on it were very refreshing. For appetizer, we got the Tocino and something else that I completely forgot, but I had no complaints. They came out very quickly too. The wait time for the actual entree was a bit longer than expected but it was alright, the place was full. My steak was absolutely fabulous. Everything about it was good; the sauces/caramelized onions/Bok Choy. Excellent. My boyfriends pancit on the other hand, I was not a fan of. He enjoyed it very much. But being a Filipino myself, the noodles were far too thick and the sauce was a little too lemony. For dessert we shared the bread pudding with the ube sauce and that absolutely killed us. It was amazing. Great way to end the meal. All in all, I'd return. Good first experience.",4.0
I hear great things about this restaurant so I was going to finally try it out with friends today but was bummed to see that it was closed until I came to this shop!! Kinda bummed that there's nothing about them being on vacation on the internet and on Yelp. Will try again soon...,1.0
"Just picked up the ube bae donuts an hour ago. It's the best donut I ever had, honestly. Better than the cronuts. My friends love it as well !!! You can feel true Filipino hospitality in this place. Thank u Toki!",5.0
"The appetizers were great the main courses definitely lacked some flavor. For apps we had the lumpia and the crab cakes which were great and had me really excited for our main course. For our main course we had the lamb calderetta and the short rib kare kare. Man, I couldn't be more disappointed! The only thing it needed was salt which was nowhere to be found. This place seemed way to pretentious for my liking. No condiments like salt and pepper to go with your meal and no milk or sugar to go with your coffee. It also seemed like the host took pleasure in sending walk-ins away if they didn't have a reservation. I drove 2 hours to get to this place and unfortunately it was a waste of time.I feel bad because I am Filipino and really want to see more of our food out there in restaurants. But I will not go this place again.",2.0
"Driving to NYC for a day trip, I asked a friend with good taste where I could get Filipino brunch in the area. He recommended this place and we are so happy he did!Lumpiang shanghai is so simple- crispy and longganisa-y. We are it like chips.Vegetarian friend got the avocado fries. Never had anything like it before. It takes just like how it sounds. warm avocado coated with oily crispy goodness.We also got the classic longganisa, tocino, eggs, and fried rice combo, french toast with macapuno ice cream, and tortang talong. All yummy! Our only regret is not having enough rooms in our bellies to order everything on the menu.And you've got to the try their coffee called The Filipino. Refreshing. And the ube bae donuts, if you can. Because ube. And donuts. Come on.Service was impeccable. I wish we had something even remotely similar to this in Boston. Sigh.",5.0

"Super stuffed but damn worth it. A while back my girlfriend sent me some photos of spam fries. SOLD. Unfortunately, this was when I still lived in SF.Now I live in Brooklyn, and my friend who lives in Manhattan wanted to explore Williamsburg and try this place before it blew up (apparently some donut got all popular and a few news articles?). Missed my G train but that's alright because we had to wait a bit (gotta wait for good food right?). Ended up grabbing two arepas at a nearby joint while we waited to get called/texted that we could be seated.Get in, tiny-ish place and the decor was on point.Originally settled on lumpia, spam fries (duh), French toast and the pancake. Fattie inside me totally forgot that I had partaken in the arepa pre-meal meal and was like... I want meat and rice too. So we swapped out the lumpia for the tocino meat and rice. That was a great decision.Shortly after we place our order, Sam, who I think is the proprietor of the place, says that they ran out of batter and it'll take some time for them to make another batch. No big deal, good food takes time.The spam fries came out first. That was bomb. My arteries were saying eff-u because well it's spam and fried but so good.Next was the deep fried French toast with a coconut ice cream with berries and mango. This was also amaze-balls. I was audibly mouthgasming at this point so one of the ladies of  the restaurant seemed pretty amused.The meat and rice was up next. I loved the Tocino, and very glad we ordered it instead of the spam one. I have to say those were perfectly seasoned sunny side up eggs and the garlic fried rice had great flavor. Felt very homey and comforting.The soufflé pancake did take a while to come out, but it was worth the wait. Think Dutch pancake instead of flapjacks. Fluffy and crispy all at the same time and topped with delicious ube ice cream. Didn't even care we had to wait that long, but seriously thank you so much Sam for comping that for us, really didn't have to!TLDR: food rocked, service on point. Will come back again.",5.0

"Manila Social Club is a Williamsburg gem! The location is perfect away from the annoying and over hyped Bedford restaurants and near to chill bars. It has a laid back yet sophisticated vibe. And the food!!!! I am not a foodie and I usually do not post reviews, but I feel compelled because it was the best and most memorable meal I've had in a very long time. The modern take on Filipino concepts and pairings was so interesting and delicious. For instance, I had the surf and turf, combining the most tender and perfectly cooked pork belly with tuna sashimi and the most amazing sauces (can't even describe them, they were so good). Everyone in my party loved their dishes. The chef Bjorn even came out to check on us and see how things were. You could really tell that this new restaurant is built on talent and a real passion for cooking. It is absolutely worth a trip to Hope St.",5.0
"It was quite the serendipitous Saturday. We found street parking in Williamsburg right when we drove in, watched one of our favorite street artists in action, and discovered the Manila Social Club for dinner.I'm surprised not more people have been to this cozy corner restaurant. I loved the attention to detail here, from how the staff swished the blood orange peels in the water decanters before pouring us a glass to the just off arrangement of books behind the bar. The restaurant doesn't have it's liquor license yet but the mocktails were amazing. They were crafted just the way I like my cocktails: where I don't taste the alcohol =] I hope they don't take them off the menu when they do receive their license.Things were already off to a good start and it just got better after my first bite into the lotus root chips. They were SO addictive I ate them all night. Everything else we ordered was spot on: the sliders, spam fries, lumpia, short ribs, and more lotus root chips. I could describe them but I think my posted pictures do a better job. Although for the short ribs, I dare say the puree was so good I think I liked it better than the accompanying meat, and I love meat. I recommend sharing to try more dishes and I only wish we could have tried more. But we will be back!Must trys: Calamansi mocktail, Lotus chips, Spam fries, Short rib with parsnip puree and the French toast dessert I can't remember the name of from my photo",5.0

"So this is my second review for Manila Social Club! I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. Its a cozy little restaurant  with very friendly, accommodating,  and social staff! Its a very welcoming feeling when i come to this restaurant.  Now to the food! Ive tried the longanesa burgers in the past, which were quite tasty. Ive had spam fries which are a perfect appetizer to hold you off untill your main course arrives. Also they are addicting! Ive tried the torta talong, which is also very delicious, BUTTTTTTT my all time favorite is their Duck Adobo, hands down! If heaven was edible, i would imagine that this is what it would taste like! The duck is tender, juicy and full of rich flavor! If you want something different and refreshing, then this is the place to come!",5.0
"My friends and I had dinner here this past Saturday. I was pretty indifferent because I had no idea what Filopino-French fusion food would entail. It's pure delicious-ness. We ordered the friend rice, spam fries, and the lumpia Shanghai rolls. All were delicious! If you're a salt fan, you will probably find these under-salted. However I thought it allowed me to appreciate the dipping sauces that came with the fries and lumpia. The lumpia were my favorites of the night, and I definitely plan on going back to have them again. The fried rice, while good, is something you can get a lot of places. So unless you particularly like it, I'd spend your money elsewhere (and don't add spam, it adds nothing to the rice.).As for the entrees our table ordered kare kare, the sea bass, and tocino on a stick. The absinthe rice that comes with the sea bass is interesting. The bass was also perfectly cooked. Short ribs aren't my thing, but the kare kare melted off the bone and had good flavor. The tocino was tender with a hint of sweetness that I enjoy in meat. It was also a lot of food! Plenty for an entree.Overall, the service was good. My only complaint is that they fill the water glasses half way. My water glass was almost constantly empty because of it. They serve water out of these little beakers, which cannot give water to an entire 4 person table. I don't get it. Since they don't have their liquor license yet, they should probably just buy larger water pitchers and fill up the glasses all the way.",4.0
"I absolutely loved this restaurant. The staff is incredibly gracious and friendly, and the food is delicious. The only downside is that there's no dessert with brunch :/ I highly recommend the duck dumplings. The garlic rice was good, but a but over cooked.

"Finally, a great super cute Filipino restaurant. Most good Filipino restaurants are a bit on the grungy side. Don't get me wrong tho. I don't mind a run down place with great food but for a change, its nice to have a pleAsant brunch without saying ""I know this place is a bit shady but the food is great"" when introducing them to this type of cuisine. Im so in Love with brunch spots but this place is unique to me since it has Filipino and French fusion. A bit on the salty side however that's Filipino food for you. Tocino is awesome. Garlic rice is refreshing and not so heavy and overpowered with garlic. Spam is salty but then again it is spam. The chef had said he tries to eliminate some salt when making the spam fries but again it's still spam. I grew up on it so I can't complain. Can't wait to try more of the menu. I was impressed on their transformation of ideas with good old Filipino food. Like ube butter and their fresh and flakey, complimentary croissant. The menu is a bit limited but I feel like that's what makes this place unique. My rule for Filipino food is if my mom makes it then there is no reason for me to eat it in a restaurant. They make the dishes look pretty too. As far as the decor, I felt like I was back in the Philippines having brunch at my grandparents place minus the beach  tho. However, place is super cute and cozy. Compared to other Filipino restaurants, I felt comfortable and boughie  with sitting by the wide Windows with my citrus infused water instead of sitting what looks like a lunch room cafeteria. Staff were very friendly, service was quick but then again my boyfriend and I was the first ones for brunch for the day. then around 1/2pm is when people started heading in and started getting busy. So in conclusion my first experience at this place was a great one. I deff recommend this place. The only reason why this place didn't get all 5 stars is because it was only my first time being there. I take consistency into consideration when giving my rating. I usually wait until I go to a place 3 times to try out more of the menu and service but I was very excited just to write about this place. Another factor was that they didn't have their liquor license yet but will be getting it soon. When that day comes, I will be sure to be back. And then maybe they can earn that 5th star. .",4.0

"The food was exceptional.We came to celebrate visiting parents from Florida on his retirement and birthday. We ordered the following:Lumpia- great crunchy spring rolls. Nothing to memorable but still a great appetizer. The sauces accompanied by the dish were what made the lumpia great. There was a spicy aioli sauce and a sweet sour duck sauce.Bistec- Even though we ordered it well done, it was still tender enough that it wasn't like chewing dry grass. Exceptionally flavorful. We would definite recommend getting this dish.Sea bass- Also another great dish, on the lighter side of flavors that help bring out the sea bass and highlight it. Miso tofu- flavored really well, since tofu has no actual flavor and just texture you can really mold this to any sauce your going to cook it with. The chef did an amazing job pairing it with his unique flavors.Everything was accompanied with garlic fried rice and went well with each dish. I may however not eat this with the tofu. (Every dish except the bistec came with rice, which we were not informed of when asking about the portion of garlic rice)So here is why Manila Social Club left such a sour taste in my mouth. I do not appreciate how front of house wait staff treated us. Now I've been to many restaurants far and wide in scale. Never have I been treated as if I do not belong especially here at social club when we are of the culture here!Waitress named Mary (tall Caucasian women) treated us so cold. She was exceptionally best at being dry and in fact sarcastic witty with us at the end. Repeatedly when she refilled our glasses everyone in our party politely said thank you, her response...NOTHING. She asked routinely of course how is the food we said everything was perfect and delicious, her response...NOTHING. We notified her that we were celebrating a birthday and after she places the check at our table, she sarcastically snarkily said: well obviously the dessert is on the house. Quiet frankly this use of language is totally unacceptable.We all do not pay for a good meal to have to sit and get it ruined by the wait staff. This is in no way shape or form discrediting the chef. But please Manila Social Club do something about your waitstaff it's obviously a problem. I will not return until she is removed from the equation.",1.0
"Quick Tip: Get the Lumpia Shanghai to startIt was Sunday. It was cold and rainy (I remember because my brother had on a cool new jacket!). We popped in for brunch to see what all the fuss was about. Very glad we did.First Impressions:The place is small without being cramped, and fortunately we got a table quickly. I know it shouldn't matter, but the staff was attractive. The decor was about right--they have a bunch of tropical plants that give it an authentic vanilla plantation feel.Service:Fast, friendly--no complaints. Actually the chef, Bjorn, came out and chatted for a second--he's a good sort. He makes his own cigars and holds court in a way that makes me think he might moonlight as a crime fighter.Food:* Lumpia Shanghai - These are small egg rolls, which--just as a concept--exceed their larger counterparts similarly to how smaller fries are better than steak/wedge fries. Their filling was exceptional and it came with the sweet chili dippin' sauce.* Spam Fries - Personally I can't get in a mental place where spam is gourmet, but I'll admit they tasted good, and some in my party were enthusiastic about them, I assume out of some sense of masochism.* Deep Fried French Toast - Typically I think this comes with some ice cream on it, but I had it as one of the day's specials which traded the ice cream for chicken wings. Wings were brined in something special which distinguished it in a pleasant way from the dish's already hot cousin, chicken and waffles.Drinks:I like to have at least three drinks with brunch--usually coffee, oj/mimosa, and water. I stuck to that formula except instead of oj I got a mocktail the name of which I can't recall--something with honey. I thought it would be 'whatevs', but ended up being one of the things I was most pleasantly surprised by. Apparently they are in the process of getting their liquor license--they aren't secretly mormon or something--they're just dealing with permits in a city where it's harder and harder to get folks to accept a good bribe.In conclusion, chef Bjorn's food takes me away from the chaos that exists in spelling conventions for terms related to the food's historical country of origin.",5.0
What an amazing brunch! The ambiance invoked the Philippines but with a Brooklyn modern overtone. We were immediately impressed by the Balthazar pastries served with UBE BUTTER. So good and we didn't even order yet! We started with the spam fries and Shanghai rolls with duck and longanisa. For our entrees we got tocino and the mango souflee with ube ice cream. Everything was really spectacular. We're Filipino and was impressed by how the flavors tasted both familiar and new. Plus the owners are super nice. Great job! We will be back for dinner and drinks...and dessert...and brunch...and every time their menu changes. We're fans!,5.0
"I wanted to love this place soooooooo bad.Filipino and French fusion?! Oooo La La - Gabi A. was intrigued with really high hopes.I came here for brunch and found myself in love with Manila Social Club.Heres the conversation that went on in my head:- Cute, quiet location with a beautiful garden outside? Check. - Beautiful, amazing, antiqued wood bar? Check.- Soft, sexy French music playing in the background? Check.- Really attractive hostess and waiter? Check.The food unfortunately is something to be desired. The food wasn't bad - seasoned well and cooked well it was just lacking in Filipino chutzpah. I am super particular with Filipino food because I love cooking the cuisine of the Philippines and was raised by a Filipina mother. Some technical flaws I found in the food. My date ordered the grilled mackerel and I had the torta talong (smoked eggplant omelette). The mackerel wasn't deboned making eating it such a struggle. Torta talong is a dish I love to make for brunch on the weekends but the smoking of the eggplant is SO important. It must be done over a low flame for at least 30-40 minutes. The torta talong I ordered was so bland I needed to add a shit ton of banana ketchup to make it somewhat edible. A simple fix would just have the eggplant smoked for a little bit longer. The garlic fried rice was strange. It was a weird yellow color (which I HOPE was colored by a little bit of saffron) was so off-putting to me. I did order the Filipino iced coffee which had coconut in it and it was bomb! Maybe I will give this place another chance and order something else off the menu.",3.0

She was exceptionally best at being dry and in fact sarcastic witty with us at the end. Repeatedly when she refilled our glasses everyone in our party politely said thank you, her response...NOTHING. She asked routinely of course how is the food we said everything was perfect and delicious, her response...NOTHING. We notified her that we were celebrating a birthday and after she places the check at our table, she sarcastically snarkily said: well obviously the dessert is on the house. Quiet frankly this use of language is totally unacceptable.We all do not pay for a good meal to have to sit and get it ruined by the wait staff. This is in no way shape or form discrediting the chef. But please Manila Social Club do something about your waitstaff it's obviously a problem. I will not return until she is removed from the equation.",1.0
"Quick Tip: Get the Lumpia Shanghai to startIt was Sunday. It was cold and rainy (I remember because my brother had on a cool new jacket!). We popped in for brunch to see what all the fuss was about. Very glad we did.First Impressions:The place is small without being cramped, and fortunately we got a table quickly. I know it shouldn't matter, but the staff was attractive. The decor was about right--they have a bunch of tropical plants that give it an authentic vanilla plantation feel.Service:Fast, friendly--no complaints. Actually the chef, Bjorn, came out and chatted for a second--he's a good sort. He makes his own cigars and holds court in a way that makes me think he might moonlight as a crime fighter.Food:* Lumpia Shanghai - These are small egg rolls, which--just as a concept--exceed their larger counterparts similarly to how smaller fries are better than steak/wedge fries. Their filling was exceptional and it came with the sweet chili dippin' sauce.* Spam Fries - Personally I can't get in a mental place where spam is gourmet, but I'll admit they tasted good, and some in my party were enthusiastic about them, I assume out of some sense of masochism.* Deep Fried French Toast - Typically I think this comes with some ice cream on it, but I had it as one of the day's specials which traded the ice cream for chicken wings. Wings were brined in something special which distinguished it in a pleasant way from the dish's already hot cousin, chicken and waffles.Drinks:I like to have at least three drinks with brunch--usually coffee, oj/mimosa, and water. I stuck to that formula except instead of oj I got a mocktail the name of which I can't recall--something with honey. I thought it would be 'whatevs', but ended up being one of the things I was most pleasantly surprised by. Apparently they are in the process of getting their liquor license--they aren't secretly mormon or something--they're just dealing with permits in a city where it's harder and harder to get folks to accept a good bribe.In conclusion, chef Bjorn's food takes me away from the chaos that exists in spelling conventions for terms related to the food's historical country of origin.",5.0
What an amazing brunch! The ambiance invoked the Philippines but with a Brooklyn modern overtone. We were immediately impressed by the Balthazar pastries served with UBE BUTTER. So good and we didn't even order yet! We started with the spam fries and Shanghai rolls with duck and longanisa. For our entrees we got tocino and the mango souflee with ube ice cream. Everything was really spectacular. We're Filipino and was impressed by how the flavors tasted both familiar and new. Plus the owners are super nice. Great job! We will be back for dinner and drinks...and dessert...and brunch...and every time their menu changes. We're fans!,5.0
"I wanted to love this place soooooooo bad.Filipino and French fusion?! Oooo La La - Gabi A. was intrigued with really high hopes.I came here for brunch and found myself in love with Manila Social Club.Heres the conversation that went on in my head:- Cute, quiet location with a beautiful garden outside? Check. - Beautiful, amazing, antiqued wood bar? Check.- Soft, sexy French music playing in the background? Check.- Really attractive hostess and waiter? Check.The food unfortunately is something to be desired. The food wasn't bad - seasoned well and cooked well it was just lacking in Filipino chutzpah. I am super particular with Filipino food because I love cooking the cuisine of the Philippines and was raised by a Filipina mother. Some technical flaws I found in the food. My date ordered the grilled mackerel and I had the torta talong (smoked eggplant omelette). The mackerel wasn't deboned making eating it such a struggle. Torta talong is a dish I love to make for brunch on the weekends but the smoking of the eggplant is SO important. It must be done over a low flame for at least 30-40 minutes. The torta talong I ordered was so bland I needed to add a shit ton of banana ketchup to make it somewhat edible. A simple fix would just have the eggplant smoked for a little bit longer. The garlic fried rice was strange. It was a weird yellow color (which I HOPE was colored by a little bit of saffron) was so off-putting to me. I did order the Filipino iced coffee which had coconut in it and it was bomb! Maybe I will give this place another chance and order something else off the menu.",3.0

"Holy cow. Manila Social Club is my new favorite in the neighborhood - amazing staff, great and unique dishes, and thoughtful attention to detail throughout.I ordered the coconut cooler mocktail which was unlike anything I've ever had - kind of like a really tropical egg cream - highly recommended. For dinner, I had the surf and turf which is a novel combination of sashimi and pork belly. Both share similarities in terms of textures and richness, yet provide a fun contrast to one another.Service was very attentive though we did have to wait a bit longer than expected for the meals to arrive. However, the pleasant environment and complimentary lotus root and mango salsa snack kept my friend and I occupied.",5.0

Nice cute place with great food presentation but most of the plates were extremely salty. Staff is very friendly but I would suggest them to tone down on the salt. Definitely not woodside queens type of Filipino food but since it's fusion it definitely fits the willy b hipster model.,3.0
"They currently don't have a liquor license and was not BYOB when I went (about a week ago). They did have a nice menu of mocktails though. The space is a decent size nyc/bk restaurant and decorated super cute. The food:Spam Fries: These were interesting. We obviously had to order them be cause of the cute presentation but I don't think I would order them again. They were extremely salty- kind of like a fried salty hotdog. Totally one of those things you order just because its something unique that you cant find anywhere else.Steamed buns: It wasn't bad. The meat was seasoned well and the actual bun melted in your mouth. I felt like the meat could have been a little more tender Tomato Tartare: Great concept. It could have had a little more flavor. Sea Bass: This was really great. The sea bass was the perfect texture and i loved the sauce it was under along with the rice.Garlic Fried Rice: This was amazing combined with their hot sauce, which was actually spicy!Bread pudding: I think this was a special that night. It was definitely the best part of the meal and I'm not even a dessert person. Not too sweet. Perfect texture. I would probably try this place again in a few months when they get their liquor license and fine tune some of the menu items.",3.0
"Was walking down Roebling, famished at 5pm on a Saturday, on the way to a different restaurant when I noticed Manila Social. My first reaction was feeling pleasantly surprised that the restaurant that replaced Miller's Tavern was a fancyish Filipino restaurant, and not another BK farm-to-table. My second thought was that being such a short walk away from Cubana Social, maybe I would have chosen a different name.  The menu looked good so I decided to change plans and try it out.The restaurant was empty, but not a lot of people eat at 5, and I soon discovered they don't have a liquor license yet.  This was a bummer, but I was so hungry I didn't really care.My wife and I ordered the steamed pork buns, 2 orders of the duck adobo, the garlic fried rice, and the roots and shoots salad.  It was a bit excessive.They brought us some lotus chips first with a mango salsa.  The chips are light and well-salted, and the salsa was simple, fresh and tasty.  Next came the 3 pork buns, which were good, although I wouldn't say they're a must have.  The duck adobo, however, was crazy good.  The pan roasted duck was perfectly cooked, the adobo sauce was yummy, the confit croquette as well, and the mushrooms were packed with flavor.  The garlic fried rice was also perfectly cooked, not greasy, and huge.  Very good flavor, could have used a tiny bit more salt, but better under salted than over salted. The sprout salad was very fresh, although it was basically just the sprouts with the long slices of radish, couldn't taste the calamansi vinaigrette (although, again, I prefer under dressed to over dressed).Service was great- attentive and friendly.In sum- a truly delightful first experience at Manila Social.  I found the price/quality/quantity ratio to be very good.  I am excited to come back and try more dishes.",5.0

"After three attempts, we were finally able to taste the yumminess of Manila social. To be honest I was on the bridge of giving up and had very high expectation from them.

The customer service is amazing, seriously, especially mike who was super patient with us and made eating there possible. Thank you!!! They give you bread and Ube butter, the Ube butter is amazing!! Not a speck left on our dish. Also go for the cold Ube latte, my favorite. Spam fries and mango Ube soufflé pancakes hit the spot. The lines are massively long for brunch and if you get there when they open at 10, most of the time they are already full for the day. So go earlier or make reservations.

The other sauce was a mildly spicy and creamy (maybe a mayo or aioli?) that was delicious.As my entree I had the Biscuits and Gravy. The menu says its the 'absolute best', its GOOD and definitely different than a traditional southern style, but definitely not the best. The gravy is a creamy meat based gravy. Sweet with a hint of savory notes. Mixed with a sausage, buttery biscuit, and over easy egg, the gravy becomes a great compliment.

"I make it a policy not to review brunch.  Does it really matter how a restaurant handles eggs, potatoes, toast and coffee?  But my god, was this meal delicious.  I had the days special, which was a crab omelette.  Without exaggeration, it was this years best restaurant  meal so far.  Lots of lump crab, perfect thin omelette shell, a beautiful herbed and lemony hollandaise, with the magical Filipino touches that made the dish sing: fried shallots? A touch of coconut milk?  Not sure, but perfectly balanced mix of flavors and textures that took the dish to another level.  I'm being hardass for not giving that 5th star.   The meal was so good that I think I'm rating them on a higher curve.  The lost star is because 1) if the special wasn't offered, there wasn't much that sounded appealing to me and 2) not sure how I feel about rice as a breakfast starch accompaniment.  But after the omelette I feel totally comfortable in  seeing what the kitchen does with what might not on paper  sound like my ideal breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I'm curious if they are this confident and successful with everything that comes out of the kitchen.  Hoping I can quickly confirm 5 stars.",4.0

"I love the tropical vibes at Manila Social Club, I don't know how they keep orchids looking so beautiful. Dinner was fantastic and I returned for brunch another day for an equally great experience. The duck adobo was delicious and the plating was artful without being over the top. Great portion sizes too, I did not leave hungry! At brunch, I discovered the Filipino purple yam Ube. Had no idea you could make it into ice cream, butter, sauces, but it was awesome. We got the mango soufflé pancake after hearing the rave reviews and it exceeded expectations. The torta talong omelet with the chef's signature hot sauce was also very good.I follow them on instagram and was lucky enough to snag a seat at a chef's table dinner. Just 10 seats were available and they close down the restaurant for this private event. Meeting the small, dedicated staff was an endearing and entertaining experience. It was also very cool to meet the other diners who were at the dinner. Great place, highly recommended. Ideal for brunch with friends and date nights. Will be returning for The Golden Donut- made with real gold and Cristal Champagne. YES.",5.0

"My wife and I went there for brunch today. We ordered roasted veggies paella, lumpiang shanghai, longaniza hash and the filipino(buco juice with espresso). We had a pair of croissants with purple yam for complimentary appetizers. Thanks!The place was cozy but not well insulated. I know it was cold outside and I expected the inside would be toasty to enjoy my food and stay. I did not feel we were welcomed in a way, considering we wanted to check out the place since we take pride in places catering to us, Filipinos. Maybe they did not know that or they don't care. Anyway,the waitress waited on us like the weather today...cold. The guy who was also there managed to have a one or two words of exchange with 5 tables of large company,except us. Food was nothing special except for how it was plated.The Filipino drink tasted more of the espresso and no hint of coconut juice,which by the way,came from a  regular carton one could get from a local grocery. I mean shouldn't those drinks be mixed discreetly to leave customers clueless of how they are made? I maybe very blunt, but this was our experience.  Btw, maybe a word of ""thanks"" on our way out from any of the hosts can do so much.  This is one of those places one would try just to get a feel and not come for a 2nd round.  Jeepney on 2nd street is way better!",2.0
"This place just replaced millers on hope st, and what an improvement. It still has the same wonderful feel, but the food is leagues better. Their brunch is fantastic.

"Relaxed ambiance (busy but not packed), friendly service, and delicious food. Started with their biscuits with Ube-butter and blueberry jam (served to everyone). We had the mackerel w/eggs and eggplant omelette, both excellent. Highly recommend this place, will definitely go back.",5.0
"The food at Manila Social is some of the best I've had in Brooklyn, or anywhere for that matter. The Club Burger (longanisa and duck patty) was delicious, as were the Steamed Buns. The complimentary lotus crisps and mango salsa were a great start. And even though they don't yet have a liquor license, the mocktails were perfect for a warm summer day. The staff were very pleasant.  I'll go back again.",5.0
"Absolutely amazing restaurant!! Total gem. Their food is the perfect blend of flavors. We had the brunch and the Phillipino French toast is the best ""French"" toast I have ever eaten. It is crunchy yet moist inside with a star fruit jam that is sweet and tangy. I also ordered the eggs with whole grilled mackerel which was excellent. The fish was flavorful and flaky- perfect! The cozy interior is warm, inviting and contemporary. The cappuccino is bold and smooth. The staff was very kind and let us sit long after our meal and did not make us feel rushed. I will absolutely come back again. Next time I will try the pancake.",5.0
"I make it a policy not to review brunch.  Does it really matter how a restaurant handles eggs, potatoes, toast and coffee?  But my god, was this meal delicious.  I had the days special, which was a crab omelette.  Without exaggeration, it was this years best restaurant  meal so far.  Lots of lump crab, perfect thin omelette shell, a beautiful herbed and lemony hollandaise, with the magical Filipino touches that made the dish sing: fried shallots? A touch of coconut milk?  Not sure, but perfectly balanced mix of flavors and textures that took the dish to another level.  I'm being hardass for not giving that 5th star.   The meal was so good that I think I'm rating them on a higher curve.  The lost star is because 1) if the special wasn't offered, there wasn't much that sounded appealing to me and 2) not sure how I feel about rice as a breakfast starch accompaniment.  But after the omelette I feel totally comfortable in  seeing what the kitchen does with what might not on paper  sound like my ideal breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I'm curious if they are this confident and successful with everything that comes out of the kitchen.  Hoping I can quickly confirm 5 stars.",4.0

"I love the tropical vibes at Manila Social Club, I don't know how they keep orchids looking so beautiful. Dinner was fantastic and I returned for brunch another day for an equally great experience. The duck adobo was delicious and the plating was artful without being over the top. Great portion sizes too, I did not leave hungry! At brunch, I discovered the Filipino purple yam Ube. Had no idea you could make it into ice cream, butter, sauces, but it was awesome. We got the mango soufflé pancake after hearing the rave reviews and it exceeded expectations. The torta talong omelet with the chef's signature hot sauce was also very good.I follow them on instagram and was lucky enough to snag a seat at a chef's table dinner. Just 10 seats were available and they close down the restaurant for this private event. Meeting the small, dedicated staff was an endearing and entertaining experience. It was also very cool to meet the other diners who were at the dinner. Great place, highly recommended. Ideal for brunch with friends and date nights. Will be returning for The Golden Donut- made with real gold and Cristal Champagne. YES.",5.0

"My wife and I went there for brunch today. We ordered roasted veggies paella, lumpiang shanghai, longaniza hash and the filipino(buco juice with espresso). We had a pair of croissants with purple yam for complimentary appetizers. Thanks!The place was cozy but not well insulated. I know it was cold outside and I expected the inside would be toasty to enjoy my food and stay. I did not feel we were welcomed in a way, considering we wanted to check out the place since we take pride in places catering to us, Filipinos. Maybe they did not know that or they don't care. Anyway,the waitress waited on us like the weather today...cold. The guy who was also there managed to have a one or two words of exchange with 5 tables of large company,except us. Food was nothing special except for how it was plated.The Filipino drink tasted more of the espresso and no hint of coconut juice,which by the way,came from a  regular carton one could get from a local grocery. I mean shouldn't those drinks be mixed discreetly to leave customers clueless of how they are made? I maybe very blunt, but this was our experience.  Btw, maybe a word of ""thanks"" on our way out from any of the hosts can do so much.  This is one of those places one would try just to get a feel and not come for a 2nd round.  Jeepney on 2nd street is way better!",2.0
"This place just replaced millers on hope st, and what an improvement. It still has the same wonderful feel, but the food is leagues better. Their brunch is fantastic. Arguably the best French toast (it's fried and crusted, yum) or biscuits and gravy (made with a rue that makes the gravy brown) I've ever had. Fantastic service all around. Highly recommended!",5.0

"What a pleasant surprise to me and my 3 gourmet buddies. We ate dinner here last Wednesday - the food was delicious, the setting is elegant, and the service is attentive. Though it's off the main thoroughfare, it's definitely worth the trip to Williamsburg. We will definitely return. The negative - no liquor license. Coming soon I hear. I would recommend the mock cocktails anyway. Inventive concoctions and fun presentation. Have it with the spam fries, salty crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and with the free lotus chips accompanied by mango salsa. As others have said, and I would agree, the duck adobo is full of rich unctuousness. Also try the Tomato Tartare for light, tomatoey goodness. The surf and turf was tuna sushi paired with richly browned pork belly - a smart contrast. Garlic fried rice is a welcome accompaniment to all these main courses. My friends and I were stuffed but we wanted to try one of the desserts. We ordered Trio of Ice Creams and when it arrived, it looked like a halo-halo (a traditional Filipino dessert) - pretty layers of delicious ice cream scoops, purple yam, mango, young coconut and coconut strings.  Kudos to Bjorn the chef.",5.0
