I'm the type of person who always says they are going to write a review but then never does. Except for now. I came here with a date and we were both hungry. So we ordered The brussels sprouts appetizer and also the burrata appetizer. The Brussels sprouts were delicious although it was a small portion. And the burrata...oh my goodness. It was one of the best appetizers Ive ever had. My date thought the same. So well seasoned. We both said that we would order a burrata appetizer for each of us next time. We also ordered the mushroom pizza. Also sooo delicious. Thin crust heaven.  Very light. I could've probably eaten the whole thing by myself...if I was at home..with no one watching. Can't wait to return!,5.0
"One word: SALTY!I would really give this place about a 3.5. I came here yesterday with my boyfriend, who lives in the neighborhood. We were excited that there is a new, hip place in the area and headed here when it opened (promptly) at 5:30pm. From when it opens until 7pm, the happy hour is going on - for draft beer it was $2 off, which is great! They had about 5 draft beers on the menu and about the same number in can/bottle. Excellent.Eventually we ordered the brussells sprouts and the olive pizza. The brussells sprouts were $8, and you get a VERY small amount for it. It tasted delicious, but there were probably about 4 sprouts cut in half in this portion. FOR EIGHT DOLLARS! I would say its not worth more than $6. They need to add WAY more sprouts to this dish, or lower the price. It was salty but manageable.Then came the olive pizza which also had cheese, kale and onions. From the first bite it was salty, but as you continued through it became almost unbearable. I like salty foods but this was ridiculous. I'm not sure where the extreme saltiness even came from - sure, olives are salty, but not this much! I can't get over how salty it was. Later that night after we left, both my bf and I felt sick and we think it was from the salt. BlechThe bartenders were nice, and we stayed there for about four hours and the place attracted many different people. By the time we left, it was filling up in the back. We will definitely be back for beers; if you are a cocktail drinker, the $$$ will add up here quickly. We may try one more pizza, the plain mozzerrella one just to see if its less salty. My other complaint would be the hours. They are closed Mondays but every other day they open at 5:30pm. Which during the week is fine, but shouldn't it be open more/earlier during the weekends? Especially with the warmer weather coming up.Ultimately beware of the salt lick you will experience by eating here. However lets keep visiting it so it stays open, and they have a chance to work on their menu.",4.0
"Decided to try this place for takeout one night. The staff was friendly and polite... From the person who took my phone order to the security guy seated at the door to the hostess who escorted me to the back of the bar to pick up my order. However... My lamb sausage pizza was subpar. The crust was too soft and the lamb sausage was too salty. I let a friend try it to get a second opinion and he wasn't enthused either. The best part of the pizza were the caramelized onions.  Maybe I'll return to try another pie, maybe I won't... *kanye shrug*",2.0
"Came here for a cast party and had a great time.There's a guy at the door welcoming you as you enter and really went the extra mile by coming over to small talk and make you  feel comfortable. We ordered a pepperoni pizza which was only $12. It was thin and tasty, but don't expect a huge pie ! (Big enough for two people to share )The barista's were happy to adjust their orders to what you wanted also. Parkside has great customer service!Parkside also has great music taste and add a suitable volume where you're not screaming to the person next to you.  The bar it is dimly in a good way    And has plenty of seating . Overall I would come back and I recommend others to try this bar. :) Get yo draaaaank on.",5.0
"Seriously love this place!It was my first, and definitely not my last time coming here, last night. It's been bookmarked for months and I finally got a chance to come here. It's hard to get parking nearby if you are driving and if you do, it's pretty tight, so beware. It is very easy to get to as there is a bus stop (B41) right next to the establishment.  I met up with my good friend to have a drink and some good food in our neck of the woods. The ambiance and lighting are wonderful. Kind of out of place for the neighborhood lol, but nonetheless, needed and a nice addition. You can tell the neighborhood is right in the thick of the gentrification process.We sat at the bar which has a lovely selection of cocktails and knowledgeable and friendly bartenders, who we were greeted by upon entering. There is a ""guard"" standing inside by the entrance to help weed out those that are not welcome. (Two homeless people tried to get in and ask patrons for money, which was quite uncomfortable but not really the restaurant's fault) They do their best to make sure it does not escalate. Even with all that, this place is a gem. Let me get into the food.My friend and I both ordered pizzas. They are oven style and large! The size of the pizzas when they came out really intimidated us and we thought we could have and should have ordered 1 to share, but half-way through our dishes, we realized the pizzas have a very thin crust so even someone as tiny as me can eat the whole thing in one sitting, which I did ;)I ordered the Mussels Pizza and my friend ordered the Mozzarella. Both were FREAKING DELICIOUS!! We pretty much wolfed them down. The mussels were perfectly cooked and every ingredient on the pizza was fresh and flavorful. You could taste every ingredient! Really awesome stuff. They have other items on their menu that do not include pizza, which is great. I will be coming back to try out some of their other dishes. For drinks, my friend had the Williams Colliins and I had the Good Vibrations. Each was $12 and tasted pretty good. I do wish they had a happy hour time slot though :( Would have been even better to have discounted drinks :)We had a great time talking the night away with the ambiance, lighting, excellent food, and great drinks. This place really is a gem! I cannot wait to come back. Really satisfied and highly recommend Parkside.",5.0
"The pizza is cool the trendy Euro-Italian version in this case with a bit too much sauce, the dim light is nice, the furniture a bit bulky maybe easier to clean, the plain wall maybe because it is new, the music.......ouch. Elton John's ""I guess That's Why They Call it the Blues"" was just one of the many out of place choices that reminded of bad radio in bum-f.ck Connecticut.",3.0
"Short Review - the ambience is nice and rustic. The staff is very attentive and friendly. The pizzas were amazing (Get the Lamb Sausage), didn't really care for the drinks. Definitely a great spot and I will be back again.Long Review -  Me and my girlfriend came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm. It was about half full, so we were seated right away. I didn't see if they had more seating in the back, but there were about 30 seats that I saw, including the bar. So the restaurant might be on the smaller side, I'll check to see if there is more seating next time I go. I really like the decor, the parties are seated kind of close together, but still feels very intimate at the same time. For drinks, I had the Jungle Bird, which was supposed to have pineapple, lime, Campari and rum, but I got all Campari (which is pretty bitter). My Girlfriend got the Fancy Free (which was mostly bourbon, so that was a win for her lol) I would try some of the other drinks to see how they come out.I do wish the menu had more option like some of the other pizza places I've been to, but the pizzas we ended up ordering both tasted amazing. I ordered the Lamb Sausage, my girlfriend ordered the Mussels. The dough is on the lighter side, really thin with a really nice crispness too it. All the ingredients on both pizzas melded together really well. Overall an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend this place.",4.0
"Pizza is tongue satisfying. Artisan if you will. You could eat a whole one to yourself and be satisfied. Pepperoni was very good. Lamb more satiating, cheesier. Both very distinct.Ambience is cool!Food service unbearably slow. Several tables in the same predicament. Don't waste your night sitting, waiting 40 minutes for your order to come out. They need to move faster. Not sure we'd come back due to the slow food service.",3.0

"Yes! As a resident of PLG I am ecstatic about this place. We are in desperate need of bars and restaurants and this is a great addition. The pizza is out of this world!! I dare say it's even better than Barboncino in Crown Heights, my previous favorite pizza close to my house. Ive had the mushroom pizza and it was amazing, very flavorful, made with great ingredients with care and purpose. The wait staff is well trained and attentive, the drinks are good. The prices are a bit high. $14 for mushroom pizza, but it's well worth it. The house wine is pretty good too! They need to work a little on decor and fill the empty peach colored walls with some art, but other than that this place is great!",5.0
"Good pizza - had the mushroom and it had a nice depth with the shredded cheese on top - a musty flavor if that makes sense. The sauce was nice too, a little tangy but still good. And perfect crust, although a little thin on the center of the pizza, almost to the point of the mushrooms coming through the dough. Good flavor on the mushrooms, which were I believe porcini? The temperature was a little too cold for my taste - I like pipping hot pizzas so I can smell the aroma before digging in. Good vibe - simple spot - we sat at the bar and had a Koelsch beer. A little pricey but that's where the neighborhood is going.",4.0

"An unexpected and surprising addition to Prospect Lefferts Gardens. (PLG) Prior to Parkside, there were three ""italian"" restaurants in the immediate community. All three were similar in atmosphere, single slice pizza and a borderline fast food experience, a needed niche. Parkside breaks through and provides a unique Italian dining experience to PLG. The stylish interior is complimented with low lighting and a clean display of food and drink options. The menu offers a perfect selection of food without being overwhelming. My girlfriend and I enjoyed two sides, as a starter: -Meatballs and -Brussel Sprouts. Both arrived in clean white dish-ware. The Brussel Sprouts were delicious but the meatball was phenomenal. For our entrée we split their -Pepperoni Pizza. The pizza was fresh and incredibly flavorful. Left us both very full. We will certainly be back for more.",5.0

Crust was crispy, ingredients were fresh, and the pizza was tasty. Overall, a very good experience.",4.0
"Good healthy/clean pizza for a $12 potato pizza.  it was salty in a good way and wasn't drowning in tomato sauce like other pizza.  We also ordered the brussels sprout that came with a very good white sauce/puree.  It's a good local place, but they only have pizza and appetizers.  They will need to make a few more dish if you want to come back here all the time.",4.0
"Wood/brick oven pizza combined with craft cocktails, what more could you ask for!!! To start we had the crostini which in my opinion was the best I've ever had. The ricotta cheese with olive oil and sea salt made it really stand out and was a great addition to the fresh bread. For pizzas we had a traditional mozzarella, and the lamb sausage which was great.Now onto the cocktails. I recommend the junglebird and the conjugal visit. The jungle bird reminded me of a spiced punch and the conjugal visit had great flavors of honey,strawberry and Coconut. The staff were very friendly and the whole place just had a great relaxed vibe.

"Nice new addition to the neighborhood. Was excited about this place opening as we need more restaurants in the PLG area. Durning my second visit, we decided to have pizza. The lamb sausage pizza is good, however the pepperoni is not. It's bland and compares most to a Little Johns pizza if you will. Disappointing but it is just pizza, right? The pizzeria across the street makes a much better pepperoni slice. This place serves ""specialty"" cocktails which means small off the wall cocktails for $12.00, but they don't pack a punch and lacks vodka which I find odd. I think this place has potential but needs to find its comfort zone. They need to have a better wine selection and maybe introduce more veggies and a salad or two ! Secondly, a better DIVERSE playlist would be appreciated considering the neighborhood surrounding is predominantly West Indian and is pretty mixed.  I frequent the few restaurants/bars in the neighborhood and Parkside will be my third go to for now. I wish them luck in finding their footing.",3.0

Also, this is a place that always changes and expands the menu! Specials sometimes get added to the permanent repertoire depending on how awesome they are (like the bresaola pizza--with a light sprinking of fresh horseradish!). I always try to order a special when i can, because i am often pleasantly surprised. Also, i've learned a new appreciation for the Reverent cocktail after speaking with the excellent knowledgeable bartender--I'm no abstinthe fan, but it turns out an absinthe rinse is just the touch of unusual tastiness your cocktail needs.

"So happy to see this kind of a place in PLG. The pizzas are really lovely but the cocktails are where it's at. Also, the atmosphere is just perfect. So chill and welcoming... I hope Parkside is starting a trend in PLG!",5.0
"So great! Draft beer, which is what I care about, with a good selection (I had olde Saratoga lager, several times), but clearly they make a fine cocktail, judging by the discerning folks around. Also excellent food! We had the mushroom pizza and endive salad. The pizza has a perfect crust - thin crispy but miraculously also chewy - and the salad with fig vinaigrette was perfectly dressed - not overwhelmed or soupy, just lightly coated. Finally, and most awesomely, the crowd here looks and feels like this brilliant neighborhood.",5.0
Eat in. Don't dare call in for a pick-up. I ordered a pizza at 5:30p and didn't get it for nearly an hour. All I could do is stand around the restaurant,3.0
"I can see people is giving this place praises on the count that it's something new in the neighborhood. I been living in this neighborhood forever. So let me just say this to the people that are imports just because a place is new and sell speciality drinks, doesn't make it a great place to eat. I came here on whim, I was really hungry and didn't feel like Peppa's (the best jerk chicken in the world) So I said let me give this place a shot it was indeed very crowded. I just wanted to order a pizza to go. I order the lamb pizza. Wow let me tell you I was waiting for ever it was so bad that three people had to come to me and ask did you order which I did. The wait time for my lamb pizza was way too long. I wanted to leave but I was so hungry. The guy that I made the order request to originally didn't even come and check and see if my order was ready. The bartender's had to do it. The sell pizza here, I can go to DiFara's for that. Won't step foot in here.",3.0
"Nice place in the area, like the atmosphere. Pizza just ok",3.0
"This place is great! It's got a good ambiance, upscale-bar vibe with mid-scale prices, and it's relaxed. The bartenders are nice. The music is pleasant, kind of jazzy and not too loud, which makes this an ideal place for a good conversation with a friend. I get so irritated with bars when I go in and I can't even hear myself think. The pizza is frickin' delicious, thin and crispy -- and the cocktails are great. The prices might be a little ambitious for PLG (or maybe not anymore?), but as an nice Friday night treat, this place does it right.",5.0
"We went there for a birthday party last night & at first, the place was super hot (yes, temperature wise) but as I said something, they actually did something about it(!! so rare in NYC, I feel like, to actually get your voice heard). The place has a really nice vibe & the staff was amazing!! Our large group loved their draft beer & cocktails. The was nice, attentive but not pushy. The place looks warm, inviting & classy. Just keep the temperature comfortable, guys! My husband has lived in this 'no longer so hidden' gem of a neighborhood for 20 years, and I have been here 6 years - Parkside is a very welcome addition to our bar & food scene! Welcome to the neighborhood, Parkside!",5.0
