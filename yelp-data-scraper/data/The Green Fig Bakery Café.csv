"I love this place.  I live nearby and had walked by several times a week, each time telling myself that I would check it out.  When I finally did, I couldn't believe it had taken me so long!  They have great made to order breakfast sandwiches.  They use real bacon, which is worth like a thousand bonus points in my book.  The sandwiches are about the same price as any regular deli, but are so much better.  I also love the almond sponge cake.  Sweet, but not too rich or heavy.  The cafe itself is cute.  Dim lighting and colorful decor, including paintings from a local artist (who also works there).  The food elevator to the second floor is a nice touch.",5.0
"My first sip of Green Fig's soy latte with nocciola (hazelnut) and I fell in LOVE! Wow so good so delicious and not too sweet! The workers here are so friendly and the atmosphere makes for a perfect way to start off your morning. They have lots of baked goods, sandwiches, and lots of different coffee options to choose from! For your sandwich, they have glazed/not glazed croissants and a variety of bagels as well. They offer breakfast sandwiches and I got the ham cheese and egg on a not glazed croissant. It was delicious. Their cups and plates are so cute too! Seating is fairly limited, there's three tables that fit two people and also some seating upstairs. I loved both my sandwich and the coffee. For both it was $10. I would definitely come back and get that soy latte again....",5.0
"Swung by with friends on a Saturday after checking out the Brooklyn Flea Market. Really cool little spot with an upstairs seating area. Dumbwaiter delivers your drinks up to the second floor, pretty neat! Got coffees and teas on this particular trip but the food looked and smelled amazing. Highly recommended!",5.0
"Nicest people on earth, with good food. Give it a try! Plus you should ask for their breakfast special. If you're going to complain about the prices, remember that the food is very fresh and organic.",5.0
"Love this hidden gem, definitely what Sunset Park needed. Two levels so plenty of seating. Service wasn't super quick, but luckily I had some time to kill. Extremely cozy upstairs! They have a pull down screen and projector I assume for movie nights and a dumb waiter that brings your food up and downTried the Rosso balsamic glaze salad with mozzarella. Nothing too spectacular but I'm willing to give this place another try because I've heard good things about their sandwiches. A little more pricey then other eateries in the area.",3.0
"3.5 stars. I came in to grab some bagels and coffee one morning as I was running errands. It was dimly lit and a couple of guys working behind the counter. I found this place via Yelp and unfortunately I didn't get to sit in and take advantage of the nice cafe environment. However, I did grab an everything bagel with lox and cream cheese, plain bagel with cream cheese and an iced coffee. I thought the everything bagel was pretty good, but the lox was just ok, good amount of cream cheese though. The iced coffee was pretty good as well, no complaints there. The prices here are pretty reasonable for what they serve, pricier for the neighborhood though. It's always nice when there is a place to grab a good bagel, coffee or sandwich and there aren't a lot of those around this area. I wouldn't mind coming back to try a sandwich for lunch next time!",3.0
"Adorable, cozy spot, very much a neighborhood kind of place. They were playing Finding Nemo on the screen upstairs all day long, which I found sweet and savvy (for parents of young children, anyway).Very reasonable prices and welcoming service. Coffee and bagels were great, although the famed chocolate cigar is so oversized I can't imagine ordering it unless you arrive with an entourage.I do wish they'd label the bakery items. No one wants to stand there and ask, ""What is that? And what is that?"" for 10 minutes.",4.0
"This is truly a great cafe! I always pass by walking to the N train, and finally decided to check it out. The vibe is very hipster, and the layout of the restaurant is very nice. They have seating on the first and second floor, but I would recommend sitting upstairs to experience your order being sent up by a mini elevator. They have sandwiches, wraps, very unique coffee/tea drinks, and an amazing assortment of desserts! I had the R train sandwich which was superb. I guess they're known for their balsamic vinegar reduction sauce in their sandwiches, and it was definitely savory. Additionally, I really liked that they use fresh mozzarella in their sandwiches. For dessert I had the rainbow pastry. It was tasty and went well with a cup of coffee. The pastry was great because it wasn't overly sweet, which sometimes is a problem for me when it comes to desserts. I will definitely be coming back!",5.0
"So this is another example of one of those places that I've walked by hundreds of times but never went in until last week. One of my coworkers lives down the block from this bakery and she spoke very highly of it so I decided to give it a try. I walked in around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon. I was greeted fairly promptly and asked if I needed any assistance. I went in looking particularly for cookies for an after dinner treat. They had a huge showcase display filled with a variety of cookies. There were also small packages of macaroons in the counter, pumpkin bread, and prepackaged assortments of cookies. I decided to go with an assortment from the display since I saw the prepackaged cookies after the girl started working on my order. Nonetheless the cookies I purchased were awesome and the service was friendly. I'll definitely return for more sweets but next time I also want to try one of their sandwiches and maybe some coffee.",4.0
"Oh I love this little place. Whenever I'm in NYC, I stay in Sunset Park - so this little cafe is perfect. Whenever I don't want to go to Manhattan or the library but want to work outside from my room - this is the place to go. Yes, the internet could be faster, but hey that is a small thing to complain about. The bagels are delicious, they have a wide array of reasonably priced tea (you can have all of them either hot or iced) and a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. I would say though that the sandwiches are on the pricier side for the area. It's hard to find a place with such a nice, calm atmosphere though in the area, that's why it's worth it for me.",4.0

"My buddy and his family live in the neighborhood.  He (and his 1 y.o.) daughter frequent the Green Fig.  When considering vegetarian lunch options he suggested here saying the sandwiches were excellent.  Skeptical but hopeful, I accompanied him.  A warm, friendly vibe and comfortable seating upstairs.   But enough of this - how about the IMPORTANT stuff - I ordered a grilled vegetable and mozzarella sandwich.  My buddy indicated that I might not be able to finish it ... the portions were that generous.  He was right.  More importantly it was probably the BEST vegetarian sandwich I've ever met.  The sandwich arrived warm and redolent with an array of grilled vegetables, thick slices of what appeared to be fresh mozzarella and a delicious balsamic jam, all filling an excellent crusty roll that was sliced in half (absolutely necessary - as I said this a GENEROUS serving).  I kept thinking to myself, THIS is what I alway want when I order a vegetarian sandwich, but up until now, never got.   And yes, the baked sweets all looked tantalizing but I refrained.The sandwich was about $8.50 ... and worth every penny.  I was a most happy camper ... obviously.",5.0

Best Coffee Around!!! We stayed the night in Brooklyn and went to the Green Fig twice. We then went to stay in Manhattan and haven't been able to find anything that can compare. We had black coffee with vanilla flavor and cream. So simple but life changing. The macaroons were amazing. The chocolate cigar was beyond delicious. Highly recommend you stop by if your in town.

Usually that's pretty nice, but it also seems to be the only thing the employees actually want to do - talk to their friends. And their friends are LOUD.

"This place has gone downhill so much so that I almost never go in anymore given the constant changing ownership, staff changes and the decreasing feeling of a local neighborhood business with any kind of personality. The only redeeming qualities are the prosciutto bagels which always sell out before 10 AM because they only order five a day and every day one guy comes and buys three of them. The bridge stay sailor pretty much disgusting and the sandwiches are grossly overpriced as are the baked goods. The chai latte is nothing special and I've heard from coffee drinkers that the coffee is pretty awful. I do go here in the summer months more often to get a peach iced tea which is rather nice, but again with the changes in ownership and consequently personnel, I felt the need to update my previous review with a feeling that this place doesn't have an identity and is not very friendly in general, at least not when it opened up 4 years ago.

I chose a croissant and it was buttery soft and flaky. I have to make my way to trying more things on their menu, as they do offer sandwiches and other lunch items but I'm rarely on this block and it's easy to forget it's here if you don't travel on 36th street often.

"I love when a place goes out of its way to cater to us vegans.  Very much appreciated.  So the first time I ate here I got some grilled veggie sandwich with Balsamic vinegar and vegan cheese.  I casually inquired about the cheese and was shown a package of Rice Cheese.  I guess they finally made rice cheese vegan but as I checked the package there it was, first ingredient, casein.  Now this normally pisses me off but reigning in my ire I showed the chef the offending ingredient and then showed the manager.  Both vowed that the cheese was vegan and needed a bit of education to convince them.  Then they told me they got a different cheese in the order and weren't aware it wasn't vegan.  OOOOOkkkkkkkay.  The sandwich was delicious, crusty bread with a moist crumb, perfect.  The grilled veggies were, well, grilled veggies.  The sandwiches were a bit burnt but what's a little char amongst friends.  It was still good. While I'm waiting there the owner calls back and profusely apologizes for the error...because not only might someone be ethically opposed to eating cow secretions but it might be a medical issues.  OK, he tells me there is going to be a correction.  I tell him about Daiya, he seems to write it down.  I tell him it's available in food size packages.  He seems to be writing it all down.  Again he apologizes.The second time I went there was during lunch and when I asked the young lady behind the counter to put the Balsamic Vinegar on the sandwich she said it couldn't be done.  Weeeeeeell, I don't like the word ""can't"" and after some back and forth I suppose we settled on a ""side"" of BV.  Still no vegan cheese.The sandwich was once again pretty good.  The BV made the flavor pop, as it's designed to do because otherwise we get the standard ""grilled veggies for the vegans"" food.  This isn't 10 years ago.Still, two visits and two hassles.  I expect this from Joe's (what's a vegan?)

Please, Green Fig, honor your posted hours or at least give us advance warning that you're closing early. Also, less importantly, they could use an improvement with the music. Sometimes they have a terrible top-40 FM station or aggressively lame adult contemporary FM station on the stereo, with lousy ads yelling at you. Once they had WBGO (jazz) on, which was a major improvement on the awful commercial radio, except that WBGO was doing a pledge drive! And their pledge drives are the WORST. (Hey BGO, learn something from WFMU and its amazing pledge drives, you dorks!) Come on guys, you should only put on WBGO when it's NOT doing a pledge drive.

"This place has gone downhill so much so that I almost never go in anymore given the constant changing ownership, staff changes and the decreasing feeling of a local neighborhood business with any kind of personality. The only redeeming qualities are the prosciutto bagels which always sell out before 10 AM because they only order five a day and every day one guy comes and buys three of them. The bridge stay sailor pretty much disgusting and the sandwiches are grossly overpriced as are the baked goods. The chai latte is nothing special and I've heard from coffee drinkers that the coffee is pretty awful. I do go here in the summer months more often to get a peach iced tea which is rather nice, but again with the changes in ownership and consequently personnel, I felt the need to update my previous review with a feeling that this place doesn't have an identity and is not very friendly in general, at least not when it opened up 4 years ago. Also wifi is very very spotty and often goes out, though free.",2.0

I Might as well buy internet for myself, or walk the 6 blocks to the library for free internet and dollar coffee.  Also, the staff is... awkward... they don't greet when you walk in, they don't assist with the menu (which is actually hard to find), they don't provide a tray/plate for your stuff which makes using the ""food elevator"" awkward. The staff also likes to have deep, personal, TMI conversations very loudly (louder than the music, which from other posts you can imagine is very loud), so when you are working on the computer upstairs you get free life stories booming through the double height space.If the prices were reasonable I would go everyday, despite story-telling time",2.0

They didn't have a ton of baked goods I'd consider ""morning"" material, so I ventured outside my comfort zone and got a hefty slice of their vegan pound cake. Trust me, it tasted much better than it sounds, which is saying a lot for me. I took it and my Chai Latte to go and enjoyed both on my drive out to Long Island. Good find!",4.0
"I really want to 5-star this place because it is such a cute coffee spot in the area, but it is very overpriced and the staff is not very friendly/ boarder-line obnoxious. Pros: Delicious baked goods, tasty coffee, free Wi-fi, an upstairs seating area with cool ""food elevator,"" games, guitars, and decorated in a fun artsy style - also conveniently close to the train.Cons: regular coffee $2.45????? get out of town and take the bus. I Might as well buy internet for myself, or walk the 6 blocks to the library for free internet and dollar coffee.  Also, the staff is... awkward... they don't greet when you walk in, they don't assist with the menu (which is actually hard to find), they don't provide a tray/plate for your stuff which makes using the ""food elevator"" awkward. The staff also likes to have deep, personal, TMI conversations very loudly (louder than the music, which from other posts you can imagine is very loud), so when you are working on the computer upstairs you get free life stories booming through the double height space.If the prices were reasonable I would go everyday, despite story-telling time",2.0
"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! This place has a great mellow atmosphere and the food is amazingly good.  Try the Veggie w/ mozzarella and tomatoes, it's to die for.",5.0
"The only reason they get four of five stars is because they changed their menu not to have soup anymore, and some other changes too. The cooks are hilarious and chatty, and the sandwiches they make are baller. The coffee and espresso is great, and it's my favorite latte in town. Really good atmosphere to study in upstairs with numerous outlets for plug-ins, and they don't mind if you come in literally from open to close to study for the MCAT (ahem). Yummy pastries, the chocolate covered figs are amazeballs, and the service is great and doesn't take too long. Definitely the best coffee in Sunset Park. This is one of the newer establishments that are making this a better neighborhood.",4.0

"I have been coming here all summer, and the sandwiches are AMAZING, which is what keeps me coming back time and time again. However, the reason this place isn't getting 4 or 5 stars is because they have a rule that they absolutely WILL NOT alter their pre-set sandwiches between 11 AM and 2 PM. This means that they will not add or remove any items from a sandwich! I've talked to the workers before, and apparently this was put into place because they get very busy during lunch hours. It must have been implemented recently, because I have definitely gotten extra items on a sandwich here in the past few months. No more. Look, if you need to hire an extra person during lunch so that you can add arugula to a sandwich, you should do that instead of angering all of your regular customers who want to customize their sandwiches. Another alternative would be to limit people who call in their orders on customizing sandwiches, but allowing customers who order in to add ingredients. It takes longer for you to argue with a customer that you can't add something to their sandwich than it does to just add the item and charge them for it.",3.0

The upstairs is a great place to chat or work, with comfy chairs and tables and plenty of soft lighting. I also love that they have a dumbwaiter to send your food up, because that's just fun.

"This was EXACTLY the kind of place I was looking for when we needed a good spot of coffee and a snack. I ordered an almond iced latte which was heavenly, my husband had a vanilla latte which was great as well. We also shared a Callabria sandwich and it was perfect. The bread was out of this world, the Italian ham they use was deliciously sliced thin and perfectly complemented the fresh mozzarella and dribble of aged balsamic. We also ordered a multigrain bagel and cream cheese for our son, which sounds pretty pedestrian, but had to be one of the BEST bagels I have ever tasted! It was encrusted in grains and had a unexpected pinch of fennel seed every so often, and the cream cheese was super excellent as well, creamy and perfectly softened. We also had some of the cookies: Almond crescent (good), sesame seed (really good), Linzer torte (yum), lemon raspberry iced (almost made me cry that we had only bought two).To top all of this, the service was extremely friendly and helpful. They were so nice to our son and were kind enough to run the dumb waiter for him a couple of times.All I can add to this review is ""wow!"".We will be returning soon!",5.0

I think I had talked to the owner over a month ago and asked if he had VEGAN stuff and he said he was working on it. I just stopped by the other day and today and he has a a couple great things plus VEGAN butter and cream cheese! I'm going back to write next time plus eat more mini cupcakes... wish me luck!",5.0
"This place is adorable, has excellent food, and great customer service. First off, their upstairs is really cute and quiet and a great place to get work done. Second, their food is awesome. I got an amazing sandwich here - really good quality and large portion. It's not usual crappy cafe food, but really gourmet ingredients. The guy who made it was one of the older guys (not one of the teens that often work there), and he double-layered my sandwich in such an awesome way! All their baked goodies look amazing too. They also take credit card (no minimum), and have this dummy waiter that brings your food upstairs. Come here to chill upstairs or to have a good sandwich. It's a rare spot in Sunset Park, and I want it to stay for a very long time!",5.0
"Before the new management took this place over, it was a decent place. Now it's great! I always look forward to getting bagels from here - they're some of the best I've had - and washing them down with a chai tea latte. It helps that the new owner has made an effort to hire some of the friendliest people in town. I've noticed that the young folks who work on the weekend are especially polite, fast, and eager to help. Anyone who's ever been intimidated by a barista will find a friendly face behind the counter at the Green Fig!",5.0
"Misogynnistic staffers ignorant of the products they sell have greatly changed this place. It is unfortunately no longer a friendly family establishment due to the overabundance and attitudes of it's male workers. Loud during the day with the yelling and rowdy voices of staff, it's changed from a quiet cafe to a hang out for its employees.

"I work in Sunset Park and there aren't a ton of good lunch spots within walking distance of my office. I have my usual staples - Spiro's, Twin Lin's, La Fe, Maria's, Mai Thai - which are all good. But exactly zero of these places are good for spending any amount of actual time in. You're pretty much in and out. You can't really hang out comfortably in a weird chinese takeaway spot. So when I discovered Green Fig, I was absolutely delighted. Finally a place to eat lunch that isn't my desk at work! This place is super cute, haphazardly artsy, cozy and friendly. They have fresh baked goods, coffee, salads, sandwiches and more. I ordered a sandwich with mozzarella, eggplant, arugula and balsamic vinegar and it was SO GOOD. At $8.25 it wasn't cheap, but worth it for fresh, real food. I took my plate upstairs to a really nice lofted seating area, cuddled myself into a corner, cracked open a book, and was just really happy. They offer a nice selection of vegetarian and vegan options, rather rare round these parts. Perhaps this is what ariel J. is referring to as ""hipster tastes."" I don't think this place deserves so much scorn. I too love the bodegas and cheap eats of Sunset Park, but Green Fig has absolutely filled a void that, judging by the number and quality of reviews, a lot of people were feeling. On top of that, it's a small business owned by really nice people. It's not like it's a Starbucks.",5.0
"I'm writing from my iPhone because of how desperately I want to review this place. I recently moved into Sunset Park and I must admit: I was a little sad at the absence of ""cute"" cafes, bookstores, grocers, etc. By a little I mean really sad, but hey-- I'm on a budget, and Park Slope is so close, right?Not the same.Anyhow, while wandering around one day, I passed The Green Fig. I was immediately intrigued by the beautiful breads in the window, but unfortunately I was carrying twice my weight in stuff from Target and really just wanted to be home before I passed out from heat exhaustion.A day later, I made the point of going back for bread. I left with a loaf (90 cents!), a cookie (amazing. They also have vegan treats, which I'm curious to try), and half a dozen bagels (given for free because I was new to the neighborhood). What better welcome can a person want?Today I went in for coffee, which wasn't anything special but did the trick. Every employee I've encountered has been so nice, patient, and helpful. I haven't seen it crowded and will likely take my computer in soon and work there.Essentially, I think I'm in love.

I'm not sure if it was an off day, but the girl who took my order totally brought me down. She looked incredibly annoyed that I was even there. Didn't smile a single time. I ordered just a simple iced coffee. It being my first time there, I was confused about where to wait for it. Apparently it had already been sent upstairs but she actively ignored me and let me stand by the counter waiting like an idiot instead of just telling me that. I ordered a sandwich to go and it was good, exactly what I wanted. However, I will probably never go back there unless I am craving a giant deli sandwich and happen to be in the area.

"Basically I would like to support services of this nature given the location. However.

Who knows, maybe I got unlucky and ran into their shift whereas other workers could treat the environment more appropriately. At least, the administrator of this cafe should learn what other stores are doing in order to market themselves to keep the clientele they currently have. No decent cafe leaves FM radio on. This is no Dunkin' Donuts even if it is located in the deserted industrial area where has just begun its gentrification.

I'm too used to adding these things myself to revert back to a counterperson doing it for me. Also, a few months ago I tried one of their bagels which was...just a lie. They are bagel-shaped crusty Italian rolls. Delicious but definitely NOT bagels. Oh well. The decor is comical. It tries for artsy or ""funky"" and that's what it looks like.

"i have to return on a weekday morning for a more precise review, but the problem is, these type of places struggle with business...great coffee, great food, but on a sat am-afternoon you would expect some flow of traffic, but unfortunatly, my 5.25 for a iced latte and danish was the only income for that time....i will be back and hopefully they stay afloat!!!! i mean i love a bargain but..cant beleive im saying this....rise your prices!!",4.0

"""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" is for five stars. I finally found my cafe. This place gets five stars not only because it is quite literally one of its kind in Sunset Park, but also because it is just good. I got the sandwich with mozzarella, arugula, zucchini, and balsamic vinaigrette, the bread of which I could have eaten plain it was so crunchy and tasty. I also got the peanut butter cookie sandwich, which is two peanut butter cookies with chocolate in between and dipped halfway in chocolate, along with a large cup of coffee. All were quality. This was all delivered upstairs to me by a dumb waiter, which is just cool.

The apple crumb pie had a nice crunchy topping but the apple chunks were a little mushy and the crust was slightly raw. Athough they did mention they just started baking pies. So they haven't perfected their recipe. This is definitely a good place to come and have a cup of coffee or curl up with a good book. They have a 2nd floor with plenty of seating and free wifi.",4.0

"I've been going to this cafe since it opened because I live and work in sunset park. I've usually enjoyed the coffee and other baked goods. There have been numerous  occasions when I walk in and it takes the staff a good amount of time to greet me. But the worse part has been the amount of wait time to get the food. This has happened already 2-3 times where I wait for about 20 minutes for a simple bagel and coffee. Today was the worse experience and I've now made up my mind not to go back there.I ordered a small salad and a piece of bread. When I got there there was only one person serving and a few other customers ordering. I sat at a table for 30 minutes waiting for my food. I then went down, asked about my order to a second woman who had arrived to help and she didn't seem to know about it because the person who took my order never told her or ever made the salad. She told me she'd make it for me then. I then waited an additional 15 minutes and nothing! At that point I had waited for a simple salad and bread for 45 minutes. My lunchtime was almost over and I was starving so I went downstairs, asked for a refund and left.Not good.",1.0
"I need to preface this review by saying that I desperately want this place to succeed. Sunset Park needs you. I need you. I also need you to make a latte in under 25 minutes.

A bit pricey for this neighborhood but so big they easily feed 2 and they're delicious. I just wish that operationally they would get their shit together.

So in summary, if you're in a hurry, don't go there, you'll just get frustrated.

"I have been living in Sunset Park for a little over a year and I've been thinking the whole time about how great it would be for a coffee spot to open so I was thrilled when I saw that Green Fig had set up shop.  Honestly, this place deserves 5 stars, they have great coffee, food and atmosphere but I had to withhold 2 because of the weekend and evening service.  This place is great on a weekday morning.  I assume that the owner is the guy behind the counter and he totally gets it.  You get your coffee and food quickly and with a smile.  Sadly, he isn't there on the weekends or in the evening (at least when I have been there) and that's when service gets spotty.  The staff is always pleasant but it seems like they haven't been trained well.  Recently, I went in on a Saturday and their were 4 people working.  Two of them were dealing with food, one was working the counter and serving people at the tables and the other guy wasn't doing very much of anything.  The girl working the counter and tables took my order but before she could start she had to do something at the table.  That was fine but then this other guy got behind the counter and  asked me if I'd been helped.  I replied that yes I had given my order but she couldn't start it expecting him to take over.  Instead he just moved onto the next customer.  I then stood there for 15 minutes (I timed it) waiting for a late that can be made in 2 minutes.  Other times I have been given iced coffee with no ice in it or I had to explain my order several times to someone that had obviously never looked at the menu before.  I know this all sounds nit-picky but the truth is fancy coffee and snacks are an indulgence in this economy and bad service doesn't make it worthwhile.  I really like this place and love that it is in the neighborhood.  Seriously, all they need to do is train the staff better and this will be a 5 star joint.",3.0
"$1.75 for a small cup of drip coffee that isn't even that great - really?!?!  In Sunset Park?!?!  I mean it's a nice place, as other's have noted, and I have liked the few baked goods I've tried but the prices are ridiculous.  If you're trying to make ends meet by overcharging for a cup of coffee, you might consider that more people would come in to buy coffee if it were 50 cents cheaper, maybe.  Just sayin'...",2.0
"I always want to like this place, but every time I go there I am confused. It feels like it takes so much effort to sort out menu. So, you walk in and there are several chalkboards with various messages, but NEVER with a list of daily specials and prices. so I ask for a menu, because they are not conspicuously displayed. The menu reads like a Chinese menu. Totally uninspired. There are various categories, and in every one there is a repetition of ingredients from all other categories. what is the point of that? But the most confusing part is that there are a slew of things on the counter (specials?) not listed anywhere. Some are obvious (pizza, but no info on price) but some are more mysterious: 3 different shaped fried balls of something. But worst is when you ask what the mystery items on counter are. First person has a vague idea, but must ask owner(?). First person has no idea of price. Asks second person again, who adds, ""they are really good."" So now I am in this awkward position where I have had to involve 2 staff members and5 minutes just to find out what the special items are. Seriously, how hard is it to inform staff and or write specials description AND PRICE on specials board. I was exhausted after the exchange. Worst part: prior to the exchange, when i tried to find special items on menu and failed, I ask counter person what the were and she handed me a menu. How could she not know that the specials would not be on the menu? I am getting exhausted again from just writing this....Bottom line is that the food is actually good (though the coffee is subpar and overpriced), but the place just feels unprofessional. I wish it were just a casualness, but it is more than that. It's a lack of information in the staff and consequently, the customer has to work too hard and interact too much...but I really want this place to be good! Fig, please listen to our comments! We want you to be a great addition to our neighborhood!",3.0
"A hidden gem in a neighborhood filled with taco joints, bodegas and 99 cent stores, this place is a great coffee joint. They have interesting pastries, cookies, breads and even sandwiches and smoothies. I came there once on a really hot day and they were offering smoothie samples which was just what I wanted (but didn't know!) The staff is supernice and they place decent music. It's family friendly too! I think they need to make the staff a little more knowledgable about their teas, as I asked for a chai latte once and the gal behind the counter offered me a ""green chai"" instead since they were out of the regular chai - I had never heard of this so I asked to see it. Lo and behold, it was actually genmai cha, which is a toasted brown rice green tea which has nothing to do with chai. Glad I asked!",4.0
"I'm so thankful for a strong latte on my commute to work!  And they accomodated my request for brown sugar (I haven't used white sugar in years and sometimes have to carry my own).  Also, they have fresh bread!!!  You could not get a fresh baguette in Sunset Park to save your life, but now we are saved!  Hooray for the Green Fig.  And I learned my lesson with Suryasta Yoga -- you have to give them business if you want them to stay a business so everyone get your java, bread, and morning smiles here!",4.0

"I have been living in Sunset Park for a little over a year and I've been thinking the whole time about how great it would be for a coffee spot to open so I was thrilled when I saw that Green Fig had set up shop.  Honestly, this place deserves 5 stars, they have great coffee, food and atmosphere but I had to withhold 2 because of the weekend and evening service.  This place is great on a weekday morning.  I assume that the owner is the guy behind the counter and he totally gets it.  You get your coffee and food quickly and with a smile.  Sadly, he isn't there on the weekends or in the evening (at least when I have been there) and that's when service gets spotty.  The staff is always pleasant but it seems like they haven't been trained well.  Recently, I went in on a Saturday and their were 4 people working.  Two of them were dealing with food, one was working the counter and serving people at the tables and the other guy wasn't doing very much of anything.  The girl working the counter and tables took my order but before she could start she had to do something at the table.  That was fine but then this other guy got behind the counter and  asked me if I'd been helped.  I replied that yes I had given my order but she couldn't start it expecting him to take over.  Instead he just moved onto the next customer.  I then stood there for 15 minutes (I timed it) waiting for a late that can be made in 2 minutes.  Other times I have been given iced coffee with no ice in it or I had to explain my order several times to someone that had obviously never looked at the menu before.  I know this all sounds nit-picky but the truth is fancy coffee and snacks are an indulgence in this economy and bad service doesn't make it worthwhile.  I really like this place and love that it is in the neighborhood.  Seriously, all they need to do is train the staff better and this will be a 5 star joint.",3.0
"$1.75 for a small cup of drip coffee that isn't even that great - really?!?!  In Sunset Park?!?!  I mean it's a nice place, as other's have noted, and I have liked the few baked goods I've tried but the prices are ridiculous.  If you're trying to make ends meet by overcharging for a cup of coffee, you might consider that more people would come in to buy coffee if it were 50 cents cheaper, maybe.  Just sayin'...",2.0
"I always want to like this place, but every time I go there I am confused. It feels like it takes so much effort to sort out menu. So, you walk in and there are several chalkboards with various messages, but NEVER with a list of daily specials and prices. so I ask for a menu, because they are not conspicuously displayed. The menu reads like a Chinese menu. Totally uninspired. There are various categories, and in every one there is a repetition of ingredients from all other categories. what is the point of that? But the most confusing part is that there are a slew of things on the counter (specials?) not listed anywhere. Some are obvious (pizza, but no info on price) but some are more mysterious: 3 different shaped fried balls of something. But worst is when you ask what the mystery items on counter are. First person has a vague idea, but must ask owner(?). First person has no idea of price. Asks second person again, who adds, ""they are really good."" So now I am in this awkward position where I have had to involve 2 staff members and5 minutes just to find out what the special items are. Seriously, how hard is it to inform staff and or write specials description AND PRICE on specials board. I was exhausted after the exchange. Worst part: prior to the exchange, when i tried to find special items on menu and failed, I ask counter person what the were and she handed me a menu. How could she not know that the specials would not be on the menu? I am getting exhausted again from just writing this....Bottom line is that the food is actually good (though the coffee is subpar and overpriced), but the place just feels unprofessional. I wish it were just a casualness, but it is more than that. It's a lack of information in the staff and consequently, the customer has to work too hard and interact too much...but I really want this place to be good! Fig, please listen to our comments! We want you to be a great addition to our neighborhood!",3.0
"A hidden gem in a neighborhood filled with taco joints, bodegas and 99 cent stores, this place is a great coffee joint. They have interesting pastries, cookies, breads and even sandwiches and smoothies. I came there once on a really hot day and they were offering smoothie samples which was just what I wanted (but didn't know!) The staff is supernice and they place decent music. It's family friendly too! I think they need to make the staff a little more knowledgable about their teas, as I asked for a chai latte once and the gal behind the counter offered me a ""green chai"" instead since they were out of the regular chai - I had never heard of this so I asked to see it. Lo and behold, it was actually genmai cha, which is a toasted brown rice green tea which has nothing to do with chai. Glad I asked!",4.0
"I'm so thankful for a strong latte on my commute to work!  And they accomodated my request for brown sugar (I haven't used white sugar in years and sometimes have to carry my own).  Also, they have fresh bread!!!  You could not get a fresh baguette in Sunset Park to save your life, but now we are saved!  Hooray for the Green Fig.  And I learned my lesson with Suryasta Yoga -- you have to give them business if you want them to stay a business so everyone get your java, bread, and morning smiles here!",4.0
"Would give It 5 stars if the service was more friendly, didn't get a thank you, hardly a word said and we also went in to get some work done and the wifi was messed up. But that could be just an off day. I would spend a lot of time there if the Internet worked and the service was friendly.",3.0
"this place is both welcoming and delightful.  the food is excellent yet simple, the coffee bar is top notch and the staff is friendly.  the neighborhood needed a place like this and now it's finally here.  check them out and you will not be disappointed.",4.0
