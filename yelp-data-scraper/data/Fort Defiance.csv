Great brunch spot in Red Hook Brooklyn.  Still dreaming about that cheddar egg cheese on a biscuit sandwich with has brown on the side.  Cute small spot with awesome service.,5.0
For years now I have been eyeing this beauty and wanting to go. It has been for such a long time that the menu has changed.I love the deco and thought that the service was acceptable but I did not like the food. I had the Charleston because it looks so amazing on pictures and was extremely disappointed. The greens were way to salty. The corn bread was on the dry side. With these two components not being up to par there wasn't much to enjoy. I always take my leftovers home unless like in this case I don't care for the food that I leave them.I will admit that when I asked what was most popular the Charleston wasn't one of the dishes mentioned perhaps I should have gone with a house recommendation.,2.0
"Four stars purely for the drinks and the smiles. We were there between meal service (which was a little odd on a weekend but I won't judge even though I really really want to because I was hungry and excited to be here, but ok ok I won't judge I will only report the experience as it played out). There were some small plates available so we ordered the cheese sandwich and a couple of cocktails to tide us over before seeking out more food elsewhere. The cocktails were fantastic. I mean, they were smooth, well constructed, and the right blend of alcohol and flavor. They were terrific anytime cocktails and I'd sit and sip a cocktail there anytime. The cocktails made up for the lackluster snack food. I want to believe that the food is better during regular meal service, but based on the little I sampled I didn't get the impression that the food is worth rushing back for. The grilled cheddar sandwich was surprisingly cheap quality. But the cocktails. Yeah, the cocktails really are where it's at.",4.0
"Came here while visiting Red Hook and saw this place was highly rated. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table and was seated on a nice saturday morning..and then somewhat forgotten. I felt that during our meal, they were a bit slow in serving us. A table that was seated after us was given their food before us I noticed. I guess I can understand because it was quite a busy time for them but found it a bit unfortunate at the same time.Food though was good for a brunch. I got the Biscuit Egg Sandwich which was good. What made it special was definitely the jalapeno jam. Definitely an unique add on that really raised the bar for an egg biscuit sandwich. If in the area, I would recommend it but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to Red Hook for it.",3.0
"Great decor, service, and coffee. Enjoyed the brunch fare. Crowded for a Saturday afternoon.",4.0
"we went here last night for a delicious dinner. the place was adorable and I discover they have great cocktails but we didnt try any. instead we purchased the only two entrees they'd, shrimp and grits and roasted chicken. as I understand it, the menu changes daily and these were our selections. so we got them both together with a side of balsamic, brown butter brussel sprouts. the food was ok. it was a little high-priced and nothing dramatic. in fact my grits were kinda lumpy as well as a disappointment to the tasty southern dish. Perhaps the drinks are excellent but I 'd go someplace else for dinner.",4.0
"The food is alright ... Corn bread has a nice crunch to it. The mustard hollandaise sauce is a bit overwhelming. I can't say anything extraordinary about this place, though I'm not sure if a 40 minute wait for the food was really worth it.",3.0
"We came to this restaurant based on it's ranking for top 5 Irish Coffee's in the City. Traditionally we go to the Dead Rabbit in Wall Street, but this place may have them beat for me! Their coffee is all freshly made and their food is absolutely delicious. We visited for breakfast, it gets super busy so go early, and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I highly advise getting and Irish Coffee and one their Breakfast Sandwich. It was probably one of the best meals I have ever had.",5.0

"I must have been here a dozen times for brunch and this place never disappoints!!! The biscuit egg sandwich is to die for and the omelette of the day is usually quite delicious!

"I like the brunch menu better than the dinner, which has slim options. Only like 3 things on the entree list.

"Fort Defiance is one of those restaurants I couldn't wait to run back home to write a review for (get a life, right? I know.)  I want to scream at the top of my lungs to let everyone know how much I LOVE this place. I'm going to skip right to the part where my knees got weak... that Biscuit Egg Sandwich is without a doubt in my mind heaven sent and I'm not even religious.  Now I believe there is a God.  It is definitely the best choice I have made to start off this New Year. At first glance, the sandwich looks unassuming.  But as soon as you bite into it, your life changes.  I know this also because my boyfriend was watching me take the first bite and he wondered why I never look at him the same way.  He's just no competition to this biscuit.Everything about it is perfect.  The flavorful cheddar biscuit (I love biscuits in general, but this took it to the next level), the perfectly fried egg (not too runny, not overcooked), the ham (honestly, this was probably the least memorable ingredient) and most importantly whatever crack they put in that jalapeno jam.  Not caring that my boyfriend was watching this affair unfold before his eyes, I lustfully seduced the biscuit... ""I'll be jalapeno jam ANY day!""To top this off, my chai latte was BANGING. Most chai lattes are more or less the same.  But this was one was silky smooth, not grainy, perfectly warm and not too hot with just the right amount of foam.  Also for some reason, it is all white (not that I have preference over color, but a white chai latte is something I consider exotic and hey! I like to try new things).The collard greens and the gingerade were equally as good.  My boyfriend had the Richmond, but honestly, we can't tell if it is even good or not because it was utterly out-shined by the biscuit sandwich.I can't wait to come back for a second date with this place, looking forward to trying their dinner.",5.0

Yum.  The red beans  and ham -- were creamy and wonderful topped by some pickled red onions.  We also ordered the collards which were sweet from caramelized onions, and scented with lemon zest and coriander -- some of the best we have ever had.  Coffee was good and strong.  I saw a huevos rancheros that looked terrific.  I would say they need some gluten-free options..maybe cheese grits would complement this menu.The place was doable at 10:00AM on a Sunday but full up by 11 so get there early.We will be going back....early.",4.0
"Fort Defiance is a gem in a small neighborhood known as Redhook, close enough to Gowanus, which is close enough to South Slope, which is pretty much Park Slope... right? But it did take my boyfriend a while to persuade me to make the trip out to this part of town, since there isn't much going on in the neighborhood, other than a few gas stations, run-down lots, and warehouses. But that adds to the charm, in a way. As soon as you enter the restaurant, you'll notice it's a quaint space with cute waiters with beanies and plaid button-ups. There are misplaced and ironic pieces of decor along the wall. And of course, the much needed quintessential piece of chalkboard art that acts as a centerpiece in many casual restaurants and cafes these days. The wooden tables were refurbished with tacky yet fun wallpaper print that adds the extra flair. It's what non-Brooklyn dwellers would expect from Brooklyn. And the food, the food, the food is so delicious! What surprised me most about this joint was how they have a full bar with all types of wine, prosecco, and liquor smack in the middle of the restaurant. It leads me to believe that Fort Defiance is an even better joint for happy hour and after-dinner drinks on the weekends. They apparently serve dinner until midnight on any given night, minus Tuesdays. I walked in on a Sunday morning at 10AM and there were a few couples sitting at the two-seaters and a few solos with their nooks and newspapers. My boyfriend and I were in a rush to head out of town so we decided to take the food to go and ordered their steal oatmeal and the Charleston, which is two poached eggs, corn bread, and collard greens. As we were waiting, a waiter was kind enough to give us glasses of water (which some establishments forget to do so it was very appreciated!) And then we spotted the cute barista and immediately wanted to put his skills to the test. And oh man, this was the best cup of cappuccino I ever had the pleasure of enjoying!The food didn't take too long to prepare but as we were waiting, we struck a conversation with another waiter and asked about Fort Defiance- apparently, they never stop serving alcohol! And one look at their alcohol collection, you'll figure out that it's one of the many selling points. So on to the food, the oatmeal was delicious. They had little pieces of diced almonds and a couple of grapes floating around. I would have liked more fruit on the oatmeal, but the oatmeal itself was not too dry and not too bland. The Charleston is just like the Eggs Benedict but with cornbread instead of the English muffin. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection and went really well with their version of cornbread. Their cornbread is not as sweet and buttery as I remember other cornbreads to be, and they have visible pieces of red and green peppers to add a pinch of zest.

"Just had an awesome brunch this morning.  Sun was shining and so was the pleasant service and delicious food.I had the scrambled eggs with mushroom and asparagus and goat cheese (I could no tell there was goat cheese..it must have melted in.) A nice fresh salad and slice of fresh baguette accompanied the eggs.  I skipped the bread.  My companions had the egg biscuit with jalepeno jam. Biscuits were perfect! Yum.  The red beans  and ham -- were creamy and wonderful topped by some pickled red onions.  We also ordered the collards which were sweet from caramelized onions, and scented with lemon zest and coriander -- some of the best we have ever had.  Coffee was good and strong.  I saw a huevos rancheros that looked terrific.  I would say they need some gluten-free options..maybe cheese grits would complement this menu.The place was doable at 10:00AM on a Sunday but full up by 11 so get there early.We will be going back....early.",4.0
"Fort Defiance is a gem in a small neighborhood known as Redhook, close enough to Gowanus, which is close enough to South Slope, which is pretty much Park Slope... right? But it did take my boyfriend a while to persuade me to make the trip out to this part of town, since there isn't much going on in the neighborhood, other than a few gas stations, run-down lots, and warehouses. But that adds to the charm, in a way. As soon as you enter the restaurant, you'll notice it's a quaint space with cute waiters with beanies and plaid button-ups. There are misplaced and ironic pieces of decor along the wall. And of course, the much needed quintessential piece of chalkboard art that acts as a centerpiece in many casual restaurants and cafes these days. The wooden tables were refurbished with tacky yet fun wallpaper print that adds the extra flair. It's what non-Brooklyn dwellers would expect from Brooklyn. And the food, the food, the food is so delicious! What surprised me most about this joint was how they have a full bar with all types of wine, prosecco, and liquor smack in the middle of the restaurant. It leads me to believe that Fort Defiance is an even better joint for happy hour and after-dinner drinks on the weekends. They apparently serve dinner until midnight on any given night, minus Tuesdays. I walked in on a Sunday morning at 10AM and there were a few couples sitting at the two-seaters and a few solos with their nooks and newspapers. My boyfriend and I were in a rush to head out of town so we decided to take the food to go and ordered their steal oatmeal and the Charleston, which is two poached eggs, corn bread, and collard greens. As we were waiting, a waiter was kind enough to give us glasses of water (which some establishments forget to do so it was very appreciated!) And then we spotted the cute barista and immediately wanted to put his skills to the test. And oh man, this was the best cup of cappuccino I ever had the pleasure of enjoying!The food didn't take too long to prepare but as we were waiting, we struck a conversation with another waiter and asked about Fort Defiance- apparently, they never stop serving alcohol! And one look at their alcohol collection, you'll figure out that it's one of the many selling points. So on to the food, the oatmeal was delicious. They had little pieces of diced almonds and a couple of grapes floating around. I would have liked more fruit on the oatmeal, but the oatmeal itself was not too dry and not too bland. The Charleston is just like the Eggs Benedict but with cornbread instead of the English muffin. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection and went really well with their version of cornbread. Their cornbread is not as sweet and buttery as I remember other cornbreads to be, and they have visible pieces of red and green peppers to add a pinch of zest. The collard green are sautéed in a heavier cheesier base which compliments the mustard-ey hollandaise really well.

The service was excellent, they are speedy and friendly. It's very homey inside with interesting art/lighting and floral vinyl tablecloths for a throw-back. We ended up sharing a table with this couple that comes every weekend, we made friends fast. And also while waiting on line for 10 mins or so we made friends... very sweet neighborhood and they all had great things to say about Fort Defiance.

"Breakfast Martini.I once ""accidentally"" ordered a delicious-sounding ""breakfast cocktail"" at Watty & Meg and was mildly embarrassed (as in not at all) that it was a martini.At Fort Defiance, they do it right.  You want a Breakfast Martini, Lucille?  Then order the damn Breakfast Martini (gin, Cointreau, lemon and orange marmalade).  And a piece of toast.  Also.  Ramos Gin Fizz.  Let's just pretend we're in New Orleans and drink these all afternoon.  No, no one is waiting for your table.  Yes they are, but they're not as fun as you, so order another drink.It's one of those brunch menus that makes you want to order everything on the menu.  I was never down with ""brunch is for sharing"" because hands off my sloppy runny eggs!  But...grits, and bacon and biscuits and all that?   Order extra sides to sate your brunch needs.  And an extra Ramos Gin Fizz.",4.0
"I'm not sure I've ever been treated as well as I was by the afternoon staff at Fort Defiance. Let's do a quick rundown of all the ways they made my life better.They happily waved us inside, even though lunch service was ending in 10 minutes.They offered us a menu stocked with winners, and when we couldn't decide...They recommended the corned beef sandwich* and the cheddar biscuit.**They made my companion a ""pour over coffee, which she was very pleased with.They broke up the Black Eyed Peas.***They quickly made a new batch of Bloody Mary mix (quite tasty) at my request.They called me ""doll.""They made me wish I lived in Red Hook.They made me feel as welcome as can be, and served me a lunch that I'm pretty sure couldn't have been better.___________*This thing is AWESOME. Warm, juicy, flavorful meat piled high with enough fresh horseradish to clear your sinuses atop buttery toasted bread. With lightly dressed arugula on the side to cut through the fatty deliciousness of the corned beef. Perfect.**Equally awesome. A fluffy biscuit with ham, cheddar, a fried egg and jalapeno jam...this is the breakfast sandwich that makes other breakfast sandwiches look weak.***I don't know if this is true, but it seemed to happen simultaneously. Either way, we should all just be thankful: reuters.com/article/2011…",5.0
"The chicken liver pate here is the best I've ever had, and I get it just about every place where it's on the menu.Oysters are perfectly shucked.The cocktails were pretty good--great for the price, and strong.Grab a bite here and head to the waters' edge for the sunset.ALSO:Corned beef short ribsBurger (brioche bun)Crostiniwith Salvatore Bklyn ricotta, shiitake mushrooms, kale, Parmesan, and vin cotto",5.0
"Wow. The brunch here is stupid-good. I had The Charleston which is poached eggs (vegetarian). The mustard sauce was perfect, and the cornbread was awesome. My friend had the Biscuit egg sandwich which is very popular here for good reason. Cappuccinos are also delicious. The place is a decent size, but it gets packed quick... so worth the wait though. The service was excellent, they are speedy and friendly. It's very homey inside with interesting art/lighting and floral vinyl tablecloths for a throw-back. We ended up sharing a table with this couple that comes every weekend, we made friends fast. And also while waiting on line for 10 mins or so we made friends... very sweet neighborhood and they all had great things to say about Fort Defiance. What an awesome time we had... if you're in the area, this is a must try. What's funny is we were originally planned to go elsewhere up the street, there was a 30-min wait and they never called us... so glad we stumbled here instead thanks to Yelp.HIGHLY Recommended. Will be back.",5.0
"We were four at the city chaperoning international students. We had cauliflower soup, lentil soup, omelette of ham, cheese, and spinach, and chicken liver pate. Of course, we had leftovers to take home. However, it would be nice to inform us of extra charge for hash when we asked to sub the toast for hash. Also, the only toilet doesn't flush well after more than 5 people have used it ahead. Otherwise, cozy and delicious food.thank you.",4.0

"If this place only served the Ramos Gin Fizz, I'd still probably come at least once a month. Seriously, don't miss this beverage which is basically an adult milkshake that is both perfectly refreshing in the summer, and delicious and comforting in the winter.They also know how to do breakfast / brunch right, which starts by opening at breakfast time (9am). No more waiting until 11am to eat out on the weekends! The kitchen knows how to cook an egg, but my favorite of their dishes is the Huevos Rancheros. Also try the biscuits & jam for something a little sweeter, or the creole red beans if you want more of the New Orleans taste that they offer. Though I haven't tried it myself, I've also heard the Muffuletta is bomb.If it's a nice day out, ride your bike and scoot right up to their outside bar. Perfect!",5.0
"Bartender was great but server was horrible.  Don't go if they don't have the brunch menu available because the rest of their food isn't that great.  The deviled eggs were very good (but not the best in the city IMO); the chicken liver pate was just a wad of average pate on the plate with some toast; don't get the risotto unless you like a random mix of mediocre flavors in your mouth; and the hamburger was your average burger served on a bun that was much bigger than the meat patty.The cocktails were good and strong, so it's not bad if you don't plan on eating anything beyond deviled eggs.",2.0
"Fort D hands down has the best BEST Irish coffee, hot or iced. The coffee is slow drip and the bartenders make the cream. It's seriously the best. Generally, I prefer brunch over dinner. More options and the hash browns are the most delish little crispy golden treats. The huevos rancheros, although not the traditional Mexican kind, are hearty and flavorful. And the bartenders are helpful without being overbearing. You can just sit and read and eat and drink.Oyster happy hour during the week is pretty great too.",5.0
"This place is super small but cute. It gets busy for Saturday brunch, let me tell you, you're more than likely going to wait 10-15 to be seated. The hostess took down my name and phone number and said she would call me back when seating was available. She did just that which I thought was very accommodating. We were seated with another couple which means we had to share a table & wasn't to bad but a little awkward at first. I ordered The All American ($13.00) and I LOVED THE TOAST AND BACON but my scrambled eggs were not dry enough and the hash brown was too oily & didn't taste like much. I wanted to take a picture of my food for you guys cause it was so nicely plated but since we were sharing the table with another couple I felt...weird =/ My partner had the Huevos Rancheros ($12.00) and loved every bite of it. lol =)   The coffee ($2.75 each) by the way needs work... Didn't like it. (oh and no refills) All in all I gave this place three stars (OK) because my brunch wasn't ""amazing"" like other fellow yelpers experiences with Fort Defiance but that doesn't mean I wouldn't be back to try other dishes. I do however want to try other spots in the area before returning here such as The Good Fork, Home/made and Kevin's right near bye.

"Fort Defiance left me wanting to go back just for the egg on a cheddar biscuit. --Food: My friend and I both enjoyed the food. 5 starts for presentation. 5 stars for taste.

"Red Hook hospitality, done right. My esteemed colleague and I arrived around 245pm for a late lunch today. We quickly inquired if they were still serving lunch and the man exclaimed ""Yes!

Things are off to a good start, indeed. We saddle up, and are equipped with ""small in stature, not in content"" menus, a botle of water and smiles. I frantically try to decide what to eat, as about 85 percent of it is screaming ""Eat me! Eat me!"" as I try to focus. I order a pour-over coffee, which is made for me special about 1 foot from where I sit. Can you say fresh? I can. It smells like rich, hearty caffeine. I'm caffeinated, I'm ready to order. A smiling gentleman makes several recommendations. I take him up on the offer of ""Cheddar biscuit sandwich, jalapeno jam, ham, fried egg."" It is all is cracked up to be, pun intended, move over, eat this. It's incredible. Filling, made with love, fresh, and my god its resting on a cheddar biscuit! Cheddar! I also tried a bite of my pal's corned beef sandwich, also a winner. I'm pleasantly full. The world is better. Overall, an unexpectedly wonderful customer service experience, coupled with a slammin' egg sandwich, peppered with a pour over coffee. I couldn't get much happier about my lunch at Fort Defiance. If nothing else, I'll be back to try those cocktails, enjoy a brunch in Red Hook, drink a few more pour overs, and bask in the glory of good showmanship. The space is absolutely kitsch-lovely with a twist of sophistication. Nestled on Van Brunt, a true diamond in the Fort.

"Really delicious appetizers! The chicken liver pâté still has me drooling the next day and the corned short ribs were also texturally wonderful. The service had me confused. Our first waitress just seemed utterly apathetic and out of it, and only smiled at my guy friend and ignored me when I asked how she was doing, barely acknowledged me when I was ordering. My friend suggested it might be because she thought he was paying (I paid). The second server who brought us our bill was super nice and lovely. I'll chalk it up to end of night tiredness and definitely visit again for yummy snacks. It's right across the street from my new studio and their food was just flat out lovely.",3.0
"Fort Defiance is just fun.The atmosphere is laid back, and the service is both attentive and pleasant.There is a definite rockabilly vibe to the place that is at the same time light and playful while avoiding feeling ""themed.""The oysters are perfectly prepared.  There was no grit, and whomever shucked them managed to retain all the scrumptious liquor inside.  They are served with homemade horseradish and a slightly sweet pickled garlic relish that are an excellent complement.  The cheeses (all relatively local) are excellent, as is the charcuterie assortment.The homemade ginger beer and sparkling lemonade are great, perfect for a hot summer day.I've wanted to try this place for quite some time, and they definitely did not let me down.  Absolutely a culinary destination in Red Hook.",4.0
"A very cool place for Sunday brunch which I have dined a number of times. I like the variety of choices and I'm particularly impress with their Dutch pancake.In terms of service - so, so. I arrived by myself on a Sunday morning with a number of empty tables. They seems to be eager to seat groups of 4 to 6 then trying to seat everyone. I was the last person to be seated at the bar while many groups of 2 in front of me were already seated. Still a number of tables were open. Not very considerate in my opinion.Well, I guess they were overwhelmed by a lot of patrons already, why would they care?",2.0
"described differently on the menu, the whole roasted fish over chichpeas absolutely floored me. quite possibly the most memorable dish I've had in YEARS. Service was very attentive.

Came here for brunch with my wife and enjoyed a chicken sausage scramble and a side of hash browns. The scramble was great but i kind of hoped for a bigger portion. The hash browns were nice and crispy on the outside and a bit gooey on the inside. The place is nice and clean. It's little small and the place was packed but we got the last open table so we didn't have to wait. The service was great and the food came out quickly.Would have given it a 5 if I had a bigger portion of the scramble for the price.,4.0

Please order this when you come here.Prompt and friendly service for a Saturday brunch (what sorcery is this?!), and no 2-hour wait for hearty huevos rancheros (get these!) and beans on toast.It's right next to the waterfront so you'll have something to do after stuffing your face.",5.0
"I've been trying to get over to red hook to try this place out and well...on my way to ikea...I made it happen!  First, I have to give them props for their Apple Hot Toddy!   I am not a big alcoholic beverage drinker but that drink could do it for me...perfect combination of amaretto,  cream and apple!  To start we had the apple and parsnip salad which was a pleasant yummy surprise.  We then shared two entrees:  the sea bass and risotto minus the pancette and sausage...I'm on a no meat kick this week...don't judge me :)  The portions are perfect for sharing and everything was delicious and just perfect!  Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert...but that gives me a reason to come back!",5.0

"I'm revising my review because I've found the way I love Fort Defiance: for weekend brunch, sitting at the bar.They offer a fabulous prix fixe brunch deal, with entree, side, coffee and cocktail for 20 bucks. Considering many of their drinks have double-digit price tags, that's a steal.The tables are a little too close for my taste, but at the bar, I'm simultaneously a little removed from the hubbub and have a great perch to watch everything, including the bartenders. In my experience, it seems the wait staff can be stretched thin working the tables, but at the bar, I've always been well tended. So my tip: go for brunch on the early-ish side, ideally Saturday and not Sunday, and sit at the bar. Get the Dutch pancake and a bloody Mary. It's pretty close to perfect.",4.0
"This is a true gem.  The restaurant drew us in with the charm it exudes.  It is cozy with warm lighting and nice decor.

"If you can get your ass to Red Hook, this is one of the best Brunch w/ Cocktail options in the entire city, not just Brooklyn. Amazing food, homey bar atmosphere with a low-key vibe, great staff and a fantastic cocktail list that runs all day.As many know, Fort Defiance was one of the hardest hit businesses in Red Hook in the wake of Sandy. They have just recently reopened, and I cannot stress enough that this place both needs and deserves your business, so please check it out and support them!Highly recommend just about anything of the Brunch Menu. As for cocktails, I recommend Classics that most bars do not have for Brunch, like the Bourbon Milk Punch and Ramos Gin Fizz. If you want something more boozy and stirred, the Red Hook Criterium is based on a wonderful Rhubarb Amaro called Zucca. Off Menu, they will also make you the Trinidad Sour invented by Giuseppe Gonzalez, which is an amazing study in Angostura Bitters. 1 full ounce of Bitters mixed with Rye, Lemon and Orgeat (Almond syrup), this drink is beautifully controlled chaos that promises to be one of the most memorable, funky and delicious drinks you've ever had.Definitely on THE LIST:yelp.com/list/best-cockt…",4.0

She was so unpleasant it is sad that I can't go back. My advice if you get someone who is making your experience terrible tell a manager. All other staff was always very kind and didn't almost burn us or give us other peoples food. So it is probably worth trying for yourself.",2.0

"We went on a Friday night after going to the Widow Jane distillery to pick up some bourbon. Fort Defiance is just around the corner, so it made sense to kill two birds with one stone and eat in Red Hook. We were able to walk into Fort Defiance and get a table even though it was quite busy. The menu wasn't over-burdened with nonsense, and the chef seems to pay attention to seasonality. We started with a dozen oysters. Every restaurant has its own version of a classic mignonette and Fort Defiance's was excellent, very astute use of shallots and a good vinegar base. The oysters were on ice with fresh horseradish and lemon. Oysters vary on availability and the night we dined... I want to say that they were Caraquets. Small, extraordinary delicate, a tremendous subtly that simply isn't present in better known Malpeques, Wellfleets and the like. At least I think they were Caraquets. Whatever they were, we initially ordered six, but they were so good we immediately ordered another six. We also had the chicken liver paté. It was astonishingly rich and smooth, served with a bacon onion relish and crusty bread (though perhaps not quite enough bread). The paté had a complexity not usually seen in something that is usually presented as a rustic dish. We then had a couple of the salads. We both tried the same one, pear and watercress. Very peppery dressing might have be too complementary for watercress regardless of the sweetness of the pears, apples and grapes. There was a hint perhaps of cheddar but I didn't really taste that much of it. I think that the salad's composition was muddled. We finished with one of their own deserts, a cherry crumble, tea and espresso. The food was fresh and excellently presented. The wait staff was harried due to the number of diners so a few minor mistakes were made (I received the wrong drink order, I didn't mind, but was given a complementary drink anyways). All in all a good night.",4.0
"After half a dozen visits for Brunch, it's about time to review this little gem on Van Brunt St. Waits can vary but weekends in red hook can range from stillness to madhouse.

In our recent visit, the menu changed and our faves were rotated out. We found an equally tasty substitute in the French toast, just the perfect amount of sweetness and crunch to the perimeter topped with some candied almonds (no need for syrup here). Hash browns are on point, it's a small portion for the price, but any bigger and your arteries will be paying the price, thanks for looking out for my LDL count Fort Defiance.

(She did mention that the little kid at the table next to us had been kicking her on and off throughout the meal, though, so watch out for naughty children!)

But not to worry, I poached my companion's toast points that accompanied the Olive Tapenade spread. Lovely.We continued the shared experience with Mussels, a light and summery Panzenella salad (new favorite salad) and Sautéed Hen-of-the-Woods mushrooms. The latter had a hint of rosemary and garlic in it - simple and earthy. It grounded the meal.While we were stuffed, I couldn't resist trying the Berry Crumble. Although I've had better, I was happy with the lack of added sugar so the flavors of the fruit could peek through.Two glasses of a good Côtes-du-Rhones and thus the meal was ended.

"The food was pretty good; however:-it took about 15 minutes to get a regular cup of coffee-it took about 25 minutes to get a gingerade and a brunch cocktail-they delivered our food to the people next to us (who came in and ordered after us)-my eggs were over easy instead of medium, I had to remind them I ordered a biscuit, and I had to request the jam that comes with the biscuit-there was some obvious hostility between the wait staff and the bar staffKeep in mind, we sat AT the bar. I may give it one more shot, but it certainly failed to meet expectations.",2.0

"My girlfriend and I had a late brunch here. Parking was super easy. We both got the prix fixe with a cocktail (I got the one w/ tea), dutch pancake (super filling), and OJ. The service was good. This was my first time in Red Hook. Since parking is so easy and it's close to my gf and I, I'd probably be back again. We walked off the food at IKEA.",4.0
"This is a super cute spot, and it's not every day I get over to Red Hook riding my fixed gear and accompanied by a lovely friend as I was Sunday night.  Alas finding any vegetarian options on this menu will put you in a defiant mood real quick, although they did have delicioius marinated asparagus and deviled eggs.  I'll note though that their beer and cocktail selection was excellent and sixpoint being right around the corner, they had very good Bengali IPA which is one of my favs.  So that helped to save things.All and all I really liked the place, the vibe is way chill, very quiet and I felt like it's some hidden corner of new york that even Brooklynites rarely tread.",3.0
"Decided to go on an adventure in Red Hook without much planning last weekend... I was surprised that a lot seemed to be closed/kinda dead. But we did see this cute cafe/restaurant/bar and decided to drop in for a snack. We got deviled eggs, oysters, cheese and pie. A lovely gouter for the late afternoon, if you ask me. Everything was really delicious, and the wait staff was pleasant. It was cozy and casual... perfect for catching up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. (She did mention that the little kid at the table next to us had been kicking her on and off throughout the meal, though, so watch out for naughty children!)

"Red Hook has really grown on me since being expertly shepherded through the neighborhood by some friends. Likewise, having now made a few visits, Fort Defiance has grown on me as well. It's a mix of well-executed, sort-of-hipster-inspired motif, great cocktails, and solid food options.The interior of Fort Defiance isn't very large given the popularity of this spot, so it can get a little crowded in the evening. Honestly, this place is probably at its best during the day when the waiters seem slightly more attentive and the pace is generally less hectic. My first trip to Fort Defiance, during prime hours, was a comical disaster as far as table service goes. We had a group of 8 people and the waiter seemed intent on coming over, taking one drink order, getting the drink and bringing it back before taking another order. This happened twice before we had to ask if he could just take all of our orders.But, I've not had that problem since and Fort Defiance mixes one hell of a good drink so it's probably good that I waited on my review. All told, Fort Defiance is a great spot for some eats and drinks in Red Hook. It's not my favorite spot in the area, but its earned a place on my list of places to visit on those occasions that I wander from my safe haven amid the well-to-do, gentrified, denizens of Park Slope out to the wilds of Red Hook.",4.0

"Our second spontaneous evening in Red Hook, to savor the local flavor was a little less successful than our first meal at neighboring Hope & Anchor. Fort Defiance wins on looks - the type of place that has the character and dignity of a well-kept octogenarian - but the service was confused and sluggish, and the limited menu, though rather good, was on the expensive (~$25 entrees) side, all things considered.If you happen to find yourself here, I'd recommend the braised pork tongue appetizer ($12), wonderfully tender, and plated over the creamiest of applesauces.",3.0
"This is a review of cocktails only. The decor is a mix of a blue-collar fishing watering hole cum Havana in the 1970s. The walls are painted a teal green, which gives the place a non-US feel? I felt transported back into a different era and when I perused the drink menu, I knew I had been transported to a tropical island circa 1960s. The owner used to be involved with Pegu Club. Now, Pegu makes some kick-ass cocktails. Not your run of the mill cocktail. There was thought put into creating the cocktail list and I am very impressed. I like when cocktails challenge me. Here is what the mixologist created: 1. St. John's Martini - I am not sure what or who the ""St. John"" is referring to (the US Virgin Island or a pseudonym for the owner?), but I do know that it was clean, crisp, dry and the best martini I have had in Brooklyn. The lemon twist was just right. 2. Singapore Sling - I have only seen this cocktail in campy Chinese Restaurants that try to be Polynesian and exotic. Sigh. But this was a nice surprise. This almost beats my mom's version. I don't think I like sweet cocktails and while this one was sweet, it was still also strong. Thanks for making this drink trendy again. 3. Goombay Smash - This drink knocked my socks off. I really love the Caribbeans, and the reason being...RUM, warm weather, beautiful beaches, beautiful people. Needless to say, this drink originates from the Blue Bee Bar in New Plymouth, Bahamas. The drink consists of white and dark rum, coconut liqueur, and pineapple juice. I would like to think of it as an adult and more sophisticated version of a pina colada minus the sweetness. This drink had me thinking about it for days and also I happily went googling and found this wonderful website, the owner of Fort Defiance is also a prolific writer.

"We went for brunch on Saturday and I was blown away as to how damn good this place is. I have been by it a bunch of times and thought ""I need to go in there"". So, Saturday we parked ourselves at the bar in front of the individually dripped coffee cups and started salivating the moment we read the brunch menu.First, the vibe in there is great - totally laid back, neighborhoody, funky and relaxed. Like someone's super cool, carefully curated living room (ok, with tables and chairs). Anyway, we ordered steak & eggs, the smoked trout salad, side of biscuits and extra hash browns. I know, kind of carbo loading, but well, it's brunch!The salad was light, fresh, smoky and just delicious. Tons of mixed baby greens and a good amount of smoked dry flaked on top. The biscuits are seriously the best I have had - light and flakey inside and a little salty but with a nice crunch on the outside. I scarfed it down very fast and we ordered another. The steak and eggs for my husband - super duper delicious. Not a huge hunk of meat, but a nicely charred, med-rare rectangular cut of skirt steak that was juicy and meaty and peppery. Eggs, beautifully cooked. And the crowning jewel - the HASH BROWNS. They are shredded and then re-assembled to look a little like a latke. Absolutely everything was really high quality - even the eggs had a dark yellow yolk (not your regular store bought eggs). You can tell that the people at Fort Defiance really care about the food they serve. The service was wonderful, served with a smile not rushed, but not slow either. They were really busy in there, but we felt completely taken care of.There were a ton of other items on the menu that we wanted to order but as you can see we ordered quite a bit. Luckily the strong freshly brewed coffee help to cut the food coma!I CAN NOT wait to go back there again for brunch and also for dinner - I highly recommend going!",5.0
"** Dinner Review **Came here for dinner the other night and had one heck of a good meal. This place has a killer drink list, but to be honest, all I wanted was a good beer (and it was just that!). Boyfriend had a specialty drink and it was delicious. Only drink that wasn't top notch was the pinot noir they had by the glass -- it was pretty tasteless/watered down.We ordered a salad and one of their special sides (kale'ish kind of green, sauteed with lots of garlic and chili). The salad was great -- fresh tasty greens, dressing was delish and dressed perfectly -- not too much, not too little. My greens were awesome -- well seasoned, very well prepared.We never order the same thing, but we were both in the mood for the fish stew. Gladly, it didn't disappoint -- it was great. Lots of calamari, mussels, pieces of white fish, etc in a very light fish broth with just a hint of tomato. Lots of fresh parsley. We both licked the bowl clean.One point of warning: other people have said it, but worth saying again. The menu isn't extensive so this is really a place you either sign on to the dishes they have or you're going to feel like you don't have enough options. That said, the dishes are prepared very well, so they at least hit it with execution on the limited menu.",4.0
"Iced coffee was superb, it's strong and totally helped us to wake up on a hot and humid weekend morning.Opened for about a month, they only have a small menu for lunch when we went this past Sunday, but it has a pretty good range for all the meat-eaters to non-meat-eaters. 4 sandwiches: Muffaletta (tons of different meat), Banh Mi (with ""homemade"" pork pate), Italian Tuna, and an Asparagus sandwich; all on different kinds of bread. They also served a Salad of the Day and various pastries.We had the Banh Mi (spicy) and the Italian Tuna sandwiches. The sandwiches were quite delicate and full of flavours. We were satisfied afterwards. (Others have already commented on these sandwiches.) Wait staff were friendly and attentive. Would love to go back for a drink!3.5 stars, really. I do like this place, but somehow I just can't give it 4 stars. I don't know why. Perhaps after next time?",3.0
"Amazing amount of care put into everything served here. Great margarita created by a recipe from Tommy's legendary mexican restaurant in San Francisco. Great fresh oysters from Massachusetts. Nice bartenders and an excellent atmosphere. If the drinks were a touch less expensive ($8) or they had a less expensive beer available to have after your first ""treat"" drink, I'd give it five stars. But, nonetheless, a very good place. I'll be back!",4.0
"I've been here for Sunday brunch twice and both times were great.  Pros:Super-friendly service and tasty food.  First time I had the Biscuit and Gravy, which was a little different than your standard B&G.  The single biscuit is huge with a crispy exterior and very dense (almost pound cake texture) inside.  The gravy comes with big chunks of sausage and covers the biscuit and 2 eggs.  The second time I ventured out a little more and went with the Cold Fried Chicken w/ oysters and bacon, and based on the waitresses recommendation a side of greens.  Chicken was cooked perfectly and somehow maintained a crispiness, despite being room temperature.  The bacon is thick cut and delicious.  The greens were a great suggestion and helped cut some of the saltiness from the chicken/oysters/bacon.  Coffee always seems fresh and tasty.Cons:It's tight space but I haven't been to too many places in NY that aren't.  And it fills up fast on Sunday mornings.  Get there early.",4.0
"Our waiter was the ""brunch dr."" His prognosis was spot on and enthusiastically delivered. The food itself was delicious! We opted for the chicken sausage scramble and breakfast sandwich. Enjoyed in a cozy and charming atmosphere. Will definitely return!",5.0
"After visiting Fort Defiance I felt like I should be living near this restaurant so I can go there for breakfast, lunch and dinner... After visiting that famous build-your-own-furniture store in Red Hook we decided to get late lunch / early dinner before taking the water taxi back to the South Street Seaport. After a ten minute walk we were front of the Fort Defiance around 4:30 in the afternoon but at that time they already finished their brunch (which is a great deal $20) service and they were getting ready to start their dinner service at 5:30 but they were still serving the cheese/meat platter with drinks from the bar so that's what we settled for.Fort Defiance offer some great drink combinations made with premium and exotic brands around the world as well as fresh juices. We went with the Breakfast Martini, Barbados Buck (variation of the Dark and Stormy) and the Cucumber Collins. at $8, $8 and $9 each. They drink menu changes for brunch and dinner but there are always some amazing concoctions for any taste.After finishing our drinks and cheese/meat platter and couple of cappuccinos we were still hungry for more but it was still not the dinner time so we decided to go and explore the neighborhood and come back for dinner in about half an hour.This is a really nice area of the Brooklyn and it still quickly developing to be the next Williamsburg or Dumbo with old warehouses being converted to residential lofts, new cafes, bars and restaurants popping up around the area. We returned for dinner at 5:30 and even at that time half of the restaurant was full. It looked like crowd was half and half with locals and those made the trip from Manhattan. When you are at the door daily specials are marked on the outside with chalk which was kind of cool and unusual at the same time. We were seated in the back of the small dining room which holds about twenty tables. There is also the bar area which is the main attraction of the restaurant.Menu changes weekly but there are few items seem to remain like the side dishes, desserts, etc. From what we were told chef always picks out what's fresh, local and in season. That day's special was roasted red snapper, pork chop and a steak dish so we both picked the red snapper at $21 which was a generous portion along with a side of Hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, with bottle of Alsace at $26 to go with our meal. We finish the dinner with chocolate pudding with home made whipped cream on top which I thought it was the best pudding I've ever had for a long time.I am looking for reasons to go back to Red Hook either for lunch, brunch or dinner so we can try some of the other options in the menu. This is such a great place that once you go, you want to keep going back because of the comfortable atmosphere, friendly service, delicious food at very reasonable prices and amazing cocktails.",4.0
"My husband and I are on the Redhook kick.  We have stumbled upon some great gems, but this is Not one of them.  Firstly, the menu is limited.  Also, they stop serving at 3, but start serving ""snacks"" at 3:30, and then dinner at 5:30.  Now, this timeline was Not shared with us at 2:45 when we got there.  It is also Not posted anywhere.  In anycase we ordered the brunch, eggs, toast, bacon, and hash brown.  Bacon and hash browns looked as though they had been sitting and were about to be thrown out.  There wasn't enough ketchup on the table to make the hashbrowns moist.  The eggs were ok.  The waiter although sarcastic and short, seemed to have a good vibe with the patrons.  An example is when some ladies walked in and he said oh its 3:15, we stop serving food at 3.  The ladies said, oh we didn't know and he said, well now you do.  Anyway, not sure if we just picked the wrong time on a Sunday, but we will not be going here again.",2.0
"The perfect spot for dinner after the BWAC art show (yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-wa…). I regret that I couldn't partake of any of the cocktails that Yelpers have recommended so highly, so my review is only for the food. We had a mozzarella appetizer, escarole-lemon salad, and the duck breast special. All were delicious, beautifully presented, and IMO not overpriced. Our server was prompt and polite. We appreciated having a bottle of water on the table rather than waiting for someone to notice that our glasses needed refilling. One thing I didn't like was the noise level. It was seriously hard to have a conversation in there.",4.0

"We went for brunch on Saturday and I was blown away as to how damn good this place is. I have been by it a bunch of times and thought ""I need to go in there"". So, Saturday we parked ourselves at the bar in front of the individually dripped coffee cups and started salivating the moment we read the brunch menu.First, the vibe in there is great - totally laid back, neighborhoody, funky and relaxed. Like someone's super cool, carefully curated living room (ok, with tables and chairs). Anyway, we ordered steak & eggs, the smoked trout salad, side of biscuits and extra hash browns. I know, kind of carbo loading, but well, it's brunch!The salad was light, fresh, smoky and just delicious. Tons of mixed baby greens and a good amount of smoked dry flaked on top. The biscuits are seriously the best I have had - light and flakey inside and a little salty but with a nice crunch on the outside. I scarfed it down very fast and we ordered another. The steak and eggs for my husband - super duper delicious. Not a huge hunk of meat, but a nicely charred, med-rare rectangular cut of skirt steak that was juicy and meaty and peppery.

To close the evening (and prep myself for braving the cold during the much-anticipated walk back), I selected the Hot Apple Toddy.

So good! The cocktails are great and the assorted meats and cheeses are delicious. The only downside to this place is that it's a pain to get to and it can be hard to accommodate larger groups.

"I recently organized an outing to Red Hook for an afternoon of urban exploration and day drinking with my friends. We stumbled upon (literally, really) Fort Defiance and came in for a fancy drink, admitting to the host that yes, we were on a bar crawl of sorts, and no, we wouldn't get all rowdy and scare away their guests. We've been known to do that.The bartender (to call her just that is an understatement - she was a connoisseur of liqueurs) talked us through the incredible drink menu. I opted for the Coffie Van Brunt, a rich hot drink featured in Bon Appetit that was heavy with cream, coffee, rum and an orange flavor that emerged on the back end. It was decadent.My friends and I tried the following and recommend them all: cherry Manhattan, Marconi Wireless (apple brandy w/ sweet vermouth - wow!) and a drink made with St. Lucia rum. They were all were delicious, but also contained many different flavors that kept the drink interesting. A big round of applause to Abigail, our amazing bartender. She made our trip to Red Hook so special and we're enthusiastically still talking about our cocktails to anyone who will listen.",5.0

Fort Defiance! Your menu alienates vegetarian customers. The Monday veggie burger is a joke. All vegetarians I know hate Dr. Praeger's. Home made ones are SO much better. That's my recommendation.,2.0
"A perfect afternoon:1) Go to Fort Defiance for lunch and get the burger.  It is organic, it is tasty, and it will make your soul happy.  The burger is NOT served at dinner, so you must come at lunch if you want to experience it.2) Go to Baked (it's on the next block) and get a salted caramel cupcake and a latte.  Read a book.  Go crazy.3) Go home and take a nap.  The End",4.0
So good! The cocktails are great and the assorted meats and cheeses are delicious. The only downside to this place is that it's a pain to get to and it can be hard to accommodate larger groups. The staff is very friendly and accommodating when they can be. They do not take reservations but if you ask nicely and you have a largish group they will try to work with you.,4.0
"I recently organized an outing to Red Hook for an afternoon of urban exploration and day drinking with my friends. We stumbled upon (literally, really) Fort Defiance and came in for a fancy drink, admitting to the host that yes, we were on a bar crawl of sorts, and no, we wouldn't get all rowdy and scare away their guests. We've been known to do that.The bartender (to call her just that is an understatement - she was a connoisseur of liqueurs) talked us through the incredible drink menu. I opted for the Coffie Van Brunt, a rich hot drink featured in Bon Appetit that was heavy with cream, coffee, rum and an orange flavor that emerged on the back end. It was decadent.My friends and I tried the following and recommend them all: cherry Manhattan, Marconi Wireless (apple brandy w/ sweet vermouth - wow!) and a drink made with St. Lucia rum. They were all were delicious, but also contained many different flavors that kept the drink interesting. A big round of applause to Abigail, our amazing bartender. She made our trip to Red Hook so special and we're enthusiastically still talking about our cocktails to anyone who will listen.",5.0
"Going to Red Hook seems like a getaway.  Fort Defiance was the low point of our trip, though.  The vibe in the place is good, and we'd heard good things.  Service was poor.  The bartender disappeared on us while we waited for our table.  I passed on the omelette of the day, telling the waitress I don't eat ham.  She neglected to tell me the greens came with bacon.  Coffee came without spoons or sugar.The poached eggs were well cooked, the corn bread OK.My wife, a native Southerner, was disappointed the greens were just sauteed with the bacon.  My alternative fruit cup look like it came from a bodega.  Not worth the $50, really.",3.0
"4 starts since this is a great addition to Red Hook. The pros:- Delicious cocktails and house-made sodas at very reasonable prices (relatively speaking). - Yummy brunch - Yummy deviled eggs- They do cool things for the community like serve delicious fried chicken at an outdoor movie at Valentino Pier and some of their ingredients are sourced as local as you can get: from the nearby Added Value farm. The cons:- Haven't had dinner proper since I never want anything that's on the menu, and I know several people that have said the same. And I consider myself a more ""adventurous"" eater that was raised on eastern european food...I'm just never in the mood for blood sausage or venison when I'm there, and honestly I almost never am, especially in the heat of the summer.  A larger, more varied menu or a more constantly revolving one would be ideal and would catapult this place into five-stardom for me.Thanks, Fort D!",4.0

These were spicy and sweet with a delicious tangy bite and a fun texture from mustard seeds. Each bite really revealed something else. I loved discovering all the other ingredients: celery salt, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, and greek yogurt (which I think makes these the smoothest, creamiest deviled eggs ever).I wish I could say that the rest of Fort Defiance's dishes were as successful. We also ordered a Green Papaya Salad with Duck Confit. This salad was bordering on disgusting. The confit was fatty and cold. Who wants to eat cold fat (unless it's in ice cream)?

Needless to say, I didn't finish the salad.The Pat LaFrieda skirt steak wasn't nearly as offensive as the salad but I still found it lacking. The meat was overcooked (we ordered it medium rare) and the chimichurri sauce didn't add much to the dish.

The menu changes daily so this'll only give you an idea as to what you may expect:-Frisee salad with poached plums, toasted spiced pecans, and blue cheese.  Perfect balance between the sweetness of the plum and blue cheese. It was genius and reminds me while ill never venture beyond ""amateur"" chef. -Braised short rib over horseradish mashed with a side of swiss chard. Classically executed. -Salsify Soup.

"ok so i've been here three times now: the first was for dinner and drinks, the second was just cocktails, and the third was for brunch. (at which one of the specialty cocktails sounded amazing but we were with my future parents-in-law so unfortunately i had to resist ordering it.)  but the point is: it's been a variety.and, i'm still torn between giving them 3 stars or 4.  the cocktails are very good, but perhaps not as wide-ranging as i would like... on our first visit, i ordered my first drink from the menu and really enjoyed it, but then for the second round i asked the bartender to make me something off-menu and she just made me a hemingway daiquiri, which is... fine... but not as unusual or special as i hope for when asking the bartender to get creative.on our second visit, i just ordered the same cocktail i'd had for round #1 on our first visit, because the menu hadn't changed and it was the only thing that interested me.  like i said, the special drink when we were there for brunch sounded fantastic, but sadly i didn't get to try it.food-wise... i can't entirely remember what i ate.  our dinner on visit 1 was good but not outstanding.  i had the braised pork tongue, which was actually really good, and i think i had one of the cheeses? and i don't remember what my bf had, maybe some kind of stew or chicken pot pie or something?  on our third visit, we were there for brunch so i had one of the more basic egg dishes (just eggs, toast, and bacon on the side) and it was fine but just that: fine.  my bf had the egg sandwich that comes on a cheddar biscuit, i think he liked it but he likes everything.i don't know... i don't have any specific complaints but there's nothing that blows me away.  i should say that our server at brunch was terrific... but that's the only thing i've felt was particularly noteworthy from all of these visits.  i'm happy to go back for a drink if we're in the neighborhood (perhaps eating a lobster dinner at the lobster pound) but i wouldn't trek over specifically to eat here.",3.0

St. John (""Sin-Gin""), the proprietor of FD, acts as barkeep on certain nights of the week, and I'm terribly glad he does. He masterfully wields a brass monkey like few I've seen, and it's clear that he genuinely cares about the final product.  Two'll get you buzzed and by the third you'll wish your commute home wasn't upwards of two hours, and then you'll fall asleep in the cab.

The menu changes daily so this'll only give you an idea as to what you may expect:-Frisee salad with poached plums, toasted spiced pecans, and blue cheese.  Perfect balance between the sweetness of the plum and blue cheese. It was genius and reminds me while ill never venture beyond ""amateur"" chef. -Braised short rib over horseradish mashed with a side of swiss chard. Classically executed. -Salsify Soup. Had never heard of Salsify before, but am glad I now know it exists. -Collared Greens. Best I've had. -""Gingerbread cocktail"" - gingerbread, whipped cream, candied ginger, and pureed pumpkin. AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!The quality of the cocktails has been covered already. I concur.  I just thought it was worthwhile to bring attention to the quality of the food here.  So, here. I have popped my yelp cherry.  Apologies to the following amazing meals over the past year who have been neglected and could have all just as eaily popped my cherry: Taim (numerous), Express Power Lunch Food Kart (numerous), Minetta Tavern (!!!!), Banh Mi Food Cart at Pearl and William, Craft, Wichcraft Dinner, Lucalis (numerous), Di Fara (square slice), City Sub,  DiStefanos, Primehouse (65 day dry aged), Lugers (for the Burger and bacon. Porterhouse was whatever) and crap im forgetting a bunch of others. Until next time (whenever that is). :)",5.0
"ok so i've been here three times now: the first was for dinner and drinks, the second was just cocktails, and the third was for brunch. (at which one of the specialty cocktails sounded amazing but we were with my future parents-in-law so unfortunately i had to resist ordering it.)  but the point is: it's been a variety.and, i'm still torn between giving them 3 stars or 4.  the cocktails are very good, but perhaps not as wide-ranging as i would like... on our first visit, i ordered my first drink from the menu and really enjoyed it, but then for the second round i asked the bartender to make me something off-menu and she just made me a hemingway daiquiri, which is... fine... but not as unusual or special as i hope for when asking the bartender to get creative.on our second visit, i just ordered the same cocktail i'd had for round #1 on our first visit, because the menu hadn't changed and it was the only thing that interested me.  like i said, the special drink when we were there for brunch sounded fantastic, but sadly i didn't get to try it.food-wise... i can't entirely remember what i ate.  our dinner on visit 1 was good but not outstanding.  i had the braised pork tongue, which was actually really good, and i think i had one of the cheeses? and i don't remember what my bf had, maybe some kind of stew or chicken pot pie or something?  on our third visit, we were there for brunch so i had one of the more basic egg dishes (just eggs, toast, and bacon on the side) and it was fine but just that: fine.  my bf had the egg sandwich that comes on a cheddar biscuit, i think he liked it but he likes everything.i don't know... i don't have any specific complaints but there's nothing that blows me away.  i should say that our server at brunch was terrific... but that's the only thing i've felt was particularly noteworthy from all of these visits.  i'm happy to go back for a drink if we're in the neighborhood (perhaps eating a lobster dinner at the lobster pound) but i wouldn't trek over specifically to eat here.",3.0
"Who needs food when you have some of the most delicious, carefully-made, reasonably-priced cocktails in the land? ""Nawt meee!"" (said slurred-ly). (For the record, obviously, this review is based solely on the cocktails, though I hear from reliable sources that the food and coffee are both excellent.) St. John (""Sin-Gin""), the proprietor of FD, acts as barkeep on certain nights of the week, and I'm terribly glad he does. He masterfully wields a brass monkey like few I've seen, and it's clear that he genuinely cares about the final product.  Two'll get you buzzed and by the third you'll wish your commute home wasn't upwards of two hours, and then you'll fall asleep in the cab. Or maybe that's just me.",5.0

"Fort Defiance is a really great place if you are looking for a relazed midday munch. I've not yet tried their dinner menu but their afternoon snackeries are so delumptious it's ridiculous. I'd never before tried deviled eggs but I just about scarfed down 4 of those they were so delicious and well-made.Same goes for their pressed sandwiches: the bread is great, the cheese, the everything!Fort Defiance is the place to go if you are looking for good food accompanied by a laid-back, friendly, easy going vibe.",5.0
"Gang of Eight and a Full Moon -went in Sept.M said ""Let's go to Fort Defiance on Sunday""Interesting, because we walked by not too long ago.... For lunch they offer Muffaltetta 'n Bánh Mì which is brilliant.  Because Little Italy and Chinatown is way to far for a fix!I like their idea as Red Hook is a new frontier for all things ""new"" if you will.  With just a few items on the dinner menu, a couple of daily specials and a few apps...The octopus was cooked perfectly and seasoned well,  ragu was a hit.and catfish was alright.  Dark 'n Stormy was more on the soda side (unexpected from the norm) and served in a pint glass.Margarita was tart 'n fine.If I lived here I can safely say ""yes"" because I love supporting neighborhood joints but for a dinner experience I prefer The Good Fork.",3.0

"Buried deep in Red Hook, Fort Defiance is a place you want to like for the name alone!  It won't disappoint!While the cocktail menu, beer and wine lists dominate the menu, we tried three of the four entree offerings, and they were all delicious.*The Hanger steak over a bed of Heirloom tomatoes was served at room temperature, which bothered me at first, but after a few bites, I decided it went very well with the fresh from the farm chilled tomatoes.  Maybe this should be emphasized more as a salad, but it was very tasty, and I would order it again.Another hit was the Mustard rubbed BBQ ribs, served with Grits and Corn Bread.  Two of my companions banged forks across the table, in celebration of making the best choice of entrees!More impressive than the entrees, were the appetizers- Olive Tapenade with toasts, which was chunky, hand chopped, with bits of red bell pepper and very refreshing.  And I certainly wouldn't miss the  Squash and summer vegetables Gratin!  Wow.It may be better known for it's impressive list of cocktails and beers on tap, but if they expanded the menu, by say, one or two more entrees, it would become a more frequent dining spot by us, for sure.Next time I go, I may order a handful of appetizers, and mix it up with a few cocktails or a beer sampling.*The menu changes weekly.PS.  If you're in Red Hook, heading to The Good Fork?  Turn around, walk up Van Brunt a block and check out Fort Defiance.  You'll be much happier and more satisfied!",4.0
"Friends, the brunch menu showcases southern foods, in huge portions.I had the simple egg sandwich with fontina cheese and an iced decaf. People: the sandwich. It was soft where it needed to be, toasty, and cheesy. I didn't feel like a brunch glutton afterwards. My tiny Brikram-loving friend had the enormous ass muffaletta sandwich - several italian cold meats, chopped olives, lots of cheese, tomato & plenty of oil & vinegar and salt.

"Excellent service and food with a casual cafe ambiance.  We went on a Wednesday night, and probably would not dare go on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night - the space is very small and can get very loud, and with one bartender I can imagine a long wait for complicated cocktails.The food was extremely salty (a bid to sell more booze, no doubt), but well-executed.  Salty chicken taken home and left to sit in the fridge for a few hours was less salty during midnight snack.  The mussels (while salty), were cooked perfectly - a rarity these days.All in all, the food was practically flawless and delivered on its promises.  The prices are reasonable - the booze will up your bill.",4.0

"The first time I went here, I was astonished at how awesome it was--delicious grits, pour-over coffee from Counter Culture, best biscuits in town. The serious trek from Williamsburg to Red Hook was a frequent fixture in my imagined future. Been there 4 times now, and it is extremely uneven. Disclaimer: I have only ever had brunch here.For the record: The grits and biscuits are always outstanding.But: the coffee takes forever and, depending on the bartender making it, can be incredibly poorly done. Like, hard-to-drink-this-even-though-I-am-falling-asleep-at-the-table bad. The food is also hit or miss. The grillades and grits, even though it sounds good, is heavy-handed with a mediocre sauce that masks the tasty grits (I know, third time. I will stop); maybe it's there to compensate for the flavorless veal. If you're going to eat an animal that has lived its live chained to a kennel, that shit better be tasty; this is not.The omeletes are also pretty bad, which is kind of unfortunate; they're generally way too thick, and then thin on the filling. Basically a giant egg pancake with garnish.And then there's the service. The lady with the stars tattoo is lovely; the incompetent stoner we had recently was comically bad. Everything he did took 10 minutes; he clearly forgot to put our order in, only remembering that we were sitting there empty-tabled about 30 minutes into our meal. Most of the time, he just lazed about the dining room with a dazed look on his face. The best was when the table next to us asked for some fake sweetener: He went and got it, and then kinda tossed it onto a table across the dining room that was in the process of packing up and walking out the door. If you get this place on a good day, though, it can be a startlingly good meal.",3.0
"On a weekday afternoon, it was quiet and very pleasant, with very good food.  My corned beef sandwich was a bit gristly (if you don't like that, you don't like corned beef) sliced thick with REALLY good flavor, just the right amount of horseradish mayonnaise, excellent bread, lightly paninied and perfect dandelion greens with a sharp dressing that complemented the meat nicely.  My wife had perfectly poached eggs over very good multi-grain toast and green tea served in a very thick, heat-retaining pot.Service was just right, courteous but not overbearing..Even after the weekday lunch rush, the kitchen was VERY slow.HOWEVER, we tried to go last Sunday for brunch and the very slow-moving line went out the door and down the block.  We waited 15 minutes and the line didn't move at all, so we left.  It's hardly their fault for being popular, but the overall experience was 2 stars",4.0

REALLY super into this place. Part of me wishes it was more accessible so that I could frequent it more often. But most of me is glad it is not so that the charm remains. We had cocktails and they were so tasty. Pisco sour to start and some sort of alcohol darjeeling tea cocktail later on. Yum and yummier. Also the crowd was amazingly friendly and what a melange of patrons. Red hook is another (fabulous) world in its own.,5.0

"The first time I went here, I was astonished at how awesome it was--delicious grits, pour-over coffee from Counter Culture, best biscuits in town. The serious trek from Williamsburg to Red Hook was a frequent fixture in my imagined future. Been there 4 times now, and it is extremely uneven. Disclaimer: I have only ever had brunch here.For the record: The grits and biscuits are always outstanding.But: the coffee takes forever and, depending on the bartender making it, can be incredibly poorly done. Like, hard-to-drink-this-even-though-I-am-falling-asleep-at-the-table bad. The food is also hit or miss. The grillades and grits, even though it sounds good, is heavy-handed with a mediocre sauce that masks the tasty grits (I know, third time. I will stop); maybe it's there to compensate for the flavorless veal. If you're going to eat an animal that has lived its live chained to a kennel, that shit better be tasty; this is not.The omeletes are also pretty bad, which is kind of unfortunate; they're generally way too thick, and then thin on the filling. Basically a giant egg pancake with garnish.And then there's the service. The lady with the stars tattoo is lovely; the incompetent stoner we had recently was comically bad. Everything he did took 10 minutes; he clearly forgot to put our order in, only remembering that we were sitting there empty-tabled about 30 minutes into our meal. Most of the time, he just lazed about the dining room with a dazed look on his face. The best was when the table next to us asked for some fake sweetener: He went and got it, and then kinda tossed it onto a table across the dining room that was in the process of packing up and walking out the door. If you get this place on a good day, though, it can be a startlingly good meal.",3.0
"On a weekday afternoon, it was quiet and very pleasant, with very good food.  My corned beef sandwich was a bit gristly (if you don't like that, you don't like corned beef) sliced thick with REALLY good flavor, just the right amount of horseradish mayonnaise, excellent bread, lightly paninied and perfect dandelion greens with a sharp dressing that complemented the meat nicely.  My wife had perfectly poached eggs over very good multi-grain toast and green tea served in a very thick, heat-retaining pot.Service was just right, courteous but not overbearing..Even after the weekday lunch rush, the kitchen was VERY slow.HOWEVER, we tried to go last Sunday for brunch and the very slow-moving line went out the door and down the block.  We waited 15 minutes and the line didn't move at all, so we left.  It's hardly their fault for being popular, but the overall experience was 2 stars",4.0

"Just had my birthday brunch at Ft. D.  and before i divulge the specifics,i have to add a heavy caveat:  because i love red hook in any circumstances, meals here--whether bought at fairway and eaten picnic-style at ikea park, or served by an over-burdened skinny glam rock waiter at o'barone during a several-blocks-long power outage--are always memorable and likely to get me waxing.and so it was today, after a short, wet bike ride with Rebecca the Intrepid, from park slope to RH, where we met mark, chase, and chris, to celebrate my birthday.3 of us ordered the special omelet--basil and tomatoes tucked in with some mellow cheese--maybe fontina--and toast (i substituted grits).  mark ordered eggs n beans over toast, and chase ordered the charleston: beautifully-poached eggs over skillet cornbread, a tiny heap of suspiciously-yellowed collard greens, and a side of home fries.the omelets arrived uniformly fluffy and beautiful, the grits even more perfect-looking.  now, before i say much about how they actually tasted, another caveat: chris had brought me a jar of hot mexican chili sauce--a repurposed gift from his mexico-transplanted houseguest--and each of us omelet-eaters at first modestly and then __liberally__ ladled this atop our eggs.  the effect was trans_form_a__tive.  our basil, tomato and cheese-pocked egg pillows blossomed into chipotle-spiced but not-too-smoky eggs with hips that dont lie.   ironic, this, in a neighborhood known among foodies for its weekend mexican and central american street eating scene at the soccer fields.  the moral?  order the omelet, but consider BYO creative condiments.  wonder how long it'll be before places like Ft. D, the good fork and hope n anchor show signs of soccer field-influence?  anyhow.the grits were a stand-alone knock-out.  who can argue with a hearty dollop of buttery, fresh(-tasting?) milled corn, not the slightest bit gluey or runny?  these pose a serious challenge to the gorgonzola, mushroomy polenta appetizer at bar toto--a single gal takes herself out on tuesday night favorite.  and this got me waxing about how unparalleled those grits'd be if centerpieced as a special with rotating, seasonal toppings (winter: grits topped with apples and grade b maple syrup; spring: grits topped with caramelized garlic scapes, young onions and tender beet greens; summer: grits topped with mulled blackberries, sage and upstate white goat cheddar).anyhow.not sure what the non-omelet-orderers thought of their eats, distracted as i was by the loveliness of a brunch birthday party for a brunchtime-born gal.  mark's plate of bean-drowned toast and eggs looked like a rather perfect red hook answer to hangover-curing central mexican chilaquiles, without the lard.  i'd totally try it next time, but i might bring along the chipotle hot pepper oil, and seasonal greens--maybe a shaved fennel salad with long island raisins?",4.0

"I very much enjoyed our first visit to Fort Defiance. We had a full supper including a special salad, broiled sardine (not sardines) and lamb shoulder chop with a side of swiss chard. I started with a ""Prescription Julep"" made with Rittenhouse Rye and cognac. A very fine drink. Our server seemed a bit nervous, but more than fulfilled the necessities. I particularly liked that I wasn't asked how the lamb should be prepared (medium rare is the only way) and my questions about the julep were clearly and quickly answered.

"Living in Carroll Gardens is a beautiful thing...I can eat in my own neighborhood or eat my way through several other hoods with just a hop, skip and a jump. One of those aforementioned hoods is Red Hook....it has a special vibe...feels like you have transcended to another/ forgotten time. Now for those of you who don't know the area...you'll probably think your days are numbered if you decide to walk to Fort Defiance...but don't be alarmed....you will be fine and when you reach your destination you will be pleasantly surprised. I think in the future I would be inclined to give this place four stars....I didn't try one of the many amazing sounding drinks. My buddy and I chose to have the lamb pasta special...it was warm, inviting comfort food. We also had a greens salad and the cauliflower gratin which in my opinion out shined the main course. That being said the decor is warm and ambient and the service was great...I really love the ""feel"" of this place...a neighborhood bar with an artistic flare... I will definitely be back...they have a seasonal menu which I also get excited by!",3.0
"Wanted to really like this place. Went on New Yrs Eve and had to wait an hour and a half after our reservation. Because of the pre-fixe menu they wouldn't let us order drinks- we had to have their punch (it was ok, but what a really bizzare way to do business). The food was uninspired, and some of the courses were frankly inedible. These folks really need to get their act together. Charging $95 for a sub-par meal was not the best way to start the new year.",1.0
"FD- shame on you!  The service was so rude today that I walked in to the bar and walked right out. I've had slow, but thoughtful service there before, but I will never go back again.  It is unbelievable that anyone in the hospitality industry would ever treat any of their customers with such blatant disrespect.  And this review is coming from someone that has worked as a bartender in NYC for ten years.",1.0
Came here for lunch. Great coffee - really strong. I had the cobb salad - it was pretty good. The lunch menu is very limited - I probably should have done brunch instead of lunch. Not worth driving back to but if I lived over there I'd probably return. I hear the drinks are good...,3.0
"Just had my birthday brunch at Ft. D.  and before i divulge the specifics,i have to add a heavy caveat:  because i love red hook in any circumstances, meals here--whether bought at fairway and eaten picnic-style at ikea park, or served by an over-burdened skinny glam rock waiter at o'barone during a several-blocks-long power outage--are always memorable and likely to get me waxing.and so it was today, after a short, wet bike ride with Rebecca the Intrepid, from park slope to RH, where we met mark, chase, and chris, to celebrate my birthday.3 of us ordered the special omelet--basil and tomatoes tucked in with some mellow cheese--maybe fontina--and toast (i substituted grits).  mark ordered eggs n beans over toast, and chase ordered the charleston: beautifully-poached eggs over skillet cornbread, a tiny heap of suspiciously-yellowed collard greens, and a side of home fries.the omelets arrived uniformly fluffy and beautiful, the grits even more perfect-looking.  now, before i say much about how they actually tasted, another caveat: chris had brought me a jar of hot mexican chili sauce--a repurposed gift from his mexico-transplanted houseguest--and each of us omelet-eaters at first modestly and then __liberally__ ladled this atop our eggs.  the effect was trans_form_a__tive.  our basil, tomato and cheese-pocked egg pillows blossomed into chipotle-spiced but not-too-smoky eggs with hips that dont lie.   ironic, this, in a neighborhood known among foodies for its weekend mexican and central american street eating scene at the soccer fields.  the moral?  order the omelet, but consider BYO creative condiments.  wonder how long it'll be before places like Ft. D, the good fork and hope n anchor show signs of soccer field-influence?  anyhow.the grits were a stand-alone knock-out.  who can argue with a hearty dollop of buttery, fresh(-tasting?) milled corn, not the slightest bit gluey or runny?  these pose a serious challenge to the gorgonzola, mushroomy polenta appetizer at bar toto--a single gal takes herself out on tuesday night favorite.  and this got me waxing about how unparalleled those grits'd be if centerpieced as a special with rotating, seasonal toppings (winter: grits topped with apples and grade b maple syrup; spring: grits topped with caramelized garlic scapes, young onions and tender beet greens; summer: grits topped with mulled blackberries, sage and upstate white goat cheddar).anyhow.not sure what the non-omelet-orderers thought of their eats, distracted as i was by the loveliness of a brunch birthday party for a brunchtime-born gal.  mark's plate of bean-drowned toast and eggs looked like a rather perfect red hook answer to hangover-curing central mexican chilaquiles, without the lard.  i'd totally try it next time, but i might bring along the chipotle hot pepper oil, and seasonal greens--maybe a shaved fennel salad with long island raisins?",4.0
"Fort Defiance is the kind of place you wrestle with telling your friends about.  This is one of the best establishments in Brooklyn.  Not only is the waitstaff kind and efficient, but they are also very knowledgeable and passionate about what they do.  The cocktails are thoughtfully made and delicious, the food is simple but memorable and the atmosphere makes it more than worth the trip out to Red Hook.",5.0
"Some of the best cocktails you'll find in NYC. Cool neighborhood atmosphere - scruffy artists mixing with IKEA tourists. They have upgraded the food since I went last, but I'll always think of this as more of a bar than a restaurant destination.",4.0
"I've gone here twice and like it very much!  It is funky and out of the way, kind of hip.  The menu is VERY short.  The drink options are interesting and original.  Check it out!  (Reservations recommended).",4.0
"I would like to have a word with the person who changed the brunch menu. I understand seasonal menu changes, but who in their right mind would take off the Charleston, the Savannah, and the Muffaletta -- all items that were consistently sold out if one slept too late.  We were so disappointed in the new menu that we almost left.  However, after having waited 20+ minutes we decided to stay and have the biscuits and gravy.  Bad idea.  Even the gravy is no longer the same.  My dining companion and I (both southerners) were offended that it was even called gravy.  He insisted it was out of a jar, or even worse, a can. So disappointing.",1.0
"I very much enjoyed our first visit to Fort Defiance. We had a full supper including a special salad, broiled sardine (not sardines) and lamb shoulder chop with a side of swiss chard. I started with a ""Prescription Julep"" made with Rittenhouse Rye and cognac. A very fine drink. Our server seemed a bit nervous, but more than fulfilled the necessities. I particularly liked that I wasn't asked how the lamb should be prepared (medium rare is the only way) and my questions about the julep were clearly and quickly answered. Four instead of five stars because the menu listing for ""Broiled Sardines"" yielded one sardine only",4.0
"Living in Carroll Gardens is a beautiful thing...I can eat in my own neighborhood or eat my way through several other hoods with just a hop, skip and a jump. One of those aforementioned hoods is Red Hook....it has a special vibe...feels like you have transcended to another/ forgotten time. Now for those of you who don't know the area...you'll probably think your days are numbered if you decide to walk to Fort Defiance...but don't be alarmed....you will be fine and when you reach your destination you will be pleasantly surprised. I think in the future I would be inclined to give this place four stars....I didn't try one of the many amazing sounding drinks. My buddy and I chose to have the lamb pasta special...it was warm, inviting comfort food. We also had a greens salad and the cauliflower gratin which in my opinion out shined the main course.

Literally just finished having one of the best burgers I've had in my life!  I was recommended by a vendor I do business with.  He wasn't kidding that the burgers are amazing.  My only beef w this burger was that they dont serve fries!  :(  That was the only reason preventing FD from getting a 5 star rating.  For some it might not be a big deal but i enjoy them w my burgers.  All in all i will definetly go back again and again.  On top of that i will recommend FD to all my friends! :D,4.0
"I was really looking forward to this place since we moved around the corner. Sadly, my first visit, I was disappointed with my lunch. My sandwich (turkey/gruyere) was dry and quite boring I thought, and with minimal cheese. It just was not tasty. I left most of it on my plate. It was huge, so I guess that's why it was just the lonely sandwich on a plate with no small salad or gourmet chips or anything. The ginger-ade was very tasty, I will say- you should try that. As an aside, and not a huge deal, but my companion tried to order a cucumber cocktail he had ordered before here and they wouldn't make it for him saying it was for 'dinner only'. Really? That just seems unfriendly to me- not to mention a loss for them on $ since there were only about  3 other parties in the restaurant at the time. I don't know, I'm having a hard time taking this place seriously, but I will be back to try dinner at some point. I hope it's more impressive.",3.0
"This place is charming in concept and the drinks were good, snacks more than fine. I find the menu extreme in terms of scale: either you have a light snack or a full meal. But the real problem was the noise. Obviously the bar/restaurant staff can't control cackling customers, but it was impossible to have a conversation. So we left after one drink.",3.0
"Fort Defiance.    It is so nice to be able to get a GREAT cup of coffee in Red Hook.  Not only do they have great coffee, but their sandwiches are oh so tasty.  I have tried the muffaletta which is HUGE and the vietnamese sandwich, which is a nice variation on the classic with bigger badder veggies and rather than a smear of of pate' its like chunk oh pate'.    I have yet to try their cocktails, but am looking forward to a nice midsummer refreshment very very soon.",5.0

We're talking drinks as good as Little Branch, and the food... it is not as fancy-pants as the fancy meals you can get in Manhattan, but almost as good, and again about half as much.
