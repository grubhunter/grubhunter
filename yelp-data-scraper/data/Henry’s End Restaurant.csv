"My boyfriend found this restaurant on Yelp so we decided to go. The atmosphere in here is nice and cozy. The kitchen is open so if you sit by the back you can look over and see the cooks preparing the meals. I ordered the Prix Fixe menu, Spring Onion soup, which was good. As an entree I had Walnut Crusted Chicken Breast with a side order of mashed potatoes, it was amazing! And for dessert I got the chocolate banana bread pudding. It was good and was enough to share with my boyfriend. My boyfriend ordered the Mixed Game Grill which featured elk chops, stuffed quail, and rabbit sausage. He's the more adventurous one when it comes to ordering different things. He really loved this dish! I would definitely suggest this place and I plan on going back!",5.0
"Bottom Line: Superb dinning with exotic meats cooked to perfectionI love this place. I've been here several times and the restaurant is on my top 10 places to take a date. First off, you're in the heart of Brooklyn Heights - where you get the Brooklyn Promenade and a quaint little community.The food here is not good but GREAT. As a fan of wild game, I think the food here is cooked perfectly. Do you want your Buffalo steak, duck, or lamb chop cooked medium rare? Well then come to Henry's End because they know how to cook it. Also, for all you non-Meatatarians, they have a pretty good list of fish dishes to check out as well such as Sole with Lobster :).Not only is the food good but they also have a great wine list that's worth checking out. My friends and I have found several new bottles that we buy on the regular now.",4.0
"By far the best dining experience in Brooklyn. Not too expwnsive, and definitely worth it.  Whether it's date night or a small group gathering, it's fantastic...and you get a discount car for your birthday!",5.0
Peter is the man. He really knows his beer and takes bar-tending very seriously. Tiny beers during the summer changed me into the person I am today. Can't emphasize the tiny beers enough. Try the nachos. Good for after a walk across the bridge.Classic NYC bar in a great neighborhood.,5.0
"KANGAROO!? Python salad? Turtle soup! Elk chops? They have unique items you won't find in your average restaurant, menu changes in the fall and they have an ever so amazing selection of Game that you would never even think a hole in the wall (in BROOKLYN) could ever have. Service is on point, just like the steak, lobster penne vodka, rice with snow peas, walnut chicken, truffle fries, Brussels sprouts, all delicious. Dirty Martini - Yes.Kangaroo, I will be back for you, Kangaroo.What did the fox say?",4.0
My first turtle soup ever was delish! Nice atmosphere--hip and jumping crowd. Amazing food and a nice bottle of wine.  The only thing better was the company.,4.0
"Updating to include some photos.  My prior review still stands.""When I want Duck - this is my go-to place.  It's ALWAYS good - and we're talking for over 30 years always good!!Dining in - tables are really close together - Tables for 2 can be difficult to hold all the plates - you're better off taking a 3d wheel and getting a table for 4!""",4.0
"I think I went in with some high expectations but unfortunately my evening at this restaurant did not meet those expectations. My date and I opted for the pre fixe menu. We started with the linguini and the crab cakes. The first was way too salty and the second was just ok. Entrees were not much better. The sliced pear was the best part of the chicken dish and the Duck while crisped well was only  saved by the sauce. They came with no sides so we needed to purchase them separately.For dessert :The Apple cobbler lacked sweetness to balance the tartness of the apples and the crumble topping. The highlights of the evening were the bread and the bread pudding. Service was good and attentive.  I think even if I had not gone in with expectations, I would have been underwhelmed. I tried it but I will not be returning.",2.0
"Enjoyable steak, crowded but warm atmosphere.Meal:Really enjoyed my peppercorn steak.  Nice cut of meat, prepared well.  Side dishes are modest in size, but still enjoyable.Service:Waitress was friendly.  Service was a little slow, but our water was kept topped off all night, which we appreciated.Env:Had to squeeze around tables as the restaurant was cramped.  But that is part of the atmosphere.  Reminded me of a Boston North End Italian restaurant setup (long and narrow).  But I wouldn't want to table in the back, about a foot from the bathroom door.  Makes for an uncomfortable moment for both parties..Recommend.",4.0
Excellent restaurant!  Try the walnut crusted chicken with pear its exceptional. Helpful and knowledgeable staff!  Save room for dessert you must try the 21 layer crepe cake!What a great find in Brooklyn Heights!,5.0

"I can't say that I was super impressed by the food. The small plates were pretty good, although the mains weren't anything to rave about. I had the sole citron and my partner had the steak au poivre. The steak turned out to be too tough and my sole was over breaded. For the price, I was hoping for something better. Henry's End is fine for a neighborhood drink or appetizer, but that's about it.",2.0
Came here twice for the Australian game food theme they had going on. The elk & kangaroo were def my faves. The boar was good but it was slighty a bit too much sodium for me. Place is smaller but has a great ambiance for the perfect romantic date night. I would without a doubt come back again! Great food & hole in the wall.,5.0
"Henry's End was the first restaurant I ate at, after moving to the neighborhood over 11 years ago.  It's still my go-to special occasion restaurant!  Food is consistently high quality and fresh, the wine list is reasonably priced and offers a nice variety, and the waitstaff are courteous.  NYE's prix-fixe offered some regular menu fare, along with some delicious options I hadn't seen before.  I had the wild boar Ragu, grilled salmon with lobster risotto, and chocolate banana bread pudding.  SO good.",5.0

"I have to dole out a 5 star for this amazing place. Not only is the food excellent the waitstaff are extremely courteous and sensitive to every diner here. This place functioned like a well oiled machine, our courses came out with such perfect timing. We started with some Crab cakes, whoa, utterly amazing. I could have just ordered these....... just kidding, because for my entree I had an amazing mixed gamer grill, which included quail, elk chops, and elk sausages. This was superb, but the standout were the perfectly cooked elk chops. This is perfect meat, better than any beef I've ever had. It was superlative food. My family ordered from their regular menu, tortilla flour crusted shrimp (amazing) and stuffed chicken (also amazing). Another very special aspect of the restaurant is the beer list- it's thoughtfully curated with many nods to local breweries, but with some great beers from all over the country. You can see that whoever put this together really believes that beer deserves the same emphasis as wine at fine dining establishments. Henry's end is a special place. It's unpretentious, yet in my opinion it can stand up to any NYC michelin starred restaurant. It's a place with great food, great service, and simply put authentic charm. If you're going out for a splurge or special occasion, it's my advice to consider this place. I can't wait to return.",5.0

"Ate here tonight for Father's Day (family of four) & had a great experience! The food was delicious & the service was far above average! The waiter was fantastic & very knowledgeable about the menu as well as the drink pairings & daily specials. Here's what we ordered:Appetizers 1. Pan-Roasted Vegetables with Polenta & Balsamic Glaze- So yummy! The glaze was just the right amount of sweet. The polenta was cooked perfectly. Nice assortment of in-season vegetables. 2. Ribs- Didn't eat these, but my brother said they were fall-off-the bone tender. They didn't last very long on the table either! 3. Pecan Crusted Shrimp (Special)- I didn't try the shrimp, but they were served over a corn & chipotle salsa which was very good.Entrees1. I had the Southern Style Fried Chicken- It was out of this world. Perfect crispness on the outside & still juicy and tender inside. It was a large portion, too! I took some home. I really liked the spice blend they used with hints of clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon. 2. My brother had the Peppercorn Crusted Steak. Cooked perfectly medium-rare & served with a Dijon sauce. He had a side of Truffle Fries. 3. My father ordered Two Softshell Crabs: The Basil Butter & Tempura Battered. 4. My mother ordered the 18 Spiced Steak & it came with an awesome Apple Chutney. Everyone basically cleaned their plates. The waiter was very accommodating to special requests: My brother asked for his steak to be served without the sauce on top. My father had asked for two different style Softshell crabs, instead of the menu stating that they come two crabs to an order with one preparation or sauce. There were no issues with these requests.Desserts1. I had the lemon sorbet. Very refreshing.2. My father had the 21 Layer Crepe.3. My mother had the Banana Pudding. The butterscotch sauce was on point! 4. My brother had the Mud Pie.I think the best part about this restaurant was that the owner was actively involved in the service and checked in with all of the diners throughout their meals. His name was Mark. He also informed us that (since parking is nearly impossible) there are coupons to print off the website for 50% off parking in the lot across the street. Also, it started pouring out of nowhere & some people from the street came inside to wait it out. They didn't even stay to eat, but he offered them napkins to dry themselves off in the meantime.

"Henry's End is an institution.The dining room, though cramped, is very clean. The staff are affable, knowledgeable of the menu, and eager to create an enjoyable dining experience.The fare is simple in its presentation, but big on taste, combining lovely ingredients and bold flavour combinations.The wild mushroom salad is perfectly seasoned, the greens slightly wilted by a warm vinaigrette, and loaded with umami from the savoury mushrooms.The wild mushrooms also make a wonderful appearance in the wild mushroom and lingonberry duckling. Though the duck was ever so slightly overcooked, the skin was crispy, the fat rendered nicely, and the balance of salty, sweet and umami in the sauce was delightful.Also on offer are classics of previous decades including a Steak Diane, as well as a shaved salad with Green Goddess dressing.However, the signature of this restaurant is definitely the wild game festival.The mixed grill is a triumph of meat with bags of flavour, combining an elk chop cooked perfectly, succulent boar belly, and a spicy andouille sausage of alligator. Each by itself is wonderful, though admittedly, the andouille is shamelessly outmatched by the elk chop and the boar belly. They are served with a savoury chasseur, or hunter-style sauce, rich with bone stock and reduced wine flavours, hints of tarragon and marjoram, and a slight acidity of tomato - a perfect accompaniment.Truly, Henry's End has not squandered its reputation for clean preparation of classic ingredients and elegant flavours.",4.0

"This place is about the food. There are plenty of places in BK Heights that are more hip or have fancier decor, but if you`re more interested in what goes into your mouth than interior design, than this place is well worth a try.The restaurant has been around for decades so it has a nice old-school atmosphere.

They have a nice wine bar two doors down where you can go for a drink while waiting and the waiter will come and pick you up when your table is ready. Great!We had a Caesar salad and the Game Charcuterie Plate from their Annual Wild Game Festival menu. The salad was great and the game pate was amazing.Next we tried the duckling with wild mushroom & lingonberry and the steak Diane. Both great, huge portions of meat, pretty spicy and saucy.For sides you get rice and string beans by default, but they have a selection of veggies that you can order. We  completely filled up on the meat, so we didn`t need anything extra.Wine selection was good.Our waitress that night has been working there for 3 decades and she was super cool.",5.0

We were visiting from California and looking for a place to eat in Brooklyn Heights.  We found Henry's End on yelp and decided to take a look.  We got there around 20 minutes before they opened and while taking a look at the menu posted outside just about every person that walked by told us we had to eat there.  We weren't disappointed.  We all had the wild mushroom soup and it was awesome.  I had the elk chops and they were right there too.  The service was perfect.  It made for a great finish to the day.,5.0
"I can't believe this place is rated so highly.I went to dinner with a friend here. We were seated at the table in the far back, with a window to the back concrete area, complete with a view of the pigeons and rats running around. It smelled a little funny from the beginning, but we decided to stay.First of all, for a place know for wine and beer, their waitress poured our beers with great fanfare, but clearly doesn't know how to properly pour a beer from bottle to glass. The ratio we're going for is not 60% head, people, with it rising over the edges of the glass. I would have preferred to do it myself, thank you.We ordered two appetizers for a light meal. After a while, we were brought a basket of somewhat limp-looking bread. When the appetizers finally arrived, both of us took a few bites of our respective dishes, looked at each other, and agreed this would never happen again. The crab cakes were mostly filler (no lumps of crap) and tasted like they had been in a freezer far too long. I couldn't stomach more than a few bites. The only comment my friend made about the bbq shrimp was that it was ""weird,"" and commented that ""now we know not to come back.""All the while, every time the cooks fired up a new dish, the smell grew more intense - both smoky and sour and really very off-putting.",1.0

"Popped in here after seeing Grimaldi's had an insane line and found a pleasant surprise.Atmosphere: Cute, very Brooklyn Heights / DUMBO. (Brick, wood, old pictures)Food: My girlfriend and I both got the prix fix ($30 per person). She had the crab cakes, salmon / arugula, and key lime pie. We loved the crab cakes as they actually tasted like crab meat and not the typical more breadcrumbs than crab. The salmon was very good and I am comparing this to both salmon I have had in Northern Europe and the Pacific NW. The keylime pie was so-so.I had the mesclun salad, scallops, and banana pie. The salad was good but very typical. The scallops were wonderful but the side corn was only so so. I loved the banana cream pie.Overall: I would rate this 3.5 or so. Good meal, nice atmosphere, OK price ... But nothing gave me the urge to return.",3.0
"My first 5 star review.We wanted to try Henry's End for the food but were a little concerned about the hipster rep, small tables and cramped quarters. We come to Brooklyn from Montreal  every month or so to visit our children and grandchildren and Brooklyn Heights is our preferred stomping ground because of it's proximity to our hotel.At any rate this is not Patty Duke's Brooklyn Heights, (you gotta be old to get that reference), its chic, expensive and popular beyond belief, Henry St. a local jewel, choc full of eclectic and exciting culinary choices, all lined up over a block or two.We decided on the Italian restaurant next door (which doesn't take reservations) and were surprised that it was overflowing on a Sunday night. Peeking into Henry's End next door we spotted a table and decided to jump at the chance.What a serendipitous choice!The food was quite simply fabulous. Every one of the four main courses ( sorry read: 'entrees' in America) was daring innovative and quite delicious.Service was above par and the noise level was such that we had some fine dinner conversation.We were never rushed and enjoyed our best meal in Brooklyn so far. We shall continue sampling other great local restaurants on our return trips, but will surely return here to enjoy some of Brooklyn's finest plates.",5.0
"Yes, it is that good.Firecracker shrimp were large, perfectly cooked and spicy.Duck was perfect, moist and crispy skin, no fat, off the bone.Sauteed soft shells were excellent, buttery and lots of flavor.Friendly, knowledgeable, and appropriately attentive service.The best.",5.0

"Came here with the lady and my aunt, uncle and cousins (who are from out of town).Atmosphere:- Unassuming, not pretending to be anything fancy - just putting out amazing food to regularsFood:- I had the veal with brussels pancetta and sage - it was fantastic- Some nice sauteed veg came on the side- This place is just solid good food- Looking forward to trying out the game menus come this winterService:- Service was good, no complaintsDrink:- Had some wine.  No complaints.  Decent selection of good beersOther:- Another spot you will be happy to call yourself a regular at.  I will certainly be back soon enough.- Good spot to bring ppl from out of town who will be impressed with the food but still want to be casual- This place has been here forever - check out the news articles in the bathroom",5.0
We were visiting from California and looking for a place to eat in Brooklyn Heights.  We found Henry's End on yelp and decided to take a look.  We got there around 20 minutes before they opened and while taking a look at the menu posted outside just about every person that walked by told us we had to eat there.  We weren't disappointed.  We all had the wild mushroom soup and it was awesome.  I had the elk chops and they were right there too.  The service was perfect.  It made for a great finish to the day.,5.0
"I can't believe this place is rated so highly.I went to dinner with a friend here. We were seated at the table in the far back, with a window to the back concrete area, complete with a view of the pigeons and rats running around. It smelled a little funny from the beginning, but we decided to stay.First of all, for a place know for wine and beer, their waitress poured our beers with great fanfare, but clearly doesn't know how to properly pour a beer from bottle to glass. The ratio we're going for is not 60% head, people, with it rising over the edges of the glass. I would have preferred to do it myself, thank you.We ordered two appetizers for a light meal. After a while, we were brought a basket of somewhat limp-looking bread. When the appetizers finally arrived, both of us took a few bites of our respective dishes, looked at each other, and agreed this would never happen again. The crab cakes were mostly filler (no lumps of crap) and tasted like they had been in a freezer far too long. I couldn't stomach more than a few bites. The only comment my friend made about the bbq shrimp was that it was ""weird,"" and commented that ""now we know not to come back.""All the while, every time the cooks fired up a new dish, the smell grew more intense - both smoky and sour and really very off-putting.",1.0
"the place is small and you can feel the warmth since the very moment you cross the door. It is located within walking distance of the New York Marriot at the Brooklyn Bridge, where I stayed due to a summit. You should reserve your table before coming down since, as I stated before, the place is small. The food was delicious and the service was great. I definitely want to come back and try all of the steaks available.I think I could take a girlfriend here ;)",5.0
"My lady took me here for a nice night out. For my first time out in Brooklyn Heights, she definitely chose the right place. Although the restaurant is a little small, it's dim and pretty. The food was wonderful and the server was so sweet. I'd definitely recommend this for a romantic night out.",5.0
Absolutely delicious!  I loved every single morsel of the meal.  They have some really cool gamey options on the menu that are atypical of NY restaurants.  Would definitely go back!!,5.0
"Popped in here after seeing Grimaldi's had an insane line and found a pleasant surprise.Atmosphere: Cute, very Brooklyn Heights / DUMBO. (Brick, wood, old pictures)Food: My girlfriend and I both got the prix fix ($30 per person). She had the crab cakes, salmon / arugula, and key lime pie. We loved the crab cakes as they actually tasted like crab meat and not the typical more breadcrumbs than crab. The salmon was very good and I am comparing this to both salmon I have had in Northern Europe and the Pacific NW. The keylime pie was so-so.I had the mesclun salad, scallops, and banana pie. The salad was good but very typical. The scallops were wonderful but the side corn was only so so. I loved the banana cream pie.Overall: I would rate this 3.5 or so. Good meal, nice atmosphere, OK price ... But nothing gave me the urge to return.",3.0

"I had a great experience here. The beer list has some great selections to choose from. You can't go wrong with Chimay. For our appetizers we had goat cheese and beet ravioli, a BBQ-y/spicy jumbo shrimp, and tuna tartar. The ravioli was not very substantial or flavorful, but the shrimp was awesome.For my main course, I had chicken coated with ground almond, on top of bleu cheese, and topped with sliced pear. It was phenomenal, although I wish the bleu cheese had a stronger presence than it did.All in all, a great meal and a really nice, mellow atmosphere.",4.0

"Great little restaurant tucked away in Brooklyn heights. I had the Cesar salad, which was delicious, it had anchovies and a very rich dressing as a real Cesar salad should.

The customer service was also amazing, everyone was exceptionally nice and friendly. Can't wait to dine here again the next time I'm in town.",5.0
"One of the top three restaurants in Brooklyn Heights. Amazing food, great sauces, and great service. If you're into game, the game festival will definitely be of interest. Their regular menu items--especially the lemonese which can be had with chicken on request, or veal as per the menu, is my ultimate favorite. The new orechiette with tuna pasta is AMAZING and the brandy sauce pasta with lobster is also super delicious. Definitely stick around for desert though because it's amazing--especially the Mrs. Mud Pie (heath bar, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, graham cracker crust and butterscotch drizzle--mmm!).",5.0
"To be brief. Had high expectations. None of these met.  Food was gloppy, overcooked and way over sauced. Of 5, only one thought food was good.

"More hype than flavor. I was so excited to eat here.And it appeared I was not alone in this feeling. Had my dish been cooked to order, I would have given it three stars. But who wants well done meh salmon? (I thought not.) My dining companions had meat, and both enjoyed their dishes. (I sucked it up - the experience, not the food - of course, but seriously.) So, if you like pork or beef I would say try this place. Just don't, whatever you do, order expensive medium rare salmon. Or, bring an electric carver.

"Went here for a double date on a Friday night. They do accept reservations for parties of at least 3.  We were seated promptly.  The restaurant is cozy, and by that I mean the tables are pretty close together.  Not so much that you can't have a private conversation, but you definitely may have people pressing your chair in to get by if you haven't scooted your butt close enough to your table.We sampled a few items off the Wild Game Festival menu, which I'm listing in order of favorite to least liked.1) Spiced Antelope with a Lingonberry Sauce, Sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts.  This was the best dish of the night.  The antelope was incredible.  Melt-in-your-mouth tender, perfectly medium rare (though more on the rare side).  The  mashed sweet potatoes were creamy and paired perfectly with the meat.  The brussel sprouts were caramelized but still had a nice bite to them.  Delicious all around.2)  Mixed Game Grill - Wild Boar Belly with pistachio pomegranate relish, herb crusted Elk Chop, and Rabbit Sausage, served with a very small plate of rich and steamed veggies.  The rabbit sausage was very good, although it was not browned at all and the grey color of it was kind of sad.  The boar was delicious.  The elk chop could have used a bit more seasoning, but it was perfectly cooked (medium rare).3)  Danish Venison stew with caraway mashed potatoes.  This was alright.  The venison was nicely cooked (very tender) and the dish was early and flavored, but a little bit one-note.We also had the Wild Mushroom Salad (regular menu), which was good, but not outstanding.  As a side, we did order the truffle fries, which were fantastic.  They used a very fragrant truffle oil, and the fries were perfectly salted and perfectly crisp.  No soggy pieces and no burnt pieces.  I could easily say these were the best fries I've eaten in my entire life, and I have eaten truffle fries before and I have been to Pommes Frites and other places where people say they love the fries.  These were better.We were too full to order dessert, but we did order a bottle of the Zinfandel.  A bottle is only a few dollars more than a half carafe (which pours about 3-4 glasses).Good service.  Friendly waitress.  Water glass was always promptly filled.",4.0

I don't know if he will ever trust me again after he had his first scallop ever and it was cooked to the point of a pencil eraser and completely devoid of moisture or flavor. A $15 glass of low-end chardonny was the only mildly palatable thing placed on our table. The rice that was served as a complimentary ""side"" would have been alright if we were in prison.

"Well, came with high expectations based on the reviews here--expectations which were pretty much dashed. I'd seen the ambitious menu and the not cheap prices and so was a bit taken aback at the place which looks like a midwestern family restaurant; you know Christmas lights and lots of wood. The servers were friendly but not particularly well dressed: think dockers pants, polo shirts. Hey, I told myself, don't judge a book by its cover. So I ordered the duck in raspberry sauce while remembering a brilliant version I had in Burlington VT. Out comes half a duck lying in a gloppy pool of brightly colored but tasteless gravy. The meat had a wet, kind of spongy, texture: fried while frozen? Meat didn't have much flavor either. It came with a ludicrously small serving of rice and a few florets of cauliflower. My friend ordered a fancy sounding veal dish that he said was like something his mom made--and she ain't no chef..Dunno, maybe I went through a wormhole into an alternate universe...",1.0

"It was a delicious dinner.We didn't order anything from the Game (meat) festival, Marco C. ordered duck with wild mushroom and berries and I went for the prefix (Mon-Thur, $25). The prefix consists of appetizer (I had butternut squash bisque), entree (Mustard seed encrusted Tuna) and dessert (Persian Lime Pie).The duck was simple and well done, the skin was crunchy and the meat was moist. The bisque was good and my medium cooked tuna was tasty and very ""mustard-y"". The Persian lime pie was the perfect finish with the tartness to wrap it up. The portions were generous for a prefix, I couldn't finish all my entree and I shared my dessert. I was very full at the end of meal. The duck dish was big, my fiance had a hard time finishing it (I help him a little, who can say no to a nicely cooked piece of duck with berry sauce!?). Next time we will share a prefix plus another side and appetizer.The waiters are quiet and no-frills but they are attentive, refills your water all the time.

There is also a great selection of whisky.Tip: They get busy quick, I usually call to reserve a table so I don't have to wait.This is a small restaurant and a bit crowded, but the food is well worth it.",5.0
"I just went here last week for dessert and coffee with a friend, and the service was absolutely fantastic. My friend and I sat down, ordered our dessert, and our coffee was on the table immediately with bread. Bread. Before dessert. Had I died and gone to heaven? The butter they serve with the bread here is so fresh and delicious...I seriously didn't realize there was anything wrong with the butter I have at home until I tried this butter. The dessert did not disappoint, either. Whenever Henry's End has a dessert special, I strongly recommend that you order it. I got the mudslide pie and it was decadent but not too rich. The waiter and waitress who served us were really kind and unobtrusive. Henry's End has a great vibe...it can be trendy and Brooklyn chic, but ultimately it is incredibly homey.

"This was our first visit to Henry's End (on our wedding day!) and it was a lovely place to celebrate with good food and wine. We arrived on the early side and it was already bustling with regulars (as other reviewers have noted, it's a romantic place with a neighborhood-y feel). The menu is large but our server helpfully directed us to his personal favorites on the game week menu. We tried the shaved Brussels sprout salad which was good though a little underwhelming (the pomegranate seeds were a nice touch).We also tried a small plate of gnocchi with boar ragu which was flavorful but a bit tough (I may be forever spoiled by the exceptionally tender and flavorful veal ragu tagliatelle that I ate earlier this summer at Au Pied du Cochon).For the main course we shared a venison special with spinach and sweet potatoes and the duckling with mushrooms and lingonberries. We also tried the turtle soup from the game week menu.Though nothing knocked my socks off, everything was well prepared and flavorful.

"Well, came with high expectations based on the reviews here--expectations which were pretty much dashed. I'd seen the ambitious menu and the not cheap prices and so was a bit taken aback at the place which looks like a midwestern family restaurant; you know Christmas lights and lots of wood. The servers were friendly but not particularly well dressed: think dockers pants, polo shirts. Hey, I told myself, don't judge a book by its cover. So I ordered the duck in raspberry sauce while remembering a brilliant version I had in Burlington VT. Out comes half a duck lying in a gloppy pool of brightly colored but tasteless gravy. The meat had a wet, kind of spongy, texture: fried while frozen? Meat didn't have much flavor either. It came with a ludicrously small serving of rice and a few florets of cauliflower. My friend ordered a fancy sounding veal dish that he said was like something his mom made--and she ain't no chef..Dunno, maybe I went through a wormhole into an alternate universe...",1.0
"I really enjoyed my meal. Great atmosphere and it was a very clean establishment, especially the bathrooms. The people in my party were not happy with their food, but I certainly was!

My meal was perfect",4.0
"It was a delicious dinner.We didn't order anything from the Game (meat) festival, Marco C. ordered duck with wild mushroom and berries and I went for the prefix (Mon-Thur, $25). The prefix consists of appetizer (I had butternut squash bisque), entree (Mustard seed encrusted Tuna) and dessert (Persian Lime Pie).The duck was simple and well done, the skin was crunchy and the meat was moist. The bisque was good and my medium cooked tuna was tasty and very ""mustard-y"". The Persian lime pie was the perfect finish with the tartness to wrap it up. The portions were generous for a prefix, I couldn't finish all my entree and I shared my dessert. I was very full at the end of meal. The duck dish was big, my fiance had a hard time finishing it (I help him a little, who can say no to a nicely cooked piece of duck with berry sauce!?). Next time we will share a prefix plus another side and appetizer.The waiters are quiet and no-frills but they are attentive, refills your water all the time. You can tell the kitchen was on full throttle, despite the restaurant being almost full, our food came out quickly. You won't find elegant or romantic decor at Henry's End, but you will find good food that's for sure.",4.0
"I have been going here for a very long time. I have never been disappointed.It is a great place for a date, very romantic, though not a first one.

"I just went here last week for dessert and coffee with a friend, and the service was absolutely fantastic. My friend and I sat down, ordered our dessert, and our coffee was on the table immediately with bread. Bread. Before dessert. Had I died and gone to heaven? The butter they serve with the bread here is so fresh and delicious...I seriously didn't realize there was anything wrong with the butter I have at home until I tried this butter. The dessert did not disappoint, either. Whenever Henry's End has a dessert special, I strongly recommend that you order it. I got the mudslide pie and it was decadent but not too rich. The waiter and waitress who served us were really kind and unobtrusive. Henry's End has a great vibe...it can be trendy and Brooklyn chic, but ultimately it is incredibly homey.

"I've always been curious about the annual Wild Game Festival at Henry's End. For historical reasons.I'm used to game meat. Every time I go to Sardinia, Italy[1], I would eat some sort of game. Usually wild boar; some times fowl. The curious thing is that hunting season is in the winter, and I am usually there in the summer. How do I manage to eat fresh wild boar when it is illeg...aheam! ""unusual"" to hunt it in the summer? According to my relatives, it would seem that wild boars have suicidal tendencies. I've heard tales of wild boars jumping in front of a car, then being finished off with a monkey wrench, and skinned with a Swiss Army knife in the bathroom of a public camp site. Whatever the origin of the meat, the end result has always been spectacular.Roadkill never tasted so good.Henry's End is rather nondescript, and the overall vibe is a welcoming ""old school, no frills"". The only notable feature is a neon sign/skyline behind a transparent plexiglass cover mounted on one of the walls. It looks like a relic from the '70s that probably has now achieved national landmark status.The wine selection is rather impressive, with 25+ white wines and 70+ reds[2]. My choice for the evening, however is a bottle of Aventinus (12% ABV): a wonderful doppelbock with a dark ruby color, a creamy head, and a yeasty-bready-fruity taste.As appetizer, my dining companion and I shared the Pheasant Ravioli ($10.95; $21.95 as main course) with caramelized fennel and pistachio nuts. The ravioli were nicely presented in a dense, creamy sauce. The filling was very flavorful, and the flavor of pistachio balances nicely the delicacy of the pheasant. The end result, however, was a bit too dry.For main course, I had the Mixed Game Grill ($33), which included Herb Crusted Elk Chop, Wild Boar Belly, and Rabbit Sausage. The dish is served with a Madeira-and-veal stock demi-glace that is a rich orange in color and slightly sweet. The elk was excellent: elk meat is very lean and tender, and the wonderful crust[3] enhanced the flavor without overwhelming it, while at the same time maintained the meat nice and juicy[4]. The Wild Boar Belly was nice and fatty, very tender and juicy. The Rabbit Sausage, however, was bland and didn't live a lasting impression.The Elk Chop dish ($36.95) that my dining companion had, came with the same demi-glace as the Mixed Game Grill. I found a bit surprising that they would use the same sauce for the two dishes; in fact, that sauce might have overwhelmed the flavor of the rabbit sausage.Unfortunately the Wild Game menu does not include any more items that I have seen listed in the past and I would have loved to try, like BBQ Rattlesnake Salad, Antelope Au Poivre, and Reindeer. venison is gone too. Nevertheless, kudos to Henry's End for serving a solid, albeit limited, selection of game meat.Keep your excitement and expectations at bay and you won't be disappointed.--------------------------------[1] The land of my ancestors.[2] The cheapest ones at a very reasonable $35-36 a bottle.[3] A mixture of breadcrumbs, capers, extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, Tabasco, chives, thyme, tarragon, rosemary, parsley, and anchovy.[4] Ask to have the elk medium rare.",3.0
"The experience of dining here couldn't be any better. From first entering the restaurant you are treated like family. There are no signs of white table cloths or pretension.

"Henry's End Restaurant. One of the gems of Brooklyn that I go to when I can, because it is a little heavy on the wallet, but I think it's worth the dough. For a good portion of the year (mostly winter), they have their ""Wild Game Festival"", which is totally my thing, love me some wild game. The wild game menu items change, but they are posted on their website, saying what is served on what day. I've eaten kangaroo in a red wine sauce, and it was heavenly. Animals usually taste a little bit of what they eat, and since kangaroos eat mostly fruit, berries, and plants, the meat itself had a fruit-like taste. It was good.I've also had the herb crusted elk chop, served with mushrooms and fresh spring vegetables, and that was great as well. The flavors really complimented each other, and the elk chop was cooked just right.The wild boar belly was also good, think bacon, but with distinct differences. The turtle soup I've had on more than one occasion and it's never let me down. The rabbit is superb as well. The owner is usually there and greets me by name, which is always welcoming. Bonnie the waitress is one of the sweetest old ladies that always treats me like a grandchild, and warms my heart. She's great and has been a fixture there for a while. So, servicewise, it's wonderful. Food-wise, it's fantastic, confused after reading some bad reviews of Henry's End, maybe those experiences were just flukes, because everytime I leave there I have a full belly and a smile on my face.I'm also a part of the 'Birthday Club' which entitles you to a free dinner entree with a max. value of $20, which is valid a week before or after your birthday. When I went for my birthday it was the first time I went there outside of the ""Wild Game Festival"". I ordered the wild mushroom & lingonberry duckling which contained portobello and morel mushrooms, shallots, thyme, brandy and lingonberries. The duck was cooked perfectly, crispy skin, tender, moist, flavorful meat. The dish really worked out, and my compliments to the chef.I will continue to patronize Henry's End Restaurant, especially during the ""Wild Game Festival"". Definitely in my Top 20 restaurants in New York City. I highly recommend giving them a try.",5.0
"I have often thought Henry's End was expensive but well worth it, given the wonderful food. I was recently there a few days after a visit to The River Cafe. Dinner for 8 at Henry's was about the same price as dinner for two at the River Cafe. And though the cafe's food and service are elegant and formal which Henry's end definitely is not, I can't say that The River Cafe was worth the money, while Henry's End has always been more than worth it. And, I've been eating there for well over thirty years. A truly enjoyable dining experience.(No restaurant is perfect and I've had the occasional unhappy visit. No matter.  Henry's End has long been one of my favorite places to eat.",5.0
"Went on a Tuesday night around 8pm. Got a table immediately for 2, but the place was pretty busy and LOUD. Pretty decent wine menu (some older vintages and great stuff by the glass)Good beer menu too. I got the Salmon with asparagus and lemon risotto (medium rare). It was cooked past medium but it was still pretty delicious. I really enjoyed the salmon skin and the risotto wasn't too overwhelmingly lemon-flavored.The duckling with wild mushroom and lingonberry was a very large portion and tasted amazing.

This place is amazing!  Great atmosphere and surprisingly has various delicious options for a vegetarian.  I had the sour cherry soup and heirloom tomato salad...was better than any vegetarian restaurant in the area.  I had roasted vegetables with polenta as main dish and that was perfect as well.  I can't speak for the meat dishes but everyone I was with raved about them.  The best part....dessert.

Henry's End is the special-occasion place for my girlfriend and me. The service is friendly and accommodating; the food is excellent and interesting (not what's on offer everywhere else); and the bourbon and Scotch flights are a perfect end to dinner.,5.0
"I applaud Henry's End's attempt at a wild game menu. The food was tasty, if a bit traditional. It would have been even tastier if the game were allowed to show through more with less of a heavy dressing and preparation. We really enjoyed the...Turtle Soup - robust and warmingElk Chop - tender with a bit of gaminessBlood Sausage - one of the best I've hadService was good, welcoming and friendly. Space was very cozy. Atmosphere was warm and informal.",3.0
"Henry's End Restaurant. One of the gems of Brooklyn that I go to when I can, because it is a little heavy on the wallet, but I think it's worth the dough. For a good portion of the year (mostly winter), they have their ""Wild Game Festival"", which is totally my thing, love me some wild game. The wild game menu items change, but they are posted on their website, saying what is served on what day. I've eaten kangaroo in a red wine sauce, and it was heavenly. Animals usually taste a little bit of what they eat, and since kangaroos eat mostly fruit, berries, and plants, the meat itself had a fruit-like taste. It was good.I've also had the herb crusted elk chop, served with mushrooms and fresh spring vegetables, and that was great as well. The flavors really complimented each other, and the elk chop was cooked just right.The wild boar belly was also good, think bacon, but with distinct differences. The turtle soup I've had on more than one occasion and it's never let me down. The rabbit is superb as well. The owner is usually there and greets me by name, which is always welcoming. Bonnie the waitress is one of the sweetest old ladies that always treats me like a grandchild, and warms my heart. She's great and has been a fixture there for a while. So, servicewise, it's wonderful. Food-wise, it's fantastic, confused after reading some bad reviews of Henry's End, maybe those experiences were just flukes, because everytime I leave there I have a full belly and a smile on my face.I'm also a part of the 'Birthday Club' which entitles you to a free dinner entree with a max. value of $20, which is valid a week before or after your birthday. When I went for my birthday it was the first time I went there outside of the ""Wild Game Festival"". I ordered the wild mushroom & lingonberry duckling which contained portobello and morel mushrooms, shallots, thyme, brandy and lingonberries. The duck was cooked perfectly, crispy skin, tender, moist, flavorful meat. The dish really worked out, and my compliments to the chef.I will continue to patronize Henry's End Restaurant, especially during the ""Wild Game Festival"". Definitely in my Top 20 restaurants in New York City. I highly recommend giving them a try.",5.0
"I have often thought Henry's End was expensive but well worth it, given the wonderful food. I was recently there a few days after a visit to The River Cafe. Dinner for 8 at Henry's was about the same price as dinner for two at the River Cafe. And though the cafe's food and service are elegant and formal which Henry's end definitely is not, I can't say that The River Cafe was worth the money, while Henry's End has always been more than worth it. And, I've been eating there for well over thirty years. A truly enjoyable dining experience.(No restaurant is perfect and I've had the occasional unhappy visit. No matter.  Henry's End has long been one of my favorite places to eat.",5.0
"Went on a Tuesday night around 8pm. Got a table immediately for 2, but the place was pretty busy and LOUD. Pretty decent wine menu (some older vintages and great stuff by the glass)Good beer menu too. I got the Salmon with asparagus and lemon risotto (medium rare). It was cooked past medium but it was still pretty delicious. I really enjoyed the salmon skin and the risotto wasn't too overwhelmingly lemon-flavored.The duckling with wild mushroom and lingonberry was a very large portion and tasted amazing. My dining partner thought it was a bit dry but to each his own.   Great service but the place was packed too closely and again, it was loud. Not as suitable for 'date night' as I had imagined.",3.0

"I have a love for trying out new types of food and food experiences. Because of this, one of my biggest vice is to try out food with exotic strange meats.  Of course I have boundaries where I would say no such as endangered animals and man's ( and woman's ) best friend, etc, but for the most part I am more then game for trying something at least once.A few days ago on Yelp talk, there was a thread on ""Uncommon Food - What and Where to get it?"" and this place was mentioned.  One look at the menu and I knew I and a similar minded friend had to be there.  According to their web site, every year starting on October to March, they have a Wild Game Festival of dishes made from exotic (to Americans) meats.  What they have rotates year by year and week by week.  According to the super friendly and very patient waitress (I had so many questions about the food and the festival ) named Bonnie, they had lions, tigers, and bears (Oh my )over the years.  Ok, I was kidding about the tiger, she actually said hippo.Sadly, because I was eating here at the very end of the festival, the menu for this event was very limited.  I was so looking forward to the Rattlesnake Salad, and kangaroo from this year too.  What was available though, was amazingly good.Turtle Soup Cajun Style:  A little like a cross between a tomato soup and chili.  Turtle meat is usually a little tough and chewy so they grounded the meat till it was the consistency of ground beef to make it easier to eat. It was mildly spicy.  The soup by itself was good but what made it amazing was that they provided a bottle of sherry on the side to flavor the soup as you like.  Alcohol in your soup, what a combination.Mixed Game Grill: This plate consists of a Herb Crusted Elk Chop, a Wild Boar Belly, and a Stuffed Pheasant.  The Elk Chop, as other reviewers noted, were the highlight.  Done medium rare, the meat was much more tender then most beef steaks.  The top of the Elk Chop were covered in a Herb ""Crust"" as they called it and adds a nice flavor to the tender meat.  The Stuffed Pheasant was a tiny little bird half  the size of most people's fist.  It was filled with a combination of spinach and bacon. Again very tender and the bits of bacon in the interior adds a nice bit of porky saltiness to the meat.The last item, the Wild Boar Belly was good but was the weakest of the three. Pork belly is a very hot item in restaurants right now because of how soft and buttery it is.  This dish should have kicked ass because  wild boar have a more intense flavor then domesticated pigs and despite the fact that you could taste that in this meat, I believe it would have been improved if it was softer.The Mixed Game Grill also came with a side of basic rice and steamed broccoli.  I agree with the other reviewers that this was a disappointment.  Nothing wrong with it but considering how tasty everything else was, I expected something a little more exciting then what was provided here.  Maybe give me wild rice in some kind of sauce at least? I enjoyed this meal and is excited to see what interesting meats they have planned for future festivals.  I'll be there for sure. Now could someone provide some info on where I could get some nicely cooked garment insects too?  Yumm....",4.0
"The only word that comes to mind when I think of Henry's End is 'mediocre'- decent food, in a decent atmosphere, with decent service, although a bit over priced. I was surprised that there was such a crowd as the quality of food was not worth the money being spent. I ordered off of the Prix fix ($30) and had a salad of 'mixed greens' (literally a plate of mixed greens, aka different types of lettuce, with three cherry tomatoes) to start, the duck with honey and ginger (an extra $4 for mushy sauce) as my main, and the mud pie (not a mud pie at all, but rather an ice cream pie) for dessert. In addition, the bread sticks in the complimentary bread basket were a bit soggy, obviously stale from having sat out. On second thought, maybe this is more of a 2.5 star kind of place? Despite the downfalls however, it was a pleasant enough experience and the flavors made up for what the (at times questionable) texture was lacking. I do not plan on returning although judging by the packed dining room, Henry's will be around for awhile... All in all I wouldn't recommend this restaurant as there are better, less expensive, options in the area.",3.0

The veal was fried and not very tender.Our appetizers (I had the Celery Root soup, my wife an arugula salad) were good.  The soup looked and tasted excellent.  Such a shame - the menu reads incredibly well - we were both disappointed in the food and service because we would otherwise be tempted to eat there every night just to try every dish.But the food was terrible!  IF the Elk Chops had been cooked all the way to the medium rare I ordered (yes, they were served undercooked and barely even warm), it could have been an excellent dish - they looked good and came with a delicious puree, but the pittance of side dish I don't understand... rice and green beans are difficult to serve poorly!My wife's veal was fair at best, the brussel sprouts were good but nothing great.

"I've been living in Brooklyn my entire life (all 30 glorious years). How have I never heard of this place? How good was it? Let's just say that I scolded my husband in the restaurant for knowing of this place and never bring me here. The family dining next to us have been long time patrons, and appreciated this sentiment. This restaurant is known for its wild game menu (the reason why my husband didn't think I would like the place). However, they have so many other options on the menu. Everything coming out smelled great. I had the spiced walnut crusted chicken with autumn fruit compote. I wasn't sure if they could pull this off. It was sensational. It was so flavorful. The texture was great. The sweet fruit with the savory nutty chicken made such a great team. I was extremely happy. I also ordered the side of mashed parsnips. Holy crap!! They were outstanding. This has been missing from my life for too long. I need to make this. My husband ordered the buffalo hangar steak with truffle fries. The fries were just ok. Nothing special. The steak was really good. I liked the sauce. Every dish come with a side of steamed broccoli and rice. It comes out about 10 minutes after your meal has arrived, but who's complaining? When we were unsure of the type of red wine we wanted, the waiter brought us samples of 2 types. That was great. We had the mud pie for dessert. It wasn't anything special. It was sort of like the Carvel birthday cakes. That's fine (who doesn't love the crunchies?), but it wasn't different. Overall, the place gets cramped, and packed if you're not in by 6. Fortunately, the early darkness in winter threw us off, and we thought it was later when we went in. This helped us get a table right away. Within 15 minutes however, people were being turned away. There was a waitress there who is pretty batty, and all over the place. I liked her. Reminded me of the good ol days of Brooklyn, before snarky hipster waiters and waitresses covered in ironic tattoos, started serving in restaurants until their art career takes off. I prefer the career waitresses of yesteryear. This restaurants screams real Brooklyn. It has a loyal following of longtime patrons. It actually reminds me of the kind of old time, exposed brick, quaint Brooklyn eatery that many new restaurateurs attempt to recreate, but fall short. One cannot simply put kitchy gold lettering in a window, with curtains, and old street signs, and assume they have a winning restaurant. This is the real deal. Not pretentious. Not trying to be something it's not. It's the O.G. of small Brooklyn eateries. We will be loyal patrons long after the Brooklyn trend has disappeared.",5.0

I've had chicken, fish and pasta here in the past and have always been very content.  Last night's lamb sirloin with homemade spicy BBQ sauce and mashed potatoes was out of control.  If it was proper to lick the plate to show my enthusiasm of the dish I would have licked mine and the BFs clean.The Persian lime pie was a delicious and refreshing way to end such a great meal.  Can't wait to go back!P.S Join their mailing list.",5.0

"SOOO disappointed!!!  I have a Gluten intolerance but can still find something on a menu - especially with a little help from the waitstaff and/or the chef.  I asked about the preparation of a dish which turned out would not be good for me and the waiter had NO interest in making another suggestion or asking the chef (other restaurants have been amazing). I know my gluten issue is not the waiters problem but if the waiter at least makes an effort to help me find something to eat, I will tip bigger, refer them to others and write a nice review.  NOT the case here.  I settled for  grilled chicken ceasar (without croutons) because I felt like I was inconveniencing the waiter by even asking. It sucks to have a food issue (this is new for me) but it sucks more to have wait staff that have no interest in making their customers dining experience a nice experience.With all of the people who have different food allergies and issues; resaturanteurs, wait staff and chefs should educate themselves and be able to make everyone's dining experience a pleasant one.",1.0

"I've been living in Brooklyn my entire life (all 30 glorious years). How have I never heard of this place? How good was it? Let's just say that I scolded my husband in the restaurant for knowing of this place and never bring me here. The family dining next to us have been long time patrons, and appreciated this sentiment. This restaurant is known for its wild game menu (the reason why my husband didn't think I would like the place). However, they have so many other options on the menu. Everything coming out smelled great. I had the spiced walnut crusted chicken with autumn fruit compote. I wasn't sure if they could pull this off. It was sensational. It was so flavorful. The texture was great. The sweet fruit with the savory nutty chicken made such a great team. I was extremely happy. I also ordered the side of mashed parsnips. Holy crap!! They were outstanding. This has been missing from my life for too long. I need to make this. My husband ordered the buffalo hangar steak with truffle fries. The fries were just ok. Nothing special. The steak was really good. I liked the sauce. Every dish come with a side of steamed broccoli and rice. It comes out about 10 minutes after your meal has arrived, but who's complaining? When we were unsure of the type of red wine we wanted, the waiter brought us samples of 2 types. That was great. We had the mud pie for dessert. It wasn't anything special. It was sort of like the Carvel birthday cakes. That's fine (who doesn't love the crunchies?), but it wasn't different. Overall, the place gets cramped, and packed if you're not in by 6. Fortunately, the early darkness in winter threw us off, and we thought it was later when we went in. This helped us get a table right away. Within 15 minutes however, people were being turned away. There was a waitress there who is pretty batty, and all over the place. I liked her. Reminded me of the good ol days of Brooklyn, before snarky hipster waiters and waitresses covered in ironic tattoos, started serving in restaurants until their art career takes off. I prefer the career waitresses of yesteryear. This restaurants screams real Brooklyn. It has a loyal following of longtime patrons. It actually reminds me of the kind of old time, exposed brick, quaint Brooklyn eatery that many new restaurateurs attempt to recreate, but fall short. One cannot simply put kitchy gold lettering in a window, with curtains, and old street signs, and assume they have a winning restaurant. This is the real deal. Not pretentious. Not trying to be something it's not. It's the O.G. of small Brooklyn eateries. We will be loyal patrons long after the Brooklyn trend has disappeared.",5.0
"My favourite restaurant in the whole world for 15 years. Not a bad point in the space. Mark Lamm has created something absolutely incredible, and keeping his staff so long (Bonnie!, Albert!

I've had chicken, fish and pasta here in the past and have always been very content.  Last night's lamb sirloin with homemade spicy BBQ sauce and mashed potatoes was out of control.  If it was proper to lick the plate to show my enthusiasm of the dish I would have licked mine and the BFs clean.The Persian lime pie was a delicious and refreshing way to end such a great meal.  Can't wait to go back!P.S Join their mailing list.",5.0
"A rare gem in every way. Perfect. Food...ambiance...Proximity to the promenade. This place has ""date material"" written all over it.

It's an insane amount of food. I already can't wait to bring people back.",5.0
"SOOO disappointed!!!  I have a Gluten intolerance but can still find something on a menu - especially with a little help from the waitstaff and/or the chef.  I asked about the preparation of a dish which turned out would not be good for me and the waiter had NO interest in making another suggestion or asking the chef (other restaurants have been amazing). I know my gluten issue is not the waiters problem but if the waiter at least makes an effort to help me find something to eat, I will tip bigger, refer them to others and write a nice review.  NOT the case here.  I settled for  grilled chicken ceasar (without croutons) because I felt like I was inconveniencing the waiter by even asking. It sucks to have a food issue (this is new for me) but it sucks more to have wait staff that have no interest in making their customers dining experience a nice experience.With all of the people who have different food allergies and issues; resaturanteurs, wait staff and chefs should educate themselves and be able to make everyone's dining experience a pleasant one.",1.0

"If the patrons are indication of how great this place is, then the fact that the guy at the table next to me has been coming to the place for nearly 20 years and drove in from Long Island just to eat here should be pretty telling.  There was a 30 minute wait when we arrived and we were told to hang out at the wine bar while we wait (which is awesome).For dinner, we had the duck and three mustard salmon.  The three mustard salmon is one of the best fish sauces I've had in a long time.  Between that, the bottle of excellent Cabernet that the waitress suggested and an amazing chocolate confusion (yep, that's the name) dessert, it was a fantastic meal.  It is reasonably priced and well worth the trip.  If I had to add a negative, it would be the tables are really ""cozy.""  But that's to be expected in NYC.  I highly recommend this place and I will be going back regularly.",4.0

The sides served with it were just simple rice and sauteed snap peas. I honestly expected much more in the way of flavor and quality.  I have to give props to the place on their wine selection - nice (albeit brief) wine list with some nice reasonably priced selections.  Would I go back - maybe, but I'd be inclined to sample some of the other great restaurants in the area first.",3.0
"WOW where can I start about this amazing Brooklyn treasure! We were the first here for dinner and were met with the warmest faces and kindest people!

I loved watching her speak! The food was sooo good! I was nervous about eating boars stomach or any kind of liver but let me tell you they both have to be the best thing I have ever tasted in my life. I also had the organic chicken encrusted in almonds yum yum yum!!!!!!!!

"Wonderful wait service, but the wild game wasn't all that wildNever listen to Google map's direction service. I was coming from midtown so it told me to take the F train to York St and walk 9 minutes over to the restaurant. Besides getting lost (this place is right underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, so a lot of the streets end on one side or the other of the bridge), and taking about 10 minutes to reorient myself, I still have to walk like 15 minutes because last I checked, I can't walk through walls (or walls that are part of buildings) . I had to criss-cross many streets and walk through many underpass to finally find Henry St. It might look close on Google maps, but it certainly isn't logical and they didn't take in account that it was 10 degrees that night.The simplest and most straightforward way to get to this place in a winter day if you never been here before is the 2 or 3 train Clark St station (I went back to the city that way). Once you get out of the elevator, it will take you less than a few minutes to orient yourself and its about a 5 minute walk to the restaurant.When I finally got to the restaurant, the place was on the quiet side. The waitress was really nice and offered a lot of suggestions on what to order. We came here for the wild game festival, where you can eat anything from rattlesnake to lion (as the waitress mention they had once). The problem is it comes down to what they can get their hands on at any time so the wild game menu can really vary from day to day. I was really looking forward to the rattlesnake and the kangaroo, but they had neither of those items that day. So here's what we ended up ordering.Wild game pate - good, gamey, I forgot what the waitress said was in thereBBQ python salad - The salad tasted good, but I can't say the same for the python. It just tasted like BBQ chicken, except it was chewier. I really wouldn't have known it was python if you didn't tell me.Grill game Plate (wild boar belly, quail, elk chop) - a good variety, I like the wild boar belly the most, but then again, its not much diff than pork belly. The tremendous amount of fat makes anything good. The quail is good, plenty of dark meat, so it was tender and juicy throughout, but being Asian, I had quail more than your avg person that would try this dish. The elk chop was definitely new to me. It really had gamey taste, which I didn't like too much. I like the fact that I tried it, but it was my least favorite of the dish21 layer crepe cake - This dish got us talking about how you can fold paper more than 8x (and that was busted by Mythbusters with their football field size paper), but the crepe was really lack luster. I can't even say it tasted like crepesChocolate Confusion - A good amount of chocolates with more chocolate syrup drizzle on top and a scoop of ice cream. This was way better than the crepe cakeCall me when they have the Kangaroo, but I hope they serve it in a unique way so it doesn't taste so bland (like the BBQ python salad).",3.0

"Wow, I just feel stupid for having not eaten here before.We went for Christmas Eve dinner and had one of the most delicious meals we've had during our 7 years in NYC. I had a shaved brussels sprouts salad that sounded tame but was fantastic- light and flavorful and a nice big portion of veggies. The sole in lobster cream sauce was absolutely fantastic- perfectly done fish and lobster and well-seasoned. The lamb was buttery-tender and had a super-flavorful rub that managed not to overwhelm. Also worthy of note was our kind and funny waitress (whose name started with a B), excellent service from someone with a personality is always a plus.",5.0
"Yelped this place last Monday after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn side. It's really random picking but turned out to be a very fun night! Starter: my friend got a bean soup and both of us got a mushroom salad. very tasty and freshly good!I had a lobster pasta which is so creamy and irresistible! I generally don't eat creamy stuff but this time, i almost finish them all coz I just couldn't stop eating!Will def go back and try some other stuff!",4.0

"One of my favorite places period.I usually go for the wild game when it's in season (their elk chops are to-die-for and their turtle soup is delicious) but recently I went just for a regular dinner. The place is small, noisy and crowded but also very friendly and cozy. The service is warm and friendly and the waiters seem to be around always, they even know their customers by name. Food comes pretty quickly and they are very responsive to any changes (i.e. mashed potatoes versus french fries, etc). I highly recommend their Steak Diane (huge pieces in a wonderful sauce) as well as their wild mushroom salad. Ask the waitress for recommendations.",5.0
"Yummmmm.  Penne with butternut squash and anchovies. Perhaps an unexpected choice, but it was delicious. As was my goat cheese and beet salad. And post-dinner latte. And sesame-crusted tuna.

"Went to Henry's End for their infamous Wild Game Festival.  It did not disappoint.  There was enough variety and interest, the meat was all cooked well.Funny thing is all my friends liked my dish the best and I had the most ""normal"" dish one could get.  The Buffalo Hangar Steak...but it was DELICIOUS!The staff was helpful and pretty attentive.  The place is small and gets packed, especially for the Wild Game Festival.  We had originally made reservations for more people but the host was accommodating.All in all, a good experience!",3.0
"We went to this restaurant with friends. The food was above average in New York standards. Crab cakes were delicious but can't say the same thing for the main course. It is decent food but for the price I pay for it, I know way better places. (But then again, I am from Paris, I might have high expectations). I guess the ambiance and the attitude does not help. The place looks dirty and, avoid the tables in front of the restroom, because, boy it stinks. I guess they make enough money to renovate. Also, both waiters were plain rude. I won't return to place where I don't feel welcome.",3.0
"There are a few things that make this meal stand out as one of the best I have ever had in NYC.1) I was seated before my entire party arrived (this scores major points with me, especially at busy restaurants.  I despise when I make a reservation and can't be seated until everyone arrives.)2) Lindemans framboise - the only way to get mom to drink beer, and always a indication of good things to come.3) Turtle soup.  Sounds gross right?  I was pretty worried when the waitress suggested we add sherry to the bowl.  But guess what - turtle soup is pretty fanfuckingtastic.4)Tuna entree. I order rare tuna often and this was by far the best version I have had in NYC.5) Mrs. Mudpie.  Well helllloooo healthbar.  You are looking fine tonight!Conclusion? One of the best restaurants in Brooklyn, Manhattan or anywhere- well worth your money.",5.0

"My boyfriend and I just moved to the area and have been checking out the local restaurants.  Lastnight we took my parents to Henry's End and were pretty much embarrassed.  It's a good thing we prefaced the meal with ""now keep in mind, this is our first time eating here too""The area and decor is charming and very comfortable.  We are not snooty diners and love restaurants that look more rustic and serve amazing food, so upon being seated we were looking forward to the experience and really WANTED it to be a good one.The first thing we noticed was that the service wasn't great.  Our server (don't know his name since he never introduced himself, but we called him ""Justin"" since he looks exactly like Justin Timberlake) was very quiet and seemed pissed off to be there.  When he took our orders, he asked my mom and me how we'd like our salmon cooked, but failed to ask my boyfriend how he'd like his veal cooked, and refused to substitute sides (which is fine, I understand sometimes they are not allowed) in an almost appalled way.The bread was delicious and the drinks came out fast, but I have reason to suspect I was not served the Pinot Noir I asked for since it tasted more like a Cabernet, but no problem - I just passed it over to my boyfriend and ordered an iced tea.  Our appetizers came out - Ceasar salad, mixed greens salad and crab cakes.  The salads were average (how do you mess a salad up?) and the crab cakes were AWFUL.  They were hardly crispy on the outside, quite mushy on the inside and the chunks of corn inside obviously came from a can.  My dad put it best when he said they were just bland and lacked the ""kick"" crab cakes need to make them outstanding... Okay, no matter... we move on to the main course with open minds...The main courses were TERRIBLE!!  My mother ordered the Morroccan Salmon which came with powdery dry ""garlic"" mashed potatoes which did not taste like they had a bit of garlic in them.  The salmon was a bit overcooked even though she asked for it medium rare and it was drowned in sauce (the sauce was good, but too much).  I ordered the herb crusted salmon which was cooked well (medium well) and actually okay, although my boyfriend says it wasn't prepared well since it was a bit ""fishy"" and didn't taste fresh.  The sauce was delicious but unlike my mother's dish, they did not give me enough.  It came with a very boring arugula side salad that I didn't even touch.  My father's penne with lobster was decent - he said there were enough large chunks of lobster in it which was nice.  My boyfriend's dish had to be the worst - he ordered the veal special with goat cheese.  It was barely luke warm, an extremely small portion and the sauce tasted like a watered down BBQ sauce.  He ate it because he was starving but said it was pretty bad.  All of our entrees came with a side of DRY rice (uncle ben's I presume) and extremely salty undercooked greenbeans.  Very very disappointing.Of course we skipped coffee and dessert, and the total bill for two iced teas, two glasses of wine, three appetizers and four entrees was $160 including a measly 12% tip which wasn't bad, but way overpriced for the awful food.I don't know if we just went on a bad night or what, but needless to say we will never go back.  For those of you looking to try something in the area, the Brooklyn Heights wine bar on the corner of Cranberry and Henry and Noodle Pudding right next door are way better choices.",1.0
"My boyfriend found out this place had a wild game festival starting up in the fall and we were patiently biding our time to check it out. I happened to be home now for a few days so we decided to drop in on friday, they did not have the elusive Kangaroo on the menu but we figured there would be other exotic enough things on the menu for us to order.It is a pretty small space, we got there at around 7ish and it was a bit crowded with an early dinner crowd, luckily there was no wait. There were different wine specials around the restaurant on dry erase boards...the half carafe apparently gives you about 3.5 glasses but for the pricing its worth it to get a whole bottle if you are going to not bother just getting a glass at a time.So on to the food, of course we had to get the turtle soup since there were so many rave reviews about it, we also decided to try to the game charcuterie plate. The turtle soup was perfect to me without having to add the splash of sherry and it had a bit of a kick to it, I enjoyed it and would recommend getting it. The charcuterie plate was so so, it included a spicy buffalo sausage which was not to bad, a pheasant sausage which was excellent (although I was trying to get away from the pheasant since I am in South Dakota right now which is apparently the pheasant hunting capital of the world) and a country game pate which I have no idea what was in it but it was cold and had bits of carrot in it...not that great. There was a spicy mustard and some sort of jam that went good with the sausages.On to the main courses, my boyfriend got the mixed game grill which this time around included the elk chop, venison sausage and wild boar belly and I got a half portion of the penne with rabbit sausage. We did not get a heads up about how the meat was going to be prepared so the elk was served up quite rare...so rare that there was a little river of blood flowing into the gravy, it did not detract from the taste which was excellent but it would have been nice to have a bit of a heads up about it. The elk chop also had some kind of a mustard coating on it which was very good it was the highlight of the plate, the venison sausage was fine and the boar belly was very good it had a pistachio and cranberry dusting with an essence of bacon to it, I also enjoyed that. The pasta was pretty good as well it had some sort of spice to it and the rabbit sausage was good, the pheasant sausage definitely was the winner of the sausages for the night. I also agree that the veggies and rice were quite uninspired and looked out of place, it seemed to have been thrown in just to give a ""side"" -- the meal would have been fine without it. We did not sample dessert as we were quite stuffed.I am not sure that we would go back again since it is out of the way for us but it was good to go once and the meal was not disappointing pretty reasonable in price for what we got.FYI on wild game from my experiences - Reindeer aka caribou is not as tender as venison.  Antelope and venison are pretty much the same, antelope are a bit smaller so they might be more tender. Pheasant is similar to duck in that is is kind of a darker game bird. Rattlesnake is a paler meat and kind of tough and does not really taste like chicken. Buffalo is very similar to beef but you should get it as rare as you can take it.",4.0
"A serious disappointment.There was no game on the menu when I went there, the service was poor and the food was very heavy and uninteresting.  The best things I can say is that the wine was nice and they gave us free dessert.  Otherwise the decor is terrible and this place is overpriced.",2.0
"I went here once for my Dad's birthday. The food was great, everything was fresh and delicious. As a main course i had the black pepper crusted new york strip. It was very tasty and flavorful.

My brother had the fried chicken which was pretty good. Overall we all enjoyed the place and thought it was worth trying. The only negative is the price. It's quite expensive - especially if you plan on having a few drinks.",4.0
"Atmosphere wise, Henry's End has a dim casual bistro setting - it was a little on the loud and crowded side.  As for the service, I believe we had Bonnie, who was, um, interesting - it's a very casual serving style that I could see bothering people who are a little, um, stodgier than my wife and I.  This is not a pretentious place.My venison dish was the highlight of the experience - absolutely succulent, not at all dry.  Unfortunately, my wife's sole citron was not as memorable, so if we head back we will probably stick to the game.  As for the wine, they had an excellent Columbia valley red by the half liter.Just a solid neighborhood bistro - I will have to try the game again, as this place might warrant five stars.",4.0

"My boyfriend and I just moved to the area and have been checking out the local restaurants.  Lastnight we took my parents to Henry's End and were pretty much embarrassed.  It's a good thing we prefaced the meal with ""now keep in mind, this is our first time eating here too""The area and decor is charming and very comfortable.  We are not snooty diners and love restaurants that look more rustic and serve amazing food, so upon being seated we were looking forward to the experience and really WANTED it to be a good one.The first thing we noticed was that the service wasn't great.  Our server (don't know his name since he never introduced himself, but we called him ""Justin"" since he looks exactly like Justin Timberlake) was very quiet and seemed pissed off to be there.  When he took our orders, he asked my mom and me how we'd like our salmon cooked, but failed to ask my boyfriend how he'd like his veal cooked, and refused to substitute sides (which is fine, I understand sometimes they are not allowed) in an almost appalled way.The bread was delicious and the drinks came out fast, but I have reason to suspect I was not served the Pinot Noir I asked for since it tasted more like a Cabernet, but no problem - I just passed it over to my boyfriend and ordered an iced tea.  Our appetizers came out - Ceasar salad, mixed greens salad and crab cakes.  The salads were average (how do you mess a salad up?) and the crab cakes were AWFUL.  They were hardly crispy on the outside, quite mushy on the inside and the chunks of corn inside obviously came from a can.  My dad put it best when he said they were just bland and lacked the ""kick"" crab cakes need to make them outstanding... Okay, no matter... we move on to the main course with open minds...The main courses were TERRIBLE!!  My mother ordered the Morroccan Salmon which came with powdery dry ""garlic"" mashed potatoes which did not taste like they had a bit of garlic in them.  The salmon was a bit overcooked even though she asked for it medium rare and it was drowned in sauce (the sauce was good, but too much).  I ordered the herb crusted salmon which was cooked well (medium well) and actually okay, although my boyfriend says it wasn't prepared well since it was a bit ""fishy"" and didn't taste fresh.  The sauce was delicious but unlike my mother's dish, they did not give me enough.  It came with a very boring arugula side salad that I didn't even touch.  My father's penne with lobster was decent - he said there were enough large chunks of lobster in it which was nice.  My boyfriend's dish had to be the worst - he ordered the veal special with goat cheese.  It was barely luke warm, an extremely small portion and the sauce tasted like a watered down BBQ sauce.  He ate it because he was starving but said it was pretty bad.  All of our entrees came with a side of DRY rice (uncle ben's I presume) and extremely salty undercooked greenbeans.  Very very disappointing.Of course we skipped coffee and dessert, and the total bill for two iced teas, two glasses of wine, three appetizers and four entrees was $160 including a measly 12% tip which wasn't bad, but way overpriced for the awful food.I don't know if we just went on a bad night or what, but needless to say we will never go back.  For those of you looking to try something in the area, the Brooklyn Heights wine bar on the corner of Cranberry and Henry and Noodle Pudding right next door are way better choices.",1.0
"My boyfriend found out this place had a wild game festival starting up in the fall and we were patiently biding our time to check it out. I happened to be home now for a few days so we decided to drop in on friday, they did not have the elusive Kangaroo on the menu but we figured there would be other exotic enough things on the menu for us to order.It is a pretty small space, we got there at around 7ish and it was a bit crowded with an early dinner crowd, luckily there was no wait. There were different wine specials around the restaurant on dry erase boards...the half carafe apparently gives you about 3.5 glasses but for the pricing its worth it to get a whole bottle if you are going to not bother just getting a glass at a time.So on to the food, of course we had to get the turtle soup since there were so many rave reviews about it, we also decided to try to the game charcuterie plate. The turtle soup was perfect to me without having to add the splash of sherry and it had a bit of a kick to it, I enjoyed it and would recommend getting it. The charcuterie plate was so so, it included a spicy buffalo sausage which was not to bad, a pheasant sausage which was excellent (although I was trying to get away from the pheasant since I am in South Dakota right now which is apparently the pheasant hunting capital of the world) and a country game pate which I have no idea what was in it but it was cold and had bits of carrot in it...not that great. There was a spicy mustard and some sort of jam that went good with the sausages.On to the main courses, my boyfriend got the mixed game grill which this time around included the elk chop, venison sausage and wild boar belly and I got a half portion of the penne with rabbit sausage. We did not get a heads up about how the meat was going to be prepared so the elk was served up quite rare...so rare that there was a little river of blood flowing into the gravy, it did not detract from the taste which was excellent but it would have been nice to have a bit of a heads up about it. The elk chop also had some kind of a mustard coating on it which was very good it was the highlight of the plate, the venison sausage was fine and the boar belly was very good it had a pistachio and cranberry dusting with an essence of bacon to it, I also enjoyed that. The pasta was pretty good as well it had some sort of spice to it and the rabbit sausage was good, the pheasant sausage definitely was the winner of the sausages for the night. I also agree that the veggies and rice were quite uninspired and looked out of place, it seemed to have been thrown in just to give a ""side"" -- the meal would have been fine without it. We did not sample dessert as we were quite stuffed.I am not sure that we would go back again since it is out of the way for us but it was good to go once and the meal was not disappointing pretty reasonable in price for what we got.FYI on wild game from my experiences - Reindeer aka caribou is not as tender as venison.  Antelope and venison are pretty much the same, antelope are a bit smaller so they might be more tender. Pheasant is similar to duck in that is is kind of a darker game bird. Rattlesnake is a paler meat and kind of tough and does not really taste like chicken. Buffalo is very similar to beef but you should get it as rare as you can take it.",4.0
"A serious disappointment.There was no game on the menu when I went there, the service was poor and the food was very heavy and uninteresting.  The best things I can say is that the wine was nice and they gave us free dessert.  Otherwise the decor is terrible and this place is overpriced.",2.0
"I went here once for my Dad's birthday. The food was great, everything was fresh and delicious. As a main course i had the black pepper crusted new york strip. It was very tasty and flavorful. The sauce they put on top was also really good. My dad had the same steak as well and he enjoyed it. My girlfriend ordered the duck. It was average, not bad but not great. My brother had the fried chicken which was pretty good. Overall we all enjoyed the place and thought it was worth trying. The only negative is the price. It's quite expensive - especially if you plan on having a few drinks.",4.0
"Atmosphere wise, Henry's End has a dim casual bistro setting - it was a little on the loud and crowded side.  As for the service, I believe we had Bonnie, who was, um, interesting - it's a very casual serving style that I could see bothering people who are a little, um, stodgier than my wife and I.  This is not a pretentious place.My venison dish was the highlight of the experience - absolutely succulent, not at all dry.  Unfortunately, my wife's sole citron was not as memorable, so if we head back we will probably stick to the game.  As for the wine, they had an excellent Columbia valley red by the half liter.Just a solid neighborhood bistro - I will have to try the game again, as this place might warrant five stars.",4.0
"By far one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn! The specialty here is wild game which I've never had, but my two favorites are mouth watering! The mustard sesame crusted seared tuna and chicken with goat cheese and pears, OMG! They also have quite an impressive wine selection where you can order by the class, 1/2 carafe, full carafe and bottle. If you go into the bathrooms, there are a ton of write ups on the wall about the place and the head chef/owner who is now always up front greeting the customers! Everyone is extremely friend and knowledabe.. The place is small, but that's what makes it so cozy and intimate. I love the atmosphere, food, wine, service... everything.",5.0

"Service = okay. Atmosphere = quaint & romantic. Price = Overly expensive. Food = minimal & typical. Boy, was I disappointed with this place. My major complaint was with quantity of food served. I ordered their short ribs, which was certainly a mistake-- the entrée consisted of 3 small, half-dollar sized pieces of beef served over a half cup of mashed potatoes and 3 pieces of broccoli. Did they think they were serving food to a toddler? For $22.95, I expected ALOT more. As for the meat itself, it was tender, but the gravy tasted like packaged instant gravy. The mashed potatoes were typical but served mixed with wasabi or horseradish, which really added nothing special to the mix (in other words, they were bland)... plus, they weren't even creamy. We did order the crab cakes appetizer with our meal, and it was flavorful, but, again, they were quite small. Note that if you order them, they are deep fried and not pan fried or baked, so they aren't really flaky like you find in most restaurants. Nonetheless, they tasted fine. Vinny ordered a strip steak smothered in a mustard sauce. The portion size for this was a little better than the other items we ordered, and he said the steak tasted fine.  All in all, our experience was mixed, with Vinny liking the restaurant more than me. But, oh how I wanted to fall in love with this place b/c it's close to our house... but I was mostly disappointed.",2.0
"I went to Henry's End last night, and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I heard about this place awhile ago and was intrigued by the whole Game Festival thing. After reading various reviews I decided that I would order the Duckling with Lingonberry and Mushrooms. While the skin was crispy and the meat very tender and moist (not oily or fatty), I thought the flavors were lacking (bland). I also ordered the tortilla shrimp dish. I loved the chipotle mayo with the shrimp - it had a nice zing. The shrimp were not greasy at all. I didnt really feel there was a need for the guacamole alongside, as it had a very subdued  flavor. It just seemed like mashed up avocado with no seasoning. They did include lemon wedges, so maybe I should have squeezed a bit of that on the guac to add more flavor. I would definitely order that again, maybe the meal size portion.I liked  the decor of the restaurant. It had a very homey feel. The place was small - smaller than it looks on their website. (our table was about 3 inches from the one next to ours).  It was very crowded, and there was a wait when we arrived, but we were seated within less than the 5 min we were told.  The first thing that struck me when we entered were the amazing smells. The kitchen was almost right there in the open (not a separate room).The service was attentive. Our waiter was extremely patient and answered any questions we had about the menu. I like the idea of this place, but was a bit disappointed with the food (for the price - almost $100 for 2). I would like to go back to give it a second shot. Any recommendations for what to order?",3.0
"Mediocre, particularly at these prices. We had 5 dishes and none... really, not one, was interesting. We started with a salad and moved on two chicken dishes which were just bland. The dessert (perhaps called the Mrs Mud - second down from the top of the dessert menu) was honestly TERRIBLE. It was a rock hard block of Heath bar ice cream and absolutely not worth it. I never return food, but I should have returned it in all is icey, flavorless splendor.  I want to like Henry's End. I've always hears great things about it but for this price,they need to do better (like a lot better).",2.0
"The eastern end Henry Street, cleaved between the established brownstones of Brooklyn Heights and the industrial but refurbished BUMBO neighborhood, can claim some of the best, seldom discussed restaurants in Brooklyn.  Running parallel to Smith Street on a map, it runs nowhere near it on the radar.It's just a quick walk for me whereas Smith Street means a trip on the subway or bus, or some pedestrian ambition.  Having cycled through each restaurant between Middagh and Clark, I finally wandered in to Henry's End whose façade and name connoted a dive bar.  The ""wild game festival"" menu hanging in the window from October until March persuaded me to make a reservation.Established in 1973 as a local hangout and burger bar, Henry's End inherited that frowzy atmosphere, but chef Mark Lahm worked his way up the restaurant brigade, starting as a busboy and moving through the front of the house.  Eventually, Lahm attended the CIA and took over Henry's end in 1986.  Somewhere along the line he developed a taste for game.  Venison, quail and buffalo are found in many restaurants, but elk, rattlesnake and turtle are a bit harder to come by.The exposed brick and slate tabletops give Henry's End the kind of masculine feel that stuffed heads and other taxidermist bric-a-brac can muster in places like Freeman's and Trophy Bar.  The wine list is as steroidal and bold.  New World wines from California, and South Africa feature as prominently as  whites from Oregon and Washington state.  A 2005 Napa Cabernet Sauvignon (Panacea) was painfully bold, but a Stag's Leap of the same appellation was velvety enough to enrobe a meal of mushrooms, game and chocolate.A meal can easily become a feast.  Ordering a couple of salads to whet our appetites, my beautiful fiancé and I were surprised a large plate piled high with large cubes of beets, whole pistachios and enough chevre to fill out a healthy cheese board.  The dish overwhelmed and even threatened the sanctity of an evening out; meanwhile, a mushroom salad tossed with walnuts and perfunctory greens deceived the stomach but warmed the palate with the image of the hunt.Not that any great hunting is taking place at Henry's End.  Ostrich comes to Brooklyn by bridge and tunnel.  Quails come us from Georgia, perhaps with the Braves when the play the Mets.  Stuffed with chard and pomegranate, the tender foul is juicy but the greens added a bitterness that fought against, rather than accentuated, the sweetness of the dish.  The wait staff is well trained and polished.  The rolled up sleeves of their denim shirts reminded me of trips to Lake Tahoe and the sporty waiters who looked like LL Bean catalogue models, yet at every point in the meal I was attended to and never bothered.  As I began to enjoy an herb-crusted elk chop, I noted how fine the cutlery was.  Much leaner than beef and pork, the sturdy knife was helpful.  The herbs, largely parsley, some lemon zest, peppercorns and breadcrumbs were fine, but I detected a bit of complacency in it.Across from me, I noticed a fine fillet of salmon in a ""three mustards"" sauce being pulled apart by a fork.  A side of garlic mash potatoes was, as the waiter promised, worth the price of the dish.  The mustard sauce was deficient though.  It was simply lathered across the flesh, it seemed, rather than part of it.  While nicely composed, it failed to register anything but satisfaction, if somewhat limited.The finest dish was an antelope au poivre.  I expected little more than venison, but antelope in this fashion had the gaminess of wild boar, the texture of beef and the sweetness of the best pork.  Lean but succulent, the green peppercorns leached a little more juice from the bone-in steak.  While everything was well handled and the kitchen operated with timeliness and care, the desserts were disappointing.  A Fonseca Vintage Port capped a nice meal but the Mud Pie that was recommended was served on an icy plate but topped with hot fudge.  As anticipated the fudge become little more than troublesome tar.  10pm feels late at Henry's End.  The crowd thins out dramatically and we were left with espressos and the chattering accompaniment of four expatriated Italians.  Stuffed and exhausted we left to views of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.  It's not an every night place, or even a monthly spot but once a season it is well worth it.",4.0

All the sauces were perfect, as were the delightful side of mashed potatoes, rice and snap peas. A great, well priced bottle of wine topped off this absolutely fantastic meal.

Also, if you duck, steak and game, they have some great meats that are always very well done (i.e. elk, etc.) Further, service is always laid back, solid and relaxing - this is one of those places that you end up wanting to order another bottle of wine just so you can hang around and nibble at your plate, share stories with whoever you're with and just kick it.Also great - they'll take down your name and birthday (if you want) and mail you a card every year for a free entree - a simple, but really thoughtful, touch that wins points in my book. All in all - a great time.",4.0

"My friends and I were taking a walk over the Brooklyn bridge for my birthday and wanted to find a place for dinner nearby. When a quick Google search led me to Henry's End's website and I saw the words ""wild game festival,""  I knew I had to check the place out. I had read some reviews about some of the more exotic game (such as kangaroo) not being available but it was on the menu last night; we did go pretty early in the festival, which I believe begins at the start of October. On the server's suggestion, I ordered the mixed grill, which consisted of an elk chop, wild boar belly, and venison sausage. It did not disappoint. Everything was delicious and properly cooked. (It is really easy to overcook many game meats.) My less adventurous friends chose chicken and pasta dishes that they enjoyed. To give you an idea of price, my game platter was about $30; my friend's meals were more around $20. A prix-fix $25 meal is available Monday to Thursday and includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. (There are some game items on the price fix menu, although the wild boar penne has a $2 surcharge.) The atmosphere was casual and cozy. I saw several couples enjoying what I imagine would be a nice, low-key date night. While crowded and somewhat loud, I did not feel cramped at all and had no problem enjoying some lively conversation with my friends. My friends arranged for a birthday candle in my banana pudding. While not the sort of place where all the workers gather together to sing (thank G0d!), the enthusiastic server presented the pudding dish in a plate that said ""Happy Birthday Carli"" in chocolate along the rim. My review is only based on one visit, but I really enjoyed myself and hope to return before the wild game festival ends (I believe in February, but don't quote me on it). It is very close to the Brooklyn bridge (one of my favorite walks in NYC) and a great choice for a fun grown-up birthday dinner.",5.0

"So my wife used to be vegan: she started a couple years after we began dating and held out for 4 years or so. She recently began eating fish - still no land animals or dairy. This was the first place we went to after she came back to fish. It was cold and snowy, back in Dec. '09 when she and I first went. I had been twice before several years ago and knew what to expect.  We've returned once since. the most recent time we had to wait around for like 20 minutes for a table, but they brought us wine and we just chilled.

Likewise the Wild mushroom salad. I enjoyed the wild game mixed entree both times, but since it had different stuff each time (except the best part, the wild boar belly, which was on both) I think it counts as two separate experiences. The herb-crusted elk chop was very nice, the venison was even better, the stuffed quail was pretty good but lacked something in comparison, and the boar belly is out of this world. And there was some kind of sausages one time that was quite well-made, if not as spicy as I'd prefer. The wine list was affordable and well-stocked. The service is nice without being pretentious or overbearing, though maybe it's just the one tall older lady with the smoker's voice and cough who we've had both times as our server that I'm grading and not their waitstaff as a whole.

"We've been here a handful of times and it's always been a fun experience.Of note - they have a remarkably well-priced and solidly stocked wine list - you can get some great bottles for very reasonable prices. Also, if you duck, steak and game, they have some great meats that are always very well done (i.e. elk, etc.) Further, service is always laid back, solid and relaxing - this is one of those places that you end up wanting to order another bottle of wine just so you can hang around and nibble at your plate, share stories with whoever you're with and just kick it.Also great - they'll take down your name and birthday (if you want) and mail you a card every year for a free entree - a simple, but really thoughtful, touch that wins points in my book.

Also...I have my doubts about it being sole; if it was sole it was the thickest piece of sole I've ever had.  At first bite, I was inclined to believe the fish was also frozen, and not fresh catch. Trust me, I know my fresh fish...I grew up by the sea. I ate as much of it as i could, but just couldn't get through the mushy, grainy texture of the fish to finish the meal....disappointing at best. I then ordered a banana pudding that arrived in a martini glass. Without exaggeration, there was two inches of pudding topped with five inches of whipped cream....nice presentation, but it took three tries to reach the pudding through the mountain of topping.

The boar, however, was delicious, and I wish I'd had more -- a nicely crispy crackling skin over juicy meat, with flavorful layers of fat.The restaurant is small, narrow, and dark -- it looks like a bar that has been converted to a restaurant.

"Henry's End is the definition of a 'local gem.'  Cozy, warm, and worn in around the edges but sophisticated enough to impress the palate and delight the senses.  Around 15 tables, a tiny bar, and a semi-open kitchen are tucked into the narrow space.  The closeness and transparency make for an atmosphere that is somewhat like being in a familiar family clubhouse on the backstreets of a Northeastern town in a bygone era.  Because of the 'warm' feel, Henry's End seems like a cozy sanctuary from chilly New York nights. The menu is a treasure -- both entrees that I sampled were excellent and mouthwatering (steak au poivre and chicken w/ goat cheese, fig jam).  Presentation was unadulterated, simple, non-gimmicky.Our server was friendly, comforting, good natured.  He seemed rather young and may actually have been the son of the woman managing the place.  Henry's End patrons are Brooklynians joining their families for dinner, meeting their loves for dates, or reconnecting with old friends around good meals.  This spot has none of the icy cold standoffishness that so many 'scene' establishments think is necessary to match high quality food.  Bottom line: go here with company with whom you wish to eat well and keep close to you.",5.0

"Henry's End is the definition of a 'local gem.'  Cozy, warm, and worn in around the edges but sophisticated enough to impress the palate and delight the senses.  Around 15 tables, a tiny bar, and a semi-open kitchen are tucked into the narrow space.  The closeness and transparency make for an atmosphere that is somewhat like being in a familiar family clubhouse on the backstreets of a Northeastern town in a bygone era.  Because of the 'warm' feel, Henry's End seems like a cozy sanctuary from chilly New York nights. The menu is a treasure -- both entrees that I sampled were excellent and mouthwatering (steak au poivre and chicken w/ goat cheese, fig jam).  Presentation was unadulterated, simple, non-gimmicky.Our server was friendly, comforting, good natured.  He seemed rather young and may actually have been the son of the woman managing the place.  Henry's End patrons are Brooklynians joining their families for dinner, meeting their loves for dates, or reconnecting with old friends around good meals.  This spot has none of the icy cold standoffishness that so many 'scene' establishments think is necessary to match high quality food.  Bottom line: go here with company with whom you wish to eat well and keep close to you.",5.0

"In spring of 2005 I was dating a girl from Brooklyn Heights. The romance did not work out but one night we dined at Henry's End and I can say that this restaurant is the best thing that came out of that relationship. I put my name on their mailing list and every year around my birthday I get a voucher in the mail for a free entree. For the past six years I have dined at Henry's End on my birthday weekend and it has been an affair to remember. Chef/Owner Mark Lahm began his career at Henry's End in 1981 as a dishwasher and busboy. He eventually became a waiter, then manager, then chef. In 1986, he graduated from the Culinary Institute of America and took over the restaurant and Henry's End has become one of the best kept secret foodie destinations in Brooklyn to this day. The 2006 Zagat awarded the restaurant a score of 26 for food and an earlier edition stated ""this is why they built the Brooklyn Bridge"". In 2002, Mark and his staff hosted an event at the prestigious James Beard House. The restaurant has a cozy cabin-like feel but with taller ceilings adorned with fans and neon lights. The spacious open kitchen allows for diners to watch their meals come to creation methodically. Tables are a little tight together but in this environment it adds to the dining experience rather than detracting. The staff is very friendly and treats you like family even if it's your first time at Henry's End. Chef Lahm crafts entrees like chicken with pears, walnuts, and blue cheese, and blackened lamb sirloin over garlic mashed potatoes. Warm up with his New Orleans turtle soup and sherry. Make sure to visit Henry's End in the fall and winter (October-March) for their famous Wild Game Festival, where exotic game dishes like the herb-crusted elk and pepper-crusted venison and roasted wild boar are legendary. As an appetizer, the restaurant does offer an Assorted Wild Game Charcuterie of which, on this visit, included buffalo sausage, partridge sausage and Muscovy Duck pâte. Antelope, bear, kangaroo and python salad are also among the ferocious fare available at this white-tablecloth Brooklyn Heights standby. The restaurant is also known for its great duck dishes. The ducklings are braised in their own natural juices until they are flavorful and fork tender. Then they are boned and the fat rendered until the skin is delightfully crisp. The accompanying sauces include raspberry, or honey and ginger with soy and scallions, or a wild mushroom lingonberry sauce with shallots, thyme and brandy. To entice recession affected diners, Henry's End has been offering a $25 three course prix fixe on Mondays thru Thursdays with wine pairings for an additional $14. The restaurant also features an award winning American wine list. Chef Lahm carefully selects an eclectic wine menu for his offerings. On this night a 2007 Amador Rose was paired with scrumptious al dente crab and lobster ravioli. Diver scallops faired well with the grape tomatoes and a 2006 Dr. Frank Rkatsiteli varietal. Moroccan Grilled Salmon topped with a compound butter made from cumin, cayenne, mint and scallions and served over garlic mashed potatoes was a wonderful healthy option. ""Drop-your-fork"" delicious spinach sautéed in garlic went great with cauliflower, capers and cranberries. With the main courses, we indulged in hearty sides of arugula and roasted beets paired with a 2007 Van Ruiten Chardonnay. My Duck with Wild Morel & Portobello Mushrooms & Lingonberries Sauce, shallots, thyme and brandy melted in my mouth as I swirled my aromatic glass of 2005 David Bruce Petite Sirah. The meal crescendo included a Valrhona black and white chocolate mousse and an apple golden raisin cobbler covered in a light and flaky almond streusel crust. Our diligent server Nate paired our desserts with a satisfying glass of Fonseca Bin 27 Port. Dinner for two with birthday discount, tax and tip was $120.",4.0

If you are into eating hard to get animals like kangaroo and turtle then this is the place for you! I stuck with ""safer"" items (mixed field greens and Moroccan salmon). The salad was great - very fresh, cold and crisp, right amount of dressing. The salmon was OK but not fantastic. It was cooked perfectly, and you get a decent sized portion. The Moroccan sauce was a little too much for me. It was very strong and extremely oily. I would have been happier with half as much, but I was able to push it away (minus the oil). The vegetable side (when I went it was snow peas) was also very oily. It wasn't bad, it just could have been a lot lighter for my taste.The others at my table gave mixed reviews.

Ah, forget it.  i don't even have the verbal capacity to describe everything that found their way into our tummies.  it was all outstanding.accompanying each entree was a side dish containing the least amount of items that could be combined on one plate and still be referred to as a ""dish"" -- two forkfuls of rice, a bite each of cauliflower and carrot, and a singular, halved, brussels sprout.  fine by me.   after all, i came for the meat.  the less distractions, the better, in my opinion.we heard rattlesnake and kangaroo will be featured before the festival ends -- i'm already planning my repeat appearance.",5.0
"Henry's End is a small place with intimate lighting. I went on a Tuesday evening around 8pm. The atmosphere was okay. The crowd was full of ""mature"" white Americans. Not much diversity in age or race. I had the pre fix meal. I wasnt quite fixed though. If you get the Honey Ginger Duck its 3 dollars extra. The duck was average. It tasted like high-end Chinese food. Sweet and sour duck. I wouldnt recommend it. My bill was over 80 bucks for 2 fixed meals, and it wasnt worth it. My date had the Veal, and he liked it a lot. The food is not awful, just quite average for the price you pay, oh and its BORING in that place!",2.0
"I found Henry's End accidentally, trying to find a good restaurant to visit with my parents.  If I lived in Brooklyn Heights, I'd eat here once a week!  Despite the wild game menu that everyone raves about, I usually get their salmon.  Whether it's salmon with lentils, salmon crusted with crabmeat, or their salmon moroccan (my husband's favorite,) it's always perfect!  Their weeknight prix fixe menu is better than any deal you'll score during restaurant week -- $25 for three courses, and well worth it.  Their persian lime pie is a great way to end the night.  In addition to their fantastic menu, one of the best parts of Henry's End is the staff -- always welcoming, friendly, and accommodating.  We've visited several times over the past year and feel like we've been regulars for years!",5.0
"Just went here for a dinner on a Thursday night.  My lady and I had: - horseradish crusted shrimp (3 tasty shrimp for 10 bucks) - a little pricey, but good.  - A half order of Penne w/ venison sausage (the sausage was very good, though I would not order pasta here -that is just the Italian in me.)- The 5 spice blackened Shell steak w/ apple compote (which is served cold, I think it should have been hot)- Good stuff thoughand the big winner of the night was the - DUCK.  we got the berry and mushroom sauce.  This was up there with the best duck I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly, lots of meat, crispy skin.  The meat pulled away in shreds and was not overly fatty.  By far the best dish we had.  The service here is very good and the wine list is good too.  Okay, this was not the most clever review - but you got to hear what we had and now you know to get the duck.... enjoy!",4.0
"I like game.  If you don't, this probably isn't for you.  Cozy, small, intimate.  The kind of place that doesn't have to pretend about anything.  Great wine list, and attentive, unannoying staff (sime might mistake this for snootiness, but I never liked a server saying, ""Hi, I;m Amber and I'll be taking care of you tonight..."").  Yes, the desert choices are skimpy, but you don't come here for desert.  Love it.",5.0
"This place is fantastic.  Nothing pretentious about it, and the motherly waitress whos name escapes me is always there to please.What rules about this place is their fall/winter wild game menu, they call it their wild game festival i believe.Very well priced wine menu, with a chalkboard for specials by the glass every night.  Unless I'm mistaken the current chef owner was a dishwasher their a long time ago and worked his way up.  Cant beat that!",4.0
"Let me start off by saying that to read through all these reviews you kind of get the sense that you were about to walk into a wild animal cowboy house with deer heads on the wall. Not at all the case. They just happen to have an amazing food selection in the winter that is called the wild game festival. It's classy and intimate.That said, I lived in Brooklyn Heights for 7 years (oh Brooklyn, how I miss you!) and spend most of my expendable income on food and wine. I believe that some of the most incredible restaurants in the world reside in NY and this is my favorite restaurant in all of NYC. The owner, Marc, is an incredible and kind host. Bonnie is a wonderful friend and waitress who thrilled my boyfriend by calling him 'Darling' and giving us both kisses when we walked in.My very favorite things on the menu by far are the Turtle Soup and, and I know this sounds so boring, the Chicken Lemonase, but I've never had another entree at any other restaurant that with every single bite I close my eyes and am in heaven.... Still happens after having this dish at least 20 times.  As a graphic designer i even asked Marc once if I could do the logo for his new wine bar down the street (also really great) and only be asked to be paid in Chicken Lemonase. No joke.  I've moved to NJ but we still head to Henry's End for every special meal, anniversary, bday, etc.",5.0
"Excellent!  I went there last night with my mom (who is also a foodie) and everything we ate was delicious! I will keep my review short and sweet because our dinner was just that that. Go, Go, Go.

"We had a delicious meal here. We came during the week and took advantage of the price fixed menu (M-TH). Service was fantastic, the food was even better. I think the appetizers were the highlight of the meal.

We will definitely return to try some of the other fantastic looking menu items.",5.0
"The BF and I had been told we HAD to come here, and when my parents were in town, we finally decided to try it. So we got there a tad early and they politely asked if we wouldn't mind going to wine bar next door to have a drink, and they would come get us. We were totally fine with this, since they don't have a bar, and they came and got us very quickly. So we started off well..The food, service and management was great. We all got different things and loved all of them. My dad and BF tried different wild game entrees and we're so impressed, while my mom, my sister, and I keep it basic, but still loved it none-the-less. The waitress was super nice, always attentive and put up with my dad's ""dad jokes"" (we all know what thats like). The manager or owner was very nice too, he was the one who came and got us from the wine bar, called us a cab after our meal (yes, suburbanite parents refuse to walk a few blocks) and was overall, very accommodating. I would definitely come back here. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu here!",5.0

"I went there after a long walk on the Brooklyn bridge. There was no Wild Game plate that day, so my bf and I ordered the dinner combo. My appetizer corn calamari patty was a bit too salty. but the sauce came with it was creamy enough to tone down it a bit. My rib was cooked very well. It melt right away in my mouth, but it was also a bit heavy on the sourness. Again, it is an appetizer, so the acidity wasn't that big of a problem here. and it help to tone down the fattiness of the meat. Main courses were Soft shell crab, veal (forgot the long name) it came with a very creamy sauce with some diced tomato. i thought it was pork first, since the way it was prepared was deep fried with coated flour, then simmered with the sauce afterward. It made the texture of the meat taste more like pork. it was a okay dish. Not bad but not wahhh ~My bf's plate (soft shell crab) on the other hand was so delicious, the seasoning was just right. Not too salty and very savory. Americans don't cook with MSG or Chicken Essence Powder often. The savory of this dish came from the freshness of the raw material ( crab). The only thing is i wish there were some vegetables on the side. dessert were okay okay. Again, this is not a bakery or a dessert hot spot. Mine was meshed banana with whip cream on the top. Maybe they know it is lacked on texture, it was top with few crispy granola. but it was still too muddy. Almost like a warm banana smoothie... :( The whole experience was average. Their service was really great. I will go another time when they have the Wild Game menu on again.",3.0
"Took my mom here for her birthday once.  I remember the food being really really good, but also pretty expensive.  Food worth the price though, basically the standard I judge things by in NYC.  You'll get what you pay for here.  From what I recall they didn't take reservations, was about a 30 minute wait maybe.",5.0

"After reading reviews this sounded like the perfect neighborhood spot to take parents visiting from out of town. The restaurant itself has a great small wine bar feel to it, nice lighting, good amount of space (no sharing conversation with the next table), good attentive service and solid menu. We started with the charcuterie- great array of a pate, and some other cured meats that were all yummy. A few of us did the $25 three courses- great deal! Between the table we had a few different salads the favorite was the brussels sprouts salad YUM. My husband had bufalo short rib ravioli to start- quite the starter with a rich sauce, amazing but a little rich for an app. I had the salmon with mustard and  lentils- always a fab combination, it was cooked perfectly, well seasoned, perfect temp, I was very happy. Other dishes at the table included a veal entree, chicken with shallots and tuna, everyone was impressed by how well everything came out. We were also not short on wine, that's for sure :) By the time dessert came I could barely breathe but do remember something chocolatey and delicious.

"At  one o'clock in the morning our circle of friends received an urgent email. Somewhere in Brooklyn Heights, there was a restaurant that serves BBQ rattlesnake salad!!Once Shaun sounded the alarm I made reservations at Henry's End which has a Wild Game Festival menu on from now through February.The restaurant itself, on the cusp of the Heights and Dumbo is an inviting, quaint place filled to the brim even on a Sunday. The intoxicating smells from the kitchen, the hum of happy conversations, and the old brick walls add to the ambiance.As for the food, well, the rattlesnake was not on the menu (the site did warn that the menu changes due to availability) but we still found a lot to write home about.We shared two game charcuteri plates, with game terrine and a rabbit and venison sausage. I had the turtle soup, an unexpected tomato based concoction with a soupy chili texture that pleased as well as it surprised me. Others opted for the best Caesar salad anyone at the table had ever had.I followed my soup with the rabbit sausage pasta, a very spicy dish which is possibly one of the tastiest pasta dishes I have had at a restaurant in ages. Friends partook in the venison stew, a mole-ish rich and dark dish of epic flavors. Jim was the most daring when he ordered the kangaroo steak and was well rewarded for it. The meat tasted a bit like pork, but fuller, more tender, and sweeter.Even though we were quite full we all managed a few bites of a 21 layer crepe cake (a former brix pick and one I can never resist). Make your reservations now while the wild game festival is still going on, but the regular menu is, I am sure, just as satisfying.brixpicks.com",5.0
"We moved to Brooklyn Heights a few months ago and had walked past Henry's End many times without even noticing it - the edifice is quite unassuming, as are the surrounding businesses.  A foodie friend, hearing that we had moved to the neighborhood, excitedly asked us if we had tried HE, after which we decided to drop by for dinner. The interior design suggests that ambiance was not at the top of the management's mind, but there is something authentic and charming about this - especially as compared with plenty of other locations in the area that have a cultivatedly insouciant air that is mostly a front.  The lurid, unironic 80s neon sign on the wall is enough to tell you you ain't in a gastropub, you're in a Good Restaurant that Serves Good Food.  I ordered a glass of Chenin Blanc and the Chicken with Bleu Cheese Sauce, Walnuts, and Pears.  My husband ordered salmon, about which I could say more, but my memory is completely clouded with the deliciousness of my own meal.  After sampling a bit my husband declared my dish ""Chicken Pancakes,"" which is pretty accurate: the pears seemed baked or sauteed in a buttery sauce that evoked the spiced richness of pecan pie and Belgian waffles, and the chicken was moist and encrusted in a subtly sweet breading.  The bleu cheese flavor was imperceptible - I was expecting the moldy bite you typically get with this ingredient, but I think it rather contributed to the depth of the dish.  We also ordered the asparagus with goat cheese fondue (really just a mild and rather chalky goat cheese sauce drizzled on top).  The asparagus was perfectly al dente, and while the sauce didn't contribute much, I don't think it really needed to.  The dishes came with rice and haricots verts, which I largely ignored and enjoyed my entree.  Even the breadbasket was fresh and flavorful. We had already made other plans for dessert, but I watched a few items headed for other tables and found myself envious.Prices are mostly under $20 for an entree.  Be prepared for tough deliberations about your order, though - it's an extensive menu with many options to tempt the adventurous diner.Make a reservation in advance; it's a cramped but congenial space, and the service is no-nonsense and efficient.",5.0
"Thinking of Henry's End makes me misty.  Was taken to dinner there by an uncle of a dear friend.  Uncle Andy was originally from Chicago, but became a true New Yorker.  Having lived in Brooklyn for over 30 years, Henry's End was his favorite restaurant.  We had a lovely bottle of chardonnay, make that two bottles!  For our meal we had a delicious salmon filet, prepared w/ middle eastern spices.  I've tried to duplicate it at home; I've come close and it always reminds me of strolling through Brooklyn Heights.  What a wonderful neighborhood treasure.",4.0
"we all had the prix fixe menu it sounds good for 30.00 3 courses but entrees do not come with anything you must purchase sides if you want, the chicken was very good with apples and blue cheese , the salmon with herb crust was also nice , but my duck with the honey glaze the skin was not crispy the meat was well done and swimming in sauce , the truffles fries were very nice, i will give them another try maybe get something off the regular menu and see if it comes with any accompaniments",3.0
I visited Henry's last evening and found the atmosphere warm and friendly. The wait staff was attentive and the manager Erik was very accommodating. He spent time with us and his recommendations were excellent. I had a duck Ruben which was warm and moist. The duck was delicious and the they used an excellent quality Swiss cheese. My date had pork chop which was perfectly cooked and served over fresh steamed spinach. I recommend Henry's and plan on going back for their jazz at Saturday brunch,4.0
"The ideal restaurant.  A diverse yet classic menu that features expertly executed dishes at reasonable prices.  The atmosphere and staff are friendly, unpretentious and perfect enablers for a long, boozy evening with friends or a casual date out.  The Ozark Bar-B-Q Ribs, which I tend to order as an appetizer although they're also available in an entree portion, are perfect, not too fatty and slathered with a sweet/spicy sauce that warrants mopping up with whatever is left in the bread basket.  For those who like their food spicy, the West Indian Bar-B-Q Shrimp never disappoint.  Entree-wise, the Veal Morel and Sole Citron are favorites.  But, for staunch and adventurous carnivores like myself, Henry's End is at its best with its October-March Wild Game Festival, a constantly changing selection of masterfully prepared Venison, Wild Boar, Reindeer and Elk.    This is a restaurant that takes its specials seriously and offers lots of them.  I've been going to Henry's End, at the advice of a friend who lives in Brooklyn Heights, for over six years and have never been bored or anything less than delighted.",5.0
"Please don't read this review, there's plenty of other ones that are a lot more objective.  I'm not kidding.  Please don't ask me to say anything imperical about this place.  Since moving away from Brooklyn I've been dreaming about the Chicken Lemonese and the Three Mustard Salmon--two dishes that are as good as anything I've eaten and that I can't get anywhere else on the planet (as far as I know).  Two dishes I could have every night and not get tired of.  But the menu is much bigger and full of other delights.I've driven two hours to wait another hour to have my fix.  The owner smiles when he sees me.  He knows me, he knows he has me in my clutches.  I can't do anything about it, and I'm not sure I want to.I don't know if there's a heaven, but if its like this place--good conversation, friendly people, one fascinating delight after another (the wine list is one of the many things that have won awards); a perfect date place just steps from Fulton Ferry Landing or the Promenade, a great place to bring a group of people and share each other's food--then this is my kind of cosmos.If there is an imperfection, it is that sometimes they experiment.  And the experiments are--at their worst--fascinating.I needed to write a review so I could add this to my list of favorite places (a list of one).  I feel I've failed as a YELPer because I can't write the epic love poem that this place deserves. Forgive me.",5.0
"This is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.  The food is always amazing.  They don't rush you at all, they let you savor every course.  The desserts are to die for.  The only problem is how close all the tables are to each other---but that's New York!",5.0
"My wife and I have been going to Henry's End for almost 20 years. We celebrated buying our first condo with dinner there, commiserated with the staff over a conceled vacation there, have enjoyed exotic entrees with one of the best all American wine lists on either coast. It is a rare gem of a restaurant that is a truly local hangout with great food. We now live in the SF Bay area and whenever we are back in NYC (at least once a year) we always go there. Like I said upfront, we have been going there for almost two decades, and even though we have not lived in the area for over 15 years, we are always greeted as family and it is as we've never left. A real treasure. By the way, James Patterson mentioned Henry's End in one of his novels.",5.0

"Thinking of Henry's End makes me misty.  Was taken to dinner there by an uncle of a dear friend.  Uncle Andy was originally from Chicago, but became a true New Yorker.  Having lived in Brooklyn for over 30 years, Henry's End was his favorite restaurant.  We had a lovely bottle of chardonnay, make that two bottles!  For our meal we had a delicious salmon filet, prepared w/ middle eastern spices.  I've tried to duplicate it at home; I've come close and it always reminds me of strolling through Brooklyn Heights.  What a wonderful neighborhood treasure.",4.0
"we all had the prix fixe menu it sounds good for 30.00 3 courses but entrees do not come with anything you must purchase sides if you want, the chicken was very good with apples and blue cheese , the salmon with herb crust was also nice , but my duck with the honey glaze the skin was not crispy the meat was well done and swimming in sauce , the truffles fries were very nice, i will give them another try maybe get something off the regular menu and see if it comes with any accompaniments",3.0
I visited Henry's last evening and found the atmosphere warm and friendly. The wait staff was attentive and the manager Erik was very accommodating. He spent time with us and his recommendations were excellent. I had a duck Ruben which was warm and moist. The duck was delicious and the they used an excellent quality Swiss cheese. My date had pork chop which was perfectly cooked and served over fresh steamed spinach. I recommend Henry's and plan on going back for their jazz at Saturday brunch,4.0
"The ideal restaurant.  A diverse yet classic menu that features expertly executed dishes at reasonable prices.  The atmosphere and staff are friendly, unpretentious and perfect enablers for a long, boozy evening with friends or a casual date out.  The Ozark Bar-B-Q Ribs, which I tend to order as an appetizer although they're also available in an entree portion, are perfect, not too fatty and slathered with a sweet/spicy sauce that warrants mopping up with whatever is left in the bread basket.  For those who like their food spicy, the West Indian Bar-B-Q Shrimp never disappoint.  Entree-wise, the Veal Morel and Sole Citron are favorites.  But, for staunch and adventurous carnivores like myself, Henry's End is at its best with its October-March Wild Game Festival, a constantly changing selection of masterfully prepared Venison, Wild Boar, Reindeer and Elk.    This is a restaurant that takes its specials seriously and offers lots of them.  I've been going to Henry's End, at the advice of a friend who lives in Brooklyn Heights, for over six years and have never been bored or anything less than delighted.",5.0
"Please don't read this review, there's plenty of other ones that are a lot more objective.  I'm not kidding.  Please don't ask me to say anything imperical about this place.  Since moving away from Brooklyn I've been dreaming about the Chicken Lemonese and the Three Mustard Salmon--two dishes that are as good as anything I've eaten and that I can't get anywhere else on the planet (as far as I know).  Two dishes I could have every night and not get tired of.  But the menu is much bigger and full of other delights.I've driven two hours to wait another hour to have my fix.  The owner smiles when he sees me.  He knows me, he knows he has me in my clutches.  I can't do anything about it, and I'm not sure I want to.I don't know if there's a heaven, but if its like this place--good conversation, friendly people, one fascinating delight after another (the wine list is one of the many things that have won awards); a perfect date place just steps from Fulton Ferry Landing or the Promenade, a great place to bring a group of people and share each other's food--then this is my kind of cosmos.If there is an imperfection, it is that sometimes they experiment.  And the experiments are--at their worst--fascinating.I needed to write a review so I could add this to my list of favorite places (a list of one).  I feel I've failed as a YELPer because I can't write the epic love poem that this place deserves. Forgive me.",5.0
"This is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.  The food is always amazing.  They don't rush you at all, they let you savor every course.  The desserts are to die for.  The only problem is how close all the tables are to each other---but that's New York!",5.0
"My wife and I have been going to Henry's End for almost 20 years. We celebrated buying our first condo with dinner there, commiserated with the staff over a conceled vacation there, have enjoyed exotic entrees with one of the best all American wine lists on either coast. It is a rare gem of a restaurant that is a truly local hangout with great food. We now live in the SF Bay area and whenever we are back in NYC (at least once a year) we always go there. Like I said upfront, we have been going there for almost two decades, and even though we have not lived in the area for over 15 years, we are always greeted as family and it is as we've never left. A real treasure. By the way, James Patterson mentioned Henry's End in one of his novels.",5.0

"My husband and I came here last night for my birthday and the food was absolutely delish! The first time we ate here, I wasn't too crazy about the dish I had ordered. I believe I had gotten some kind of duck but it was very fatty and gamey. My husband had gotten the 3 mustard salmon and he said it was amazing. Last night we came back so that we could try out their wild game festival. My husband ordered the Elk, I ordered one of their specials, Canadian Salmon with lobster risotto with a champagne vanilla sauce. Both dishes were outstanding! His elk was soo good. Not gamey, not an ounce of fat on it and cooked to perfection. The sauce which was made with wine and the natural drippings from the elk itself, was so delish. My husband soaked it up  with his bread once he was done with his chops. My salmon was perfectly cooked and the skin was so crunchy. The lobster risotto was also cooked perfectly with big chunks of lobster in it. The champagne vanilla sauce, although a little on the salty side which made me drink about 3-4 glasses of water, was outstanding. When I eat out, I hardly ever finish my meal. Last night, my plate was empty. The only downside was they didn't bring us any sides but truthfully with the amount of food that was on my plate and the size of his elk chops, we didn't really care. We are definitely going back in October once their game festival starts up again!",5.0

"We were there on a Saturday night, and strolled in around 8:30, prepared to wait for a considerable wait, but our under fifteen minute wait was the right note.  The minimal waiting time was enhanced by the helpful and genuine attentiveness from the staffer who updated us with wait times upon finding out that the table we were waiting for had not ordered dessert.  All that said, the food was so good, that even an hour long wait would probably have been worth it.We started off with the wild mushroom salad from the regular menu and a special app of the shaved brussel sprouts, bacon, pecorino & pomegranate salad.  Each selection was perfectly on point.  The wild mushroom salad was warm and rich and garlicky (though BF thought perhaps a little too much oil with that garlic).  The brussel sprout salad was well prepared, to appear like a frisee, and had delicate, well-complimenting flavors - from the smokey bacon pieces to the sweet fresh crunch of the pomegranate seeds. For mains, we both decided to sample the wild game menu, which has been extended to continue until Memorial Day.  BF tried the wild game sampler platter, which included rabbit sausage, elk chops with a mustard seed breadcrumb crust and wild boar belly with pomegranate pistachio chutney.  The lowest point for him was the rabbit sausage, which he expected, saying he did not order for the sausage, and felt it simply tasted like any other good sausage.  The pork belly was reported as pig 2.0, with a perfect combination of fat and sweetness in the meat, enhanced by the flavors in the sauce.  The elk chops were the star of his plate, and is being coined as one of his new favorite meals.  The meat was tender and perfectly cooked and didn't fall into any trap of being typically too gamey.  I went with the penne with venison sausage, butternut squash and hazelnut.  Perhaps it was a safe choice in the realm of wild game, but it was still delicious enough to not care.  The sausage was spicy and sweet simultaneously and the sweetness of the squash highlighted that hint of sweetness in the meat, while the hazelnut added a bonus crunch and richness to the dish.  The service was pleasant, attentive and yet unobtrusive throughout our meal.  The atmosphere is warm, cozy, and food-focused without being stuffy in the least.  To be sure, this won't be the end for us at Henry's...",5.0

"I've been going to Henry's End since its early days and have never been disappointed. The warm and welcoming people there offer up delicious food and a wide range of wines and beers. On our most recent visit, this past Thursday, my husband and I went to celebrate his birthday. Our appetizers were delicious--he had the country pate (from the Game Festival offerings) and said it was the best pate he had ever had; I had the wild mushroom salad and it was perfect. Our entrees were also wonderful. I, tempted by the lobster risotto that accompanied the salmon, ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the Alaskan Cod. The cod was a bit spicy for his taste (he doesn't go for any spice at all), which made me very happy, since I really liked it and was hoping to share it with him. We traded our entrees and I got to eat the cod and a good portion of the lobster risotto (and there was a nice amount of lobster in it!) and he got to eat the delicious salmon. And then there was the matter of desert. We got the Chocolate Confusion--a combination of brownie, chocolate praline bread pudding, hot fudge and vanilla ice cream--together with a decaf espresso and a decaf coffee. We thought it couldn't get any better than that. And then a friend sent over the Persian Lime Pie, which really made it a birthday celebration to remember.          And as the days grow longer, we start hankering for the best-ever soft-shell crabs that Henry's End has . . . and the fiddlehead ferns . . . and the morel mushrooms. With our first bite it will be confirmed--spring has arrived again. In the meantime, we'll comfort ourselves with the warming and wonderful offerings of their winter menu.",5.0

"I would not go back to this restaurant.  We ordered the BBQ shrimp appetizer which included only three shrimp for $12.  The BBQ sauce was good, but nothing special.  My husband ordered the duck with mushrooms and lingonberry. Not too good. Duck is usually quite tender but this must not have been a good piece or something because it was chewy.  I had the fried chicken and it was good.  Our dishes came with rice pilaf. I wouldn't go back because the menu items are boring - the duck is prepared the same way with a choice of three different sauces, the same could be said for the veal, and the random rice pilaf that came with both of our dishes didn't go with the meal at all and obviously did not require any thought from the chef.  While it is a cozy restaurant the custom neon sign has probably been there since the restaurant opened and probably nothing has changed since then including the menu.  I'm glad I can check this place off my list, but I will not return.",2.0
"Absolutely one of my favorite carnivorous haunts in the city. Henry's End is a cozy, intimate, typical Brooklyn Heights neighborhood place; it almost feels like a hunting lodge with its wooden interior. They make fresh stocks daily, and you will taste that in their very rich sauces that they serve over their meat dishes - the last time I was there, I had a hangar steak au poivre dressed with a mustard cream sauce. Another recent highlight was a bourbon glazed rib eye topped with a corn salsa. These subtle riffs on classic main meat dishes are what really sets this place apart. You may also find wilder meats on their menu, like elk chops and venison, but that varies seasonally. They tend to have many seasonal specials on their menu, and those can change week to week too, but they are all good! They also have excellent pasta dishes - everything is rich and hearty and great here. The service has all the charm a Brooklyn neighborhood spot should and then some - they have a loyal clinetele from all over the city that visits them regularly, and you will see the patrons hugging and kissing the waitstaff on entry. This and Noodle Pudding and Brooklyn Heights' contribution to the best kept dining secrets in NYC. If you are into good meat dishes, you will be thrilled you came. Not to mention they have Sam Smith's beer.",5.0
"I've been eating at Henry's end for a little over 10 years, and the quality has steadily gone down over that time. Their winter game festival is still kind of OK, but overall, the level of cooking is now mediocre at best. For some reason they've taken to grossly over saucing everything - perhaps to mask the declining quality of the raw ingredients. A recent filet mignon had quite a bit of sinew in it, and rare tuna was slightly funky - not outright spoiled, but not that fresh. You might be tempted by their Prix Fixe menu - don't be. In a display of complete lack of graciousness, they remove the vegetables from their prix fixe offerings, then offer to return them for an exorbitant price. Aside from the stinginess (potatoes cost pennies!), it makes for a very poor plating, and casts an unpleasant pall over the meal. Really guys, if you can't afford to throw a vegetable on the plate, don;t offer the menu! Their desserts are huge, but at the level of a decent diner. This used to be a place to go for a treat, but it is sadly no longer worth the price, even if someone else is paying.",2.0
"Ok, talk about a very interesting menu for the adventurous spirit. This restaurant lists seasonal game on their menu. From duck, to venison. Came here one night looking for something different than the usual. The menu itself is very interesting, even if you decide not to go for the seasonal game options. The space is small and a bit cramped, but cozy none the less. The waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive to our questions about the menu. The STEAK AU POIVRE was a very good option to select. It was cooked very nicely and the sauce was not overpowering but complemented the dish.  Appetizers also were on point. I cant describe it all as it has been some time since i visited Henry's End, but it was very good experience which I'd like to venture again sometime. This is a little jewel in Brooklyn heights and the locals seem to be very fond of it, but the looks of the crowd and the wait to be seated on a Tuesday night. Be adventurous... Henry's End will not disappoint.",4.0
"Some days good ,some days bad.  It depends on the chef of the evening.  Joey who is on during the week is the best.  Sometimes ,sigh ,the food is cold and obviously oldish.  Send it back at that time.  The vegetables are horrible always and the rice is dreadful.. That said this could be a great restaurant but often isn't so complain...  You will get results.",4.0
"this is the restaurant i love best.  they have a great menu, you can find just about ANyThing on their menu--everyone in your party will be satisfied.  I LOVE the servers--you don't often say that in nyc but these folks are wonderful!!  and!!! you get birthday treats, if you register for their birthday club (or whatever they call it) within two weeks of your birthday (within 7days before or within 7 days after) your entree is on them!!  love love love henry's end!!",5.0
"I've been going to Henry's End since its early days and have never been disappointed. The warm and welcoming people there offer up delicious food and a wide range of wines and beers. On our most recent visit, this past Thursday, my husband and I went to celebrate his birthday. Our appetizers were delicious--he had the country pate (from the Game Festival offerings) and said it was the best pate he had ever had; I had the wild mushroom salad and it was perfect. Our entrees were also wonderful. I, tempted by the lobster risotto that accompanied the salmon, ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the Alaskan Cod. The cod was a bit spicy for his taste (he doesn't go for any spice at all), which made me very happy, since I really liked it and was hoping to share it with him. We traded our entrees and I got to eat the cod and a good portion of the lobster risotto (and there was a nice amount of lobster in it!) and he got to eat the delicious salmon. And then there was the matter of desert. We got the Chocolate Confusion--a combination of brownie, chocolate praline bread pudding, hot fudge and vanilla ice cream--together with a decaf espresso and a decaf coffee. We thought it couldn't get any better than that. And then a friend sent over the Persian Lime Pie, which really made it a birthday celebration to remember.          And as the days grow longer, we start hankering for the best-ever soft-shell crabs that Henry's End has . . . and the fiddlehead ferns . . . and the morel mushrooms. With our first bite it will be confirmed--spring has arrived again. In the meantime, we'll comfort ourselves with the warming and wonderful offerings of their winter menu.",5.0
incredible dinner--they have a wild-game feast from October thru March. Their snapper-turtle soup with Sherry? DIVINE,5.0
"I've been going to Henry's End for close to 20 years. The steak diane is one of my favorite meals in the world. Henry's End also has great specials, great appetizers and a great wine list. The place is small but not cramped. The wait staff used to be top notch. They had all been there for years and were friendly and extremely knowledgeable. I had a waiter that I had never seen before. He was rude and seemed to want to be anyplace but at the restaurant. The food is too good to let a tard like my waiter ruin the experience. I just hope he is gone next time I come.",4.0
"I would not go back to this restaurant.  We ordered the BBQ shrimp appetizer which included only three shrimp for $12.  The BBQ sauce was good, but nothing special.  My husband ordered the duck with mushrooms and lingonberry. Not too good. Duck is usually quite tender but this must not have been a good piece or something because it was chewy.  I had the fried chicken and it was good.  Our dishes came with rice pilaf. I wouldn't go back because the menu items are boring - the duck is prepared the same way with a choice of three different sauces, the same could be said for the veal, and the random rice pilaf that came with both of our dishes didn't go with the meal at all and obviously did not require any thought from the chef.  While it is a cozy restaurant the custom neon sign has probably been there since the restaurant opened and probably nothing has changed since then including the menu.  I'm glad I can check this place off my list, but I will not return.",2.0
"Absolutely one of my favorite carnivorous haunts in the city. Henry's End is a cozy, intimate, typical Brooklyn Heights neighborhood place; it almost feels like a hunting lodge with its wooden interior. They make fresh stocks daily, and you will taste that in their very rich sauces that they serve over their meat dishes - the last time I was there, I had a hangar steak au poivre dressed with a mustard cream sauce. Another recent highlight was a bourbon glazed rib eye topped with a corn salsa. These subtle riffs on classic main meat dishes are what really sets this place apart. You may also find wilder meats on their menu, like elk chops and venison, but that varies seasonally. They tend to have many seasonal specials on their menu, and those can change week to week too, but they are all good!
