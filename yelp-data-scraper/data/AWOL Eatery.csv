"I am slightly obsessed, so please ignore the drool. Of the beaten hipster path and casually unassuming, this small eatery is a hidden gem. The staff are friendly and provide the right balance of attention and privacy. The vibe is earthy and natural. There are many gluten-free, vegetation, and vegan options, along with meat, leaving everyone satisfied. Food: tip- pace yourself and choose wisely.  The plates are perfect for sharing. The grilled corn is a grownup version of America's favorite ""vegetable,"" topped with herbs and crema. The roasted Brussels sprouts are special and hit every note from the sweet caramelized shallots, crunchy toasted hazelnuts, and crispy fried sage leaves. The Mac and cheese could have used more meat, but if you like smokey cheese, you'll love this. Save room for dessert- the banana churro is spectacular. It has a crunchy ""churro-style"" shell, sweet Nutella and caramel, and salty hazelnuts. I will definitely be back. Thank you for a lovely birthday dinner!",5.0
"Sending out the 5 star flag for this awesome neighborhood spot. The grub holds up to the high standards that AWOL has set both in-person and as delivery. In fact, delivery might be even BETTER than in person... The meals arrive in eco-friendly packaging, quickly and in large portions.So, what are you getting into here? How about a wide-variety of seasonal deliciousness!Each day there are 3-4 special items in addition to a well-curated list of ""New American"" classics: Sliders, Mac & Cheese (w/ short rib!), individual pizzas, veggie plates. Then, you have some odd, but delicious items (kimchi fried rice, tempura beef taco). Having sampled over half of the menu, I think it is safe to say... ITS ALL GOOD!The Garden Crema Tacos were a strong standout, as Lots of vegetarian options. Small interior, but quick seating and friendly service. This is my kind of place. Do it!P.S. Nice, funky restroom decor.",5.0
"came here on a saturday night with my sister and bff.  the place doesn't take reservations and word on the street is it gets crowded...so we got there early.  this might not have been necessary since in addition to our table there were probably only 4 other parties there.  i also noticed the staff to patrons ratio was about 4 to 1.  strange.  high wasited pants is part of their uniform apparently.    the food was killer.  i got the shrimp special and tried the kimchi fried rice, which was definitely memorable.  yum.i will return.",4.0
"I was looking for a place in Brooklyn with a good menu for vegetarians and non-vegetarians.  Where else should I search other than the Williamsburg/Greenpoint area?  AWOL came up on Yelp and I decided to pay them a visit on Friday night around 8-8:30.  I don't usually eat dinner this late, but the place was packed with parties of all sizes (not that I really recommend having a party larger than four here because with five people, one person will be stuck with an awkward chair at a booth.  They also have a whole section on the right side where you can merge tables together, but a lot of people want to eat here so finding that much space for a large party is not the best idea!).We didn't have to wait too long maybe 5 minutes for a two-person table to clear up.  One issue is that if it's super cold out, you might have to stand awkwardly next to someone's table as there isn't much room to wait inside.But let me tell you - the food is delicious.  The grilled caprese salad was pretty good, two slices of grilled tomato and mozzarella cheese over a arugula drenched in balsamic. But the real star of the show was the pizza.  For all of y'all who love meaty pizza, ditch it this one time and try their truffle and mushroom pizza.  The truffle oil is delicious with the thick cheese and the crust is actually pretty well seasoned.  They also have a ""sliders"" section but it's not three sliders, it's one slider packed with meat.  The dishes (other than the pizza) are relatively small.  I really wish I could give this place five stars because it really deserves it - the beautiful, ""perfect-for-a-date"" atmosphere, its accommodating menu for all diets (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, and meat lovers if there is such a name for a diet), and its delicious pizza.  However, our food did take quite a while to come, which is why I deducted one star.  Service was super nice though, just took a while.",4.0
"Legitimately farm to table AWESOME.My boyfriend and I were looking for a healthy but nice dinner spot and decided on AWOL. We kept it veggie heavy and tried:-Spring Salad-Roasted Brussels Sprouts-Corn off the Cob-Crispy Squash Blossoms (insane!)..and my personal favorite/new restaurant dish obsession - The Vegan ""Meatball"" served over vegetables and tomato sauce. Easily my new favorite meal.Everything including the service was really great. We didn't get dessert but I noticed they had a banana churro on the menu, which is a must try next time!",5.0
"Yum, yum, yum! Everything we tried was fabulous: mushroom hash, street corn off the cob with Chipotle sauce, sea bass slider with calamari. We have been wanting to try this gem for so long and finally made it. Not sure why we waited this long, geez... So many items on their menu that sounds mouth-watering!",5.0
"For my first visit, I had the House Burger, with so many choices, is kind of hard to pick, well, I am glad I did !  OMG !  I hit the jackpot, I found one more place with a fantastic tasty Burger !  what makes it fantastickly tasteee?!  the MEAT flavor !  the meat was seasoned just right, that is the most important part for me, since I don't like to eat too much meat, but finding a good seasoned meat that is a challenge. Whatever it is they use to season the meat burger is just right and delicious, it didn't have any meat taste, but all the taste of great seasoning, the burger was cooked just right. There is a part of the menu that changes everyday, so in order to taste all those different dishes, frequent visits are needed. I have to come back because their wide variety of desserts are very promising, I will be updating this review as I taste along. I am exited about bringing my sons here, that is next.Dessert choices:* White Chocolate Flan Cheesecake* Tres Leches Tiramusu Rice Pudding* Banana Roll* Fruit Cobbler",5.0
"This place is really awesome on so many levels, from the super attentive waitstaff to the eager manager/owner to the obviously delicious food. As a restaurant, I think the food style straddles the line between new-American/modern cuisine and tapas style, as a lot of the dishes are smaller and catered to be shared. I disagree with some of the comments about the restaurant being overpriced. The food is excellent and the service make up for what some may perceive to be ""expensive.""Being a relatively slow night on the Sunday we visited, my GF and I had the opportunity to speak for some time with the manager/owner, Esther. Super bubbly and friendly, she spoke at lengths about their partnerships with local merchants and how the restaurant is chef-run (which I'm guessing means lots of changes in menus and specials, which is great for customers and cooks alike). Even if the food wasn't good, I'd go back just to see her again!But the food here is great! So of course I want to come back to gorge again. We ordered 4 small dishes (though most were NOT small) to share between the two of us and were very full by the end. We started with the Beef Tempura Tacos which my GF, a food blogger with HungryNYC, claimed it to be one of her top 3 tacos in NYC. It had fresh ingredients including the greens and tomatoes over a bed of crispy beef pieces and drizzled with a sweet Asian-style sauce. I absolutely loved it as well and thought it was the best dish of the night.Then we had our Lamb Chops and Skirt Steak. The lamb chops were good, served over a sea of tzatziki sauce (dunno how to spell that) and beside a large salad. The chops were good but felt a tad small compared to the salad beside it. The meat was very tender and not gamey at all. The Skirt Steak was great too, but instead of serving it directly on top of the sweet potato mash, I think it would have been better on the side so that it didn't feel like a potato topping. The Steak should have been the star, but it didn't feel that way. But both elements of that dish were, regardless, very good.The last dish, the Short Rib Mac & Cheese, was surprisingly light yet flavorful. I wish there were more meat pieces in the bowl, but the kale that it came with was surprisingly delicious and complimentary to the cheese. The cheese was very light, not something that I'm used to in restaurant macs, but man, it was so good! I'm a little torn on the fried (onion?) strings on the top because it adds texture and aesthetic beauty to the dish, but they were a tad bit stiff and tough. I think despite those small flaws, it was my favorite dish of the evening. STRONGLY recommend trying it out! We ended the night with the White Chocolate Cheesecake. It was very sweet and came with a dulce de leche cream (I think, I can't remember if that's actually what it was). I liked it a lot because it wasn't overly cheesecakey and had a strong white chocolate flavor. My GF thought it was too sweet, but then again she doesn't like sweet stuff in general. I wavered between a 4 and 5 star. The food was great but some of the execution felt a bit off, but the warm, enthusiastic staff more than makes up for any of its shortcomings. A restaurant is really about its vision and will to present their own dedication to the craft, and AWOL Eatery does a stellar job of that on all fronts. I hope to be back and try out some of their other dishes!",5.0
"Woke up super early on my vacation just to write this review before going to explore more of nyc. Had this place book marked since my visit last fall but we didn't have the time. My sister's baby was sleeping so we didn't want to go out, luckily AWOL does take out and delivery but my best friend and I really wanted a glass of wine :)The design is simple but gorgeous. It sets a nice casual but intimate theme. The chalk boards and candles were a beautiful touch. We told them we would be doing take out for food but wine to stay:) we sat down and looked at their menu which had new daily specials then what we saw online.Making our choices were so hard lol we ""settled"" for 1. Short rib mac n cheese (creamy, cheesy and not too heavy but packed with flavor)2. Risotto ( Leeks and Japanese mushrooms which gave it a slight sour taste! Delicious)3. Burger (they asked how I liked it :) good sign when they aren't looking to over cook the burger :) )4. Sea Bass Calamari Slider ( huge, amazingly crispy and lightly battered calamari and great tar tar sauce)5. Last but not least Polenta fries!!! My heart jumped a bit at first sight of polenta fries on the menu. They shaved some delicious parmesan  on top and it honestly tasted like fried mac n cheese. I'm still dreaming about it now.The wine service was so great that I decided to tip them for the take out too! My friend ordered the dry reisling and during tasting found it too sweet and they automatically offered and different one, she got the Sav blanc instead. I got their Argentinian Malbec which was great and definitely a nice amount in my glass. The service, menu, atmosphere, drinks and food were all deserving of 5***** :) maybe I can get late night snacks delivered by them tonight haha",5.0
"I went on Friday with my non-vegan girlfriend and my vegan self. She had the steak, and I ordered their vegan options. I had the vegan meatball, brussels sprouts made vegan, and sweet potatoes in coconut milk. All items were quite good. As a vegan, my only complaint is that their only vegan dishes (which you must order many of as its a small plates kind of restaurant) don't go well together at all. Spicy pasta with sweet potato in curry sauce didn't make sense. I also didn't particularly care for the sauce. It was a bit too spicy for my tastes. Anyway, don't get me wrong, the food was pretty good, and it's a good spot to come to in the neighborhood if you're looking for someplace to eat with someone who has a restrictive diet of some sort (vegan, gluten free, etc.).",3.0
"This is hands down my new favorite neighborhood spots. My husband and I have probably been here ten times in the last few months. The service is amazing, the food is delicious!

I'm allergic to gluten and dairy, and the kitchen has always accommodated. By far the best quality food in the area. My husband's favorite is the sea bass slider with calamari and short rib Mac and cheese. Mine has to be the kimchi fried rice and the vegan meatball (with gluten free pasta).",5.0
"Quick review from a visit in 2015 -Decor - pretty basic with no real vibe other than maybe slightly better than your average diner feel.Food - The food is about the only thing kind of saving this place, but only enough that I give 2 stars instead of only 1.

Definitely had buyer's remorse as I had to go eat again after leaving here.Service / Management - Had a really bad feel of pretentiousness associated with an attitude of being ""holier than though"". Kind of get this at a lot of Williamsburg spots, but it was very evident here. Really weird for a very average restaurant. Service was not good, but just adequate enough that you do not have to serve yourself. Being that I am not a bad tipper even when it does suck, I still tipped 20% as I believe most of the time it is bad management that causes this kind of behavior. I would try it again sometime in 2016 as maybe they are going through some growing pains or hopefully there will be change management. The way it is run now leaves much to be desired.",2.0
This place was fantastic! Came here with my mom for brunch. She had the braised beef short rib Mac n cheese which was good (her portion was a kind of small though).

"Oh man. I just moved to the area and am so stoked to have discovered this place.I ordered delivery with some friends a few weeks ago - everything arrived surprisingly quickly and was FANTASTIC.

"Got take out. It was a 50/50 split between dishes that were way overpriced and poorly executed and dishes that were phenomenal. The tempura beef taco was exciting and flavorful. The kimchi rice was also good (though they didn't give us quail eggs per the menu, just chicken eggs, grrrr). The spicy stewed sweet potatoes were bland and the creamed kale tasted burnt, with a terrible stringy tough texture, and was far from creamy. Seems like the food can be hit or miss here.

"Another Farm to Fork eatery. It's the uber iteration of the original promise of locally sourced, small farm, organic foods brought from the ground to your table. It doesn't really matter if you are growing the damn veggies or raising that damn cow in a bio dome, what most ""F to F"" eateries fail at is simply making the food taste good. They correlate the quality of the ingredients to a perceived need for uber-health, eschewing common sense in preparing their dishes. Pacific Fine Foods is a great example of this type of thinking : great ingredients put together in weird ways that just don't taste very good, but damn sure are healthy. AWOL is not one of those places. I had the skirt steak here and the meat was quality, that's to be expected when you pay $25+ for a dish. But the execution was terrific... I had asked for a medium piece of skirt steak and it was cooked perfectly. If you've ever tried to cook a piece of skirt steak yourself, you'll know how hard it is but these guys got it right. The dishes here are also all triangular in shape. It's... so outside the box that I can say I've never seen it before. AWOL is easily the best restaurant in East Williamsburg. It combines execution, innovation, fine ingredients and most importantly good taste into one package. Be warned : it's hipster as crap and this place is NOT ideal for big groups or kids.",5.0

I'm talking about fresh, do-your-tastebuds-a-flavor (mouth-watering) gooood!!!  Menu has variety to fulfill everyone's palate too. Nice set of options to choose from.  Service was friendly and professional. Check them out, I highly recommend it!Officially a neighborhood fave!!AWOL Eatery? Yes please!!!!",5.0
Kimchi fried rice is a must!! Tres leches rice pudding is crazy good.Definitely coming back I love that they source from local farmers.,5.0
"We had an excellent evening here at AWOL.  The food is clearly well thought out and the menu changes constantly.  They were very sensitive to any food allergies and it was VERY well priced for all the food we had.  The wine was 1/2 off bottles so we indulged in a nice rose.  Everything we ordered from the shrimp glass noodles to the risotto and the pizza were amazing and literally come from ""All Walks Of Life""  The chef brought out the dessert which were apple and brie filled dumplings (a tad too brown) and a special shoutout to our waiter Jimmy who was an extraordinary waiter.  Shocked to see only a few tables full throughout the night after such an amazing meal.",5.0
The Roast Chicken plus rosé plus fruit cobbler was the perfect dinner date meal. We will definitely be back.  The chef even came out to talk to us and he's really cool.,5.0
"Okay so let me start this off by saying this place is the best kept secret in Williamsburg!Everything on the menu is full of flavor and delicious, whenever I want to eat brunch I come here. My favorite thing to eat on the menu is the corn",5.0
"In search of places that offer gluten-free fare, a friend and I discovered AWOL Eatery, where we had a late lunch/early dinner the other day. Since my friend has to follow a gluten-free diet, everything that we ordered had to be gluten-free; however, we did not feel restricted at all!We each started out our meal with glasses of wine, which later paired well with shares of the truffle aioli fries, the mac and cheese, and the Brussels sprouts. While everything was delicious, the mac and cheese was exceptional. With just enough meat for flavor, it was the perfect amount for two people who do not generally enjoy it.Also, the service was friendly, and the bathrooms were clean. Truly as good as it gets!",5.0
"Nice intimate ambiance, great service, good food and 1/2 price bottles of wine on Monday's! What more can you ask for?Short Rib Mac & Cheese and Grilled Quail were the highlights, as was the Long Island Rose (sorry I don't remember the name)!",4.0
"Another Farm to Fork eatery. It's the uber iteration of the original promise of locally sourced, small farm, organic foods brought from the ground to your table. It doesn't really matter if you are growing the damn veggies or raising that damn cow in a bio dome, what most ""F to F"" eateries fail at is simply making the food taste good. They correlate the quality of the ingredients to a perceived need for uber-health, eschewing common sense in preparing their dishes. Pacific Fine Foods is a great example of this type of thinking : great ingredients put together in weird ways that just don't taste very good, but damn sure are healthy. AWOL is not one of those places. I had the skirt steak here and the meat was quality, that's to be expected when you pay $25+ for a dish. But the execution was terrific... I had asked for a medium piece of skirt steak and it was cooked perfectly. If you've ever tried to cook a piece of skirt steak yourself, you'll know how hard it is but these guys got it right. The dishes here are also all triangular in shape. It's... so outside the box that I can say I've never seen it before. AWOL is easily the best restaurant in East Williamsburg. It combines execution, innovation, fine ingredients and most importantly good taste into one package. Be warned : it's hipster as crap and this place is NOT ideal for big groups or kids.",5.0
"This restaurant did not meet my expectation. I was really disappointed by many things.1/ a little bit pricey for what you get2/ You better not be hungry because there isn't much in your plate3/Food is average. Pizza is just ok. 4/I was there with some friends and we all got cold because they don't heat the place in winter? Really cold especially next to the window.5/The waitress was friendly but not really good at her job (sorry)6/We were 6people and we decided to pay by card and cash. They charged EVERYTHING on my card. that was not professional at all. I was really mad and when they gave me back my cc they kinda laugh (nervously) telling me that they charge the entire bill on my card. they didn't really apologize either.Anyway, it doesn't worth more than a 1/5 to me. I'm sure that other people enjoyed the place more than I did.I just had a terrible experience and I won't recommend this place to my friends.",1.0

Delicious food and very gluten free friendly.  We ordered several different dishes for the table and all were great - standout was the kimchi fried rice! The waitress told us that 4 or 5 plates would be enough for the 4 of us but we ordered quite a few more than that (I think 7) and it was the perfect amount of food. Half price bottles of wine on Monday nights!,5.0
"Really enjoyed it here. The kind of place where tables are close together but they kept the music not too loud so it's still good for having a conversation. Music could be a little dimmer but that's just my preference. Staff was very attentive and the food didn't take long. We went on a Friday night at 830 and were surprised that there were several tables open. My boyfriend and I wanted to try everything so despite their advise to only get maybe two plates each we shared the sea bass slider and 5 plates, slightly too much food. The sea bass slider was good but we sort of jumped the gun and didn't realize it would be fried. If you're in the mood for that it was very tasty and came with delicious calamari. We had two of the garden tacos and it wasn't my favorite, probably wouldn't order it again, but I'm just not into that particular flavor. It was cooked and presented fine. We also had the pork belly buns which were standard but really tasty. I love shrimp so we got the shrimp skewers and they were amazing, such a great flavor to them. The quinoa salad them came on was good too. Note there are only three jumbo shrimp on the skewer, but a big heaping of the salad. The stewed sweet potatoes were delicious if you like cumin and coconut milk, which I do. I'll definitely try to replicate that. They were a tad spicy.Also had the vegan meatball which was good, medium sized, and came in a bowl of penne in tomato sauce and veggies. Not very exciting. I would definitely recommend the shrimp skewer, stewed sweet potatoes, pork buns, and the sea bass slider was good too. Everything tastes very fresh and you feel the love put into the place.",5.0
"A tasty addition to the neighborhood with some particularly tasty things that are creative and some relatively tasty things that are pretty standard. Also I really like their weird triangular plates. Very cool.Get the short rib slider. It's a bit overpriced but is really quite extraordinary. Super tender, with some mashed potatoes for good measure. The beef tempura tacos were also interesting and quite tasty.The more mundane stuff included the brussels sprouts and mushrooms. They were in no way bad, but there was nothing super special about them.",4.0
"My roommate and I have been wanting to come here for ages, and we finally pinned down a date to hit it for dinner. We walked in, and were immediately greeted and told it would only be about five minutes. When we sat down, the hostess explained the entire menu and gave us the low down on numerous dishes. The explanations were very helpful and made our decision even more difficult because everything sounded delicious! My roommate got the steak, and it was cooked a perfect medium rare and seasoned very well. I opted for the vegan meatball and the kimchi fried rice. The Kimchi fried rice was a standout, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Next time I would like to try one of the ""sliders."" They are less like a typical slider, and more like a properly portioned burger. Also, the kitchen and wait staff was extremely diligent regarding my cheese allergy.",5.0

Lot's of options that fit most any diet: vegetarian, gluten free, etc. We had 4 small plates, which was more than enough food.

"I've been eating at AWOL at least a few times a month since they opened and have been meaning to leave a review for months now.  AWOL is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.  The food is absolutely delicious and the service is impeccable.  It is now our go to spot to take friends and family when they visit from out of town, and everyone we've brought has loved it as much as we do.I'd recommend almost everything on the menu.  My favorites include: The Margherita Pizza, Quinoa and Zucchini Sliders, Garden Crema Tacos, Grilled Corn Off the Cob, Roasted Brussel Sprouts, and all of the fries and sauce.We're vegetarians and the options are great, but our meat-eating friends have loved their meals too.Everyone who works here has been exceedingly kind to us, even bringing us a custom dish on my birthday!If you're in Williamsburg and hungry, look no further than AWOL to be fully satisfied.",5.0
"I'm sometimes kinda particular about the food I eat. It's partly because I'm tracking my food using @myfitnesspal, and really focused on trying to the the right combination of foods to maximize nutrient intake. It's also that I think that a menu should reflect the dish. You have to know that about me as you read this review. I was really excited to try this farm-to-table restaurant in Brooklyn, and the menu and the food didn't disappoint! The menu and utensils seemed to take a while to arrive, but then the server (or hostess?) went through and explained the entire menu. I asked about the chicken dish and was told it as a 6oz breast. It also said it came with carrots and sweet potatoes, two things I wanted in order to round out my day. So, I ordered that. The couple next to me ordered after me, but got their food before me. It may make sense because this place has small plates, so that's fine. And I'm guessing my dish just took such a long time because I imagine each dish to be prepared with love and care. When my dish arrived, I was disappointed to see a big bone sticking out. It looked like a drumstick and a thigh to me. It's fine; I was expecting a breast, but I'm fine with thigh and leg. But then, after a few bites of the tasty chicken and carrot, I realized that the sweet potatoes neither looked or tasted like sweet potatoes. They were mashed potatoes. :(So I brought it up to one of the servers and she brought the plate back to the chef. Then the chef came out. He asked what the problem was and I explained the above. He insisted it was a breast, but as I said before, that wasn't so much a problem for me. Then he explained that the sweet potatoes were mixed in with white potatoes. Hmph. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered it.The chef brought me the menu and asked that I ordered something else. I ordered the skirt steak with lobster, broccolini and risotto. I should have ordered that right from the beginning! The steak was cooked perfectly. I know skirt steak isn't know for being tender but this was! It was cooked to perfection, and the lobster on top was an excellent addition and really rounded out the flavors of the steak, et al. The broccolini couldn't have been cooked better. The stem was crunchy and the flowers almost melted. The texture of the risotto was exactly what I'd hoped for, chewy enough but not mushy. The chef came out and checked on me. I hope he could tell how happy I was with the dish he presented, and how grateful I am with the attentive service. A big part of me wishes I hadn't made a big deal out of it, but at the same time, if I was going to pay $25 for a dish, I should get what I'm told I'm getting. I'd recommend this place to any foodie looking for amazing dishes, prepared with love and care. Just don't be as picky as me!",4.0
"My fiance and I really enjoyed AWOL. We are both vegetarians, so it was right up our alley, but I noticed they had a bunch of meat options as well. To start we had two small plates: ratatouille tabouli & the asparagus with a quail egg sunnyside up. Though small, both were delicious! For the main, we split a quinoa slider (slightly larger than a slider, smaller than a burger) with avocado fries. To supplement, we also ordered a sweet potato dish from the small plates menu. We really loved that everything was seasonal and fresh. The atmosphere of the restaurant was casual with an upscale twist - their modern triangular plates were a nice touch.",5.0

"I had dinner at AWOL tonight with my girlfriend. Obviously there are already a lot of rave reviews, so I'll stick to essentials. 1. AWOL is superb choice for vegetarians. The ""farm plate"" selection is varied and uniformly delicious. We had the corn, brussel sprouts, sweet potatos and risotto, along with a side of truffle fries. The corn and sweet potato dishes stood out for their rambunctious flavor and unique preperations. The risotto was possibly the weak link in our meal, although it was still pretty great. It could have used a little more salt, and the texture ran a little soft for my taste. 2. This place is an absolute steal. The portions were huge, we were given a free drink (thirsty thursday) and the bill was less than 20 dollars a person. 3. Service was quick, helpful.4. Atmosphere was comfortable. So yeah, go to AWOL.",5.0
"Stuffed between a grocery store and something else no one ever pays attention to stands some pretty good eats.Stopped in for a quick bite and was impressed by the use of all fresh ingredients and higher end meals. Walking by, or looking at the name and how the seating is set up I immediately thought 'Oh cool, one of those build-your-own salad spots. Weird they have table settings, but whatever'. After looking at the menu and being mostly nosey and not super hungry I just ordered a tiny plate of fried pickles. They came out piping hot and covered with a green salsa that was really good, and slightly messy. Don't know about you but I'm not above being covered in salsa verde, it may be an aphrodisiac. The crispness of the fried batter, the soft sour pickle, salsa verde, and aioli all on one fork was good enough to make me want to order a couple full course meals regardless of mynot being hungry.AWOL made a great first impression I'm def going back...even if they don't make build-your-own salads",4.0
"Food was delicious. Great service. They also have cool promotions throughout the week - $2 beers, discounted bottles of wine, etc. Best gluten free Mac and Cheese I've had in a long time! Very creamy and cheesy but not overwhelmingly heavy. Perfect balance. Delicious Brussels sprouts and lentil chili. I would order them again even though I'm not a fan of Brussels sprouts. Or lentils :-)Only caveat - beer and wine only. I'll be back for sure!",5.0
"Great decor. Helpful service. I'm gluten-intolerant and vegetarian so it's sometimes hard to find a flavorful meal at a place that all my carnivorous, wheat-eating friends can also enjoy. The corn off the cob is amazing as is the vegan meatball which everyone concluded tastes just like 'real meaty red sauce'. The daily specials are always great. The desserts weren't very impressive, though, and only a couple options.Would love if they'd add some hard ciders and hard liquor to the menu!",4.0

Went in the other day for brunch. I got a Spanish influenced dish and my friend got a Koreans dish. Somehow both of them managed to be amazing despite very few places being able to ever master these culinary styles well in the neighborhood. Today my roommate and I ordered delivery. The steak pizza dish was mind blowing. I took one look at it and thought there's no way these ingredients will work will together and boy was I wrong. The crust on the pizza was to die for and it blended so well together I was shocked. I also had a taco that while pricy was amazingly fresh and delicious. My Roomate had a slider that she couldn't stop raving about. Looking forward to continuing to explore this menu.,5.0

"I just need to tell someone that I love this place...I ordered pizzas for delivery + the brussel sprouts hazelnut side one night, and my bf and I were so impressed. It was real pizza. Not that other stuff. You know what I'm saying. Thinnish crispish crust, interesting topping assortments, approachable in size. We ordered 2 and had a couple slices leftover. Because the delivery food was so mmmm, I was dying to try it in person. This was a good decision.  The place itself is really cute - I'm hands in for the design. It's clean and geometric yet still interesting. It's not huge so you feel like a hungry person, not an am-i-invisble number. Though the food was again fantastic, what REALLY sealed the deal for me was one small thing that rocked my entire mothereating world: It happened so fast. I moved my arms from leaning on the table, and there was a slight wobble to the base. I thought in my head, how does this always happen to me, and then quickly forgot. I didn't even think anyone else noticed. A few minutes later, our server came back out, got on all fours beneath us, and with one swift motion placed a cork under the table and stopped the wobbling. * WHAT! * It was amazing. I felt so loved, I felt like our server empathized with my experience, and was totally in tune to what our experience would be. I know that it's small and random but c'mon only someone that takes pride in the end goal of their server position would have done this. Or he thought I was sexy. Either way, our water and wine was never left untended to either. What a magical server and A++ impressive experience.

"Awol is just down the street from me, but I didn't go in at first because of the trendy-but-cheap looking decor. Low school-child chairs and hard wooden benches that looked silly and uncomfortable to me, and I admit I judged them immediately as a place that values aesthetics over comfort. I finally decided to give it a try though, and I'm very glad I did.The first time I looked over their menu I was impressed and ready for something different, and I wasn't disappointed. Filet mignon tempura tacos- definitely a first for me, with great taste and texture. The roasted brussels sprouts are delicate in size and are done just the way I love them, with the outside brown and crispy. The other day I had the Mac and Cheese, which is gluten-free, btw, and obscenely delicious. It was garnished with thin strips of dried, crispy leek, and all the other dishes have similarly interesting and tasty garnishes. The first time I went, my friend and I ordered way too much, thinking the ""Farm plates"" were typical small plates, but many of the items are perfectly sized for sharing (like the brussels sprouts and mac and cheese). If you are two women or a man and a woman, four farm plates total should be plenty. But of course there are also sliders, and pizza to choose from.Nice service, and they recently added some booths for parties of four. Not too expensive (for Williamsburg), on my last visit our bill was $44 plus tip, which included a glass of wine and a bottle of sparking water.",5.0
Really close to home so I decided to check it out. We asked for a booth since it would be more comfortable but we're told they need to keep those open in case more people come? Okay whatever. Food was pretty good they have a lot of gluten free options which is nice. Overall good place.,4.0
"Went in for dinner last night, the food was  AMAZING!!!! The chef and staff were so fantastic and accommodating of all of my allergies (gluten, red meet & milk) and the food was fantastic!!!!! I got the salmon (which was perfect) with coconut curry rice (also perfect) and yuca (which were like the tastiest potato chips) my friend got the chicken (honestly the best chicken I have ever had; so succulent yet crispy) with roasted potatoes (also great). I was expecting these to be Brklyn portions so we got the roasted brussels sprouts with hazelnuts which where out of this world good so we took home half our food everything was so wonderful. Check it out for yourself!!",5.0

"If you're looking for a unique and magnificent experience... go to AWOL.  Seriously people, from the art on the walls to the art on the plates, this is not to be missed.  Drinks with truffle salt, food with a tandoori flavor... cocktails with beet juice.  Rad stuff.  I loved loved loved the pizza, and all the veggies are amazingly fresh.  (sweet potatoes, I don't even know what to do).The value is amazing and the service was impeccable.  get involved people.",5.0
"Tried this new place for delivery tonight and was fantastic! Great margherita pizza, tasted so fresh and the crust was just crispy enough, also the creamed kale was delicious! I also appreciated the eco-friendly packaging! I'll definitely be eating here again!",5.0
"We ordered delivery from AWOL when it first opened and really enjoyed it. The only glitch was that they forgot our beverage order. However, the delivery guy apologized and brought the beverages to us within ten minutes with a nice note from the restaurant. We decided to try the delivery again, and it was not as good. The food was okay, but certainly not as good as the first time even though we ordered the same thing. They also forgot our beverages again and did not bring it until over half an hour later with no apology. Most people want to have their beverage with the food they are eating. For this to happen both times we ordered is pretty unacceptable, especially for the prices we are paying. All in all I might dine in, but I will most likely not be ordering delivery again.Update: The general manager called us and personally apologized for the mistake. That was certainly nice enough for me. However, later in the evening the manager delivered some delicious desserts and beverages with a note. I was incredibly impressed with that gesture and the fact that they went above and beyond. Thanks AWOL! You certainly deserve another chance.",5.0

Low school-child chairs and hard wooden benches that looked silly and uncomfortable to me, and I admit I judged them immediately as a place that values aesthetics over comfort. I finally decided to give it a try though, and I'm very glad I did.The first time I looked over their menu I was impressed and ready for something different, and I wasn't disappointed. Filet mignon tempura tacos- definitely a first for me, with great taste and texture. The roasted brussels sprouts are delicate in size and are done just the way I love them, with the outside brown and crispy. The other day I had the Mac and Cheese, which is gluten-free, btw, and obscenely delicious. It was garnished with thin strips of dried, crispy leek, and all the other dishes have similarly interesting and tasty garnishes. The first time I went, my friend and I ordered way too much, thinking the ""Farm plates"" were typical small plates, but many of the items are perfectly sized for sharing (like the brussels sprouts and mac and cheese). If you are two women or a man and a woman, four farm plates total should be plenty. But of course there are also sliders, and pizza to choose from.Nice service, and they recently added some booths for parties of four. Not too expensive (for Williamsburg), on my last visit our bill was $44 plus tip, which included a glass of wine and a bottle of sparking water.",5.0
Really close to home so I decided to check it out. We asked for a booth since it would be more comfortable but we're told they need to keep those open in case more people come? Okay whatever. Food was pretty good they have a lot of gluten free options which is nice. Overall good place.,4.0
"Went in for dinner last night, the food was  AMAZING!!!! The chef and staff were so fantastic and accommodating of all of my allergies (gluten, red meet & milk) and the food was fantastic!!!!! I got the salmon (which was perfect) with coconut curry rice (also perfect) and yuca (which were like the tastiest potato chips) my friend got the chicken (honestly the best chicken I have ever had; so succulent yet crispy) with roasted potatoes (also great). I was expecting these to be Brklyn portions so we got the roasted brussels sprouts with hazelnuts which where out of this world good so we took home half our food everything was so wonderful. Check it out for yourself!!",5.0

"If you're looking for a unique and magnificent experience... go to AWOL.  Seriously people, from the art on the walls to the art on the plates, this is not to be missed.  Drinks with truffle salt, food with a tandoori flavor... cocktails with beet juice.  Rad stuff.  I loved loved loved the pizza, and all the veggies are amazingly fresh.  (sweet potatoes, I don't even know what to do).The value is amazing and the service was impeccable.  get involved people.",5.0
"Tried this new place for delivery tonight and was fantastic! Great margherita pizza, tasted so fresh and the crust was just crispy enough, also the creamed kale was delicious! I also appreciated the eco-friendly packaging! I'll definitely be eating here again!",5.0
"We ordered delivery from AWOL when it first opened and really enjoyed it. The only glitch was that they forgot our beverage order. However, the delivery guy apologized and brought the beverages to us within ten minutes with a nice note from the restaurant. We decided to try the delivery again, and it was not as good. The food was okay, but certainly not as good as the first time even though we ordered the same thing. They also forgot our beverages again and did not bring it until over half an hour later with no apology. Most people want to have their beverage with the food they are eating. For this to happen both times we ordered is pretty unacceptable, especially for the prices we are paying. All in all I might dine in, but I will most likely not be ordering delivery again.Update: The general manager called us and personally apologized for the mistake. That was certainly nice enough for me. However, later in the evening the manager delivered some delicious desserts and beverages with a note. I was incredibly impressed with that gesture and the fact that they went above and beyond. Thanks AWOL! You certainly deserve another chance.",5.0
"I just had the most beautiful customer service experience I have ever had in my life.  I just moved into the neighborhood. I placed a order online because I have been craving the fresh farm to table experience I was use to in SF...  I asked if they could please includes plates since I am still unpacking.  I was not expecting one of the owners to come hand deliver my order and gift me actual plates and saucers to make sure I had the right dinning experience.  It was such a sweet gesture I was going to leave a nice review even if the food was bad. But it wasn't... it was incredible.  I'll definitely be coming back and trying more things on the menu.  So far the tempura beef tacos, the brussel sprouts and the pumpkin empanada's were everything I wanted and more.  I'm eyeing those pizza's next. ;)",5.0
"Buyer beware - enter hungry and leave broke.Yes, they're trendy, and the food does taste good overall but 3 stars is the maximum I can surrender here.  Portions are small (overpriced) and the menu is misleading.  For instance: consider their Sliders section.  When one ponders the nature of sliders, he/she/it would expect approximately 3-4 mini-burgers.  At AWOL you get 1 mini-burger, for $14.  Grammatically, sliders doesn't come in a singular form, like shenanigans, or annals.  Moreover, most people don't expect to pay $14 for 1 undersized burger unless its going to land a satellite atop a comet as the side-order.  If you're looking for reasonable beverage options, avoid their North Fork wine, which come at ~$114/bottle.  Though traffic from Long Island is pretty abysmal, transportation cost cannot account for this wallet-gouging option.  The other options are a bit over priced as well, naturally steering one back to beer.  Alas, and we were going for class.",3.0
"Both working and living in the neighborhood, it's always exciting when a new restaurant opens up. AWOL especially stands out with it's farm to table philosophy, which is truly displayed on their ever changing menu.

"5 starts for AWOL! Not only is the food absolutely delicious but these guys are super awesome. They never received our Seamless order, and after 2 hrs we called wondering where our food was. They were closing up and the stoves were shut down. They went above and beyond to cook and hand deliver our dinner. They even threw in some delicious surprises to make up for the long wait time. I can't thank them enough! We can't wait to dine in next time.",5.0
"This place rocks! Despite their love of cilantro and their sliders actually only being one medium burger and not a few small ones their food is great and locally sourced. Nice wine list. Awesome brunch. I crave their heuvos, soo good! Their fries are also awesome. Small place that can get rather loud but they also have outdoor seating and it's definitely a chill atmosphere.",5.0

"Dinner for 2 couples last night. Excellent space and service. Food is well prepared though a bit under seasoned. Portions are appropriate. Hazelnuts in the Brussel sprouts made the dish. Bison steak and polenta was perfect. Corn off the cob was underwhelming as were the shishito peppers (needed more char). Sweet potato with curry and coconut was well balanced and satisfying. Tempura filet tacos had great texture but taste was reminiscent of Americanized sweet and sour pork Chinese take out.  Dessert was excellent (cheesecake and sweet potato empenada) as was the French press. Overall, I like the farm to table concept but I think the flavors and dishes underwhelm, especially for $190 for 4 (with 4 beers, 2 glasses of wine, and tip).  Would like to see how brunch goes.",3.0
"Had been meaning to stop in since this place opened, and I am so glad I did. I will definitely be coming back a LOT.

"So happy this place opened; it's definitely a welcome addition to the Williamsburg restaurant scene. So far all the things I've tried here are fresh-tasting and original. I'm not usually drawn to vegetarian dishes but the Garden Crema Taco and Maiz corn salad were super tasty.  Also, my friend ordered a slider that came with polenta fries--which I couldn't stop stealing bites of. My other favorite dish was the grilled Argentine pizza--it combines my two favorite things: chimichurri steak and pizza! To drink I had the Locke mimosa. I ordered it mostly out of curiosity because I've never seen organic sake, prosecco and an assortment of fresh juices combined in such a way, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well it all came together. Next I had the Spiked Iced Tea, which I think is my favorite. It's exotic and refreshing and has a little kick to it. On top of how much everyone enjoyed their meal, we all left feeling good about how reasonably priced everything is!

"Delicious meal deserved by courteous and accommodating staff. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. Went out with four others and we were all impressed with our dishes: fried green tomatoes, chickpea fritters and maize to start. Then we moved on to ribeye steak w potatoes au gratin, 3 generous personal pizzas: argentine with steak, duck  with sweet potato and a garden vegetable (each was exceptionally seasoned and crispy) and an order of tempura beef tacos. We were quite pleased and full when a complementary sampling of the  pumpkin empanadas and white chocolate flan cheesecake. Wow! The creme anglaise is fabulous and we ate every bite. Suggestion: wear expandable clothing! Can't wait until our next visit to see our daughter in Brooklyn. AWOL is gem.",4.0
Great new restaurant in the area. Argentine pizza with skirt steak and chimichurri is delicious and highly recommended,5.0
"This place is absolutely amazing!!! We live in the neighborhood and this is what we have been dreaming of. But no matter what neighborhood, we would be here...we would definitely travel for this gem! We are low-meat, varying between veggie and some poultry and veggie friendly places are always high on my list. Risotto was to die for, the flan-cheesecake was out of this world, as well as the sweet potato--well everything! Thank you AWOL!",5.0
"This place was amazing. Came here with my mom on a random trip to Brooklyn. She got the skirt steak and I got the airline chicken. Both were absolutely amazing.  Everything was really fresh. We also had the apple pizza for two for dessert, which was just as great. Next time I'm in the BK, I'll definitely be going back. Maybe for brunch!",5.0
"Outstanding!I was absolutely blown away this past Sunday. If I recall correctly, I had the Maiz with cojita cheese (ridiculously good), Tilapia Slider with Calamari Fries (absurd value for the price), the white chocolate flan, the Gewürztraminer sour with egg whites and Bloody Mary with grilled pineapple. So, so good.",5.0
"My new favorite spot in Williamsburg.  Delicious food and friendly, attentive staff; nice decor, great date spot.  Great vegetarian options - I recommend the quinoa sliders - but the pork belly was delicious too.  We got to meet the chef and he was a great guy.",5.0
"I really, really like this place. The food is so refreshingly interesting. I deducted a star just based on a bit of variability (some dishes are amazing and some were just good) and portion size for the special based on the $30 price tag. My favorites have been the Argentine pizza and the grilled bison specials. The meat is amazing and the vegetable purées that the bison sits on are always crazy good - so flavorful with amazing texture. Oh, and the flan cheesecake. It's simply wonderful - creamy with hints of milk chocolate and delicious accompaniments of hazelnut paste and homemade flavored whipped cream. And there is enough of it to go around. Eating it right now reminded me I owe it to the public to let them know about AWOL.",4.0
"This place is insanely good. The staff is great, and the farm plates are worth every cent; great for sharing. I've been a couple times, with different types of eaters -- snobby and not, and everyone has been consistently impressed. The grilled pizzas are out of this world--and the specials, that seem to change daily, always look so appetizing and personalized. I'm probably gonna eat there tonight, actually.",5.0
"We were pleasantly surprised by this new restaurant. There are lots of appetizers/tapas, so it was perfect to order a bunch of the smaller plates and share so we could taste a bunch of things. Both vegetarians and meat eaters will be happy. 5 apps for 2 were perfect and everything was really tasty, my favorite being the ratatouille. The drinks were also creative and unique (and good). Really friendly staff and reasonable prices-we'll be back!",5.0

Delicious!!! Had the Brussel sprouts and quinoa and zucchini slider with avocado fries and it was great! They forgot to add the pork belly to the sprouts I ordered and they immediately sent it over!!! So nice!!!,5.0
"This place is AMAZING. The food is extremely fresh (it's a farm to table/fork place) and the taste of everything that we had was delish! I forgot the name of the drink that i had but it was a play on a michelada with a spicy twist to it - also terrific and the spiciness was not overbearing. My boyfriend got the Bloody Mary which was probably the best that i ever had, but slightly heavy for dinner (the tomatoes they used are grilled so it tasted WOW and it was topped with a piece of grilled pineapple and kale). We started off with the Grilled Vegetable Taco and the Risotto from the small plates and both were terrific. The taco had a really good flavor given it was vegetarian and it was also filling. Presentation of both were outstanding! We then moved onto the sliders (beware - it's a nice and large slider!) - we wanted the short rib however it was sold out, so we instead picked the Almond Crusted Tilapia slider which was also great and had good flavor - this was probably my favorite items and it comes with a side of calamari fritters which was perfectly cooked - no fishy taste at all! Last, we got the Hawaiian pizza - the grilled pineapple and prosciutto complimented each other perfectly - also there was lots of prosciutto! I was already stuffed from dinner but obviously had to get dessert - we got the White Chocolate Flan Cheesecake. So rich and amazing. It wasn't too big too so just a couple of bites of heaven to satisfy your sweet tooth. I will definitely be back!!! Looking forward to trying the other small plates and desserts. Moderately priced for fresh ingredients too! #foodcoma  Perfect place for DATE NIGHT!",5.0
