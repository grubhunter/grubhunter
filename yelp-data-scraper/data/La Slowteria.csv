"this place is fantastic! I read an article (I think it was in Lucky Peach) recently about how ethnic food (not from Europe) often is expected to be less expensive. Coming from San Francisco, I can attest -- we like our street tacos substantial, and around $3 per. This place is a perfect example of how that is a totally unfair expectation. The food is excellent -- quality ingredients, hearty, beautiful presentation and the seasoning is delicious. Yes, two tacos with rice and beans for $16 may, at first, seem a little bit pricey but in reality, it is completely justified. Between, as I mentioned, the presentation, fresh, LOCALLY SOURCED ingredients & meats, full-meter (I could barely finish my rice and beans) $16 for all of that was kind of a steal.Also, they have a pretty cool happy hour -- free refills on grapefruit margaritas and Modelo!definitely going back.",5.0
"Been Meaning to try this place since I saw it on the Toni On show about a year ago so with my coworker in tow I finally made it here on Friday night and I wish I came in sooner. This was one of the best meals Ive had this year. We started with the happy hour special Cucumber Margarita which was great. Perfect balance and very light. For an app we split an order of the table made Guacamole with crispy tostadas and soft charred tortillas. Again the balance of flavors was perfect and if you needed more heat they put their house made hot sauces on the table in cool eyedroppers. The ground habanero was very hot but also quite flavorful and the chipotle was nice and smoky.  For a main I got the two tacos choosing fish and shrimp and both were exceptional with wonderful smoky,spicy flavor on the seafood. They were on soft,warm blue corn tortillas with radishes and other garnishes. Served on a cute tray with a crock of very nice rice and beans with a slice of avocado and sprinkled with cheese,a small bowl of salsa,red onions,cilantro, chili powder dusted lime slice andMexican Crema. My coworker got the seafood ceviche and a single taco a decision our awesome server helped her with and after she proclaimed herself stuffed I polished off the ceviche and the squid was insanely tender and the flavors were spot on. The decor is adorably kitschy and the service couldnt be friendlier. We will be returning.",5.0
I was extremely hesitant at first when I got there because the place is extremely small and there were tons of children in the restaurant. It was almost like it was a mommy and me play date!!How wrong I was. They couldn't have been nicer when we sat down at the bar.My girlfriend got a cinnamon Margarita which was absolutely delicious and to my surprise they made me a fresh juiced cucumber margarita right in front of me. It was insane. Their juicer is behind the bar. We both got steak tacos on fresh made tortillas which were probably one of the best tacos I've ever had. They also made fresh guacamole right in front of us. You definitely get what you pay for here and I would go back in a heartbeat.I also love the photographs of drag queens on the wall.,5.0
"One of the best meals I've had in a long time.I knew I was in for a treat when the kitchen sent over a small starter at no charge.  That was followed up by huevos rancheros that was cooked to specifications. (Scrambled and no cheese) and was both delightful and satisfying.  The people were so nice and followed up to make sure everything was ok. The eggs were served on a flavorful corn based tortilla that was firm.  Small side of beans and rice coupled with a small amount of corn within a small ring of sliced onion, completed the presentation.  I like the small seating  at the bar and can't wait to go back in the warmer months to check out the outdoor seating.",5.0
"I am that biased ex-Californian who usually prefaces a Mexican restaurant review with, ""not as good as Cali Mexican,"" and having recently dined here, I'm finding myself at a loss for words here.  La Slowteria is a very good Mexican restaurant, definitely not Cali-style, but in a good way.  For starters, the kitchen sends out an amuse bouche of lazy tacos, a delicate and delish chopped chicken taco with pico de gallo.  No cliched chips and salsa here, although they do provide you with 2 kinds of house made salsa.  I noticed that they took their time executing our dinner orders, but I understood why, when the food arrived.  The massive taco sampler came with one shrimp taquito and  6 different kinds of tacos, each with its own unique garnish and preparation.  The scallop&bacon and the duck tacos, in particular, were phenomenal.  The delicate seared scallop was cooked a little rare, and complemented the crunchy bacon perfectly.  The duck was juicy and flavorful, and made for a perfect little taco.  BF and I also shared the light but crispy pork taquitos, ""fake fried""  flat taco like patties filled with nicely spiced shredded meat.  Both entrees came with the lightest and fluffiest version of beans and rice I'd ever sampled.  Not Cali-greasy at all.  We were totally wowed by the refined flavors and unusual preparations, and it really was a shame we did not arrive hungrier (we had in fact, just scarfed down catered sandwiches and cheese and crackers an hour earlier at an art event).  So my recommendation to you - come hungry and prepare to be blown away by La Slowteria's refined Brooklyn-style Mexican food.",5.0
"I agonized over this menu. I waffled back and forth for what felt like an eternity, and then the concerned sweetheart of a waitress came by and said, ""Oh by the way: we have a bacon and jalapeño-wrapped shrimp huevos rancheros as a special.""Next time, lead with that. So I got the bacon and jalapeño-wrapped shrimp huevos rancheros. She described it as ""medium spicy [for a real man]"" which had me crying/snotting by the end of the meal. It was quite delicious, despite barely being able to see the plate through my own tears. My wife's spicy tuna tostada was also very tasty, with the Asian/Mexican flavor mashup being as well-matched as you can really ask.It seems as though all of the flavors at La Slowteria are on point. Whoever is back there in the kitchen has a unique and wonderful vision when it comes to food. I do think a little refinement and balance might be necessary, if only to make things easier to eat. There was a lot of sinew running through the tuna itself, and the huge rings of onion were difficult to deal with. The portion sizes were also a little inconsistent; there was a mountain of tuna, and only two shrimp. Overall though, this is a place I can't wait to get back to. The service is friendly and hospitable, the backyard is picturesque, and the flavors are huge. See you over there.",4.0
"Out of this world beachy Mexican food. We almost didn't go in because the menu looked very limited. SO glad we did. The made me a jalapeño margarita with less sugar (per my request) - perfect. Chips and guac - perfect and made right in front of us. Jalapeño stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon? Guess. Perfect. Go here. And the vibe makes you feel like you're on a beach, which is great for winter! Also, I gotta say it's nice to see a Mexican restaurant owned by a Mexican person with Latinos working in the FRONT of the house. Having said that, I would have given this place 5 stars even if it were owned by a gringo.",5.0
"This review is going to have many caveats. Firstly, I went with a group to celebrate Cinco de Mayo, so of course, it was going to be busy. Secondly, both owners were out of town and one of their dads (who admittedly had no real restaurant management experience) was running the place that night. So right off the bat, my review isn't going to be the typical experience. But Pete Wells I'm not, so on goes this review.We had an 8:30 reservation, but we ended up getting seated maybe an hour later. We only found out at the end of the night from one of the waitresses that another group actually stole our reserved table inside. We waited patiently at the bar inside, sipping on margaritas (the jalapeno one is good, but for some reason the third one I had tasted weird. I think they switched up the tequila they were using). It's not a good waiting area, as food runners and people going to the bathroom/yard walk past you and the place is pretty narrow.Anyway, we finally got seated at 9:30 in the backyard (insert your Slow-teria jokes here). For the record, the backyard is amazing. There was a table of drunk girls next to us who were complaining loudly that they had waited two hours for food and were getting belligerent. Understandable to be pissed, but also... how about not being complete terrible human beings? They eventually left after their food finally came and they made up some excuses about it not being good.That said, the food is actually delicious. They make the guacamole at your table, and ask you how chunky or spicy you want it. The seafood ceviche is also great; with shrimp, octopus and big chunks of avocado. We also had the Soldado (beans, chorizo and cheese with spicy roasted Serrano peppers). Very cheesy and great for dipping.For my main, I split the taco sampler. It was 6 tacos for $22, which is a great deal. They're smaller than the ones you can just get as a taco platter, but it's a good way to try things out. Ours came with steak, duck, bacon wrapped scallops, chorizo, fish and veggie. The veggie is skippable. My favorites were the steak and the chorizo.At the end of the meal (which was close to 11pm), they gave us a free dessert plate that the acting manager had promised us earlier in the night while we were waiting an hour for our table. It was a mix of tres leches, choco flan and coconut macaroon. All very good, though my favorite was the choco flan.All in all, Slowteria would probably be good if they had all their cylinders firing. The food is great, and I would consider coming back for brunch.",3.0
"A very fresh, modern Mexican restaurant that I am happy to have around.The blue color in the restaurant reminds me Greece very much, and it puts me in a good mood. The ambience is cosy, there is a big board with the menu on it and it's a difficult not to order everything, as all dishes look yummy.All that we had was well done, very tasty, very fresh and brought with a big smile. That's a plus.Enjoy Margaritas, order with close eyes and I am sure you're going to have a great time. See you soon Slowteria !",4.0
"On one my long walks thru Brooklyn, I finally noticed La Slowteria. And since a friend of mine and I are on the search for the best fish tacos, I knew we had to try. We went a few weeks ago. The place is cute. Bright and festive, but not too much so. The staff was friendly and pleasant. We started off with guacamole and margaritas.  Guacamole was excellent, margaritas large and well made, although mine had salt when I asked for none, and with a little too much ice for my taste. The sampling of hot sauces was greatI think we shocked the waiter a little bit when for our mains we ordered two fish tacos AND the taco sampler. My friend barely tips the scale over 100 lbs, but her big eyes were definitely not as big as her stomach that night. Getting right to the tacos: the presentation was great. The tacos on the sampler were smaller, of course, than regular tacos. The range of quality was a little wider than I thought, but not really unexpected. My least favorite, surprisingly, was the duck; our favorite, by far, was the bacon wrapped scallops. In fact my friend, a long time vegetarian, got a very positive visceral response, which was a bonus. The fish tacos, although very testy, did not win the coveted ""best fish taco"" trophy.  There was a little weirdness at the end of the meal. We declined dessert, but our server never asked if we wanted anything else: more drinks, or coffee. My friend and I joked that maybe we did something wrong and fell out of favor, but after I paid the check, the friendliness was back, names were exchanged, and we were told to please come back.Overall, I am a fan, and I will go back.",4.0
"I cannot believe how empty they were on a Saturday. I'm disheartened by it. Seriously. In the year and a half I've been living in Carroll Gardens, I had yet to visit La Slowteria. I walk by the place every time I go to kickboxing. Finally, I went. It was awesome.Our waitress was superb and offered us a ton of suggestions on what to order. For apps we got the scallops aguachile--perfectly-seared scallops at the end of a long ribbon of cucumber, with a stuffed, hallowed out avocado and some freshly-made toasted tortillas. It was unbelievable. The presentation, beautiful, and the flavors, incredible. We also got the saldado, a bean, chorizo and cheese dip served with handmade tortilla strips. A-maz-ing.I got the taco taster, which included mini tortillas with one of every taco. The duck was phenomenal, the fish excellent, and the steak delicious. Those were just my favorites! My dad got the duck tacos, which were overstuffed and came with rice and beans. My mom got the ""la rosa""--raw tuna marinated in a soy-sesame marinade with some Mexican flavors, and served on a toastada. It was incredible, and delicious.I wish we had tried dessert, but I was stuffed. This place is five minutes away from me...FIVE MINUTES! How the hell have I not been?

However, in the spirit of full disclosure, my experience at this restaurant is NOT reflective of how they ordinarily operate and you should not take it as such. There.So, Cinco de Mayo (aka, the busiest day of the year for Mexican restaurants all across America).  We came with our group of 6 for an 8:30 reservation. We were seated an hour later. Oof, that's rough. There's no good place to stand, so we were relegated to the side of the bar, while being elbowed by passing servers and people using the bathroom. Luckily, a couple rounds of margaritas kept us in good humor. Cucumber was my favorite.So it turned out that our wait was due to the restaurant owners being out of town and having their family member managing the restaurant that evening. Plus, someone stole our table. Like I said, an atypical situation.Once we finally got seated outside in the very cool backyard, we were treated to the whining and moaning of the table of girls across from us, who had apparently been waiting two hours for their food and felt the entire backyard should know this. Not to say that this wasn't true, but it did absolutely nothing to help the situation (theirs or ours). So we were pretty glad when they left, presumably attempting to do a dine and dash (I hope someone caught them). As for us, we had sort of committed ourselves to being here for the rest of the evening, and decided to make the best of it. We ordered guacamole, seafood ceviche, a bean and cheese dip that was similar to nachos (but better), and I split a taco platter for my main, which had smaller versions of almost every single taco on their menu. I have to give them credit where it's due, the food was delicious. I enjoyed everything. The standouts were the ceviche, the dip, and the veggie and chorizo tacos. We were also treated to free dessert for our prolonged wait, which was nice. The servers were very sweet and everyone was extremely apologetic for the long wait, which I appreciated. I think it's worth coming back sometime, but probably not right away, as we didn't finish that dinner until nearly midnight.",3.0

"What an amazing experience! Come here for the delicious tacos (served with hand-made corn tortillas) and the wonderful employees who make you feel like a million dollars when serving and cooking for you! I came here with friends and had such a lovely experience! The delicious, fresh, table-made guac and made-in-house tortillas and chips started our meal on a high note and everyone in my party raved. The servers were kind, cheery, informative and helpful. They gave us our space, but we never felt neglected. The mains were met with ""oooohs,"" ""ahhhhs,"" and lots of ""yums""! A creative and delicious take on the fish, veggie and shrimp tacos. Hearty portions with sides that weren't sloppily poured on the plate, but came in their own small serving dish. Great for vegetarians: The beans and rice are made without meat and the server had other veg suggestions that weren't on the menu. Since we were eating before the rush, the chef came out and asked us if we were enjoying our meal and thanked us for coming in. Loved the customer service so much! Don't miss the Mexican hot chocolate- it's sweet with a spicy kick and a touch of cinnamon. Prices are more than an average taco joint because you are getting quality, creative and delicious cuisine! So happy we found this neighborhood gem.",5.0
"My husband brought me here for brunch. He had been here with a friend previously and he instantly knew that I would be a fan. And he was right.  When we walked in it was refreshing to see a modern take on a Mexican restaurant. There was a beautiful collection Joaquin Trujillo's photographs on the wall. I definitely enjoyed the food cart in front of the ferris wheel. And I can never resist an altar for the day of the dead. It was covered in flowers and skulls. The restaurant is painted white and there are wooden chairs, bar and tables.  It added this almost ""by the sea"" feel. I especially enjoyed their three layer, wire, sculptural fruit holder that sat on the bar. We sat down and my husband suggested the cucumber, mezcal margarita. It was smooth with a little spice and the cucumber was bright. When it comes to brunch I am always drawn to either Huevos Rancheros or Chilaquiles. And lucky for me they have Huevos Rancheros. As we waited for our food we split ""La Rana"", which was homemade guac and tostadas. The tostadas were more like vey soft, tasty, blue corn tortillas. Delicious! Then my husband tried the grasshoppers with apple slices. I guess this adventurous app is off the menu. He had previously made friends wih the chef.When the entree arrived it was just what I wanted. And then there was even a nice side dish of rice and beans. There was also a robust cheese that was melted on top of the eggs and tortillas. The cheese separates this restaurant because it represents their passion in details and quality. I highly recommend this restaurant and wish this chef all the success he deserves.

The atmosphere really depends on who is working that particular day. The last Saturday night was a real hit. Everyone was very friendly, welcoming and even brought some crickets out to try. The dessert was a little bland overall but the caramel sauce that comes with the tres leches is AMAZING.",4.0
"I went to this restaurant tonight with two friends. We were in the area and looking for a place to eat. It's a cute, little place. We ordered guacamole to start, which was really good. For dinner, we all ordered two tacos each. I had a steak one and one with squid. They came with rice and beans. The tacos were very good and they came with their hot sauce, which was also good. I had the cucumber margarita to drink and I loved it! The only thing I didn't like about this place is that they don't have paper menus. The menu is written on the wall. It was hard to read so I actually read the menu off the yelp app. Overall, I liked this place and I would return.",4.0

Deconstructed mole sauce?! Buzz words restaurants throw around ten years ago...I should of known better. Guacamole made with brown avocados at the table by your waitress with a potato masher. Stale tostada chips that were made yesterday on the side. When you start thinking, I could make better Mexican food at home, you know you made a bad decision. Be sure to order a few margaritas to help soften the sticker shock of the bill.This is the most expensive terrible Mexican food you will ever have.

I definitely enjoyed the food cart in front of the ferris wheel. And I can never resist an altar for the day of the dead. It was covered in flowers and skulls. The restaurant is painted white and there are wooden chairs, bar and tables.  It added this almost ""by the sea"" feel. I especially enjoyed their three layer, wire, sculptural fruit holder that sat on the bar. We sat down and my husband suggested the cucumber, mezcal margarita. It was smooth with a little spice and the cucumber was bright. When it comes to brunch I am always drawn to either Huevos Rancheros or Chilaquiles. And lucky for me they have Huevos Rancheros. As we waited for our food we split ""La Rana"", which was homemade guac and tostadas. The tostadas were more like vey soft, tasty, blue corn tortillas. Delicious! Then my husband tried the grasshoppers with apple slices. I guess this adventurous app is off the menu. He had previously made friends wih the chef.When the entree arrived it was just what I wanted. And then there was even a nice side dish of rice and beans. There was also a robust cheese that was melted on top of the eggs and tortillas. The cheese separates this restaurant because it represents their passion in details and quality. I highly recommend this restaurant and wish this chef all the success he deserves. PS I look forward to hanging in the patio when it warms up",4.0
"There's about to be a line out the door for this place it's so damn delicious. If you want some of the best tacos in NYC, this is your spot. Ceviche? Unbelievable. Tacos? Made with house corn tortillas so good you could cry. Beef? Spicy and flavorful. Service? A-maz-ing. Decor? Suh cute.I couldn't complain about anything here if I tried, I can't wait to trek down Court St. again for another fish taco. Also hear the patio is awesome in warmer weather, hip hip hooray spring!",5.0
"Just want to reiterate that this Might be my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. The food is that good. My mother-, who is from Texas and usually doesn't like any mexican food if it isn't Tex-Mex, even loves this place. The margaritas are mmmmmmm and they have Honey Brown beer which makes my heart happy. The chorizo tacos, roasted corn, and huevos rancheros are three of my favorite dishes. The guacamole is SO GOOD. Like Rosa Mexicana good. Better. Just come. Eat. Come back.Also: don't come in a rush. The kitchen is small and everything is made fresh. Pretend like you're on vacation.",5.0
"Atmosphere: Hit or miss.Food: DeliciousDessert: Bland but deliciousSo I have tried the tacos and the ceviche now. The tacos were hit or miss depending on the flavor. I recommend the taco platter. You can grab a sample of everything they have to offer. Hibiscus margarita was absolutely delicious.The ceviche was actually delicious. Large cuts of seafood in a sauce with some great pico flavors. The atmosphere really depends on who is working that particular day. The last Saturday night was a real hit. Everyone was very friendly, welcoming and even brought some crickets out to try. The dessert was a little bland overall but the caramel sauce that comes with the tres leches is AMAZING.",4.0
"I went to this restaurant tonight with two friends. We were in the area and looking for a place to eat. It's a cute, little place. We ordered guacamole to start, which was really good. For dinner, we all ordered two tacos each. I had a steak one and one with squid. They came with rice and beans. The tacos were very good and they came with their hot sauce, which was also good. I had the cucumber margarita to drink and I loved it! The only thing I didn't like about this place is that they don't have paper menus. The menu is written on the wall. It was hard to read so I actually read the menu off the yelp app. Overall, I liked this place and I would return.",4.0
"Food is amazing. Friendly staff. Lovely place. An amazing place for traditional yet innovative, modern Mexican cuisine. Chef Hugo brings amazing unique creations you'll never find anywhere else.",5.0
"I give this place negative three stars. We paid $121.00 dollars for two tacos, guacamole, chili, and four margaritas. If you want to pay 16 dollars for one fish taco and inedible rice and beans you should come here. I literally spit the rice in a napkin as inconspicuous as possible, it was so disgusting. Deconstructed mole sauce?! Buzz words restaurants throw around ten years ago...I should of known better. Guacamole made with brown avocados at the table by your waitress with a potato masher. Stale tostada chips that were made yesterday on the side. When you start thinking, I could make better Mexican food at home, you know you made a bad decision. Be sure to order a few margaritas to help soften the sticker shock of the bill.This is the most expensive terrible Mexican food you will ever have. Mezcal is just up the street skip this place and go pay less for better Mexican food.",1.0
"$1 oysters...need I say more? We were SHOCKED that we were able to get a table for cinco de mayo at this awesome place. We ended up staying 3 1/2 hours! The margs are absolutely delicious (I recommend the hibiscus) and pretty strong. The guac was amazing (that's saying a lot, because I usually have to doctor my guac). THe owner was super nice and the rest of the staff couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful. We ordered a few tacos and some amazing chorizo dish that I still think about. I can't wait to go back!",4.0
"Excellent food - marvelous flavors. Friendly service. Reasonable prices. A few caveats though. Note that the menu on  Yelp is old. The real menu, which is more limited, is shown on their web site. The restaurant is very small, without AC upstairs, though the backyard is reasonably cool.As mentioned in another review the pieces of duck in the duck tacos are much too big, but they are very flavorable.",4.0
"My husband and I stopped in around 730 on a Saturday night. The place was packed and very small but we were able to grab two seats at the bar. This is some of the best Mexican food I've had. We tried the chorizo appetizer (beans,cheese, chorizo) that was very tasty and the taco sampler (7 small assorted tacos) that we also enjoyed. We were so surprised by some of the taco combos we tried but they were amazing. Bacon and scallop taco was a nice surprise! This restaurant is a neighborhood gem",5.0
"5 star upgrade considered and granted.  After a few more visits to this place I'm convinced, not only is it the most unique Mexican food around... but it's one of the best bunch places in the area as well.I always have to laugh at the staff... super nice guys, but always sleepy looking, like they just rolled out of bed.  I have this vision of Chef Hugo driving around Williamsburg in a white van and clubbing hipsters over the head and abducting them, forcing them to work in his restaurant when they wake up.  They are all great though... I'm not complaining about the service at all.Onto the food:1.  The charred habanero hot sauce is amazing.  It's _actually_ hot, and adds great flavor to everything.2.  Fish tacos, win.3.  The presentation, beautiful.4.  The price, unbeatable value for money at this place.Hugo knows his food.  Best.  Brunch.  Period.",5.0
"What an excellent place! Came here on a mid Sunday afternoon for a very late lunch and was greeted by the owner and seated at a table of our choice. He is a very friendly guy and we were delighted to converse with him. The decor felt like I was by a seaside Mexican town. Very light, bring, and nautical. All was missing was sand under my toes. I ordered tacos, 1 Fish and 1 Chorizo, and boy were they excellent! The blue corn tortilla is house made, tastes amazing, and holds up so well bearing the weight of the taco innards. The fish was an excellent grilled filet and the chorizo was a game changer. I repeat - GAME CHANGER. They also supply just the right amount of rice and beans as well as a chipotle mayo and a house chilli sauce. AMAZING. I cant say enough good things about the flavor, freshness and presentation of the food. Well done! Next time Im coming for happy hour margaritas! Thank you La Slowteria!",5.0
"Pros-Friendly attentive staff, great authentic Mexican food,  jalapeno margaritas (plural because you'll want more than one)Cons-Food is a little priceyI went in on a Saturday night, and La Slowteria did not disappoint.  This is place is the perfect ambiance for date night, or drinks and food with the crew.   I would describe the scenery as your mother's dining room (if she is Mexican and can whip up phenomenal jalapeno margaritas!) We ordered the fish and shrimp tacos as well as the table side guacamole.  Flavor was perfect in every bite.  The jalapeno margarita has such an exotic rim that complimented it so well.  I can't tell you the secret, you got to check it out for your self.Will definitely be back and would recommend to a friend that I like.",4.0
"This was our first time here. It's a sit down casual restaurant. We came around 1:30 on a Sunday and they were still serving brunch so we got the heuvos rancheros and the chiquilles (spelling?) and both were delicious and flavorful. I'd read a review that the chef makes everything with love, this is true. You'll see it right away in the presentation. They brought out their homemade hot sauces which were both good, although we like things spicy so they could have another spicier option imo. We shared a fresh juice pineapple/ginger and you'll hear the juicer going, again delicious and fresh, went well with the meal. The music and decor is more funky and modern than Mexican and that suits the menu. This is not your average Mexican beans and rice, it's our new go to Mexican restaurant.",5.0
"A small place with great personal warmth radiating from the owner Hugo through his whole staff who are serving clever and tasty versions of tacos and salsas,etal. Best fish tacos I have had EVER. They make their own tortillas which are a warm companion to virtually all their dishes. There is a back garden patio which will be great when it stop being cold !",5.0
"If mexican food, trying great food, eating something different your kick...then you need to eat in this place because chef orozco does a phenomenal work in making not only great mexican food but also in creating memorable experiences. His food goes from traditional to eclectic and is made with a lot of passion and respect for ingredients and tradition. The menu is very diverse with enough to satisfy any need or taste. I've longed for a great mexican restaurant in the US and only here I can say that food taste as good as it does back home...be aware you will need to come back at least two times to this restaurant to try every item in the menu...I tried and only managed to taste 10 plates...but I will return to finish trying the rest of the menu...unless it changes again, then its back to zero and to try to eat the whole menu. The decor is very cozy and its great to hang out with friends for good food...oh! And their margaritas are awesome!, try them with mezcal rather than tequila...you will thank me later",5.0

Great tasting tacos.  It's not your typical Mexican restaurant in NY- the ingredients like pecans and dishes like grasshoppers makes this place a unique gem.  I personally had fish and shrimp tacos which were amazing ( I wasn't daring enough to eat grasshoppers).  Staff was friendly and found a parking spot nearby.,5.0

"Come here if you'd like to have an ""eff you"" pile of fat sitting on your plate at the end of dinner and a sad, angry feeling in your stomach (not to mention, still hungry). I came here last night for dinner and ordered the spicy hibiscus margarita ($11) and the steak taco ($18). My dining companions had the steak taco, as well, and the taco sampler ($22). We shared the table side guacamole ($10).The idea is that you receive one enormous taco on a house-made corn tortilla. The steak was undercooked, greasy, and flavorless, and the portion I received was noticeably smaller than my friend's. At first I tried to deal, but the few pieces of steak I had were all fat and little meat. I actually spit a piece out. I finally felt like I needed to mention it to the waitress, who removed the plate to have it cooked a little more and said she'd ask the chef to add a few slices of beef. The best thing to do when things are wrong is to let the kitchen know and give them a chance to fix it--right?However, after a few minutes, I received a refreshed plate, but was stunned to find the chef had burnt my few pieces of steak to a crisp (I just asked for medium!!) and had added a pile of fatty trimmings instead of any additional slices of beef. It was very noticeable and felt offensive. What a shameful, disgusting way to treat a paying guest. Who does that??? The taco sampler is massive, but when my companion ordered vegetarian they brought him things he didn't ask for (squid) and didn't want to eat. Additionally, the beans were seawater salty and the rice was old, dry, and unseasoned. The spicy hibiscus margarita was excellent, slightly sweet and spicy, with a warm smokey under-taste from the mescal. The table side guac was pretty tasty, as well, but felt expensive to watch one avocado and some pica de gallo smushed in front of you. You have to order this because you're not getting any chips and salsa at the table (I know, not ""high end,"" but I still miss).

"My fiancé and I walked by this place before and I was craving Mexican food and decided to give it a try. The space is very inviting with bright colors and chill dub music playing. The menu was written on the wall which was cool - but when we asked the waitress about a few dishes she couldn't really explain much since she spoke mostly Spanish which was fine but lead to a problem later... I chose to order the tuna Torta but after finding out from the waitress that it is technically an appetizer portion I changed my mind and went with the squid tacos. My fiancé ordered shrimp tacos and we also went with 12 bluepoint oysters. So the language barrier led to the waitress bringing out the tuna Torta and then looking very upset when we said no we ordered the squid tacos instead. It literally took the manager? to come over and tell her no they don't want that. Even after we could hear the conversation in Spanish (which I speak) going on and on about what happened. 1) don't assume people don't understand Spanish. 2) Be understanding and admit you made a mistake. Besides that - the food is pretty outstanding. Fresh ingredients; the oysters were delicious and we had them with lime and some salt which was a first for both of us but was very good! Tortillas were fresh and homemade. Roasted corn was literally fresh off the Cobb. Many more sauces/ spices that added to the deliciousness.

La Slowteria's fish taco is the best of them all.We also had La Rana, which is simply chips and guacamole, but is delicious. Careful with the habañero oil, though - it's powerful.Food's a bit pricey (apps $10+, entrees $20+), but definitely worth it for the quality of the food and the care with which it is prepared. Service was top-notch.We'll definitely be coming back here.",5.0
"I've been here around 10 times; it's one of my neighborhood go-to restaurants. La Slowteria has some of the best Mexican I've ever eaten. The tortillas are homemade and amazing, I love the ceviche and the taco platter. Their brunch is incredible. And those margaritas...yesssss! I like the margarita with mezcal; sometimes I have them change up the jalapeno margarita and throw some mezcal into it. They have a happy hour (I think on weekdays?) but beware because not all margaritas are on special during that time so be sure to clarify before ordering or you'll run up a $50 tab for drinks like I did. They'll throw something good and cheap and appropriate together for your kids if you have 'em. The back garden is lovely and atmospheric especially when they play old school mexican black and white movies on their projector, using the wall of the neighboring building as a screen. Overall a great place!",5.0

"Unbelievably good upscale mexican food. My tastes with mexican food tend to run towards the cheap n' nasty side, and I'm always a little more than suspicious when a place tries to take something simple (carnitas tacos for example) and fancy them up. That said, this place totally, 100%, unbelievably delivers on the the premise. The tortillas alone are incredible and unlike anything I've had. The rice and beans were phenomenal. The best dish we had was a sort of motza ball soup which had a tortilla ball filled with bacon in the middle of a saucer, over which was poured a steak soup that had been simmered for hours in a mason jar. Just unbelievable. The drinks were fantastic too. The have a great back garden where they screen old mexican films and hollywood blockbusters in the evening. Great for dates, will definitely go again.",5.0
"My wife and I live in Carroll Gardens and have been systematically searching for the best Fish Taco in our area. We've tried fish tacos at SIX different local joints. La Slowteria's fish taco is the best of them all.We also had La Rana, which is simply chips and guacamole, but is delicious. Careful with the habañero oil, though - it's powerful.Food's a bit pricey (apps $10+, entrees $20+), but definitely worth it for the quality of the food and the care with which it is prepared. Service was top-notch.We'll definitely be coming back here.",5.0
"I've been here around 10 times; it's one of my neighborhood go-to restaurants. La Slowteria has some of the best Mexican I've ever eaten. The tortillas are homemade and amazing, I love the ceviche and the taco platter. Their brunch is incredible. And those margaritas...yesssss! I like the margarita with mezcal; sometimes I have them change up the jalapeno margarita and throw some mezcal into it. They have a happy hour (I think on weekdays?) but beware because not all margaritas are on special during that time so be sure to clarify before ordering or you'll run up a $50 tab for drinks like I did. They'll throw something good and cheap and appropriate together for your kids if you have 'em. The back garden is lovely and atmospheric especially when they play old school mexican black and white movies on their projector, using the wall of the neighboring building as a screen. Overall a great place!",5.0
"Had dinner here Saturday, 7/18.  Food was great.  Fresh and satisfying.  Drinks were really good, especially the Jalapeño Margarita.  The margarita had just the right amount of spice.  Service was very good, except waitress took orders on her phone but still managed to get one of the drinks orders wrong.  The margarita that arrived was still good so we drank it.  Will go back.",5.0

"Just moved to Brooklyn from Los Angeles, and while I'm no Mexican food or margarita snob, I feel like I've had some amazing experiences back in California and I was curious to see and taste how La Slowteria measures up.In a word, fantastic! The mescal and tomatillo margarita was far and away one of the most flavorful, complex, and fresh margaritas I have had anywhere. All of the sauces and salsas I tried were top notch and I have never tasted a better habanero salsa -- roasted peppers in a light oil, good googley moogley! It captured all of the flavor of the pepper without destroying my mouth in the process, so easy to overdo it with habaneros.The scallop and avocado appetizer was incredibly fresh, perfectly prepared, all laid out on a bed of cucumber slices. I can't wait to try this place for brunch and dinner.Service was impeccable and very friendly, could have stayed there for hours.I will definitely be back and I think some places in California could learn a thing or two from La Slowteria.",5.0
"I REALLY wanted to like Slowteria.  There are very few great authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  Last night I went there for my birthday dinner after hearing very positive reviews. The drinks were wonderful. The presentation was beautiful. The food was a huge disappointment.  The duck in mole negro was almost inedible.  The duck breast that was served was 80% fat (not rendered, not crispy...just thick slabs of fat).  The mole negro was not a real mole negro, it was extremely sweet and thin and oily.  If you want a delicious authentic mole negro close by (and around the same price point), try Fonda.  My boyfriend had the fish in pipian verde.  The tilapia was very dry and overcooked. The rice and beans were very bland as well. The apps were ok.  Great homemade tortillas.  When some of the dishes arrived, they has swapped out ingredients or changed preparations from the way it was described in the menu.  We had the bean dip with cheese and chorizo.  Instead of chorizo, there was roasted pork.  It was delicious, but I wish I had known what I was ordering.  We asked the waiter to describe the guac with seafood.  He said that the seafood was grilled, but when it arrived it was just lightly cured in lime juice.  All of that is fine, I just wish we knew what we were getting in advance.  The server was a sweet guy, but never asked i we enjoyed our meal and could have been more knowledgeable about the menu. Maybe the chef was out of town this week.  Maybe it was just an off night.  Overall, I think the restaurant has a great menu and concept, the food is just really not executed well.",2.0
"La Slowteria is by far, my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. It's my go-to place for non pretentious, yet fine Mexican food. My husband and I have had both dinner and brunch here (several times actually) and have yet to be disappointed. We've made a point to try something new every time and everything has been delicious!!I planned a birthday brunch gathering in their back yard recently and the entire staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Everything from pre-ordering drinks/apps to the food and service on the day of ran super smoothly. My guests and I had a great time and left the place thoroughly satisfied!!Chef Hugo is truly a master at his craft. The atmosphere and decor is incredibly charming with it's exposed DIY herb gardens, spice racks, and Mexican nicknacks. And his commitment to slow, natural food, and composting is another added plus! If you can't already tell, we totally love this place!",5.0
"I was dragged here by my girlfriend. This place looks cute so my knee jerk reaction is to veto it. I was hungover so couldn't out up much of a fight. Let me tell you I'm so glad that I didn't. This place has amazing food. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. They have this habanero paste that will light your world and mouth on fire. It's truly amazing. The staff are great. They are super attentive and despite what some reviews say reviews very knowledgable. The true gem is the head cook. He typically will come over chat and/or send over a special dish. We have become regulars doth at May not be the case with everyone's visit bit this is such. A great great especially I'm a neighborhood saturated by people commuting to try our restaurants. This place hasn't been fully discovers because it's a bit off the beaten path. Luckily that keeps most of the commuting crowd scared away. The two block adventure from Buttermilk Channel is too harrowing for their taste. All the better if your willing to make the journey. If you are you will be well rewarded with great service, warm environment and mind blowing food.",5.0
"This is a great place where you can go and forget about the climate apocalypse for an hour or two. That is until the chef brings out the complimentary crickets in salt and lime stuff which TOTALLY reminds you of what you will be eating after the climate apocalypse. The waiter was a sport and ate mine for me. Super friendly staff who clearly love food and are very sweet and proud. Amazing food - really worth the trip past ninth street. I definitely recommend the sangria - amazing with big chunks of fruity fruits. Just for dessert I'd recommend crossing the street and going to Treat Truck. They haven't *quite* got the hang of this part of the meal. Everything else was really, really great, though.",4.0
"it's like going on a culinary retreat. absolutely delightful. we've been here four times now, while today was the first visit for brunch. freshly made juices, salads with jicama, guava, chirimoya, thinly rolled cucumber, radish, queso cotija and a raspberry sauce. every traditional dish has been re-examined, reduced to its essentials and then reinvented, resulting in a meal that is playful, surprising and full of joy. really loved it. the huevos rancheros arrived looking like two pancakes, neatly stacked - the textures were amazing, from handmade tortillas and vegetables that each have their own signature. the menu calls the chilaquiles ""el borracho"" - again, a variety of flavors and textures, which transform over time as they interact with the broth and sauces - not unlike a dish that's pleasantly getting more and more drunk (on flavor). there was an inside-out quesadilla with huitlecoche and nopales. it's obvious that chef hugo puts so much care into each dish. the love for the work shines through. you can taste it. our meal ended with a flan brulée made from corn, side by side with a coffee flan and a spoonful of cranberries soaked in mezcal. terrific. i'd go back just to eat the warm, handmade tortillas. they are perfect.",5.0
"I'm happy to have a new mexican restaurant in this neighborhood that hasn't really ever had a decent sit-down mexican spot. The chef is from Tulum, a little town that my wife and I have a sweet spot for (my little photo icon thing is from a trip to Tulum). He seems like a lovely fellow and their staff are all nice and friendly. That said, I totally want to love this place and heck, I gave it four stars, because I sincerely hope that things gel a bit better. A few quirks.- The drunken duck sandwich.This is a sandwich in a soup bowl. The duck was great, but the size of the bread for the sandwich part was super big. And because it was in a pool of broth, it was super soggy. Maybe I'm missing something here. It seemed like a waste of a nice piece of bread.- The deconstructed mole & duckI'm not sure I get this either. The whole awesomeness of any sauce is all the time it spends marrying the flavors together and making that whole magic. Breaking it in to the parts and then forcing the diner to somehow try to very unsuccessfully recreate the sauce... I don't get it. Duck with a mole sauce should have been a home run.- The shrimp & steak skewers dishInteresting presentation, but since this was all done on the skewers, everything is basically blackened - so, visually, not much happening here. Some guessing when biting into things. The shrimp and steak weren't especially flavorful. Maybe I'm missing something.What else..?Wine list - fun selections from Long Island and Mexico (yup).

"Food so good it makes your eyes roll to the back of your head and forces you to answer in grunts and moans when the staff stops by to ask how you are doing. That's what you're in for here.Dinner and brunch, once each with the boyfriend. We got different things to make sure we got to try more dishes and we loved it all.Forget what you know or you think you about Mexican food. If you care not only about the taste of food but also about texture, you're in for a treat. Every single bit is treat with subtly different flavors and textures.I wanted to lick my plate. I wish I had.Also, it worries me that the chicharrón gorditas were a special. Will they be there again next time I go for brunch? Will I ever be able to have them again? I don't know, and that makes me sad, but overall I'm just glad to have food this good so close by.",5.0
"Amazing neighborhood restaurant.  Food is great and menu is daring.  We had a bottle of wine which was great and reasonably priced. They played a great eclectic selection of music and the small space was decorated beautifully.  I left feeling as though I was on a Mexican culinary adventure, as every dish is exquisitely planned and unique.",5.0
Great food as many others have accurately described. Our only issue is that we sat down at 7:15 before the 8pm rush. We still took 2 hours to get through our meal...will go back for great food for sure.,4.0
"Just moved to Brooklyn from Los Angeles, and while I'm no Mexican food or margarita snob, I feel like I've had some amazing experiences back in California and I was curious to see and taste how La Slowteria measures up.In a word, fantastic! The mescal and tomatillo margarita was far and away one of the most flavorful, complex, and fresh margaritas I have had anywhere. All of the sauces and salsas I tried were top notch and I have never tasted a better habanero salsa -- roasted peppers in a light oil, good googley moogley! It captured all of the flavor of the pepper without destroying my mouth in the process, so easy to overdo it with habaneros.The scallop and avocado appetizer was incredibly fresh, perfectly prepared, all laid out on a bed of cucumber slices. I can't wait to try this place for brunch and dinner.Service was impeccable and very friendly, could have stayed there for hours.I will definitely be back and I think some places in California could learn a thing or two from La Slowteria.",5.0
"I REALLY wanted to like Slowteria.  There are very few great authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  Last night I went there for my birthday dinner after hearing very positive reviews. The drinks were wonderful. The presentation was beautiful. The food was a huge disappointment.  The duck in mole negro was almost inedible.  The duck breast that was served was 80% fat (not rendered, not crispy...just thick slabs of fat).  The mole negro was not a real mole negro, it was extremely sweet and thin and oily.  If you want a delicious authentic mole negro close by (and around the same price point), try Fonda.  My boyfriend had the fish in pipian verde.  The tilapia was very dry and overcooked. The rice and beans were very bland as well. The apps were ok.  Great homemade tortillas.  When some of the dishes arrived, they has swapped out ingredients or changed preparations from the way it was described in the menu.  We had the bean dip with cheese and chorizo.  Instead of chorizo, there was roasted pork.  It was delicious, but I wish I had known what I was ordering.  We asked the waiter to describe the guac with seafood.  He said that the seafood was grilled, but when it arrived it was just lightly cured in lime juice.  All of that is fine, I just wish we knew what we were getting in advance.  The server was a sweet guy, but never asked i we enjoyed our meal and could have been more knowledgeable about the menu. Maybe the chef was out of town this week.  Maybe it was just an off night.  Overall, I think the restaurant has a great menu and concept, the food is just really not executed well.",2.0
"La Slowteria is by far, my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. It's my go-to place for non pretentious, yet fine Mexican food. My husband and I have had both dinner and brunch here (several times actually) and have yet to be disappointed. We've made a point to try something new every time and everything has been delicious!!I planned a birthday brunch gathering in their back yard recently and the entire staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Everything from pre-ordering drinks/apps to the food and service on the day of ran super smoothly. My guests and I had a great time and left the place thoroughly satisfied!!Chef Hugo is truly a master at his craft. The atmosphere and decor is incredibly charming with it's exposed DIY herb gardens, spice racks, and Mexican nicknacks. And his commitment to slow, natural food, and composting is another added plus! If you can't already tell, we totally love this place!",5.0
"I was dragged here by my girlfriend. This place looks cute so my knee jerk reaction is to veto it. I was hungover so couldn't out up much of a fight. Let me tell you I'm so glad that I didn't. This place has amazing food. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. They have this habanero paste that will light your world and mouth on fire. It's truly amazing. The staff are great. They are super attentive and despite what some reviews say reviews very knowledgable. The true gem is the head cook. He typically will come over chat and/or send over a special dish. We have become regulars doth at May not be the case with everyone's visit bit this is such. A great great especially I'm a neighborhood saturated by people commuting to try our restaurants. This place hasn't been fully discovers because it's a bit off the beaten path. Luckily that keeps most of the commuting crowd scared away. The two block adventure from Buttermilk Channel is too harrowing for their taste. All the better if your willing to make the journey. If you are you will be well rewarded with great service, warm environment and mind blowing food.",5.0
"This is a great place where you can go and forget about the climate apocalypse for an hour or two. That is until the chef brings out the complimentary crickets in salt and lime stuff which TOTALLY reminds you of what you will be eating after the climate apocalypse. The waiter was a sport and ate mine for me. Super friendly staff who clearly love food and are very sweet and proud. Amazing food - really worth the trip past ninth street. I definitely recommend the sangria - amazing with big chunks of fruity fruits. Just for dessert I'd recommend crossing the street and going to Treat Truck. They haven't *quite* got the hang of this part of the meal. Everything else was really, really great, though.",4.0
"it's like going on a culinary retreat. absolutely delightful. we've been here four times now, while today was the first visit for brunch. freshly made juices, salads with jicama, guava, chirimoya, thinly rolled cucumber, radish, queso cotija and a raspberry sauce. every traditional dish has been re-examined, reduced to its essentials and then reinvented, resulting in a meal that is playful, surprising and full of joy. really loved it. the huevos rancheros arrived looking like two pancakes, neatly stacked - the textures were amazing, from handmade tortillas and vegetables that each have their own signature. the menu calls the chilaquiles ""el borracho"" - again, a variety of flavors and textures, which transform over time as they interact with the broth and sauces - not unlike a dish that's pleasantly getting more and more drunk (on flavor). there was an inside-out quesadilla with huitlecoche and nopales. it's obvious that chef hugo puts so much care into each dish. the love for the work shines through. you can taste it. our meal ended with a flan brulée made from corn, side by side with a coffee flan and a spoonful of cranberries soaked in mezcal. terrific. i'd go back just to eat the warm, handmade tortillas. they are perfect.",5.0
"I'm happy to have a new mexican restaurant in this neighborhood that hasn't really ever had a decent sit-down mexican spot. The chef is from Tulum, a little town that my wife and I have a sweet spot for (my little photo icon thing is from a trip to Tulum). He seems like a lovely fellow and their staff are all nice and friendly. That said, I totally want to love this place and heck, I gave it four stars, because I sincerely hope that things gel a bit better. A few quirks.- The drunken duck sandwich.This is a sandwich in a soup bowl. The duck was great, but the size of the bread for the sandwich part was super big. And because it was in a pool of broth, it was super soggy. Maybe I'm missing something here. It seemed like a waste of a nice piece of bread.- The deconstructed mole & duckI'm not sure I get this either. The whole awesomeness of any sauce is all the time it spends marrying the flavors together and making that whole magic.

"Full Disclosure: I'm a regular. This has quickly become my go-to spot for both upbeat and relaxing dining. At all hours, La Slowteria is one-of-a-kind, and each time I've gone I've received not only the warmest welcome but some of the best, cared-for food I've ever eaten. Chef Hugo is warm and personable, and he comes out of the kitchen to ask his guests how they're doing, how they like the food and his vibe is one of the warmest I've ever encountered in NYC. Ordinarily, a warm-hearted pleasant chef is only part of the equation, and were it not for each dish's carefully curated charm and flair, this restaurant might come up wanting. And yet, it doesn't. La Slowteria exceeds its own charm with great dishes night after night.  An example: tonight I went in and ordered steak & bacon tacos. I received 2 of the largest tacos I've ever seen. Before that arrived, Hugo sent me an appetizer. I've been here a lot, and yet I'm always surprised. Hugo is a true scientist when it comes to food, and you can see his impassioned flair in each dish. He often surprises guests with mezcal-soaked cherries as a digestif which are a total delight. The staff is witty and quick with a helpful recommendation. It's often rare to find a crew that gels so wonderfully in a restaurant, and yet everyone working here seems to really enjoy what they're doing, quite a refreshing shift from many other succulent dining experiences.",5.0
"I had dinner here last night with some friends. The food was delicious, fresh and inventive. I keep hearing that NYC doesn't have good Mexican restaurants and I admit that I don't know enough about real Mexican cuisine, but I thought this place was fantastic.We had an appetizer plate called La Chalupa that was really, really good. It was broiled shrimp and scallops with pico de gallo and guacamole with some crispy corn tortillas. It came with two sauces on the side: spicy and flaming hot.  The wine list is small but thoughtful. I had a really nice Mexican rose wine. The entrees we had were all really delicious. The food is a modern take on traditional Mexican food, and the presentation is also very nice.  I had La Musico, which is kind of a surf and turf -shrimp, steak and bacon -with sauteed vegetables. The only thing I would change is the hibiscus reduction on the vegetables: I didn't really taste it, so maybe there needs to be more on the plate.

"Firstly, I want to say that I love food! I love shopping for it, cooking it, eating it, and even cleaning up when it's all over. When my wife and I eat at La Slowteria, I get the feeling that they feel the same way about food as I do. Hugo and Stephanie are lovely, warm, welcoming and make us feel like a part of their family. The staff are friendly, relaxed, charming and we never feel ""waited on"", just taken care of. Honestly, dinner there feels like we just stopped by our best friends' house for a visit, and accidently showed up in the middle of an amazing three course dinner.It's difficult for me to describe the food at La Slowteria, because I have nothing to compare it to. It is definitely NOT like any Mexican food that I have eaten before. Hugo makes interesting, fresh, dishes which contain strange and delicious combinations of flavors and spices that just make us crazy!!! His Habanero sauce is addictive, and his home made, corn tortillas alone are worth the trip to lower Court St.Last night, my wife and I were treated to the nightly special, a green tomato based soup with beans, bacon, beef, fresh cilantro, onions and a lime wedge to squeeze into the bowl. It's the kind of thing that I could go back for day after day! Warm and satisfying comfort food that never feels heavy or over done. We tried to go there twice with our small daughters, but decided that this place was best kept to ourselves. We now use La Slowteria as the perfect excuse to splurge on a babysitter. We are real home bodies, but La Slowteria gets our tired, old butts out of the house, and into a little beach side restaurant on the coast of Mexico, where we can relax and indulge, get away from the pressures of city life, and enjoy good food, cooked with thoughtfulness and passion, that makes us talk about our next visit, even as we are walking out the door. Buen provecho!!!",5.0
"Update: Since I posted this review earlier today, the owner contacted me, which I very much appreciated. Like I said below, the staff are very friendly and they want to give you a great experience in their restaurant. To be fair, my coffee/price issues aside, I would try this place again, maybe for dinner since I already had brunch there and it seems dinner has received good reviews. The food was good and the environment was very warm and friendly. I really hope they succeed, since it's clear they value their customers. (Why am I even on Yelp at 11:40pm on a Friday night? Because I can't sleep knowing that I gave a bad review to people who are genuinely nice and deserve better than my pre-lunch hunger-fueled negative review. Oh, and a lifetime of Catholic-infused guilt.)Like so many earnest new restaurants, they try. They really try. And like my husband who tries to make the bed or put away the dishes..... it's a sweet gesture, but oh, look at you! You have thumbs and you're trying to use them. Like people! As my mom would say, god love 'em.Anyway, I came here for brunch a few weeks with a group of 6. I wanted to see if the new occupiers of the old Dubuque space would do them any justice. Nope. Food was good, not great. I would go back there again IF they didn't supremely annoy me with the fact that there are neither prices nor basic descriptions on the brunch menu. And THEY CHARGE FOR COFFEE BY THE CUP and nowhere on the menu do they indicate that. In fact, my friend asked the waitress (who I think might also have been the owner perhaps) ""Is this fancy coffee?"". Any person with a niblet-sized amount of social skills would interpret this is as ""Did you have to use an espresso machine or anything other than a regular drip machine to make this coffee and therefore it would be charged per cup?"". She said no, it was regular coffee. And when other wait staff came around to ask if we wanted more coffee, they never said, Oh by the way, that's going to be $2.50 for another cup of coffee. Between the 6 of us, we had about 12 or 13 cups of coffee. When we got the bill we were dumbfounded. And for some weird reason, we had three of those coffees comped. Maybe because they realized how stupid it is to charge by the cup and not tell their patrons? But not quite stupid enough to comp all but the first six cups? At that point I didn't really care that my huevos rancheros was actually pretty decent, a lot better than most places that end up making dog breakfasts out of it.I don't want to give this place two stars. I wish I could give it five, since everyone was very friendly and they clearly were trying to give us a great experience. But come ON! List your brunch prices, make it clear that you charge per cup, and give us a description beyond ""tacos"". Because I can imagine a lot of different tacos.",4.0
"Upping the ante here and adding the elusive 5th pointy, geometric shape to their rating.My wife and I went back last night (yes, because the food is that good) and brought my brother in-law along with his wife.  Magically the ""El Diablito"" came with tiny spoons and the portions were much bigger, not to mention that the layout was way easier to navigate.  Cheers not only on the upgrades but for taking the time to listen to reviews, speaks volumes of the management.  Also, and this is something i think all the reviewers overlooked, that dish is only $6!!!  Staying in the app department we also shared the scallops which were killer and the seafood guac, no plate went un-licked, really well done all around and again it was creative and a very new kind of delicious.For main dishes my bro-in-law got the stew and loved it.  His wife got the shrimp which she shared a bit of and it was just as excellent as the other dishes (my wife and I got the same thing as last time).We have not tried the desert yet, but I would assume good things.So, they have reached 5 stars in my humble opinion BUT I still stand by my other two suggestions and the reason being that I think it would help them generate more business.  You are going to get a lot more repeat and frequent customers who can come in and get some excellent tacos, guac, beer and tequila especially with more than a quarter of the seating residing at the bar.  Take Mesa Coyoacan for example, they have all the staples along side delicious more creative/fancy dishes.  I just think that as good as the food is at Slowteria people will come back and back and back for what they know and there is less of a chance of lines out the door for their more complex dishes regardless of how good they are.Regardless, if you are contemplating trying this place, just go, there is no way you will not be seriously impressed.",5.0
"This is my new favorite spot to eat out in NY.  Once we went for brunch and dinner in the same weekend.  I think my favorite so far (besides the amazing home made tortillas) is the Mexican steak (and I'm not a steak person at all!).  Very unique experience, as a Californian stuck in New York this place makes me very happy.  Mexican food is not just taco trucks or ""nachos with boneless wings"".  This place is very cool...",5.0
"The owner contacted me via Yelp to explain that the chewy steak was the result of not being able to get steak from their usual source due to Hurricane Sandy. Totally understandable, so I updated to a 4-star rating. Also sounds like they might be getting a liquor license soon. Looking forward to returning!",4.0
"A caveat: someone else might very well love this place, but it wasn't for me.The service was super friendly, and the food was quite good, but I simply dislike the kind of ""fine-dining"" experience where every meal arrives ""deconstructed"" into an vast array of tiny meat morsels and squiggly smears of sauce.  I can understand that the chef would like to present something different than the giant swamp of refried beans that usually passes for Mexican food here in the city, but any way you slice it a certain heartiness is central to Latin American cuisine.  Once you get past the razzle-dazzle of the plating, you're left with the realization that you've paid 20 bucks for an entree that is essentially 5 shrimp and a pineapple slice.  My wife and I not only left hungry, but after what we spent, feeling a bit cheated.  If the talented kitchen would concentrate less on presenting 15 unique elements per plate and focused instead on delivering the sumptuous, flavorful and comforting dinner they are capable of, this place would be a real winner.  Until then, I don't think I will be back.",3.0
"I almost never write reviews on Yelp, but I really want to make sure this place makes it and continues to put out such great, modern Mexican food!  My wife and I just got back from a long weekend in Mexico City, and this place brings us right back to the ""haute mexican"" food we had there. We were there today for brunch and had the scallop ceviche (fantastic - nice sea scallops, as opposed to the bay scallops you often see in scallop ceviches), the torta, which they make in a kind of ""French Dip"" style and which was FANTASTIC.  The broth it was soaked in was reallllly good.  And finally one of those handmade tortillas, fried, with slow roasted pork shoulder, a bit of guacamole, onion relish, cilantro, cabbage and radish.  It was tied together with a tomato-habanero broth which was just spicy enough.We just had coffee today, but they apparently got their liquor license recently so in addition to the fresh juices they now apparently have margaritas.  Oh and flambee mango with mezcal soaked cranberries and some sort of ice cream I believe was the dessert special - I wish we had room and that it wasn't 1pm.The few times we've been for dinner Chef Hugo hasn't disappointed either, but I'll leave that for a follow up review.",5.0
"Delicious, friendly, and unpretentious. I've eaten here twice now and everything has been so good I've wanted to slap myself.

"This place has great intentions! As for the execution, though, I am on the fence. The heart of the business is providing authentic, good Mexican fare in a slow food style. In practice, I will zero in on the deconstructed mole dish as an example of where it can go wrong. The dish centers around some duck mole (the sauce is thick and a bit gloopy), a dish of rice and pickled onions (?), a side of grilled onion and tomato (?), and the deconstruction of the mole sauce on the plate. Now, I've done my share of molecular gastronomy dining and am no stranger to ""deconstructed"" food. But when you put some dried chiles and a hunk of Mexican chocolate on the plate, it's different from other deconstructed dishes (lame example: a deconstructed breakfast sandwich of eggs and bacon and bread all separated out) because...you can't really eat all the components and have them be satisfying in and of themselves, nor can you combine them if you wanted to experiment with ""reconstruction."" And why two types of onion? And rice? There were, admittedly, delicious tortillas that came with, but they arrived when we were halfway done picking at the plate. And that's what you're forced to do with this presentation: pick. A nibble of chocolate here. Tucking the chile into a tortilla. Ignoring the pickled onion because there's already another onion and there's onion in the sauce. Slow food, to me, is simple and really invites the diner to linger and enjoy something balanced and harmonious. This dish left me scratching my head and a bit unsatisfied. Looking at the menu, I saw other presentation concepts and ingredients that, while authentic, made me think the resulting dishes would be fussy and esoteric. Maybe we just ordered wrong. The proprietors and employees were all super nice, it's right in my neighborhood, and I wish them well. But...and I'm sorry to say this...I just don't know if I'll be back until they get into gear.",3.0

When my wife and I eat at La Slowteria, I get the feeling that they feel the same way about food as I do. Hugo and Stephanie are lovely, warm, welcoming and make us feel like a part of their family. The staff are friendly, relaxed, charming and we never feel ""waited on"", just taken care of. Honestly, dinner there feels like we just stopped by our best friends' house for a visit, and accidently showed up in the middle of an amazing three course dinner.It's difficult for me to describe the food at La Slowteria, because I have nothing to compare it to. It is definitely NOT like any Mexican food that I have eaten before. Hugo makes interesting, fresh, dishes which contain strange and delicious combinations of flavors and spices that just make us crazy!!! His Habanero sauce is addictive, and his home made, corn tortillas alone are worth the trip to lower Court St.Last night, my wife and I were treated to the nightly special, a green tomato based soup with beans, bacon, beef, fresh cilantro, onions and a lime wedge to squeeze into the bowl. It's the kind of thing that I could go back for day after day! Warm and satisfying comfort food that never feels heavy or over done. We tried to go there twice with our small daughters, but decided that this place was best kept to ourselves. We now use La Slowteria as the perfect excuse to splurge on a babysitter. We are real home bodies, but La Slowteria gets our tired, old butts out of the house, and into a little beach side restaurant on the coast of Mexico, where we can relax and indulge, get away from the pressures of city life, and enjoy good food, cooked with thoughtfulness and passion, that makes us talk about our next visit, even as we are walking out the door. Buen provecho!!!",5.0
"Update: Since I posted this review earlier today, the owner contacted me, which I very much appreciated. Like I said below, the staff are very friendly and they want to give you a great experience in their restaurant. To be fair, my coffee/price issues aside, I would try this place again, maybe for dinner since I already had brunch there and it seems dinner has received good reviews. The food was good and the environment was very warm and friendly. I really hope they succeed, since it's clear they value their customers. (Why am I even on Yelp at 11:40pm on a Friday night? Because I can't sleep knowing that I gave a bad review to people who are genuinely nice and deserve better than my pre-lunch hunger-fueled negative review. Oh, and a lifetime of Catholic-infused guilt.)Like so many earnest new restaurants, they try. They really try. And like my husband who tries to make the bed or put away the dishes..... it's a sweet gesture, but oh, look at you! You have thumbs and you're trying to use them. Like people! As my mom would say, god love 'em.Anyway, I came here for brunch a few weeks with a group of 6. I wanted to see if the new occupiers of the old Dubuque space would do them any justice. Nope. Food was good, not great. I would go back there again IF they didn't supremely annoy me with the fact that there are neither prices nor basic descriptions on the brunch menu. And THEY CHARGE FOR COFFEE BY THE CUP and nowhere on the menu do they indicate that. In fact, my friend asked the waitress (who I think might also have been the owner perhaps) ""Is this fancy coffee?"". Any person with a niblet-sized amount of social skills would interpret this is as ""Did you have to use an espresso machine or anything other than a regular drip machine to make this coffee and therefore it would be charged per cup?"". She said no, it was regular coffee. And when other wait staff came around to ask if we wanted more coffee, they never said, Oh by the way, that's going to be $2.50 for another cup of coffee. Between the 6 of us, we had about 12 or 13 cups of coffee. When we got the bill we were dumbfounded. And for some weird reason, we had three of those coffees comped. Maybe because they realized how stupid it is to charge by the cup and not tell their patrons? But not quite stupid enough to comp all but the first six cups? At that point I didn't really care that my huevos rancheros was actually pretty decent, a lot better than most places that end up making dog breakfasts out of it.I don't want to give this place two stars. I wish I could give it five, since everyone was very friendly and they clearly were trying to give us a great experience. But come ON! List your brunch prices, make it clear that you charge per cup, and give us a description beyond ""tacos"". Because I can imagine a lot of different tacos.",4.0
"Upping the ante here and adding the elusive 5th pointy, geometric shape to their rating.My wife and I went back last night (yes, because the food is that good) and brought my brother in-law along with his wife.  Magically the ""El Diablito"" came with tiny spoons and the portions were much bigger, not to mention that the layout was way easier to navigate.  Cheers not only on the upgrades but for taking the time to listen to reviews, speaks volumes of the management.  Also, and this is something i think all the reviewers overlooked, that dish is only $6!!!  Staying in the app department we also shared the scallops which were killer and the seafood guac, no plate went un-licked, really well done all around and again it was creative and a very new kind of delicious.For main dishes my bro-in-law got the stew and loved it.  His wife got the shrimp which she shared a bit of and it was just as excellent as the other dishes (my wife and I got the same thing as last time).We have not tried the desert yet, but I would assume good things.So, they have reached 5 stars in my humble opinion BUT I still stand by my other two suggestions and the reason being that I think it would help them generate more business.  You are going to get a lot more repeat and frequent customers who can come in and get some excellent tacos, guac, beer and tequila especially with more than a quarter of the seating residing at the bar.  Take Mesa Coyoacan for example, they have all the staples along side delicious more creative/fancy dishes.  I just think that as good as the food is at Slowteria people will come back and back and back for what they know and there is less of a chance of lines out the door for their more complex dishes regardless of how good they are.Regardless, if you are contemplating trying this place, just go, there is no way you will not be seriously impressed.",5.0
"This is my new favorite spot to eat out in NY.  Once we went for brunch and dinner in the same weekend.  I think my favorite so far (besides the amazing home made tortillas) is the Mexican steak (and I'm not a steak person at all!).  Very unique experience, as a Californian stuck in New York this place makes me very happy.  Mexican food is not just taco trucks or ""nachos with boneless wings"".  This place is very cool...",5.0
"The owner contacted me via Yelp to explain that the chewy steak was the result of not being able to get steak from their usual source due to Hurricane Sandy. Totally understandable, so I updated to a 4-star rating. Also sounds like they might be getting a liquor license soon. Looking forward to returning!",4.0
"A caveat: someone else might very well love this place, but it wasn't for me.The service was super friendly, and the food was quite good, but I simply dislike the kind of ""fine-dining"" experience where every meal arrives ""deconstructed"" into an vast array of tiny meat morsels and squiggly smears of sauce.  I can understand that the chef would like to present something different than the giant swamp of refried beans that usually passes for Mexican food here in the city, but any way you slice it a certain heartiness is central to Latin American cuisine.  Once you get past the razzle-dazzle of the plating, you're left with the realization that you've paid 20 bucks for an entree that is essentially 5 shrimp and a pineapple slice.  My wife and I not only left hungry, but after what we spent, feeling a bit cheated.  If the talented kitchen would concentrate less on presenting 15 unique elements per plate and focused instead on delivering the sumptuous, flavorful and comforting dinner they are capable of, this place would be a real winner.  Until then, I don't think I will be back.",3.0
"I almost never write reviews on Yelp, but I really want to make sure this place makes it and continues to put out such great, modern Mexican food!  My wife and I just got back from a long weekend in Mexico City, and this place brings us right back to the ""haute mexican"" food we had there. We were there today for brunch and had the scallop ceviche (fantastic - nice sea scallops, as opposed to the bay scallops you often see in scallop ceviches), the torta, which they make in a kind of ""French Dip"" style and which was FANTASTIC.  The broth it was soaked in was reallllly good.  And finally one of those handmade tortillas, fried, with slow roasted pork shoulder, a bit of guacamole, onion relish, cilantro, cabbage and radish.  It was tied together with a tomato-habanero broth which was just spicy enough.We just had coffee today, but they apparently got their liquor license recently so in addition to the fresh juices they now apparently have margaritas.  Oh and flambee mango with mezcal soaked cranberries and some sort of ice cream I believe was the dessert special - I wish we had room and that it wasn't 1pm.The few times we've been for dinner Chef Hugo hasn't disappointed either, but I'll leave that for a follow up review.",5.0
"Delicious, friendly, and unpretentious. I've eaten here twice now and everything has been so good I've wanted to slap myself. As a novice foodie I've found myself unimpressed by restaurants that everyone else drools over - clearly I know nothing about high-falutin' cuisine, but Slowteria was my first near-religious food experience that made me understand what a great meal can be.",5.0
"This place has great intentions! As for the execution, though, I am on the fence. The heart of the business is providing authentic, good Mexican fare in a slow food style. In practice, I will zero in on the deconstructed mole dish as an example of where it can go wrong. The dish centers around some duck mole (the sauce is thick and a bit gloopy), a dish of rice and pickled onions (?), a side of grilled onion and tomato (?), and the deconstruction of the mole sauce on the plate. Now, I've done my share of molecular gastronomy dining and am no stranger to ""deconstructed"" food. But when you put some dried chiles and a hunk of Mexican chocolate on the plate, it's different from other deconstructed dishes (lame example: a deconstructed breakfast sandwich of eggs and bacon and bread all separated out) because...you can't really eat all the components and have them be satisfying in and of themselves, nor can you combine them if you wanted to experiment with ""reconstruction."" And why two types of onion? And rice? There were, admittedly, delicious tortillas that came with, but they arrived when we were halfway done picking at the plate. And that's what you're forced to do with this presentation: pick. A nibble of chocolate here. Tucking the chile into a tortilla. Ignoring the pickled onion because there's already another onion and there's onion in the sauce. Slow food, to me, is simple and really invites the diner to linger and enjoy something balanced and harmonious. This dish left me scratching my head and a bit unsatisfied. Looking at the menu, I saw other presentation concepts and ingredients that, while authentic, made me think the resulting dishes would be fussy and esoteric. Maybe we just ordered wrong. The proprietors and employees were all super nice, it's right in my neighborhood, and I wish them well. But...and I'm sorry to say this...I just don't know if I'll be back until they get into gear.",3.0
"overpriced margaritas, obnoxious folks behind the bar, weird thrown together look and random decor. the rice and beans had NO taste and our guacamole came in something no bigger than a shot glass. music variety could use improvement and to be turned down.the waitress got the one star for the place, she was lovely.",1.0

I absolutely love this place.We were outside checking the menu when the waiter came out to give us a run down of their specials.We picked up a friend nearby and the three of us ordered some of the most delicious brunch food plus one seafood soup we have ever had.After stuffing our faces with fresh delicious food we asked for our bill and were shocked that we were only paying $50 for 5 plates of food.This is definitely going to be our new brunch spot even though we live in bay ridge.,5.0
"I took my husband here for his birthday on Friday and we agreed this is our new favorite restaurant and intend to come back again and again. When we arrived we told the wait staff we were vegan and they offered to either make anything on the menu vegan, or to have the chef make us something else altogether. The chef came to our table and suggested sending out a variety of small dishes until we were full and told him to stop. Every single bit of food on our plates tasted very special and authentic. My husband is a trained chef and as you can imagine, we are challenged when dining out to find food that accommodates our dietary restrictions while being fresh, healthy,  well prepared, interesting and delicious (we've suffered through a LOT of salads and french fries...). We were so appreciative of them going above and preparing us a wonderful dinner. They even gave our son a few Mexican wrestler toys to play with while we were there - nice touch!",5.0

"We had a nice dinner at the space that took over Dubuque this past Thursday, a week after the hurricane.  We shared a salad with avocado, grilled vegetables, and cheese.  It was very tasty.  I had the duck soup which was warm and comforting and the perfect meal for a cold, nasty night following a nor'easter.  We were the only ones in the restaurant and I hope they pick up some business because the food was genuinely good.  The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is because everything is about 3-5 dollars overpriced. Unfortunately, that may be keeping people away.",4.0
"I'm going to miss Dubuque, I won't lie.  Their truffle burger was one of my favorite things on this planet.  But I dried my tears at Slowteria the other day and I was not disappointed.  Perfectly seasoned and thoughtfully prepared Mexican food!  The homemade, multi-colored, thick, crunchy tortillas will keep you up at night with cravings.  The portions are small and the prices are high, but maybe the impending liquor license will help regulate their food costs? (hint hint, I'm looking at you owners)  One tip on presentation, if you are going to do small portion sizes, get smaller plates.  They bring out a fist-sized meal on a massive, mostly empty plate that makes it look like they gave half your food to someone else.  Also, the coffee cups and other place settings are conspicuously from IKEA.  I'm all about frugal startups.... but come on.  But seriously, try this place.  What they are doing with the food is a-OK.",4.0
