"I saw this place a couple of times when I was in the neighborhood and finally decided to give it a try. It was was way past breakfast time but the kind man behind the counter served me breakfast anyway. I had the french toast with a side of eggs and bacon. It was absolutely delicious, starting with the the french which was served with maple syrup. The eggs were cooked just the way I like them and the bacon was amazing. Plus my coffee was served in a Homer Simpson's cup which I thought was really cool.",5.0
"Really good food and what's amazing is, it is never packed.  I think people don't come here because of the ugly furniture.  Plus, it's awkwardly decorated.  If I'm going to spend money and dine out, I want to go to a good looking place with my boyfriend and not somewhere that makes me feel uncomfortable because it's dead, dark like a funeral parlor or poorly decorated.  It's a shame because I know plenty of restaurants that do better but they can't cook as well.  However, the owner refuses to change or put any time or financial investment into it even though Yelpers repeatedly say the place is dark, drab, and awkwardly decorated so, more cafe's open up in the up and coming area that's better looking, and the business goes elsewhere.  If only the owner would turn up the lights a little, make the place look open and inviting, trash all the outdated black furniture and buy all new cheap table and chairs from Ikea.  Or at the very least, get rid of the black table cloths (no one uses table cloths anymore except outdated Italian establishments), give the black tables and chairs a fresh coat of paint that is NOT black thereby bringing the restaurant to life.  Even plastic table cloths would be better being that the black furniture with black table cloths even looks like it came from a restaurant that went out of business.Sunset Park is getting more hip. If you don't learn to embrace change, you will become extinct as in go out of business.  There is simply no reason to hesitate or be stubborn.  Do you want to succeed and have a thriving business? Or do you want to hang on and look like a dying one? Listen to your customers. They obviously care.  Read all your Yelp reviews. Have a paint party! You are not alone in this. Make it a community effort.Decor and ambience: 1 Star, Food 3.5-4.",2.0
"The food is amazing, it is the freshest. It tasted like home cooking too that it wasn't too much flavor. The music and ambient is also very soothing and relax. It is definitely one of the best place you can dine in Brooklyn.I used to like this place until one day, when I go back to eat. When I check out, I told them I have an expired Yelp deal, it was a $20 for $40 deal. It was expired long ago, so I was just going to use the $20 that I paid before to pay for part of the bill. Then all of a sudden the chef got angry at us. He said why didn't I tell him in the first place. I thought, does this matter? I am not using the deal, I am only using the value that I paid before ($20), and if I tell you early, you are going to serve me a smaller serving? He even told me to think about it if I did something wrong. So I told him, no, I really do not understand your view. I am only using the cash value now, it is just like cash. After that, he told us to get out. I was so surprised. I liked this place and their coffee.I forgot my glasses, and went back to get it, at least he didn't throw it away. Thanks for that.",3.0
"This place is awesome.Came here on a Saturday night,  the place was empty, which is a shame. This place is in every way amazing. It's BYOB ($5 corking fee), but they also have beer and wine now. So we enjoyed a number of bottles, yes.Pizzettas, had two with mushrooms and pepperoni, fresh and delicious. Filling too. Nice thick crust.I had the sausage and pepper ravioli, which were awesome. The filling also had sausage in it which made them extra delicious. The side of eggplant parm, is huge ($8) fresh cheese and marinara, yummy!Dessert! Fennel pie, sounds strange, but was awesome. Like one of the best desserts I ever ate. Also had frozen tiramisu and brownie. Highly recommended for authentic Italian food.",5.0
"So I tried a few more items on the menu since my last review. Literally everything I tried was great. It's so hard to find a good restaurant in Sunset Park, I'm really glad I discovered it.

"My boyfriend and I have passed by this place tons of times, and finally decided to grab lunch since it was a nice day. First off, the place was completely empty, which seems odd at first glance, but turned out to be quiet and cozy. It really is crazy how unlooked this place is, because the food is amazing. We had the tortellini and a personal pizza with sausage on it, and we were left feeling so satisfied and full. The chef/waiter/owner was hilarious, and a great person all around. I would definitely recommend to anyone that they should visit, because this place is truly a gem.",4.0
"Despite the great reviews, I still had to find out for myself. Seriously, this place will surprise the shit out of you. When you see the kitchen, you dont expect them to put out such good food. I really do love the setup of the dining / music area. You dont find stuff like this too often any more. Add in the fact that Brian and Michael are good guys and you got a recipe for a nice dinner. I'm looking forward to checking out their shows here one day. Definitely want to try breakfast, too! These guys are musicians AND good cooks? They probably got the ladies knocking down their doors. Keep up the good work, guys!",4.0
I ordered for delivery a caprese appetizer with chicken parmigiana and the pumpkin ravioli. They included some bread with our order free. The food was hot and delicious. The ravioli was very rich and creamy.  The chicken parm tasted freshly breaded & cooked. They used quality mozzarella on the chicken parm and the sauce was great. I look forward to dining in here soon.,4.0

"First off I have to start with the owner Brian! He is just a gem, awesome, nice, smart & great cook! Sounds like the perfect man to me ;) HAHA but lets get to the food part.When you first enter this place is might not be as busy as you think and the decor isn't all that up to date, old school style but its kind of like your having a dinner at your friends house so makes it more personal and homey feeling. Brian was great introduced himself, gave us menus and told us specials and his favorite type of foods and what other customers seem to enjoy most. We started off with Mac & Cheez which was a rigatoni pasta with a nice alfredo sauce and parmesan cheese which was great and we had small pizzeta which was like a deep dish dough and lots of cheese and sauce it was good too. Entrees we had pumpkin raviolis, so creamy and thick just love pumpkin you can't go wrong with that then we had sausage and peppers which were grilled so nicely and just nice taste ager each bite, the pork parm. was so good I enjoyed that a lot and just so different then the typical chicken and the pasta linguini had lots of meat sauce I loved that, we also had meatballs and chicken franchise and everything was just really good! I could not complain about nothing at all! Brian was just a beyond cook and his partner! You couldn't believe this man can make this all fresh by hand in his little kitchen in the back! The best part of the ending also was the dessert he offered on the house which was super nice and it was a chocolate cake which was to die for, super creamy and extra sweet right up my alley and a warm danish with sweet fresh raspberry filling and that was so good too. Everything was just worth the dime! He says starting in May he will have live musicians and bands come and play great wonderful music from classical to jazz to soul which sounds interesting and something I would come back for which enjoying me a nice home cooked meal! This is a great addition to my hometown and something new and I hope more people come by and give this place a try they won't be disappointed & i will be back!",5.0

We also ordered a personal pan deep dish pizza as a starter. None of the food disappointed.

I have been dying to try the pumpkin ravioli and finally got to order it this time. My date got the fusilli with marinara. I must say the chicken pizzola was really great, just the right flavor but a bit on the bland side for me. Salt shaker was on the side of the table, but my fault for not using it. My date said he liked his pasta, but I wasn't crazy about it either because there wasn't enough sauce for all the pieces. I am so sad to say this but my ravioli was good, but not amazing, like how I imagined it to be. Maybe i'm just not into sweet and salty savory combo ravioli. Bryan did come by to ask us how the food was and I didn't feel like complaining about such trivial things.

"The only reason I came here because I had a restaurant.com voucher that I purchased for this establishment.What I disappointment. The owner say that they are not a participate of that site because they never paid them....Anyway I ordered a hot chocolate (which he charged for $4 instead of $2.5) and a hot tea (which he charged $3 instead of $1.5).I do understand that this is a small business establishment and there was only one head cook (the owner) that also took the job of the waiter and an second assistant that  did the small things.The lights are too dim. It was too dark, I could barely read the folded paper menu that he give us.So this is what I ordered.1 - Seasonal Ravioli (cheese-filled delights that we swear by!)     7.50 This was the only item that I enjoyed having. The ravioli gets a star.2 - Three Chicken Frances succulent chicken sauteed in our lemon, butter and white wine sauce 9.95 Served With A Side Of Pasta for additional $3.95The chicken had WAY too much lemon juice!!! It was very sour. I just had a bite and gave the rest to my eating crime partner. The pasta was chewy and good, but too much buttermilk taste. The pasta gets a star.3 - Lore Fries our fries are freshly cut, seasoned and fried every day.3.95 Eight sticks of fries for $4????? Most of them were burnt.We waited about 30 minutes for the meal, we were done with our drinks and were still waiting and we finished the meal in about 10 minutes. I felt bad for the owner because he was the one that was cooking everything and writing up the check at the end. The total came out to $45. The portions are very small and salty to the price that was charged, but then again this is a small business establishment.We didn't bother using the yelp check-in free dessert because we had a feeling that he would say we don't participate in that also.

I'm sorry that it took so long for us to try it again. Now I'm a little more conscious of what I order, and I'm always surprised by how small the bill is.

"A diamond in the rough this place is, probably the last real good Italian in Sunset Park.  Brian, the owner is an amazing guy who very much enjoys playing music, good conversation and making outstanding food. The pasta is made fresh as well as most everything else on and off of the menu.  His meat sauce cooks all day and from the first bite, you taste the love he puts in it.  The pumpkin raviolis are the best I ever had, with the cream sauce...OH MY... WOW!  Eating dinner here is completely old school, all the food is fresh so it takes awhile, but so worth the wait.  Fresh and healthy ingredients are extremely important to Brian and it's noticeable in every bite.  The decor isn't the best, so don't expect cozy candle light meals.  It's BYOB which is great, there's no cork fee and if you feel like sharing which I usually do, offer Brian a glass.  Save room for desert, homemade as well.  Spread the word please, but not too much, he doesn't want it packed, this way he has time to make each dish fresh.  There's a rumor that Starbucks is inquiring about renting the space, hopefully it doesn't happen so get there soon or else you may be drinking a Tall double soy Makiado Latte then biting into an amazing homemade Italian Cheesecake!Cash only",5.0
I needed a place to chill after clinic and before a meeting so I came in from the freezing wind cold to have a cup of coffee and a slice of marble cake.  The place has quite the charm.  The server was chilling and jamming on his guitar playing some sweet tunes.  I would definitely go back and also try the Italian food to give it a more fair rating.,3.0
"Five stars? Yes. For the ambiance, charm, friendliness that lacks all and every whiff of ""customer care"" blandness...and for THE FENNEL PIE.  BEST PIE EVER IN LIFE.Yes, it's true. Story: I was coming from down the street, not knowing the neighborhood, I had seen a very, very small apartment and wasn't in the best mood. Ah, look at this old place, thought I, seeing Cafe Lore. What a sign it has. I'll go there; I can sit and get some cappuccino and nurse my sad thoughts about affordable housing.In I went even though the place wasn't really lit up too well so it wasn't clear from right away that it was open. However the door opened and I was greeted. I was dismayed to see banquet-style seating- it's set up like a family wedding place; long tables, tablecloths, nicely folded cloth napkins.... which is a bit disconcerting if you are used to (and so, looking for) Starbucks-style easy disassociation with anyone around you a la separate tables and seating. Anyway, i asked for a cappuccino and guy at the counter said their cappuccino machine was broken.ARGH.Whatever, I still needed somewhere to sit and think a second, and it was cold outside. Also, I could see they had some sort of cake, looked like pound cake, and I have a big sweet tooth. I ordered regular coffee and asked about the cake. Coffee was fine, not too memorable. But in telling me about the cake, the guy behind the counter mentioned a fennel pie.Fennel pie?I'll take it.What he brought out, heated up, with a big side of whipped cream, was the aforementioned BEST PIE EVER IN LIFE.It was more like a cake, cut in a pie slice formation. It was moist...it was subtly sweet, it has a crackly, glazed, flaky, soft top...I can't describe this pie well enough. It was AMAZING, like nothing else I've ever had. STILL, and WITH my sweet tooth: it was so rich and such a generous serving that I couldn't finish it. But please, PLEASE, go ask about it. I wish I could describe it better but truthfully, I've had nothing like it before or after. I would have taken a picture but I felt self conscious due to the old man sleeping sitting up at the table next to me. I felt that if he opened his eyes he would mentally scoff at the youngin nearby, taking a picture of food like they all seem to do these days.That sleeping man was my only other company in the restaurant, however due to the amazing pie and how it cheered my mood, I started chatting to the man behind the counter, whose guitar was propped nearby. Apparently they have music nights and it's probably a great time. The man was so nice and just added to the whole special vibe of the place. SO did the music from his ipod, which was classics like Van Morrison. YUM, ahhhh, lovely.This place is the bomb. Ask for the fennel pie!!Plus, it's quiet. So rare in Brooklyn cafes.",5.0
"Finally found something different in this neighborhood Out of all the mexican and chinese food place, this is the only place you can call dining. Price is not cheap for the area but seriously i will pay a few dollar more.Best night is on friday and weekend. other nights are quiet which is great if you want the place mostly to yourself. I got here on a week night. Owner is super nice to my date and i because we are friendly and tried everything he suggested.This owner has plans for this place and i can see it will expand more than it is.

"The only reason I came here because I had a restaurant.com voucher that I purchased for this establishment.What I disappointment. The owner say that they are not a participate of that site because they never paid them....Anyway I ordered a hot chocolate (which he charged for $4 instead of $2.5) and a hot tea (which he charged $3 instead of $1.5).I do understand that this is a small business establishment and there was only one head cook (the owner) that also took the job of the waiter and an second assistant that  did the small things.The lights are too dim. It was too dark, I could barely read the folded paper menu that he give us.So this is what I ordered.1 - Seasonal Ravioli (cheese-filled delights that we swear by!)     7.50 This was the only item that I enjoyed having. The ravioli gets a star.2 - Three Chicken Frances succulent chicken sauteed in our lemon, butter and white wine sauce 9.95 Served With A Side Of Pasta for additional $3.95The chicken had WAY too much lemon juice!!! It was very sour. I just had a bite and gave the rest to my eating crime partner. The pasta was chewy and good, but too much buttermilk taste. The pasta gets a star.3 - Lore Fries our fries are freshly cut, seasoned and fried every day.3.95 Eight sticks of fries for $4????? Most of them were burnt.We waited about 30 minutes for the meal, we were done with our drinks and were still waiting and we finished the meal in about 10 minutes. I felt bad for the owner because he was the one that was cooking everything and writing up the check at the end. The total came out to $45. The portions are very small and salty to the price that was charged, but then again this is a small business establishment.We didn't bother using the yelp check-in free dessert because we had a feeling that he would say we don't participate in that also. That would have been really awkward, that was how I felt with this place---very awkward.I was expecting a female mother-like environment here.",2.0
"We had our wedding reception at the cafe, and it was a wonderful evening. Thanks to the guys for making it so special.",5.0
"I was excited when I learned about this place a while back, since it's a different option for the neighborhood. The food I had delivered the first time was good, but between getting one of the ""special"" raviolis, a side of pasta with the chicken milanese, and an extra salad (for two), the tab was more than I expected and more than my boyfriend and I would want to order on a regular basis. I'm sorry that it took so long for us to try it again. Now I'm a little more conscious of what I order, and I'm always surprised by how small the bill is. Great food, great customer service, and nice extras like the bread that comes with each delivery. I wish Cafe Lore great success and hope they're in the neighborhood for a long time.",5.0
"Came here with friends for a post-wedding brunch. It smelled wonderful and was cozy and inviting. Unfortunately I only got to stay for coffee, but my friends loved their meals and couldn't stop talking about the delicious mac n' cheese dish they shared. I believe they got a variety of lunch and breakfast items. They were accomdating to our party by adding and removing seats as needed. Overall, for the neighbhorhood, it seemed more inviting and upscale than other establishments. I'll have to check it out again next time I'm in the area.The Yelp 100 Challenge-East Bay!",4.0
"I was raised in Sunset Park and I always had a soft spot in my heart for my old neighborhood.  On my way to work every day, I passed by this place, remembering it was the old Karate school ran by John the cop!  The place never looked appealing so I gave it no thought, not being sure what it was because when I passed by it was early morning and lights were off.  Anyway, when my parents invited me to this place, I was not keen on going but she had a gift certificate and I agreed to pay for whatever was over her certificate because I brought my husband and sons with me.   Like other yelpers, the place is not fancy, but it was homey.  What a wonderful time I had with my family.  Brian, the owner immediately introduced himself to me and my family.  Bryan was such a friendly host.  I am not used to that kind of treatment.  There was another gentleman there, who we didnt get to meet.  He didnt talk much either.  The food was absolutely fantastic.  It took alittle long but hey the food was fresh!  It had a homecooked taste to it.  First time I had pumpkin Ravioli.  It was delicious.  It wasnt doused with sauce, so the flavor was wonderful.  I found Brian rather comical in his approach of how he liked certain foods and how some of his clientele liked certain foods.  We shared stories about the neighborhood.  Thanks Brian for a wonderful dinner and am greatful for the opportunity to spend such a great time with my family.",5.0
The food is outstanding. No preservatives here. What a perfect meal to start our day exploring the city!,5.0
"A diamond in the rough this place is, probably the last real good Italian in Sunset Park.  Brian, the owner is an amazing guy who very much enjoys playing music, good conversation and making outstanding food. The pasta is made fresh as well as most everything else on and off of the menu.  His meat sauce cooks all day and from the first bite, you taste the love he puts in it.  The pumpkin raviolis are the best I ever had, with the cream sauce...OH MY... WOW!  Eating dinner here is completely old school, all the food is fresh so it takes awhile, but so worth the wait.  Fresh and healthy ingredients are extremely important to Brian and it's noticeable in every bite.  The decor isn't the best, so don't expect cozy candle light meals.  It's BYOB which is great, there's no cork fee and if you feel like sharing which I usually do, offer Brian a glass.  Save room for desert, homemade as well.  Spread the word please, but not too much, he doesn't want it packed, this way he has time to make each dish fresh.  There's a rumor that Starbucks is inquiring about renting the space, hopefully it doesn't happen so get there soon or else you may be drinking a Tall double soy Makiado Latte then biting into an amazing homemade Italian Cheesecake!Cash only",5.0
I needed a place to chill after clinic and before a meeting so I came in from the freezing wind cold to have a cup of coffee and a slice of marble cake.  The place has quite the charm.  The server was chilling and jamming on his guitar playing some sweet tunes.  I would definitely go back and also try the Italian food to give it a more fair rating.,3.0
"Five stars? Yes. For the ambiance, charm, friendliness that lacks all and every whiff of ""customer care"" blandness...and for THE FENNEL PIE.  BEST PIE EVER IN LIFE.Yes, it's true. Story: I was coming from down the street, not knowing the neighborhood, I had seen a very, very small apartment and wasn't in the best mood. Ah, look at this old place, thought I, seeing Cafe Lore. What a sign it has. I'll go there; I can sit and get some cappuccino and nurse my sad thoughts about affordable housing.In I went even though the place wasn't really lit up too well so it wasn't clear from right away that it was open. However the door opened and I was greeted. I was dismayed to see banquet-style seating- it's set up like a family wedding place; long tables, tablecloths, nicely folded cloth napkins.... which is a bit disconcerting if you are used to (and so, looking for) Starbucks-style easy disassociation with anyone around you a la separate tables and seating. Anyway, i asked for a cappuccino and guy at the counter said their cappuccino machine was broken.ARGH.Whatever, I still needed somewhere to sit and think a second, and it was cold outside. Also, I could see they had some sort of cake, looked like pound cake, and I have a big sweet tooth. I ordered regular coffee and asked about the cake. Coffee was fine, not too memorable. But in telling me about the cake, the guy behind the counter mentioned a fennel pie.Fennel pie?I'll take it.What he brought out, heated up, with a big side of whipped cream, was the aforementioned BEST PIE EVER IN LIFE.It was more like a cake, cut in a pie slice formation.

"After dinner, a bunch of us decided we didn't want to call it a night and instead we extended our evening by going to Cafe Lore for some delicious Italian dessert. Before heading there, we contacted the restaurant to see if they were okay for us to order dessert only and without hesitation; they were very welcoming and said it wouldn't be a problem!The restaurant itself was absolutely adorable. With cozy Italian décors, it was very welcoming and delightful. When we arrived, the owner even had the tables set up so we didn't have to wait. I don't know about you, but that was definitely good service to me!Their desserts were really delicious. We all shared and what stood out most were their cheesecakes and cannoli. The cheesecake was fresh and moist and not too heavy with cream cheese or overly sweet. It was made perfect! The cannoli were just as awesome. Instead of being pre-piped, they do it when order. This ensured a delightful, crunchy shell and fresh non-comprised filling that tasted wonderful and it made me happy!If you're ever around the area, I highly recommend this restaurant. They are attentive and the owner is super friendly. They even have live music on certain nights so if you're looking for a fun filled evening of relaxation and good food and a place that feels like home, I would definitely suggest going here!",5.0

I would go gluten free if it was not for their pumpkin and mushroom raviolis...OMG!!!! Yeah and the eggplant parm oh and the new waffle thingy with almond paste and just about everything. They don't use all that organic BS talk, they are old school but only use natural produce. You can sit there for hours and they will entertain you for hours with stories and stories and stories.",5.0
"3.5 stars.I've seen the store on the corner of 4th and 46th change from nothing to a martial arts studio to Cafe Lore over a span of twenty years; and based on previous reviews and conversations with the owners, the premise of the restaurant is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and it certainly adds diversity to one of the most diverse neighborhoods in New York City.The interior is decorated with childhood photographs, music equipment, other random pieces. While the photographs emanate nostalgia and a sense of homeyness, the rest of it feels kind of thrown together, and dulled by the darkness of the walls. Cafe Lore seemingly strives to become a neighborhood fixture, and to create fun nights, such as poker nights, comedy nights, and music from live bands. Unfortunately, while you may feel this inside, the message feels trapped by the walls. The exterior decor is drab and somewhat uninviting. It's kind of hard to tell it's a restaurant from outside, let alone an Italian restaurant, when you're just passing by.Nevertheless, once you manage to open the door and take a seat inside, you are warmly and politely greeted by one of the owners. The food is as Italian food should be - hearty, satisfying, and filling - as I remember from my ""adopted"" Italian family who made well sure I was stuffed - quite the cultural shock when they would get offended if I refused their offerings, as customary in my own culture. ""What do you mean you're not hungry?! They're just meatballs!"" (despite the fact that they were the size of my fist. In the end I settled for one, which still accompanied under-the-breath grumbling.)The chicken parm is pounded thinner than I'm used to, and while the chicken could be seasoned a little more, the delicious fresh-tasting tomato sauce makes up for it. While I prefer my chicken a little thicker (thus more tender and juicier), the proportions of sauce, cheese, and chicken are decent. For $4, you can add a side of freshly made pasta with your choice of sauce. The spinach fettuccine with garlic oil is a good light side to pair with the chicken. Again, I could do with the pasta being seasoned a little more.You really feel appreciated as a customer here. The owners share interesting stories with you - about their childhood, their inspirations behind their food; and they truly express their gratitude. Upon seeing one of us clean our our plate, he couldn't thank us more, and was so happy that we enjoyed our meal. You can tell they really care about their restaurant and their customers. So while the food is good, but not spectacular, the warmth and welcome certainly carries the ball here, and maybe it's enough to get people to come back.",3.0
"Food is pretty great! I must say I was very questionable about this place due to its decor and strange corner kitchen, however the meal itself turned out to be quite tasty for a good price. The owners were also very welcoming and friendly. They certainly welcome you. I'm not huge on Italian food due to the carbs but I like the idea that they will customize or whip something up for you, I think they really should advertise that more. Also some more creativity in the menu would be nice, especially for people who want delivery. Overall there are many aspects that make a great restaurant and keep people hurrying back! Although the food was great with a friendly staff, this place is nothing but full of potential. I believe this spot can very well become the greatest addition to the neighborhood. I wish the place was laid out to be more relaxing and welcoming. The owners would like to welcome everyone in the neighborhood to a cafe/lounge where they can stay a while. Sunset Perk which is also a moderately new establishment in the area actually seems to create that atmosphere by simply adding more relaxed seating and drinks! The place does truly lack in its atmosphere and ambiance. A great reference for this joint would be Bowery poetry club. The place could use some comfort and creativity within their decor, lighting and layout. What keeps me from becoming a regular here is the limited menu and the ambiance.",3.0
"I must say. Iv lived in sunset park for about all my life and I have never been to such a cool, relaxing and, homie café. The food is awesome in many ways for a café in this area.

I can sit down and relax on my laptop using the free wifi or I could have a nice chat with the owner or employees or have a cup of tea.

Cafe Lore reminds you of an old school Mom and Pop Italian restaurant. The decor is nothing fancy but this is not a place you go to if you enjoy something upscale. The menu is small since most of the food is made to order. The food is fantastic and priced very reasonably since everything is made fresh and usually by the owners themselves. My favorite part is the level of personal connection you feel from the owner and staff. Their charming demeanor and willingness to make you feel at home is a rare find in this city. I am very happy to have this place in my neighborhood.,5.0

"Nice.   Brian, Randy and co. have a great thing going.  For $11 I had a nice salad (with lotsa veggies, olives in a nice vinaigrette), DELICIOUS homemade ravioli in marinara sauce and some chamomille tea.  I'd passed by a couple times and had heard live music, so I brought my acoustic guitar.  Brian's a really good guitarist...very musical.  We had a nice little jam, and I hear that there might be more live music in the works.  Overall a great hang.  Bring the family, a date or come alone!",4.0
Wonderful owner who makes nearly everything on the menu from scratch off his age old family menu. Let's keep this joint alive and make it thrive in the neighborhood.,5.0
"Fresh homemade pastas, slow cooked sauces & delightfully quirky owner.  BYO.  Terrific neighborhood gem.",4.0
This place was awesome! I know it seems a little low end because of the paper menus and low prices but really its some of the best food I've ever had in Brooklyn. Best apple pie I've had hands down and when I was there they had chamomile ice cream made in house. The guys who worked there were super nice and funny. I will be going back there and bringing more people next time. I've already recommended it to several friends,4.0
"Ok so we walked in and almost walked right out, but didn't feel like searching for another place for dinner....and damn am I happy we stayed.  Please don't let the decor scare you away.  This little family run place has amazing food!  We had a variety of pasta dishes.  The meatballs were served on a platter large enough to serve a turkey!  They were amazing with a lot of pork sausage in the blend?  The pumpkin ravioli with cream sauce were also quite tasty!  The waiter/chef/owner is very endearing and fun to chat with.  He even brought us a complementary brownie dessert which was a great way to end the meal.  If you are expecting fine dining, go elsewhere.  If you want good, homemade italian food then make sure to try Cafe Lore.  OHHHH and its BYO which was worth at least another 1/2 star :-)",4.0
"Just like the menu says, ""simply delicious Italian food"" it was really good, clean / real italian food.   I'm so glad it's in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Neighbors, let's please keep this place in business!  We need more options than Chinese and Mexican in the neighborhood.  This is the kind of place where you can become a regular, the owner chats with you, and the cook will make things off menu for you. Make sure to try the fettuccine Alfredo and the mushroom ravioli--or whatever seasonal vegetable they're using that day.  Handmade pastas are worth the trip to Sunset.  And if you're lucky you might stumble upon some live music in this joint.",4.0
"Food was below average and service was slow, despite being only one of two tables in the entire restaurant.",2.0
"I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  Cafe Lore is quite the hidden gem! The owner, Brian, is fantastic.  He has a clear passion for true Italian cooking and treats his customers like family.  I see some people commented on the lack of ambiance/decor, but honestly, the atmosphere is like you've been invited over a good friend's home for a delicious meal.The food is incredible.  We had pumpkin ravioli which was out of this world!  Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had.  Then we had fettuccine with meat sauce.  They make all their pasta from scratch - the fettuccine was light and tasty.  We also had chicken (yes, we will not need to eat for a few days) in a white wine/butter/lemon sauce which was pounded nice and thin - delicious.  Looking forward to coming back for their live music nights and also to try out their brunch!",5.0
"This place is a gem! Really rare and unique kind of place. No frills - just really cozy atmosphere, delicious home-cooked food, and very warm, friendly service. We came here with a big group for my husband's birthday and they gave us good recommendations and made some great family style dishes for us to share. We had mushroom raviolis, pumpkin raviolis, meat raviolis with sausage and peppers, pork cutlets, eggplant parmesan, and salad. Everything was delicious. The prices were very reasonable, especially given the quality and quantity of food we got, and they went above and beyond with the service. When I mentioned it was my husband's birthday, they said they would have gladly made a special cake if they had known in advance. They had brownies and pound cakes, and whipped up a beautiful tiered cake with both of those and strawberries and cream, which was so good! It's a really authentic Brooklyn place that sometimes has music and other events - definitely worth checking out!",5.0

"The food is horrible. Meat overcooked, too dry to eat. Looks like it comes from frozen microwaveable food from grocery. The food doesn't come as it is described the menu.",1.0
"Great Italian-American comfort food, incredibly friendly service, and relaxed, at-home environment. Tried the shrimp in a cognac cream sauce, house made meatballs, sausage & peppers, and fettucine in a 7-hour slow simmered ragu. All were fantastic and very reasonably priced. This is an extremely welcome addition to the neighborhood.",5.0
