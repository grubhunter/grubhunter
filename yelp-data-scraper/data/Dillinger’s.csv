"They serve Russian food and brunch and its all fresh, healthy and delicious.They have a coffee drink named ""Krokodil"" which if you know is the name of the dangerous heroine-substitute in the drug epidemic over there but also a beloved Russian cartoon character. It was coffee with a ""Red eye"" espresso shot with condensed milk and it was really REAL good.*sighs* Someone must of had a dark sense of humor while conceptualizing this drink.",5.0
"Pretty good coffee preparations. Not chaeap, and can be slow.Tasty food but more in the snack size department and very slow. Only 1 dish is made at the same time so not great for couples.Free WiFi but laptops forbidden on weekends due to limitations in space. Nice decor",3.0
"Beveragewise, I only get iced coffee here but, while expensive, it's legit.Their donuts are wonderful. Muffins not so much.Their reasonably priced croissant egg & cheese sandwich is... well, I want to like it but it's somehow too rich and greasy for me to fully enjoy. I always end up throwing the other half away & wishing I'd gone to Dunkin Donuts for a breakfast sandwich that at least TASTES surprisingly more healthy.Other food options look and sound delicious but their price points have prevented me from ordering them so far (like, $9 for toast with avocado?!). Also, they're pretty flaky about posting holiday hours & tend to close unexpectedly during snowstorms, etc. (okay, the aftermath of this last blizzard) which really sucks when you're wandering around in need of coffee at 9am & then are met with a shuttered door, you know?All in all cool place - cool vibe, relatively friendly staff, interesting food options, but pricier than may be necessary and slightly unreliable for us coffee mainliners.",4.0
"This place is cute and I would probably be a regular if I lived nearby but this is definitely not the kind of place to travel out of your way to. It's small and cute, there's a Russian theme and a few Russian food items on the menu, and the coffee is good. The avocado toast was tiny and was not enough for a meal. The dumplings were good but if you're going to do Russian dumplings add some fried onions on top and maybe a side of sour cream. The buckwheat bowl with egg on top was my favorite menu item.",3.0

"Great place for brunch and getting some work done. There is a good amount of seating in the front, a honey comb shelf, lots of patterns for decor, and a long corridor to its back area. Plenty of benches outside as well! Especially gorgeous seeing the autumn leaves while I enjoyed my coffee and food.The buckwheat bowl is a bit pricey with the egg and avocado but worth it. Love the well seasoned mushrooms and cauliflower. My only complaint are the whole black peppers, which were too strong for me since there were already ground black pepper used for seasoning.They also take CUPS! Use the code 18RS4 for $10 off your first plan.Will come back for the food!",4.0
"Nice, airy coffee shop with plenty of seats and delicious eats.The iced coffee is great and they also make iced teas (with loose tea). Lots of flavors to choose from.We also ordered the avocado toast with egg (of course) and the poppy seed parfait. The avocado toast was great (we might have skipped the radish, but it was fine with it, too). I loved the parfait. Filled with so many blueberries and seeds. Just the right amount of yogurt. I could eat this everyday!Backyard seating and the cutest public restroom ever.",4.0
Avocado Toasts...super delicious ! I'm not a vegetarian but this meal is definitely recommend this for someone who's vegetarian or someone who enjoys trying something different. It is very filling & healthy ! Their hot chocolate is also amazing :-),5.0
"I'm glad I discovered this gem.  I was able to sit, in a relatively quiet environment, with free wifi, with decent coffee, with eggy, filling food, on a weekend, in a well-done enviroment with a great skylight that adds to the ambience.  And I was able to do all that in a run-on sentence that kept you reading it.I've only been here twice so far, but I found the staff friendly, the patrons quiet and respectful, and the atmosphere civil.  I can actually go there and read, whereas some of the coffeeshops in the area are hotbeds of nervous activity and noise.    If you want a neighborhoody, friendly place to come on a lazy weekend afternoon, this is a safe bet.  I hope more Dillinger's open up!",4.0

"The storefront windows that extend to an inclusive awning gives the place a good amount of natural light, inviting you to stay and work comfortably.  But the view of flat brick warehouse just outside those windows leaves something to be desired--for example, the planting of trees in the currently baren opposite sidewalk planters (the barista believed such improvements were eminent).  The millennial design solution of 'putting a bird on it' (see etchings on the windows) can only go so far to improve.  Despite this, the merits of the natural light, relative quietude of a side-street, and comfortable seating make the place hospitable.The buckwheat & kale bowl was satisfying nourishment for a hungry morning.  Well seasoned with soy sauce and oil (toasted sesame?), and accented by moist baby-bellas and lightly curried cauliflower florets. The sunny side up egg was perfectly cooked and provided the requisite pleasure of releasing the yolk to ooze over the contents of the bowl, slightly thickening the areas of the buckwheat it reached.  Fresh ginger would've been a welcome addition, but lemon wedge on the side let me brighten up the dish to match my particular level of morning dullness.The avocado toast that was well-labored over had an excellent choice of hearty bread w well-spread avocado, fresh sprouts/radish, and another perfectly cooked sunny side up egg.  Hidden chilis and a fresh squeeze of lemon were accents to this well-executed take on a healthy standard.I imagine both dishes could've been served popularly at the Source restaurant in LA during the dawn of the U.S. Health food movement.Overall, a reasonably-priced option for a healthy and thoughtfully prepared breakfast or lunch that'll keep you moving.",5.0

"The service here was comically awful. My friend and I came here on a Wednesday morning for brunch. The place wasn't terribly busy, a couple of tables were occupied with about 5 other patrons. The two people in front of us in the queue ordered coffee, and all the food preparation was done in the tiny area behind the counter. It took ten minutes for our orders to be taken, and the server, a girl in the impractical beanie hat (its summer and impossibly warm??) and ubiquitous glasses was doing e v e r y t h i n g. Not one other staff member to be seen. I waited for 45 minutes for the avocado toast, when it finally arrived it was no longer toast but some bland avo mashed into soggy, stingy slices of bread. Now, I can hear you asking - why didn't I go up and cancel my order? At the rate things were moving I figured I'd be waiting just as long to get my money back, and there was nowhere else nearby to eat. At one point there were 6 people queuing for coffee as the server made slow progress with her orders. Never once did she engage with the customers waiting on their orders, keeping us informed, she just ignored us. Half an hour after I'd finished my avo 'toast', my friend's buckwheat bowl was ready. We didn't get to eat together and instead exchanged looks and sniggers of disbelief at how ridiculous this whole scenario was. At one point the server disappeared downstairs for about 15 minutes, crashing about in the basement, which we assume was where this elusive buckwheat bowl was prepared. About 15 minutes after receiving my order a woman who looked like she'd just come from the gym gear turned up, who might have been the owner, she didn't apologise to anyone and just strolled behind the counter to catch up on the orders. I think she even took the time to prepare a plate of food for herself ??I don't know if this was just a reallllly bad day for staff, but judging by their rudeness, I'm not entirely convinced it was. The branding and interior of the restaurant was really confused too, and didn't mesh with the name.",2.0

"This place is cool, been going here for months. Food is delicious, music is cool and overall atmosphere is just awesome.Came in this morning and saw a huge crowd, apparently Dillinger's was hosting a shoot for some popular Russian food show? It was packed and the girls looked a little stressed, but the effort they put into catering to everyone was obvious.Had a short wait time for my food but didn't really mind at all; they were slammed and were clearly doing their best. Not to mention the food was amazing as always, kudos to their chef.",5.0
"Horrible seating, they forgot half of our order and we had to wait 45min to get everything. Avoid this place.",1.0
"The service here was comically awful. My friend and I came here on a Wednesday morning for brunch. The place wasn't terribly busy, a couple of tables were occupied with about 5 other patrons. The two people in front of us in the queue ordered coffee, and all the food preparation was done in the tiny area behind the counter. It took ten minutes for our orders to be taken, and the server, a girl in the impractical beanie hat (its summer and impossibly warm??) and ubiquitous glasses was doing e v e r y t h i n g. Not one other staff member to be seen. I waited for 45 minutes for the avocado toast, when it finally arrived it was no longer toast but some bland avo mashed into soggy, stingy slices of bread. Now, I can hear you asking - why didn't I go up and cancel my order? At the rate things were moving I figured I'd be waiting just as long to get my money back, and there was nowhere else nearby to eat. At one point there were 6 people queuing for coffee as the server made slow progress with her orders. Never once did she engage with the customers waiting on their orders, keeping us informed, she just ignored us. Half an hour after I'd finished my avo 'toast', my friend's buckwheat bowl was ready. We didn't get to eat together and instead exchanged looks and sniggers of disbelief at how ridiculous this whole scenario was. At one point the server disappeared downstairs for about 15 minutes, crashing about in the basement, which we assume was where this elusive buckwheat bowl was prepared. About 15 minutes after receiving my order a woman who looked like she'd just come from the gym gear turned up, who might have been the owner, she didn't apologise to anyone and just strolled behind the counter to catch up on the orders. I think she even took the time to prepare a plate of food for herself ??I don't know if this was just a reallllly bad day for staff, but judging by their rudeness, I'm not entirely convinced it was. The branding and interior of the restaurant was really confused too, and didn't mesh with the name.",2.0

"I was so excited when Dillinger's first opened. Since I live down the street it seemed like the perfect place to grab a cup of coffee and get some work done once in a while. But after some time I started noticing little things about it that really irritated me, and that feeling has since grown into a very large sense of resentment. Here are my reasons:1. The staff is lazy and rude. Nearly every time I'm there, the condiments (sugar, milk, lids, sleeves, etc) haven't been replenished. Meanwhile they're frequently on their cell phones or making conversation amongst themselves, and any request for something extra is met with an irritable look. For a while they had a punch card offering one free coffee after 10 purchases... when I would try to redeem mine, instead of being stoked that I was a loyal customer, they'd hand me my free coffee begrudgingly, as if I had just ripped them off... they eventually stopped offering it.2. The space is awkward. The front door opens the wrong way. The line is an amoebic mess. Getting to and from the condiments is always a trial in patience between customers trying to sit and eat and those shuffling around them to prepare their drinks. The back patio is the only decent place to sit. (Also, while I know its out of their control, a band recently moved in next door, and their crappy indie garage rock can be heard booming through the place at almost any hour of the day, which is especially annoying when they have their own music playing at the same time).3. The food is actually good. It's true, the food and coffee, despite being a little overpriced, is usually pretty good (hence the 2nd star). The only thing is, it's extremely inconsistent. I'm personally a fan of the buckwheat bowl, I get it nearly every time. And yet, it's always a little bit of a gamble. Sometimes it's spicy, sometimes not. Sometimes it contains the ingredients listed on the menu, and sometimes I can tell someone back there improvised due to a shortage of ingredients, throwing in some potatoes or whatever's around without ever asking or notifying me. The bowls are all different, so even the size of the plate changes. Basically, it's just a crap shoot.Overall, it's a place that genuinely has so much potential to be a great neighborhood hang. If only the staff didn't spend all their time commiserating instead of actually taking some pride in the place! Anyway, they'll probably be spitting in my drinks now, but I'm glad I got this stuff off my chest. Cheers!",2.0
"This place is awesome and you need to check it out for yourself. The shop itself is cute, but small with a very chill ambiance. The music is on point, perfect tunes for the work grind. The menu is written on chalkboards offering different types of coffees, pastries, sandwiches and so much more. I had a cappuccino and an almond croissant. The croissant was really sweet but delicious. It had a cinnamon and sugar crumble in the inside, which was a pleasant surprise. As well as powdered sugar and chocolate on the exterior. It was a sweetness overload.The wifi is pretty bad though...probably because there are a lot of people trying to use it at the same time. The hallway heads outside to a patio with a huge mural and shaded areas for you to sit and enjoy your food/company.",4.0
"I discovered this spot through yelp a few months ago, and have been dying to drop in. To my dismay, both the food, coffee, and atmosphere combined were disappointing. The décor has a cute and quirky Russian theme, however the tables and seats are so ridiculously tight, it was almost a joke. It felt like a game of tetris trying to get through the paper thin aisles just to sit my ass down. If you enjoy dining with a bunch of strangers like a can of sardines, this may be the place for you.I ordered a regular iced latte (nothing fancy) and the sandwich with kale, chickpeas, squash, and cheese on sourdough. I'm not sure where they source the coffee, but it was very bland. There is too much competition within the area for a better brew (Cafeteria La Mejor, Little Skips, Central Cafe, etc). Now for the sandwich. The portion of cheese was overwhelming. It was literally dripping out of my sandwich like melted white slime. It was hard to notice there were actually other ingredients inside. I even tried dipping it in the spicy sauce they serve it with, but it made little difference. I wish I could say the service made up for the lack of quality in the coffee/food, but it didn't. I'll never understand why people can't just try being a little more welcoming, especially in up-and-coming neighborhoods like Bushwick where competition is immense. I guess I don't fit the hipster criteria enough. Two thumbs down.",2.0
I went back a second time. The coffee is still terrible and tastes both weakly brewed and stale... And even with cold milk mixed in was scalding hot. The avocado toast was mehThe service was better than the first time I went in and they actually had music playing this time but due to the fact that their drip coffee was still just as terrible as the first time I can't give this place any more stars. I will only ever go here again to get a Dough Donut,2.0

"Come early before the rush and have a great brunch! I was concerned that the cafe-style sandwiches would not fill my belly and it might be annoying not to have table service but that was not the case. You order and pay at the counter and my bf said it was the most convenient payment process he ever experienced (they take cards).MOREOVER, the sandwiches were creative, filling and well-seasoned! We got the ham ann brussels sprout one on Texas toast and the squash, chickpea, kale and cheese on sourdough. They both had dipping sauces and were huge and well-priced at $6.50 or so. Much better value than Miles! Also tried the potato dumplings, which were fun to share. Waited maybe 10-15 minutes and enjoyed coffee during that time. SO FULL.PLUS obviously it's cute in there, they have some bar stool seating and 4 tops and a patio that I didn't check out. It started getting pretty busy by 11:30, so keep that in mind!",5.0

"Love this place. If you're from a Russian/Ukrainian/ Belorussian (whatever you relate to) household you would really appreciate the refined nostalgia that is being served here. The buckwheat salad takes me right back to childhood- cold winters and warm ""grechnivaya kasha"" (trans. warm buckwheat) except Dillingers takes it to another level adding a perfectly easy fried egg, warm mushrooms, winter root veggies and young onions for that extra something.  The pelmeni, hand made with love or so it seems, have a great sauce they are served up with. The menu has been created with much thought and tons of love, keeping the owners' roots in mind.  It's the food from my childhood refined for the adult me. I loved every bite...They also have a great selection of teas to satisfy the any tea fanatic and their coffee is outstanding: the cap is perfect- not too much foam, perfect milk ratio... But don't take my word for it, go get it! :-)",5.0
"I think I've been waiting for this place my entire life... I just didn't know it until I walked through the door.This place is as good as it gets. Quiet, adorable, a GREAT place to show friends - trust me, they'll be impressed. If I had to describe it in one phrase, it would be like a hipster take on Belarusian and Ukrainian cuisine. The music is fan-fucking-tastic (from The Strokes to Atmosphere and everything in between) but this place manages to still be relatively quiet. Perfect place to chill out with your laptop...and they have free wifi! They have this old world Russian kitsch vibe, which would be totally cheesy if this place wasn't actually owned by two young Russian-speaking women. One of them actually happens to be from my hometown in Belarus!I'd love to say that Ksenya and Masha are the sole reason for why I'll keep coming back to this place again and again, but the food is so incredibly delicious that even if they're not around, I don't think I'll be disappointed with the experience. There is no ""kitchen"" - what you see is what you get. The food is cooked right in the open and the presentation is impeccable. You can tell there is some serious love put into the food and the recipes here. Ksenya also told me that when the weather gets warm, they're going to put on shish-kebab barbeques and events in their (pretty big) backyard! I seriously can't wait!I highly recommend the Avocado Toast and the Mushroom/Potato Pelmeni. The tangy flavor of the toast sneaks up on you and pairs wonderfully with the multigrain bread. The pelmeni are...so delicate and tasty. Wash it down with a Cheburashka, which is basically a condensed milk latte.",5.0

The food is actually good. It's true, the food and coffee, despite being a little overpriced, is usually pretty good (hence the 2nd star). The only thing is, it's extremely inconsistent. I'm personally a fan of the buckwheat bowl, I get it nearly every time. And yet, it's always a little bit of a gamble. Sometimes it's spicy, sometimes not. Sometimes it contains the ingredients listed on the menu, and sometimes I can tell someone back there improvised due to a shortage of ingredients, throwing in some potatoes or whatever's around without ever asking or notifying me. The bowls are all different, so even the size of the plate changes. Basically, it's just a crap shoot.Overall, it's a place that genuinely has so much potential to be a great neighborhood hang. If only the staff didn't spend all their time commiserating instead of actually taking some pride in the place! Anyway, they'll probably be spitting in my drinks now, but I'm glad I got this stuff off my chest. Cheers!",2.0
"This place is awesome and you need to check it out for yourself. The shop itself is cute, but small with a very chill ambiance. The music is on point, perfect tunes for the work grind. The menu is written on chalkboards offering different types of coffees, pastries, sandwiches and so much more. I had a cappuccino and an almond croissant. The croissant was really sweet but delicious. It had a cinnamon and sugar crumble in the inside, which was a pleasant surprise. As well as powdered sugar and chocolate on the exterior. It was a sweetness overload.The wifi is pretty bad though...probably because there are a lot of people trying to use it at the same time. The hallway heads outside to a patio with a huge mural and shaded areas for you to sit and enjoy your food/company.",4.0
"I discovered this spot through yelp a few months ago, and have been dying to drop in. To my dismay, both the food, coffee, and atmosphere combined were disappointing. The décor has a cute and quirky Russian theme, however the tables and seats are so ridiculously tight, it was almost a joke. It felt like a game of tetris trying to get through the paper thin aisles just to sit my ass down. If you enjoy dining with a bunch of strangers like a can of sardines, this may be the place for you.I ordered a regular iced latte (nothing fancy) and the sandwich with kale, chickpeas, squash, and cheese on sourdough. I'm not sure where they source the coffee, but it was very bland. There is too much competition within the area for a better brew (Cafeteria La Mejor, Little Skips, Central Cafe, etc). Now for the sandwich. The portion of cheese was overwhelming. It was literally dripping out of my sandwich like melted white slime. It was hard to notice there were actually other ingredients inside. I even tried dipping it in the spicy sauce they serve it with, but it made little difference. I wish I could say the service made up for the lack of quality in the coffee/food, but it didn't. I'll never understand why people can't just try being a little more welcoming, especially in up-and-coming neighborhoods like Bushwick where competition is immense. I guess I don't fit the hipster criteria enough. Two thumbs down.",2.0
I went back a second time. The coffee is still terrible and tastes both weakly brewed and stale... And even with cold milk mixed in was scalding hot. The avocado toast was mehThe service was better than the first time I went in and they actually had music playing this time but due to the fact that their drip coffee was still just as terrible as the first time I can't give this place any more stars. I will only ever go here again to get a Dough Donut,2.0
"The Avocado toast was good. Grainy, healthy and hearthy. I added an egg to it to make sure I'd get full.",4.0
"This place has really nice ambiance and the backyard is so amazing. I thought that overall it was pretty decent, a few minor improvements could make the experience a lot better:The menu was on a chalkboard on the floor.You tip before you get service.. Which is a huge slam for employees who work hard and deserve more. The food was decent and the prices were right, I'll have to come back and try something else. The employees were also extremely helpful and sweet. If there was a 3.5 button I would've clicked that.",3.0
"Come early before the rush and have a great brunch! I was concerned that the cafe-style sandwiches would not fill my belly and it might be annoying not to have table service but that was not the case. You order and pay at the counter and my bf said it was the most convenient payment process he ever experienced (they take cards).MOREOVER, the sandwiches were creative, filling and well-seasoned! We got the ham ann brussels sprout one on Texas toast and the squash, chickpea, kale and cheese on sourdough. They both had dipping sauces and were huge and well-priced at $6.50 or so. Much better value than Miles! Also tried the potato dumplings, which were fun to share. Waited maybe 10-15 minutes and enjoyed coffee during that time. SO FULL.PLUS obviously it's cute in there, they have some bar stool seating and 4 tops and a patio that I didn't check out. It started getting pretty busy by 11:30, so keep that in mind!",5.0
Great spot with lots of character and very quiet. Took a little bit of time to get everything to us but in the end the wait was worth it. Highly recommended.,4.0
"Love this place. If you're from a Russian/Ukrainian/ Belorussian (whatever you relate to) household you would really appreciate the refined nostalgia that is being served here. The buckwheat salad takes me right back to childhood- cold winters and warm ""grechnivaya kasha"" (trans. warm buckwheat) except Dillingers takes it to another level adding a perfectly easy fried egg, warm mushrooms, winter root veggies and young onions for that extra something.  The pelmeni, hand made with love or so it seems, have a great sauce they are served up with. The menu has been created with much thought and tons of love, keeping the owners' roots in mind.  It's the food from my childhood refined for the adult me. I loved every bite...They also have a great selection of teas to satisfy the any tea fanatic and their coffee is outstanding: the cap is perfect- not too much foam, perfect milk ratio... But don't take my word for it, go get it! :-)",5.0
"I think I've been waiting for this place my entire life... I just didn't know it until I walked through the door.This place is as good as it gets. Quiet, adorable, a GREAT place to show friends - trust me, they'll be impressed. If I had to describe it in one phrase, it would be like a hipster take on Belarusian and Ukrainian cuisine. The music is fan-fucking-tastic (from The Strokes to Atmosphere and everything in between) but this place manages to still be relatively quiet. Perfect place to chill out with your laptop...and they have free wifi! They have this old world Russian kitsch vibe, which would be totally cheesy if this place wasn't actually owned by two young Russian-speaking women. One of them actually happens to be from my hometown in Belarus!I'd love to say that Ksenya and Masha are the sole reason for why I'll keep coming back to this place again and again, but the food is so incredibly delicious that even if they're not around, I don't think I'll be disappointed with the experience. There is no ""kitchen"" - what you see is what you get. The food is cooked right in the open and the presentation is impeccable. You can tell there is some serious love put into the food and the recipes here. Ksenya also told me that when the weather gets warm, they're going to put on shish-kebab barbeques and events in their (pretty big) backyard! I seriously can't wait!I highly recommend the Avocado Toast and the Mushroom/Potato Pelmeni. The tangy flavor of the toast sneaks up on you and pairs wonderfully with the multigrain bread. The pelmeni are...so delicate and tasty. Wash it down with a Cheburashka, which is basically a condensed milk latte.",5.0
Love! It's less crowded than Little Skips and there's a really pretty back patio. The Lappi is so effing good. Nice place to grab breakfast/lunch/study/work...your usual coffee scene. The people that work there have always been super pleasant too- even when it's busier on weekends.,5.0
"Went here for the first time today and loved it. Interior is well-lit and pleasant. Design is unique and well done. Patio is really spacious an well done but needs a good sweep and a clean! Had a bulgar bowl with asparagus, kale , egg etc and was really really good. Price was awesome too so I hope they keep it that way. It'll keep brining me back (over their neighbourhood competitors) Staff were ho-hum but gonna give them the benefit of the doubt that they're new and ""just warming up""",4.0

"I was disappointed that the chef was out sick that day and I couldn't try their brunch specials but I really loved that they were so accommodating, the cafe was warm and cozy, their chocolate donut was delicious, the service was good, and the food was really great! I had the Leppi I think? It was a ham and cheese on texas toast with Russian-esque dressing on the side and Brussels sprouts! The food is well priced and the interior decorations are well done. Definitely want to be more adventurous next time and get their palmeni.",5.0
