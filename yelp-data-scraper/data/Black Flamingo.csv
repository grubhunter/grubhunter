"I always appreciate a business that takes care of their customers and rights their wrongs. Bryce extended an invitation to me to come back and have dinner since I was not able to have it on my last visit. Service was very attentive and it was really nice to see management going out of their way for little ol me. I hate leaving bad reviews, because as a business owner myself I know how shitty people can be, and it can really hurt a small business. Food- Food was fantastic, but we definitely had our favorites. We could have had a hundred of those potato latke tacos, I mean, a hundred. The mushroom quesadilla was also delicious and equites good as well. Drinks- We both took down a fair amount of those blood orange margaritas and liked them so much we never switched to something else. Music- It can be eclectic, or funky, or different, there are new djs all of the time. Im not gonna lie though, Im still waiting for just one DJ to drop some bass down there. The music is always alright, but no one is fully cutting up a rug. And on a Saturday night, rugs need cutting. I dont need mainstream stuff, but just something with a little more energy and this place would be my go to. I never feel fully satisfied on the dance floor unless Im breaking a sweat. Thanks again Bryce for taking great care of us!",5.0
"My roommate and I went in for Happy Hour and it doesn't get much happier than at Black Flamingo! Champagne and Draft beer are $3 along with their tacos! I'm not a vegetarian, but my roommate is and the food was absolutely delicious! Zack gave us such great recommendations and Kyle was an awesome bartender. I see the reviews about people not necessarily enjoying the staff and in my opinion, they must have been at a completely different restaurant. The staff was fun and extremely accommodating. We haven't been downstairs yet for the dancing, but we're super excited to give it a try! We will definitely be back. If not for the amazing happy hour, then for the wonderful staff!",5.0
"I don't like shitting on restaurants but the experience I had here warrants a bad review.  I'd post a one-star here but I don't want this to look just like some angry rant.Where to start...The good: It's a cute place, definitely trendy, nice little dance floor, and the cocktails are pretty good.  The mediocre: The food.  I'm reading in some reviews that these are the ""best tacos ever."" I'm thinking these people never had a taco before.  My party and I had four of the tacos and they weren't anything special.  They didn't suck and there are some interesting options but I've had better vegi tacos before by a large margin.The bad: I had one of the worst service experiences of my life here.  I went here for dinner on a Tuesday and it wasn't busy.  The waiter approached our table and right away asked if we'd like to skip ordering drinks and just order food. That's not how dinners work, buddy.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  I'm watching the guy going back and forth from bar & kitchen to tables carrying one or two glasses at a time, doing things the slowest and least efficient way possible. He comes back with drinks and runs off before taking food orders.  When he finally comes returns our order is taken.We wait for our food.  As time goes by we want to order another drink.  He comes by, I order a drink, and he turns quickly to the bar, completely ignoring the other two people at the table who wanted to order drinks!  Like, are you just going to take one drink order at a time?  When I stopped him to say others here wanted to order, I got an attitude like, ""yea, I knew that, duh.""A FUCKING HOUR GOES BY!  ""Is everything OK here?""  No, how long does it take to make tacos?  He says it takes 5 to 10 minutes and I ask why we've been sitting here for AN HOUR waiting for our dinner.  Confused, he asks us if we received our order.  I'm sitting here asking why we've been waiting for an hour, there are no plates on the table, and there's no other waiter even near this section.  If you didn't bring us tacos how tf would we have received them?This guy checks on the order and realizes he never put it in.  So he does now.  Except that he fucks that order up.  He knocked some money off the bill but I'd much rather pay full price than not sit around for an hour, hungry, waiting for the food I ordered.  If my party were to bill for the hour of our time that was wasted, he'd be owing us.Long story short - you couldn't pay me to eat here again.  The food was disappointing and the level of incompetence displayed by the wait staff was unbelievable.",2.0
"I don't come to Brooklyn enough, but for a place like Black Flamingo, I would make more effort to get over! Black Flamingo is an interesting space, with a trendy lounge area/bar on the first floor, and a fun basement for dancing. Packed on a Friday night, but not uncomfortably so. Great drinks and intimate atmosphere upstairs. Sweaty and fun dancing downstairs. Everyone's happy!",4.0
"It's not everyday you're hanging out with the *right* people and they show you the *right* places, but last night was one of those nights.  You know you're walking around Williamsburg on a Sunday night, you know like people do.  And it's looking dead outside, and you're thinking man everything is buckled down for the night and nobody is going anywhere.  And besides it's Sunday night and...Then you walk into Black Flamingo.  At you know midnight because that's where you should be on a school night.  And you amble down to the basement, and Tim Sweeney is DJing & he's just killin it!  I mean seriously raising the roof.By 1am it is wall-to-wall saturday-night packed.  Did I mention it was Sunday night?  Well if you're looking for such debauchery, look no further.  At the bar you'll find two sixpoints, plus presidante, budweiser & a couple others, plus a long list of cocktails to suit your palate.  Now looking at the yelp page in the light of day I find they also have vegetarian food fare, and you an sure as heck bet I'm going back to get down & dirty with that!",5.0

"When people first here this place is all vegetarian, they are very skeptical and it takes a bit of convincing, but after they've tried this place they are absolutely sold. Black Flamingo WINS on so many levels. For starters, their happy hour is insane. $3 glasses of champagne and $3 tacos. (I forgot how much the beers are, but not much-- either $4 or 5 I believe.) And their tacos are so. damn. tasty. My personal favorites are the Sgt Pepper and The Palms. Most people love the Banh Mi and the Savory Shroom but honestly, allll of them are delicious!! Also, do not forget the Esquites and the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla. The quesadilla is so good that you'll definitely want to order more rounds-- I highly recommend to start out with that if you have a group of people since it comes with 4-5 pieces.Thank you for opening up 2 blocks from me! Also, big shout out to the bartender, Doug and the whole staff. They're great! :)",5.0

Food only:Pretty good vegetarian Mexican restaurant on the ground / top floor. The tacos you want are the Savory Mushroom tacos. All things here with mushrooms were highlights of the meal (tacos quesadillas). Happy hour is 5 till 8 and brings drafts from $7 to $3. I think.It's by all accounts a really cool bar/nighttime scene around here - worth a trip for either reason.,4.0
"On the ground floor, Black Flamingo offers an elegant and serene experience that intends to impress. This is an excellent date spot (especially, but not only for vegetarians) or for quiet conversation.But be warned, it is expensive! Every dish is 25 to 100 percent more than what you'd expect from elsewhere on Grand Street. You're not paying for the food, my girlfriend pointed out, but the beautiful dining area (with remarkably spacious seating) and impeccable service.So be it, I will keep Black Flamingo for special occasions.",4.0

"May adjust this in the future as I've only been here once, but so far so good. Came on a Saturday night. It was pretty packed and my friend and I got the last coat check space.

I'll be back, probably with a different group next time, as I don't think it was the right vibe for some of my more dive-bar-frequenting friends.",4.0
awesome so awesome. some of the best service i've ever received here in new york. definitely go here. food was amazing.  except the vegan creme brulee. it was frozen. but the waitress quickly remedied the situation and took a round of drinks off. no attitude or excuses. just amazing service and food. will definitely be returning and bringing friends,5.0
This vegan found his heaven. An all vegetarian menu (mostly vegan with everything else vegan adaptable) and incredible cocktails. The FOOD is some of the best small plates stuff I've had. All of the tacos we ordered were delicious and the mushroom quesadilla was incredible! I begged the waitstaff to ask the chef to come out to meet her. She did. Her name is Susie and she could not have been more humble. The decor is all champagne and cocaine but really the place has a chill and inviting vibe. I'm told there is a club downstairs. Go!,5.0
"Black Flamingo is a cool little basement club below a vegetarian restaurant tucked away by the Williamsburg bridge (only a few blocks from where yours truly resides). Not a place you'd just stumble in.The room was pretty dark so you couldn't really see anyone well. A bit too crowded when I arrived around 12:30 on Thursday night. Sound was solid, but probably only because the acoustics were good in the room which is essentially just a box.The Dj spun some disco, funk type music which I liked a lot. The crowd was good but the vibe was a bit weird in that you couldn't actually see the DJ in the corner of the room but everyone was still awkwardly facing him, which meant staring at eachother's backs. Also, compared to deep house for example, I think disco warrants dancing with your peers a bit more as opposed to zoning out by yourself.Anyway, music was good, i would come back and check it out another night for sure.",4.0

The tacos!  OMG the tacos! I came here for happy hour (til 8pm) and a friend and I got some beers and split 5 different tacos (each $3) these were vegetarian and typically this would put me off but they were so fabulous!! I'll be coming back over and over!!,5.0
"They really need to do something about the dirty mop smell. The cocktails were all too syrupy (I tried three). Other than that, great food and ambiance. Their pitfalls are so easy to fix! I hope they read this, as I look forward to giving the the 5 they deserve.",3.0
"I just found out about this place and decided to give it a try last night for dinner. It definitely did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I ordered several things to share and asked for everything to be made vegan (we were told the whole menu could be with the exception of the jalapeño pancakes, stuffed peppadew and obviously the quail eggs). We ended up having the esquites, the mushroom ceviche, the mushroom quesadilla, and the bibimbap and bahn mi tacos. We originally ordered the esquites in place of the ceviche because we were told it was not yet ready but they later brought out the ceviche to us anyway free of charge!As for the food, everything was delicious. The esquites was flavorful and spicy, the ceviche could probably have been mistaken for the real thing, the tacos were small but satisfying (especially loved the bibimbap), and the quesadilla...was mind blowing. If the server hadn't described it and added ""all vegan"" as she brought it to the table, I probably would have asked to be sure. I love that they offer cashew based cheeses and homemade hot sauce! The cocktail called Passing Me By is tasty and who can complain about $3 champagne during happy hour. We were also told they had a vegan dessert available but we were stuffed from all the food!Overall, we were impressed with the service, the ambience, the presentation, and most of all the food. Definitely try it out!",5.0
"What an interesting and fun new place in the neighborhood.  I am lactose intolerant and I love vegan food, so I was very excited to try the tacos. The Sgt. Pepper stole the show for me, the creamy sauce, the mushrooms and the spice were a match made in heaven. They also made me a vegan version of the hearts of palm taco and it was fabulous. All these years I have been missing a balanced taco because I can't have cheese or sour cream - but now I can have well executed and perfectly balanced tacos! My friend and I sat at the bar for happy hour, and our champagne glasses were always filled and the bartenders were delightful. Obsessed.",5.0

The price was a bit steep in proportion to the serving size, but taste and presentation were both top notch.  My partner and I ordered several of the tacos, and a mushroom quesadilla, all of which featured fusions of other cuisines such as Korean. The Bibimbap taco was a highlight, but each item tasted unique and delicious. The staff was also very down-to-Earth and accomodated a requested adjustment to the Cachaça cocktail with pleasing results.

I followed the directions, and then found the cool little discotheque area with a good sound system and good lighting as well. The crowd was diverse and most people danced as the hypnotic House and Disco-House music played. I decided to head home before I became too tired from dancing. Overall, I had a good time. The bartenders and bar back were friendly and helpful. The restrooms are clean and well lit. I may visit again.",4.0

"I decided to try this establishment when I received an invitation to one of their events. I was nervous I would not find it because there is no sign outside with the name up on the wall. After getting out of the taxi, I went in. At first I thought it was only a bar. After having a cocktail, I asked another patron where do I go to get downstairs? I followed the directions, and then found the cool little discotheque area with a good sound system and good lighting as well. The crowd was diverse and most people danced as the hypnotic House and Disco-House music played. I decided to head home before I became too tired from dancing. Overall, I had a good time. The bartenders and bar back were friendly and helpful. The restrooms are clean and well lit. I may visit again.",4.0
"The drinks were creative, and the food was absolutely amazing. My parents are vegetarian, and it can be a struggle to find creative vegetarian food. This absolutely fit the bill. Get every single taco.",5.0
"Absolutely love this place! I'm a vegetarian and so thankful for a bar/ restaurant like this! The vibe is great, people are so nice, drinks are delicious, food is impeccable, and music is awesome! Thanks for existing, black flamingo!!",5.0
Awesome dance space on the basement + delicious cocktails at the bar upstairs. I had a coconut water mojito- mm.,5.0
"And you said you are not vegetarian, well Black Flamingo brings it to another level. You won't miss the meat with the bold Latin flavors. New, clean, and friendly atmosphere, for your favorite drink and dance place.",5.0
Truly interesting vegetarian food and cocktails. Not like other places in the neighborhood. The  lentil pate was to die for. Had a scotch based cocktail that was also delicious. Staff was friendly!,5.0
"Wow!  This is the absolute best place in all of Brooklyn.  If you have never been.  Run!!! Incredible sexy decor. Amazing date and hang out place. Such delicious food!! Vegetarian tacos! I was obsessed with the palms taco and the edamame.  Even better, there is a DJ and dancing downstairs.",5.0
My favorite stop during a weekend in Brooklyn 2 weekends ago. Did not eat there but the downstairs was great. The sound system was phenomenal and the dance floor has a dark intimate vibe. Two DJ's played some fun house songs and some tasteful disco. I only drank cans of IPA for $7 a pop which is pricey but i guess that's normal out there.,5.0
I'm really surprised. Lots of hype about the sound...lots of hype about the food....my experience was really poor. The food came out dessert first and appetizers didn't even show. Tiny ass portions for too much money. It looks pretty but it lacks substance.,1.0
Great new spot! Very cool atmosphere and much needed addition to the neighborhood.,5.0
"I usually never prefer to eat at vegetarian restaurants and wasn't even aware that it was a vegetarian place.  To my surprise, it was quite delicious.  I had the savory shroom taco and the jam, and both were both flavorful, and for a second, I forgot that I wasn't eating meat tacos.  The edamame was really tasty too with tons of lime that balanced out the chili.  The service was also great and the staff was attentive.  I came for happy hour, and we were the first ones in the place, so I'm curious about what the service would be like on a busier night.  I would definitely recommend and will be returning in the future.",4.0

Amazing discovery! I came here with friends last night for a late night diner and drinks. The food was delicious (especially the Palms Tacos and Shaved Fennel Salad) and cocktails are great.,5.0
great dark atmosphere and a basement full of dancing. a bar back brought us a pitcher of water even though we didn't look wasted which was so kind I couldn't even deal,5.0
"The menu here is really impressive! If you're looking for delicately balanced, delicious vegetarian offerings in the unlikely setting of a loungey coktail bar. The food is incredible and the atmosphere is dark and cozy. You could easily stay from dinnertime to the wee hours and not even notice the time gone by. This place is enveloping, from flavor to aestethic. Highly recommend for vegetarian foodies and neo-cokctail bar afficianados.",5.0
"i love this place!  the waitress told us 2-3 tacos would be good per person, so we had 3 each.  i may be a heffer, but i could easily eat 5.  that being said, $20 for a great dinner isn't so bad these days.  we sampled the bahn mi, savory shroom, palms and sgt pepper.  the only one that wasn't amazing was the sgt pepper, for some reason the flavors didn't meld in a way that was flavorful like all the others.  we also had the crab cakes, which left me wondering how the hell they did that with jackfruit.  the drinks are also really well-made, especially the fez.  i will definitely be back, i only wish it was closer to me!",5.0
"Love these peeps. Catch ya'll soon. Guaranteed some of the best vibes and food in town. And to add on.. Dude did right on the deco decor, corner entrance and neon flamingo. Really well done.  ALL OF IT.",5.0
