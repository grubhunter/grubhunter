"These sandwiches are yuuuuuuuge. I wish I would have gotten the roast beef like I saw in the DDD episode and as immortalized in one of the greatest 30 Rock episodes of all time. Instead I got an absolute monster of a sandwich with just about every ingredient on the planet that inhibited my ability to walk. It was great though. When you see pictures of all those famous Italian New Yorkers (including James Gandolfini RIP), you know you are in an authentic spot. I will definitely be coming back.",5.0
"Brooklyn Sandwich tour.  Stop #2.  (A three part series)Defonte's was our second leg of the tour (see other reviews) and I was encouraged by Mike to try the roast pork sandwich.  The pork was sliced thin, topped with provologne, spicy vegetable salad, broccoli rabe, and the hero was then dipped in au jus.  From a flavor standpoint, this sandwich was a knockout.  The pork was delicious and the au jus was the perfect addition of flavor.  The bread was my favorite of the tour as well. I deduct a star from Defonte's because surprisingly this sandwich was the skimpiest of the three stops.  At a food shop like this, I've become accustomed to heroes that are thick and stacked with meat.  They definitely could've laid the pork on a little heavier.  In fact, the bread was probably the most prominent ingredient.  Disappointing.  Delicious.  But disappointing.",4.0
Awesome- the real deal.Totally satisfied my old fashion red sauce sandwich craving.Quality ingredients and nice staff. Get the steak with mozzarella and sauce sandwich. It's super messy but totally worth it. Ill for sure be going back.,5.0
"I enjoyed this joint.  Since 1922 in red hook bklyn.  I will admit, I felt like I was dodging bullets in this part of BLYN.  My mind said run, my stomach said stay.. Great sandwiches, better than the famous jimmys heros of sheepshead bay bklyn.",5.0

"Yes, Red Hook is far, but you can walk back to civilization after scarfing down one of the biggest sandwiches you've ever had.Defontes is as old school as it gets. It keeps strange hours. You have older Italian guys yelling at you. And the deli meats are fresh as can be, and they load em up.Friend and I split the Nicky's special and the roast beef/mozzarella/eggplant (doesn't have a catchy name). The Nicky's special was basically everything they could throw into a sandwich. Tons of veggies, eggplant, and Italian meats. I liked the roast beef better. Perfectly pink, and the eggplant added a nice texture.If you ask them what the difference is between the two sizes, they'll just tell you with a straight face that one is bigger. Get the bigger one. For $1 more, it's totally worth it.They also have a backyard with a few tables.This place is as Brooklyn as it gets.",5.0
"Worst eggplant parm sandwich I've ever had...no flavor, soggy, and for $10 a ripoff. My coworker had chicken cutlet w/peppers & cheese and said it was terrible...won't make that mistake again!",1.0
"I first heard about Defonte's when they appeared on DDD on the Food Network. When I saw the quality of the heroes and meat that they made, I just had to make a trip to Red Hook asap! I read a ton of Yelp reviews about how they were always crowded and that there was a line out the door, but during the few times I've been here it's been pretty quiet.The set up here is simple. Walk in, take a look at the selection of heroes they have on the wall and someone will assist you pronto. The great thing about the service here is (1) they have quite a few people behind the counter (2) the employees are very proactive and friendly asking if you need some help. As for what I've tried, I've ordered the large Chicken Cutlet and large Steak Pizzaiola heroes ($12 each) and both were ridiculously awesome!Both heroes were humungous and, if you're coming here to order one for yourself, it will probably take 2 sittings to eat each half. The chicken cutlet hero had 4 huge slices of fresh mozzarella laid on 4 pieces of chicken cutlets, basically enough to make 4 separate sandwiches! The bread, chicken cutlets and mozzarella were extremely fresh, especially the mozzarella as I could see it glistening in the sandwich. The Steak Pizzaiola was my personal favorite though. This was the sandwich featured on DDD and, if you order this one, you might never take a look at the rest of the menu again! The steak and sauces seeped into the crevices of the bread and were so flavorful. The steak was soft and just melted in our mouths. It was ... the perfect sandwich! And maybe the best one I had ever eaten! If I had to choose one sandwich to eat for the rest of my life the Steak Pizzaiola from Defonte's would be right up there!Also, don't bother taking your sandwich home because the chances are that the bread will get too moist so eat it on the spot inside.",5.0
"If you haven't been here get here asap that's all that really needs to be said. Every sandwich is mouth watering , made fresh and delivered with perfection...... not much room to eat inside but there are a few tables outside to relax and enjoy. I have been here quite a few times and have had almost every sandwich and have yet to be dissapointed. Whatever your in the mood for they have. If I had to narrow it down I would have to say the Friday special of shrimp parm and galamar on side would be number one,  the steak pizziaola would have to be number two and three would be the little Nicky. You will leave full, happy and wanting more",5.0
"We came here under the recommendation of Mr. Guy Fieri from Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives.  I assure you, even if you haven't seen the episode of triple d before coming here, you'd still feel a positive vibe from this deli.You walk in, and although it isn't the location where they started, you can still feel the history of this place! They've got collages, memorandums, photos of celebrities, newspaper articles of their successful establishment, and the guys who were there from the start and I'm telling you now... it made me really freakin' excited to order a sandwich! It's an Italian spot so I went with the Roast Beef, Fresh ""Muzzarelle"" & Eggplant sandwich served with salt, pepper and their delicious gravy!Long story, short - if you want a great sandwich, appreciate ingredients made in-house, and friendly staff, come here!",5.0
"I was looking for a good sandwich, so where better to go than one of the best sandwich spots in New York City. Everything about it is old school, classic, it almost takes you into a different time walking in.Onto the important portion now; the food. Now when you walk in, all over the front, and everywhere behind the counter is another sandwich they make, we went with the Red Hook Special 1/2 & the Chicken Cutlet Mozzarella 1/3. Pro tip, get gravy on whatever sandwich they put in front of you.The special, huge delicious sandwich. Chicken, bacon, their deli turkey, the gravy savory and unique to this spot. This is a days sandwich, as in, you may not have to have anything else after a half of this. The chicken Mozzarella we got a little smaller, and regrettably, because we agreed that this was even better than the special with the fresh Mozzarella and peppers, plus a nice dollop of gravy on top.The only thing I wish I could change is like any old-school place, it is a bit disprderly, I advise you know what you want before you even walk in.Returning soon!",4.0
"My boyfriend and I saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and we had to try it after seeing those sandwiches. We came in at around 8 on a Saturday morning. It wasn't packed, but it was definitely starting to get busy. Even with all the people, we didn't have to wait long. Those guys really hustle! There are seemed to be a lot of locals and regular there, which is always good sign. I got the Cuban (roast pork, Ham, melted Swiss and gravy - I didn't want any pickles) and my boyfriend got the roast beef with mozzarella and eggplant. I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but I can honestly say his sub was delicious! My Cuban was So. Good. I wish there was a bit more gravy on there, but that's fine. The meat wasn't too dry and the cheese was perfectly melted. Plus, the staff is great and make you feel right at home. (Or maybe just me, since I'm a native). They're easy going and will joke around with you! I will definitely be back.",5.0

Not the easiest place to get to.I was originally planning on going for the steak piazzola sandwich but at 1230 they had apparently already run out. Panicking I decided for the red hook special with mozz. First off the sandwich is huge, however it was sloppy, the ingredients were meh ( mozzarella was great), and overall it was definetley something you could get in Manhattan.

I would have given this place 5 stars if only it was closer to my house. I know that seems unfair but hey it's far from me. The decor is great.

The few bar stools were occupied, so after ordering, my friend and I had to take our food to her apartment to enjoy (be prepared to do the same, there was a steady flow of customers while I was there). The red hook sandwich was out of this world good. I requested this sandwich without bacon and that wasn't a problem at all (phew!). My friend had the eggplant Parmesan sandwich and it too was amazing. We're both average sized females and we were both completely satisfied after eating half of our large orders.

Took the sammie to the benches nearby and literally, ate in silence. Silence broken up with ""mmmmmm"".We asked for half a steak pizzaiola, and half special eggplant/meatball hero. They accommodated without a surcharge! We ate a few bites, switched. Ate a few more bites and re-switched. It was MIND-blowing. Yes, expensive; but huge portions, and you can taste that they nurture the gravy. I'm so happy right now.",5.0
"All I can say is that Katie R. is the reason why Yelp should screen their reviews.  DeFonte's runs at a different pace than Miss R's vain, cynical and somewhat misbegotten twitterfeed of a world.  D's takes their time, opens on their schedule - which is often, and posted online, ya dope! - and their staff will always take a moment to crack a joke or help you enjoy the moment.  And it shows in their sandwiches!!! Nicky Special, Roast Pork (always with that fried eggplant - perfection!!!) even their breakfast sandwiches - which may include about six eggs and a mandatory power nap in Ikea's sofa section nearby...In short, don't let people like Katie R. - who never even took the time to view DeFonte's schedule online - ruin informative and helpful reviews from America's best places to eat.",5.0

"Dropped $11 (not $10.95) for roast beef, mozzarella, & eggplant just before they closed @ 4 and it was a mad house. Really simple and satisfying, yet not much of a gut bomb, while being incredibly filling.FYI per Eater:""A first trip to Defonte's Sandwich Shop can feel slightly intimidating -- here are counter workers with thick Brooklyn accents, working briskly and managing the crowd by slapping an order on the counter and then asking, loudly, if they can help the next person. It's up to you to determine whether you're next; your fellow patrons don't exactly form an orderly line. And most of them seem to have known exactly what they want before they walked through the door: a carton of meatballs for this woman; a hot roast-beef sandwich with fried eggplant for that man. This saves them from reading the menu plus the handwritten items on bits of paper taped around the joint. Many people, you'll soon notice, are ordering the potato and egg, which piles skilleted bits of both ingredients plus mozzarella between two halves of a hero.

Most neighborhood regulars take their meals to go, but some stand at the counters, taking in old photos of celebrities while mopping their faces with piles of thin napkins. It's not hard to imagine dockworkers doing something similar decades ago. Defonte's is a multi-generation family operation. Nick Defonte, an Italian immigrant, paid $100 to buy the business in 1922. Back then it was a longshoreman hangout in Red Hook, a corner storefront that sold basic sundries, where workers would sit and play cards while awaiting a job assignment or to cap off a shift. For today's regulars, who work in nearby warehouses and at the artisan businesses that now call Red Hook home, Defonte's offers a glimpse of this neighborhood's past -- and a bite of a once prevalent lunchtime tradition that's fast disappearing.""",5.0
"Holy smoke! Best sandwiches in my life!! First time there and decided to go after seeing them in Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The Pizzaoila, the Nicky, the Jerry Lewis and the Dino. Best representation of good ol' Brooklyn. The owner seemed like a really nice guy who talked to all the regulars. Go! You will LOVE everything you order! Bought four large sandwiches and ALL are the best sandwiches I've ever had! Great location and call in your order if you plan on having a few during the lunch rush. They have a wall with lots of celebrities who have stopped by. If you're visiting NYC, I'm telling you, it's worth the trip to Brooklyn!",5.0
The staff is great to shoot the shit with.  They are friendly and will talk about anything.The food is top notch.  I don't think the price is too much because you can save one half for dinner.  Two meals for 15 bucks is good in my book.  The steak pizaoli is the best I've ever had.  I also enjoyed the mac salad.  Best deli I've been to in BK.,5.0

"GIANT SIGN out in the front.  It's huge.  I was walking to Baked to get my 'betes in and  on the way back saw the sign like it was the burning bush on Horeb.  Had to go investigate.  My co-pilot was skeptical, as it is in the middle of nowhere even in Red Hook but after a quick YELPENING to make sure all was right in the world we gave it a shot.  The sandwiches.  Man, the sandwiches.  Everything comes with fried eggplant.  I didn't like fried eggplant previously so I thought I could be in for a world of hurt.  Ordered it anyway because I was under the gun and the loud Italian man behind the counter did not seem in for a game of 20 questions.  It was awesome.  Outstanding.  One of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life.It isn't open on Sunday because they believe in Yoda or something, but otherwise this place is unstoppable.",5.0

"Husband and I made a legit trip for this. Trip as in google-ing ""that sandwich place from Triple D in Red Hook"", then reading all the yelp reviews, pre-deciding what to order, taking the Ikea ferry, walking in sketchville to find Defonte's on the corner. Took the sammie to the benches nearby and literally, ate in silence. Silence broken up with ""mmmmmm"".We asked for half a steak pizzaiola, and half special eggplant/meatball hero. They accommodated without a surcharge! We ate a few bites, switched. Ate a few more bites and re-switched. It was MIND-blowing. Yes, expensive; but huge portions, and you can taste that they nurture the gravy. I'm so happy right now.",5.0
"All I can say is that Katie R. is the reason why Yelp should screen their reviews.  DeFonte's runs at a different pace than Miss R's vain, cynical and somewhat misbegotten twitterfeed of a world.  D's takes their time, opens on their schedule - which is often, and posted online, ya dope! - and their staff will always take a moment to crack a joke or help you enjoy the moment.  And it shows in their sandwiches!!! Nicky Special, Roast Pork (always with that fried eggplant - perfection!!!) even their breakfast sandwiches - which may include about six eggs and a mandatory power nap in Ikea's sofa section nearby...In short, don't let people like Katie R. - who never even took the time to view DeFonte's schedule online - ruin informative and helpful reviews from America's best places to eat.",5.0
"This is the super secret teamster sandwich place showcased on 30 Rock.  I swear.  I know several ""teamsters"" that go here.

"Dropped $11 (not $10.95) for roast beef, mozzarella, & eggplant just before they closed @ 4 and it was a mad house. Really simple and satisfying, yet not much of a gut bomb, while being incredibly filling.FYI per Eater:""A first trip to Defonte's Sandwich Shop can feel slightly intimidating -- here are counter workers with thick Brooklyn accents, working briskly and managing the crowd by slapping an order on the counter and then asking, loudly, if they can help the next person.

While driving through Red Hook on business my co worker stopped here for a sandwich and I followed suit. Boy am I glad I did. The small Italian combo for 11$ really hit the spot. And even though it was a small the sandwich was still as large as a normal Subway foot long. But Defontes is in a much higher stratosphere that Subway wishes it was. I wasn't expecting much because their are so many terrible sandwich shops in NY that boast but dont deliver. But Defontes Italian combo of thinly cut salami paired with the right amount of vinegar peppers popped in my mouth. Other places drown their sandwiches in too much meat or weird not fresh veggies.

"Defontes must be doing something right. Established back in 1922 and still kicking out sandwich after sandwich. Knocking out the long lines that await this great sandwich shop. There're many specials to try but one classic for myself is the prosciutto w/ roasted peppers and fresh mozz. The prosciutto is always fresh never dry and stringy. The mozz is so fresh it is still wet when being sliced and the peppers o'man are they great. Excellent flavoring.

"Great little sandwich shop! I've eaten here about a dozen times now and I've yet too be disappointed in the flavor or quality of any sandwich.   It's also nice to have great staff- they are always positive and funny.  I only wish they had a few tables and chairs instead of just a small counter.  In any case, worth the trip for a great take out sandwich- best in the area by far.",5.0
"Sandwiches are good and mega huge. I'm giving them 2 stars only because the employees there don't bother to change their gloves after handling money.  When I addressed the issue with the management over the phone,they hanged up on me. Go enjoy the food but make sure they change their gloves",2.0
Sandwiches and hot food is out of this world. Came across this place watching double D with guy fierri and there sandwiches blow cherry valley out the frame in white stone. I travel from astoria to get this authentic marvelous and its as ginzo authentic as you can get it with the food and the old tradition decor. Definitely a must try if you never had it before,5.0

"Ok, walked in DeFontes like a zombie,walked outta there resurrected. Oh man, I had the roast beef,mozz with the eggplant....(1/2 size),with a ginger ale. Giant sandwich, fudgeddaboutit Subway, this is real gritty,blue collar,Red Hook Brooklyn eatery.  Sure there was a line. They sure move fast, the menu is right in front of you. The one I had was the roast beef mozz,with eggplant, all out freshly cooked,soaked in its savory juices. The combination of the roast beef,with the eggplant is flavorful. The 1/2 size is gigantic (that's what she said,lol) you can feed a family of four, or a single greedy guy like yours truly. Please,please,please come on an empty stomach, like I said the sandwiches here are not like the ones at Quizno or Subway. If you find yourself in Red Hook, stop by and have a huge appetite, stop here at DeFontes Sandwich shop.",4.0
"Defontes must be doing something right. Established back in 1922 and still kicking out sandwich after sandwich. Knocking out the long lines that await this great sandwich shop. There're many specials to try but one classic for myself is the prosciutto w/ roasted peppers and fresh mozz. The prosciutto is always fresh never dry and stringy. The mozz is so fresh it is still wet when being sliced and the peppers o'man are they great. Excellent flavoring.

"Defonte's is my favourite sandwich in NYC.  If you want mozzarella and cured Italian meats in your sandwich, though, I'd steer you towards Lioni's of Dyker Heights instead.  Defonte's have all sorts of monstrosities on the menu slathered in gravy and dripping with cheese, the glutton in me couldn't resist, but my wife was rewarded by exercising restraint and settling on a turkey and muenster special - delicious.  The bread is fantastic, so are all the peppers and vegetables - crunchy and not overly briney.If you arrive during peak, lunchtime hours, which you probably will, the place might be jammed with cabbies, truckers and contractors.  Don't worry - they're staffed appropriately and will get you sorted quick (friendly to boot).  The popular hip places in Park Slope like Bierkraft would have a line backed out the door being held up by some aloof stoner fumbling through the assembly process.",5.0

I am so angry at this place. I have been driving to Fairway for years and I never know this place was right in the neighborhood.

Great sandwiches ( roast beef was loaded with meat... Yes!!!!) Small place with no seats. In other words everything is to grab and go. A lot of ppl behind the counter so the service is prompt. Love that! Price range for a sandwich like my fully loaded roast beef is +\- $10. It's worth it though. It really is. I believe it's only cash. But there is an ATM available. I recommend it to anyone that does not want to sit and eat but is willing to enjoy on the go. :-),5.0

Amazing. I also love the Red Hook special: chicken cutlet, melted American cheese, sliced turkey, lettuce & tomato, and gravy. Unreal.

"To die for.  I'm originally from Boston where there are some absolutely amazing Italian sub shops and Defontes takes me back.  Serious old school Italian.  Best way to judge a sub shop- the rolls-- or as we called them in Boston, spuckies.  Defontes hits the mark and the subs are loaded.  I got the steak pizzaola- nice tender meat topped with fresh mozzarella and hit up in the oven.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the others, like the eggplant and the sausage.",5.0
Make sure you check ur sandwich before leaving drove 20 mins to get there ordered my sandwich drove back to work and opened my sandwich to find it was not even close to what I ordered. ...thanx for a waste of time and money and no lunchPs this is the second time this happened. ...everybody gets one....not two,1.0

"Oh my god! I love it! The guys are so nice there, and it's so well natured in there. Great food, great service, and extremely nice people. I go there before a concert and they tie my tie for me. They let me off 5 bucks because me and my friend were short 5 dollars. I go there a lot because of the great food, and if I ask them for the regular, they just give exactly what I like. There is nothing more they need to make it better. Perfect! Congrats Defontes !",5.0
"Excellent Chicken parmesan sandwich - great value as I purchased the 1/3rd and it was plenty for both lunch and a take home for the next day. I brought 8 other people to this place and they all commented on how great the food, service and value were.",5.0
"Can't give anything less than five stars!! These are by far the best sandwiches I have had in NY and maybe my favorite sandwich ever! Great food for great value! Usually the portions here are so small, but this will really fill me up. I don't usually even eat eggplant, but the fried eggplant in their sandwiches is really good. I really enjoyed everything I've ever gotten here and I really don't think you can really go wrong. My favorites are roast pork and broccoli rabe and the hot roast beef. Red Hook is tricky to get to, but really worth the visit for breakfast or lunch!",5.0

Went here with intentions of finally having the Steak Pizziola. To my surprise they were out of it. :(  I got the uncle Giuseppe and have to say it was soooo good. I opened it The wrapper in car just to take a bite and I couldn't stop. I finished it right there. Def plan on going back . They told me if I call ahead they'd stash some steak Pizziola for me!

"4.5 stars...DeFonte's has been a Brooklyn institution since 1922. This bare bones sandwich shop is mostly a take out spot though there is a small counter to stand and eat at if you don't live nearby. If it's nice out then taking your food to Valentino park down Coffey Street or the park outside Ikea are nice places to go. They've got well over a dozen specialty sandwiches or you could create your own. Sandwiches come in small or large and vary from $8-10. Even the small is about 8"" of packed deliciousness so a large could easily fill two people. Whether you go with the ham, roasted pork, turkey, meatball, chicken, or some other meat you know you're going to have a fantastic sandwich with fresh ingredients. I got the meatball parm which was absolutely huge and the juicy tender meatballs were among the best I've ever had, it was definitely worth the 28 block round trip walk from my place.",5.0

"Growing up in Brooklyn I pride myself on knowing a good sandwich. I have tried basically every well known sandwich spot in Brooklyn and more. This place goes right up there with johns deli and lioni as one of the best around. I've tried 3 different sandwiches from defontes and all are awesome. I had the roast beef, hot turkey and the grilled pork. I would have to say that the roast beef was my favorite but I would eat all 3 again with pleasure.  All 3 were complete sandwiches. The bread was great, the meat was flavorful and fresh, the au jus was juicy and best of all the fried eggplant was unreal!!The only downside to defontes was that it was in red hook. The neighborhood is nice and there is more and more to do there as the weeks go by but it is dreadful to get there by public transportation. This is a sandwich place that must be driven to unless you live close by. However these sandwiches are worth the drive!!",5.0

"Just had my first sandwich there, realized I left my wallet at home.  I explained and the man in charge ENCOURAGED me to take my $10 sandwich and come back and settle up later.  That's the sidenote, the ham,eggplant and mozz was the tastiest thing ever. It even recieved an unadvertized cup full of roastbeef juice poured over the top.  I got the smaller size and even that is big enough to share with your lady friend.If you're lucky enough to live near it, you know all about if you're lost on a bike ride and you see it you're in for a massive memorable treat.I of course returned to settle up later that day",5.0

"Yup this place is as good as what everyone says. Even better for me since I just moved next door, literally. There were many 6 foot gigantic subs all lined up and ready to go when I first stopped by. The sandwiches all seem to come with some kind of eggplant, i went with the fried variety and it was delicious. I ordered Nicky's Special. A combination of cured meats, provolone, fried eggplant and crunchy spicy pickled vegetables. Yum!I noticed big egg omelets with potatoes. It looked super yummy. Thought I'd save that for a later day. There are many more sandwiches to try here. Oh yeah, sizes are 1/3 and 1/2. Half of what? The 1/3 was a full one to me. My only gripe is the hours, M-Sat 6am to 4pm. I don't get it.Easy parking which is good cause there is no subway close by.

"Not enough yelpers have mentioned that a. this is in the middle of nowhere (ie. you need a car) and b. it's cash only. The moral is you need to make like a boy scout and be prepared to come here.

Otherwise, it's going to be a bit greasy when it hits your non-hungover tummy but if I could figure out how to make such a delish egg concoction at home, I'd be one happy camper. My boyfriend lectured me the whole way home for my choice and then ended up eating more than his alotted half. We were disappointed in the roast beef, egglant, mozzarella combo.

"Great place, but just a warning, don't try to eat here everyday unless you're a union construction worker!  If you're a normal sized person, a small sandwich will more than fill you up, the large you can split .Great meatballs, chicken parm, and everything else is great, too.
