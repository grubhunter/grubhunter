"I only come to Gowanus for pie (shoutout to Four & Twenty Black Birds) and I should only come to Gowanus for that reason... Bar Tano was dusky... I mean no ventilation at all. I came in around 5:00pm so it was dead. The waitress was nice but very awkward. I felt like she had no idea what she was doing. But I don't want to judge on that. So we quickly ordered a Moretti beer on tap and a Coke. We also got a margarita pizza to share. Both flat and the beer was very metallic tasting. Then the pizza came and it was... just a cheese pizza with some fresh basil on top... Seriously? I was excited to have a tradition margarita pizza (slices of sweet tomato, nice thick mozzarella cheese and a ton of basil) but I got a plain cheese pizza with some basil on it. Very misleading. I came in here for that one thing and ended up wasting $27. Two stars for the nice waitress and the pizza crust was on point. Other than that, won't be coming back here.",2.0

"Have been here for brunch and dinner, all food very good. Came once with a fairly large group (including one ten year old) and were well accommodated - all dishes were enjoyed, even the vegetable pasta (noodles made from zucchini or something?). Love how mellow this place is during the day, and how romantic and cozy it is in the evening (despite having been there with a group). Highly recommended if you are in the area and looking for a place to have a casual but really good meal or a quiet drink at the bar. Service is great, too.",4.0
"My friends and I had been curious about this place for a while and finally tried it.  The atmosphere is really nice and laid back.  We had the fungi pizza, papardelle in short rib ragout, trofie fresca (basil pesto pasta) and Porcini Cacio E Pepe (spaghetti with porcini mushrooms and truffle oil).  Everything was really good.  The trofie fresca was beautiful to look at, but the Porcini Cacio was the big winner as far as taste.  You may want to share an order for the table.  They have a nice selection of craft beers on tap and a bartender who can help select.  We will be going back again.",5.0
"Like other Peter Sclafani spots, the interior is comfortable and relaxed. A superb wine selection starts it off right. A bruschetta selection to start that was satisfying and exciting. Cacio e pepe pasta superb, and filling. Filled to the brim, there was, unfortunately, no room for the nice selection of desserts. Our server, Marisol, was cheerful, attentive, and efficient. We'll have many happy returns here, for sure.",5.0
"Crazy good prices ($3 olives and $5 bruschetta during happy hour? yes please!) and right by the Bell House, Bar Tano is a great place to stop for a bite or dinner right before a show. I had eaten a late lunch, so I wasn't up to much food, but I was charmed by Bar Tano immediately. The seating and the ambiance is strongly reminiscent of Paris (it's probably supposed to be Spanish but I've never been to Spain so this is my best comparison). We got there at 5:15 (15 minutes before opening) and we didn't have any competition for seating. I saw someone eating calamari by himself and reading a book - what a dream. I'd totally want to do that here, too. The olives were a bit strong for my taste (drenched in olive oil and some red pepper flakes), but I think they'd be good with a drink. The bruschetta (pomodoro only during happy hour) was very fresh and good.",4.0
Came in on a Monday night for dinner with a friend.  Tried three of the bruschettas which were all amazing and we split two pasta dishes.  Great selection of wine.  I would definitely come back!,5.0
"We stopped in here late on Saturday night for some appetizers and cocktails. There were no tables open so we sat at the bar, which actually was pretty empty. Overall, the atmosphere was great. It was dim, the music was pretty loud but we still were able to have great conversation. Definitely 5 stars on the atmosphere. The bartender was friendly and attentive. We didn't really ask for much so he was totally fine. I would say the food is a solid 3 stars- definitely not great. We got the bruschetta and burrata appetizers. Both were missing some flavor and were just too simple. We were pretty tired after some wine and gimlets and decided to get a pasta dish to go. The pasta was actually really good. The gimlets were amazing!Overall, 4 stars. Would definitely stop in for drinks but not the food.",4.0
Food was delicious. Had Salmon (which was yummy but not filling as the portion was small and no sides). My bf ordered a pizza which was also delicious and the size was sufficient to satisfy an appetite. The flourless chocolate cake was good and not heavy. Liked our waitress.,4.0
"Nice atmosphere, slow service, uneven food. The Trofie pasta was quite good as was the pear tart, and I heard good things about the Bolognese. However, I can't recommend the Nero (squid ink pasta with crab and tomatoes). It tasted overwhelmingly of scallions and the tomatoes almost seemed rotten.",3.0

"I don't like conflict. I like writing passive aggressive yelp reviews instead. Came in here with a friend and ordered the Tano Burger. When our food arrived, a salad came for me instead of a burger. The food runner brought the order back to the server, who brought the food to the table again. She says that I ordered the Tano salad, not burger. Starving and disappointed  at this point, I see the food in front of me, think there must have been a misunderstanding, and accept the healthier choice of a salad. The waitress suggested I add chicken to the order if I'm not happy with the plain salad ""ordered."" I agree.I'm eating the salad and then I remember..... the waitress asked me how I wanted my burger cooked, and my friend confirms that this happened. There wasn't a miscommunication, the waitress made a mistake. She made a mistake and then insisted that I was the one that made the mistake. I'm sitting at the table, thinking how I should speak up and not let myself be pushed over as a woman and get what I want out of life.  But I'm also thinking how I still have food coming to the table and that I don't want it tampered with if I make a big stink over getting the right item.  So, I got a salad instead of a burger.  Fine. Thanks for helping me make healthier choices. However, insisting the customer was wrong when you made a mistake, not acceptable. I'm now rethinking how I choose to be treated as a woman not just in restaurants, but in life. Thanks Bar Tano for encouraging this self-realization and personal growth.",1.0
"Came in here mid afternoon after dropping a car off at Enterprise across the street. The place was empty except one guy at the bar. We were acknowledged right away and seated and ordered.

"Went to bar tano on a Friday night with a friend. The service was quick. We got the house red wine which wasn't bad for what we paid. the waitress was very attentive and even explained more about the wine. I order the pesto pasta which was really delicious. The serving size was just right, I finished my plate and could definitely eat more because it was so good but at the time I felt satisfied without feeling too stuffed. My friend got the  rigatoni which was also really good. Our desert was tiramisu. It was so a typical tiramisu, not special but not bad. The desert was a bit overpriced. Overall the environment was nice, not too loud, nice dim lighting and a great place to get dinner. We had an event to go to at the bell house and it was a quick walk from the restaurant.

"The cocktails are great here as is the entire drink menu.  If I were rating Bar Tano purely on drinks, atmosphere, and service it would be a solid four stars.  Especially the service, the folks here are warm, funny, and exactly what you want at a local bar/restaurant that is sort of off the beaten path (in a weird Brooklyn way).  The food is good. It is solidly good. It's hearty and flavorful, although I feel it lacks a little finesse and sophistication.  That doesn't take away from the entire meal experience though.

"Excellent! My friend and I were looking for a place to eat before an event at The Bell House. We had originally picked somewhere else, but when we walked pack this place with its outdoor seating and cute red umbrellas and ADORABLE old-fashioned decor and ceiling tiles inside, how could we turn it down?The menu was great. The sandwiches and sides and salads all looked incredible (they also have pizza and pasta and bruschetta). I had chosen a panini, and then our waiter told us the special - butternut squash and coconut soup. YEP, I'll take a bowl! I also ordered a side of the house potato chips. You guys, they were SO good! They were ultra crispy and not greasy in the slightest! They were lightly coated in this great salt; it was flakes instead of granules. Nummy. The soup was sooooo good, too. Normally, butternut squash soup gets boring after a few spoonfuls, but this one left me happy till the last drop.I would absolutely recommend this to a friend!",4.0
"Updated review:  sticking to my low 3 star rating for this place.  I love the decor here and the service is very friendly, but quality and cost is where I ding them.  I came back here for dinner and decided to try a sampling of appetizers/salad/drinks.  3 appetizers, 1 salad and 3 drinks... $80 bill.  Really?On the food, if I had to rate it by the fig and goat cheese bruschetta, and the arugula and asparagus salad, it'd be 4 stars, but the calamari was just blah, and the sauce for it was too sweet.  The cocktails I had felt like it was just made with cheap liquor and packed with ice.  For $10, fail.The quality/value ratio just isn't there for this place.  For that price, I'm better off taking my money to Lot 2 or Talde.",3.0
"We kept driving by this place and finally hopped on the R train for a short ride to this gem. Service was incredible, staff is super nice and attentive. We ordered a whole bunch of things to try them all and we were so stuffed and wrapped everything up to have later. We got the tano salad (cranberries, mesclun, Gorgonzola, walnuts- yum), margherita pizza (amazing) pappardelle con gamberi (out of this world) and zuppe di pesce (all fish was fresh and the broth was amazing with the bread dipped into it). We got chianti and when my fiancé accidentally spilled it and broke a glass (silly) the staff was so cool, cleaned it up and gave him a little more in a new glass. They just won customers for life. Also we got espressos and the espresso panna cotta  (unbelievable!) We will be back!!",5.0
"I have a lot of respect for Bar Tano. They made the plunge and nestled themselves under the subway here on 3rd ave. The dimly lit ambiance and expansive window seating make this cafe a legitimate contender for a date spot. The italian fare ranges from salads, pizzas, pastas and entrees. All reasonably priced, I recall my bolognese dish to be around $15. It was quite good and had an authentic italian feel. Portion was average size which leaves room for a starter salad and dessert.

"I have been here a few times and I have enjoyed dining here every time. Ambiance is great, quiet and cozy. Outside seating is great. Great service.

"I would have given this place a 4 stars but sadly, I had to take one star off because I was disappointed in a crucial aspect of the restaurant--the food ! Came here on a Saturday night just past 7:30 for a joint birthday dinner for two of my friends. They take no reservations and we had 8 girls so I was expecting some kind of a wait, but surprisingly, they were able to seat us almost immediately. They just had to clean up the table . But I did notice the restaurant got pretty crowded pretty fast . The interior is lovely, our server was nice, and the drinks were one of a kind and yummy. I had the drink with St. Germaine in it . Very good, and definitely got me woozy. It seemed like forever until we got our food, but I think all of us were understanding because it is a small restaurant and we did have 8 girls.  But what made me really disappointed was the food . I got the pasta with shrimp, olives, capers, tomatoes,etc which sounded promising--but when I finally did get my food, it was so salty . The entire time I kept on thinking if they used half the amount of salt, it would have been a fine dish . I sampled my room mate's pizza with arugula, her dish was fine . I would give this dish a solid 4 star . Over all, this place has tons of charm, but  for me the food missed the mark .  However, I would be willing to give this place another try given the occasion .",3.0
"I was here on a Monday night, so it was realllllly quiet. Like I felt the entire bar could hear my conversation. Not preferable. I sat at the bar and since it was empty got good service. While it appears to be more of a bar, they have a full service menu and I saw a lot of takeout going out, which makes me pretty intrigued about the food. The prices were decent, 5 beers and a glass of wine were under $40, very manageable. While the beer selection was small, they had the basics including Guiness and the less popular Italian beer, Moretti. It's good if you are in the area, and it's only a block from the train.

"I've been going to Bar Tano for years now and my love for it just grows and grows. It has pretty much become a staple restaurant of mine in the past two years or so, before that I just went here and there and frequented Bar Toto more often. Bar Tano has a very intimate, low key, and at the same time, fun vibe. Great brunch and lunch - dinner is OK - the menu doesn't change but they do have specials which are always a nice way to change things up. Their cocktails are good as well and moderately priced - Tano Martini is totally worth a try!",4.0

"Excellent! My friend and I were looking for a place to eat before an event at The Bell House. We had originally picked somewhere else, but when we walked pack this place with its outdoor seating and cute red umbrellas and ADORABLE old-fashioned decor and ceiling tiles inside, how could we turn it down?The menu was great. The sandwiches and sides and salads all looked incredible (they also have pizza and pasta and bruschetta). I had chosen a panini, and then our waiter told us the special - butternut squash and coconut soup. YEP, I'll take a bowl! I also ordered a side of the house potato chips. You guys, they were SO good! They were ultra crispy and not greasy in the slightest! They were lightly coated in this great salt; it was flakes instead of granules. Nummy. The soup was sooooo good, too. Normally, butternut squash soup gets boring after a few spoonfuls, but this one left me happy till the last drop.I would absolutely recommend this to a friend!",4.0
"Updated review:  sticking to my low 3 star rating for this place.  I love the decor here and the service is very friendly, but quality and cost is where I ding them.  I came back here for dinner and decided to try a sampling of appetizers/salad/drinks.  3 appetizers, 1 salad and 3 drinks... $80 bill.  Really?On the food, if I had to rate it by the fig and goat cheese bruschetta, and the arugula and asparagus salad, it'd be 4 stars, but the calamari was just blah, and the sauce for it was too sweet.  The cocktails I had felt like it was just made with cheap liquor and packed with ice.  For $10, fail.The quality/value ratio just isn't there for this place.  For that price, I'm better off taking my money to Lot 2 or Talde.",3.0
"We kept driving by this place and finally hopped on the R train for a short ride to this gem. Service was incredible, staff is super nice and attentive. We ordered a whole bunch of things to try them all and we were so stuffed and wrapped everything up to have later. We got the tano salad (cranberries, mesclun, Gorgonzola, walnuts- yum), margherita pizza (amazing) pappardelle con gamberi (out of this world) and zuppe di pesce (all fish was fresh and the broth was amazing with the bread dipped into it). We got chianti and when my fiancé accidentally spilled it and broke a glass (silly) the staff was so cool, cleaned it up and gave him a little more in a new glass. They just won customers for life. Also we got espressos and the espresso panna cotta  (unbelievable!) We will be back!!",5.0
"I have a lot of respect for Bar Tano. They made the plunge and nestled themselves under the subway here on 3rd ave. The dimly lit ambiance and expansive window seating make this cafe a legitimate contender for a date spot. The italian fare ranges from salads, pizzas, pastas and entrees. All reasonably priced, I recall my bolognese dish to be around $15. It was quite good and had an authentic italian feel. Portion was average size which leaves room for a starter salad and dessert. The mussels are also quite good here along with the broth they are served in. Our server Danny was attentive and eased our meal along at a comfortable pace.",4.0

We ordered a Tano salad to share - a great size for $9, and each got a pasta plate. Her basil-pesto penne was lovely and had a dollop of fresh cool ricotta on top. Really neat serving idea. My carbonara was done with a fat kind I'd spaghetti I had never had before, brucetti or something like that. The meat was salty and in tiny chunks, and the peas were so perfectly cooked that they popped open in your bite.

"I used to love this place, until the prices increased. The food is still great, but charging more, by about 40% on some items, for the same exact thing, is not worth it.Yes, the economy is not lending a helpful hand to small businesses, but increasing prices is only going to deter some people (such as myself) from coming back. Don't hate me, but price increases on a certain scale do not justify the ""value"" of a food item. I know business needs to survive, but at least offer special discounts on certain days, to keep customers such as myself happy.Anyway, about the food. Since that's the point.Pizza - always good. Thin crust, fresh tasting sauce, little strips of basil.Panini - also really good.House fries - tasty and delicious, they're potato chips, not fries, if that's your thing. (I love them)Bruschetta - great, but too expensive to want them anymore.",3.0
"Don""t do it!!! Do not eat here- here""a why.Friday night- 7pm lively bar and inside restaurant scene. Noise level exuberant but not painful so far so good. Got a table pretty quickly- and pretty quickly realized one waitress for all of inside tables. Finally get a menu,  waitress abruptly - after 10-15 take bar menu. 15-20 mins - later takes food menu- still no drinks. Drinks (white sangria- pretty good) finally comes.  Food comes 20-25 mins later. This is what 3 big eaters had: meatball appetizer (so so on mushy polenta) and mussels. This is where big problem was- smelled AWFUL- they smelled ""off"" when she came back we said they smelled bad- she says ""what do you expect from mussels?"" They ""smell that way"" really??? I think health dept would take exception to that!!  We sent back. Table now smelled bad. Dinner orders came. One order bucatini and broccoli rabe ok), one chicken saltimbocca  (awful, dry, tasteless no relation  to real dish) and pappardelle with ragu sauce( ok, nothing special, lukewarm).You get picture- BAD BAD BAD . Save yourself- don't go. Ps to her credit she took mussels off bill.",1.0

"There's a dearth of good restaurants near The Bell House, where I often find myself...hungry.  Recently, it was post-show (so late) and I was hungry and very concerned I might have to suffer through the long ride back home on an empty stomach.  Thankfully, a friend led me to Bar Tano - what a nice surprise.  It serves dinner 'til 12 a.m. through the week and 'til 1 a.m. on weekends - what a nicer surprise.  And what a delightful atmosphere - cozy and charming, very neighborhood bistro-esque.  A little bit of Italy in Gowanus.And the food matches the fetching atmosphere.  The Bruschette (three for $10 or one for $4) is delicious - we had the goat cheese & fig, the funghi, and the whipped salt cod - YUM.  I loved my salad - a special of the day ($14, I think), with poached shrimp, arugula, and some other succulent things.  And I had a fantastic Old Fashioned ($10) with Michter's (their bourbon and rye selection is great).  My lady friend had the Costolette ($14) - basically a braised short ribs sandwich, with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese - which she said was terrific.  And my man friend had the burger, as man friends are wont to do.  He had the Tano Burger ($14), with mushrooms, fontina, and rosemary.  I'm not a burger person, but I did snag a few house-made potato chips and they were solid.Just checked out the brunch menu - all items hover around $8-$10, unheard of for quality food in Manhattan. Might even be worth a little train ride across the river.Very friendly service - our waitress was a doll, even though it was late and she probably wanted to go home, she didn't rush us at all.  She just let us linger.  You got me wrapped around your finger, Bar Tano.",4.0
"Lol, okay so I finally found out the name of this place through my credit card statement. I've been meaning to write a review about this place after I attended some musical performance from my Professor in the area. We hit up this spot right after we finished cleaning and packing everything into the mini van. The food and ambiance in here is great!Food - I ordered a panini with gabagool (capicola) w/ chips! The panini was pretty darn good and I just love gabagool. My professor had the same thing but with prosciutto. It hit the spot! Someone from our table ordered a pizza and a burger. Both dishes looked pretty appetizing.Drinks - Fancy sink water served in a nice lookin bottle, lol. The have a fully stocked bar but all I had was some German beer on their menu. A few of us ordered some Guinness.Service - Friendly but a bit slow with the orders. We came here pretty late and it wasn't that busy. It took them awhile to serve us our food.

"The bruschetta and spagehtti pomodoro were good.  The bruschetta had a lot of flavor but it was not super garlicky.  The spaghetti pomodoro sauce was good too.  Maybe that was why it took so long for it to come out, they were trying to perfect the sauce!The service here is great.",4.0
"Up to 4 stars. Tano has grown on me more over time!I've eaten at Bar Tano and Bar Toto a bunch. They serve food later into the night, which is a real plus for us. The ambiance is nice, with a European bistro feel to it.They have a patio with a little greenery. That particular corner tends toward the louder side, with lots of car traffic going across 9th street over the Canal or into Park Slope. Despite this, it's still pleasant to sit outside at a restaurant in this neighborhood when the weather's good.We like their pizzas, usually opting for margherita or pepperoni. The menu is tasty and service is friendly. For an easy, medium-priced bite and glass of wine (sauvignon blanc for $7!), it's a really nice place to have in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Really good food. This place is probably underrated because of the location on 3rd Avenue. Most of the restaurants are on 5th ave and 7th ave.

"The Gowanus canal area is definitely suffering from a lack of food varieties.  The area is still very industrial with warehouses, art studios, and more warehouses. The food and service is very good here.  I got the Gowanus drink and it tasted similar to a mojito, but it was made with crushed basil leaves.  It was definitely refreshing on a hot summer day.  I've tried several items- the bruschetta, the Tano burger, the sausage pizza, and a chicken pasta dish.  Everything I had was exceptional, but I didn't enjoy the pizza too much because the tomato sauce was much too sweet for me.  I love the fresh bread on the Tano burger and the bruschetta.  My favorite was the fig and goat cheese combo.  It was just the perfect touch of salty and sweet.  I love the outdoor seating, but there's a lack of scenery and not much to see around you.  The service was stellar and I would definitely go back for more food.  I think Bar Tano is definitely a shining star amongst the depths of darkness in the Gowanus neighborhood, but hey, I hear it's up and coming, so there's that.",4.0
"I used to love this place, until the prices increased. The food is still great, but charging more, by about 40% on some items, for the same exact thing, is not worth it.Yes, the economy is not lending a helpful hand to small businesses, but increasing prices is only going to deter some people (such as myself) from coming back. Don't hate me, but price increases on a certain scale do not justify the ""value"" of a food item. I know business needs to survive, but at least offer special discounts on certain days, to keep customers such as myself happy.Anyway, about the food. Since that's the point.Pizza - always good. Thin crust, fresh tasting sauce, little strips of basil.Panini - also really good.House fries - tasty and delicious, they're potato chips, not fries, if that's your thing. (I love them)Bruschetta - great, but too expensive to want them anymore.",3.0
"Don""t do it!!! Do not eat here- here""a why.Friday night- 7pm lively bar and inside restaurant scene. Noise level exuberant but not painful so far so good. Got a table pretty quickly- and pretty quickly realized one waitress for all of inside tables. Finally get a menu,  waitress abruptly - after 10-15 take bar menu. 15-20 mins - later takes food menu- still no drinks. Drinks (white sangria- pretty good) finally comes.  Food comes 20-25 mins later. This is what 3 big eaters had: meatball appetizer (so so on mushy polenta) and mussels. This is where big problem was- smelled AWFUL- they smelled ""off"" when she came back we said they smelled bad- she says ""what do you expect from mussels?"" They ""smell that way"" really??? I think health dept would take exception to that!!  We sent back. Table now smelled bad. Dinner orders came. One order bucatini and broccoli rabe ok), one chicken saltimbocca  (awful, dry, tasteless no relation  to real dish) and pappardelle with ragu sauce( ok, nothing special, lukewarm).You get picture- BAD BAD BAD . Save yourself- don't go. Ps to her credit she took mussels off bill.",1.0
"Great spot in a pretty quiet part of gowanus. Have only been late afternoon-so not sure how busy they get during prime brunch-but easy to get a table in the cute space. Very pleasant staff and reasonably priced. Both really enjoyed our egg dishes-well seasoned, came out hot, and very hearty without being too heavy. If in the area and need something tasty, great option!",4.0
"There's a dearth of good restaurants near The Bell House, where I often find myself...hungry.  Recently, it was post-show (so late) and I was hungry and very concerned I might have to suffer through the long ride back home on an empty stomach.  Thankfully, a friend led me to Bar Tano - what a nice surprise.  It serves dinner 'til 12 a.m. through the week and 'til 1 a.m. on weekends - what a nicer surprise.  And what a delightful atmosphere - cozy and charming, very neighborhood bistro-esque.  A little bit of Italy in Gowanus.And the food matches the fetching atmosphere.  The Bruschette (three for $10 or one for $4) is delicious - we had the goat cheese & fig, the funghi, and the whipped salt cod - YUM.  I loved my salad - a special of the day ($14, I think), with poached shrimp, arugula, and some other succulent things.  And I had a fantastic Old Fashioned ($10) with Michter's (their bourbon and rye selection is great).  My lady friend had the Costolette ($14) - basically a braised short ribs sandwich, with caramelized onions and Swiss cheese - which she said was terrific.  And my man friend had the burger, as man friends are wont to do.  He had the Tano Burger ($14), with mushrooms, fontina, and rosemary.  I'm not a burger person, but I did snag a few house-made potato chips and they were solid.Just checked out the brunch menu - all items hover around $8-$10, unheard of for quality food in Manhattan. Might even be worth a little train ride across the river.Very friendly service - our waitress was a doll, even though it was late and she probably wanted to go home, she didn't rush us at all.  She just let us linger.  You got me wrapped around your finger, Bar Tano.",4.0

"Saturday night after a trip to Brooklyn Homebrew to grab ingredients for my upcoming Christmas Ale, my buddy and I realized we were both starving. He recently moved to Brooklyn from California and I just try to avoid it in general so we were at a loss for good places nearby. I looked left and right and pointed in the direction that looked most lively (read: there was a store with their lights still on). We walked over to Bar Tano, intrigued by the number of people out eating at that hour... then I realized it was about 7pm on a Saturday night. Not so odd but definitely an indicator of how messed up my internal clock is! Anyway, after a quick yelp search on my friend's phone we decided to go for it. The restaurant is definitely very cozy and intimate. The waitress was friendly and attentive without being too in-your-face. Perfect. They provided a carafe of water so we could refill ourselves as needed. Always a good call IMO. Our waitress named a few very appetizing specials but they all sounded too heavy at the time. Instead, my friend went with their papardelle with short rib ragu and I got the mussels and an order of the bruschetta, which came with 3, I picked: tomato, basil and prosciutto, goat cheese and fix, and blue cheese, honey and walnuts. My friend liked his dish. I thought the pasta was cooked very well - tasted fresh and looked handmade - but the sauce was a bit bland and uninspiring. I really enjoyed the bruschetta. My absolute favourite was the goat cheese and fig! I love love love fig and the proportion of salty and sweet was perfect. It's admittedly not a tough item to make but it totally hit the spot. I only wish I had ordered all 3 of the bruschetta's that way. The mussels were alright. The broth was different from the traditional; a bit more on the citrusy side which I wasn't a huge fan of but still pretty decent. The bread they served alongside was great: warm and crispy on the outside and soft and delicious in the middle. After paying the bill we lingered for awhile longer and weren't bothered at all. No one seemed in a rush to get rid of us, which was very nice. I could have stayed there all night with a cup of coffee if I didn't have to rush back to the city for work (lame). Overall I wasn't blown away by the food but the laid back atmosphere, cozy vibe and familiar and comforting menu items makes this a solid 3 star place and great for a lazy sunday supper if you live in the neighborhood. Unfortunately (or luckily?), I don't live in the neighborhood so I probably won't come back... well at least not until I have to pick up ingredients for my next brew!",3.0
"My boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's Day.  Good move on his part.The atmosphere at Bar Tano is cozy, and romantic.  Tables are close together, but it's a tame crowd so we didn't have strangers' conversations blasting in our faces.

There are many quality brunch spots in the neighborhood, and most go above and beyond to make you feel special (free bread or coffee included in the pre-fixe accomplishes this).I'd like to give this spot another shot sometime.

"Don't be fooled by the beautiful interior: Bar Tano is a fairly average restaurant. I'm all for charming tin-pressed ceilings and a faint European vibe, but if I'm eating somewhere I'd like the food to be as on target as the ambiance. One thing Bar Tano does get right: drinks. They have a nice variety of wines by the glass as well as bottles and excellent cocktails like the Gowanus (muddled grapefruit, grapefruit infused vodka, torn basil, seltzer -- mm!). It was just kind of disappointing, as their menu sounds so mouthwatering, but then why should I have to dump salt all over everything? And I am NOT the kind of person who loves extra-salty dishes. Between my panini, my friend's fish skewer (overcooked) and our side of escarole with pine nuts and raisins, we had to coat everything in salt just to taste any of it. Everything seems overpriced, too. My average-sized panini: $12. A huge plate of couscous with a couple of chunks of fish: $18. Escarole: $6??

"I've been a few times now and I think this is an absolute hidden gem for the park slope/gowanus crowd.  Space is apropos, not huge but certainly not small, I recommend the window booth for parties of 4 or more.  But the best part is it's never too crowded as evidenced by our walk in on a recent Friday night around 9p.Initially what drew me in was a review of their Costolette dish which is basically a bastardized grilled cheese with short ribs, carmalized onions and mayo mustard.  Never had anything like it and as such it's turned me into a one-trick pony when I go, it's just that damn tasty and unique!  They serve it up with light n flaky homemade chips which completes it as the piece de resistance of comfort food!  But be warned, if you indulge make sure their defibrillator is up to snuff.As for the rest of the plentiful menu, friends have all remarked how tasty their dishes were and I strongly suggest starting with their bruschette offerings which nicely pairs goat cheese and fig spread among others.Service is quick n friendly and a nice bonus is the bar is stocked with an impressive selection of bourbons, whiskeys and scotch.",4.0
"I had tickets for the Thermals show this past Saturday at The Bell House, so I did some precipatory research for a place to grab some dinner beforehand in the area with the girlfriend.Due to lack of other joints in this slice of Gowanus, Bar Tano won honors by default. We walk in at around 9:30pm and the place is in business. Every seat seems filled, the bar scattered with patrons. Our eventual waitress finds us a table for two - tucked behind a partition driven through the midsection of the establishment. Mind you, this place is not big, but I would go so far as to say it's just right.Got a bottle of Sangiovese for $24 (score!) and the girlfriend and I split some small plates - Polpette In Umido (braised pork meatballs over soft polenta and mixed greens), Radicchio Alla Griglia Con Gorgonzola (proscuitto wrapped grilled radicchio with gorgonzola cream and a drizzle of balsamic), the House Antipasto, as well as some Bruschette - Pure di Fagioli (white bean puree) and the Fichi (goat cheese and fig spread).From this selection, I can't recommend this place enough. Everything we ordered was big on flavor and appropriately portioned to be split between two. I want to say the Radicchio was the best, but two seconds later, I'll tell you it was Polpette. Or maybe it the Fichi. Try it all! You won't be disappointed!Our waitress was very helpful, all the patrons seemed to be in good spirits, and Bar Tano itself has this wonderful Eurooklyn feel to it. Yes, I made up a word. Get over it.I have to limit this review to four stars seeing as I've only visited this once and I'm not so sure I'd be doing much else besides going here or to The Bell House in the area. Even so, more than worthy of the trip wherever you reside in NYC.Oh, and The Thermals rocked the house.",4.0
"I'm a fan. There's a nice thoughtful and personal vibe to the decor and food at this location and sister Bar Toto. In contrast to Emily N, I quite appreciate the pizza varieties: simple, rustic, and flavorful without being pretentious.  A pepperoni pizza and a couple glasses of one of their house reds totally hits the spot as the sun sets over Gowanus. I like their arugula salad too, which always tastes fresh and is very nicely dressed.",4.0
"Eric and I came here for dinner before going to the Bell House for bingo last month. We got the olive plate and the house antipasto for appetizers. The olives were nicely seasoned with lemon zest and some other spices. There was not a bad olive in the bunch. The house antipasto was excellent with the star being the thinly sliced and grilled vegetables including eggplant. I could have just eaten a whole plate of their eggplant. The cheese was a pungent savory parmesan/asiago type cheese thinly sliced. The meat was also very good but kind of paled in comparison to the delicious vegetables.We then shared the carbonara for an entree and it was the most delicious delightful wonderful amazingly simple and creamy carbonara I've ever had (I am not sure I put enough descriptive adjectives in, it was that good). It was creamy and really flavorful and the peas were warm but not mushy and the pancetta with it...oh my goodness! I need another plate of it soon and this time, I am not sharing :)The selection of beers continued to be good. I enjoyed a few pints of Krusovice with all the food. This is not only the most convenient restaurant to Bell House but one of the best meals we've had yet this year.",5.0
"I appreciate bars like this being in my neighborhood, and even if I don't frequent them as often as I should, I'm happy to rep them highly just to encourage more goodness down our South Slope way.When I walked into Bar Tano, I immediately looked for the flapper girl, as the insides remind me almost directly of a 1920's style speakeasy with it's dark-trimmed bar and burgundy seats. It's dark and romantic, a great spot for a date in Brooklyn.The prices on wine and beer are fair, and I certainly wouldn't complain. The wood-fired pizza is particularly tasty as a bar snack and there a plethora of alcohol-based libations that they've come up with.Too much to drink? The bathrooms are big and, at the point in the evening that we were there, were lined with candles. I think a crap by candlelight really just heightens the experience.The only real problem I had here is that I came in with my sister, who most everyone assumed was my date. That was a little creepy.",4.0

Or maybe it the Fichi. Try it all! You won't be disappointed!Our waitress was very helpful, all the patrons seemed to be in good spirits, and Bar Tano itself has this wonderful Eurooklyn feel to it. Yes, I made up a word. Get over it.I have to limit this review to four stars seeing as I've only visited this once and I'm not so sure I'd be doing much else besides going here or to The Bell House in the area. Even so, more than worthy of the trip wherever you reside in NYC.Oh, and The Thermals rocked the house.",4.0
"I'm a fan. There's a nice thoughtful and personal vibe to the decor and food at this location and sister Bar Toto. In contrast to Emily N, I quite appreciate the pizza varieties: simple, rustic, and flavorful without being pretentious.  A pepperoni pizza and a couple glasses of one of their house reds totally hits the spot as the sun sets over Gowanus. I like their arugula salad too, which always tastes fresh and is very nicely dressed.",4.0
"Eric and I came here for dinner before going to the Bell House for bingo last month. We got the olive plate and the house antipasto for appetizers. The olives were nicely seasoned with lemon zest and some other spices. There was not a bad olive in the bunch. The house antipasto was excellent with the star being the thinly sliced and grilled vegetables including eggplant. I could have just eaten a whole plate of their eggplant. The cheese was a pungent savory parmesan/asiago type cheese thinly sliced. The meat was also very good but kind of paled in comparison to the delicious vegetables.We then shared the carbonara for an entree and it was the most delicious delightful wonderful amazingly simple and creamy carbonara I've ever had (I am not sure I put enough descriptive adjectives in, it was that good). It was creamy and really flavorful and the peas were warm but not mushy and the pancetta with it...oh my goodness! I need another plate of it soon and this time, I am not sharing :)The selection of beers continued to be good. I enjoyed a few pints of Krusovice with all the food. This is not only the most convenient restaurant to Bell House but one of the best meals we've had yet this year.",5.0
"I appreciate bars like this being in my neighborhood, and even if I don't frequent them as often as I should, I'm happy to rep them highly just to encourage more goodness down our South Slope way.When I walked into Bar Tano, I immediately looked for the flapper girl, as the insides remind me almost directly of a 1920's style speakeasy with it's dark-trimmed bar and burgundy seats. It's dark and romantic, a great spot for a date in Brooklyn.The prices on wine and beer are fair, and I certainly wouldn't complain. The wood-fired pizza is particularly tasty as a bar snack and there a plethora of alcohol-based libations that they've come up with.Too much to drink? The bathrooms are big and, at the point in the evening that we were there, were lined with candles. I think a crap by candlelight really just heightens the experience.The only real problem I had here is that I came in with my sister, who most everyone assumed was my date. That was a little creepy.",4.0

"Went to stay in Brooklyn last week for a few days with an old college friend and her new hubby. Our flight got in late, so when we arrived we were hungry!Fortunately, this charming little spot was right around the corner from their house. I split a fungi pizza and some kind of pasta. Clearly it wasn't that great since I don't even remember what it was (and it was less than a week ago!) and some tiramisu (not great either---though my friend claimed it was the best he'd ever had--so that's a difference of opinion). I went back the next night out of sheer convenience. After returning from up town, nothing else was open, so my traveling buddy and I ate here again. This time I had the chicken dish which comes in a wine sauce with mushrooms. Now THAT was good. I can't eat greens so they let me substitute sauteed carrots instead, no problem. They were yummy too!Overall this place was good, but not EXCELLENT.  Also, our waitress was not really paying attention to us. She seemed more interested in chatting with the other members of the wait staff and the bar tender. And though the food was good, I did feel guilty paying the hefty price tag for this level of quality. If I pay $18 for chicken, it better be the best chicken I've ever eaten. Not quite folks. The ambiance was good. A  nice little outdoor patio area--great for sitting out since it was a warm evening. Great for sharing conversations and good company :)I'd eat here again---but would prefer to explore and try somewhere else first. Not a die hard fan, but maybe someday they'll win me over.OH!

The Tano Salad was one of the best 'greens/goat cheese/walnut' salads I've ever had and the Bruscettas were very inventive and delicious. Extensive selection of wines, beers and bourbons.

I didn't try any of the pastas but they looked good as well, and I hear that their burger is legendary.Brunch: Even better than dinner, my dish (pictured) was absurd, I can't wait until Sunday again! Good tea and coffee, my friend got a fritatta which was incredible as well. All in all a very welcome and beautiful addition to the awesome Gowanus!",5.0
"Ok. Let's be honest. The best thing about this place is the drinks. They are pretty cheap comparatively. Of course, I get the same thing every time - a Grey Goose Martini and then a Half-and-Half because that's what I like. The martini is only $10! And it's always made well. The bartenders are all cool guys - very friendly. I am fond of them. And the music is always good. It creates a nice soothing atmosphere - especially when I am feeling lonely in my ugly neighborhood.The food is hit or miss from what I've heard from others. I really really like the Eggplant Rollatini (but it's not always available), the Pizze Margherita, Braised Short Rib entree with polenta, and the Top Sirloin entree - although I didn't like the cooked radicchio, but the rosemary sauce was quite tasty; and in my opinion, it could have used some polenta on the side. But what couldn't use polenta on the side? I LOVE polenta :]Also, my friend really liked the Bucatini alla Carbonara. And one time she had a fish special she really enjoyed. I never ever eat pasta when I go out so I wouldn't know what it was like and I thought her breaded fish was overpriced and it had so many bones she almost choked on, but hey, I am a good cook so it takes a lot to impress me.Overall, I love this place because it's really pretty inside coming from the really ugly-ness that is outside on 3rd Ave - I mean, have you seen the hookers? Cause I have! They love to stroll around my street. One time I was leaving for work at 8:30am and a prostitute was passed out on the sidewalk outside of my house! haha. OMG.

I would pin it as a good date spot. I had the Insalate Tano (salad with gorgonzola, cranberries, balsamic), which was a little bitter but otherwise tasty. I also shared an assortment of bruschetta, with the Fichi bruschetta definitely being the tastiest (though the bread was rather burned from toasting). They had a nice wine list and some interesting looking cocktails. Overall, I think the atmosphere is probably better than the food, but it's probably a good place to come for a drink and a little snack.",3.0
"Bar Tano is an exceptional place in Gowanas.  The service is exceptional,  friendly and accommodating servers. The food is phenomenal no matter what you order. I love the vibe of this place, nice open windows and out door seating. Unpretentious, with an old new york style.  As a native Queens girl, its the one of the few places I can comfortably say is the kind of place that reminds me of the Brooklyn I grew up imagining from across the Newton Creek..",4.0
I'm really disappointed. I live nearby and would love it if this was a go to spot. Food is soso; nothing wows me.  It's not bad but not great.

"I finally tried this for the first time last friday night and was not disappointed. Bar Tano has the cozy feel of a European cafe complete with black and white tile floor, pressed tin walls and steel bar. We went around 10 and were able to get 4 seats at the bar right away. Bar tender was nice and attentive. We ordered the quattro formaggi and margherita pizzas, a spinach salad, as well as the rigatoni. None of the dishes were out of this world but they were very tasty and just the right amount of food. I like the location too, my boyfriend has a studio at the Gowanus Studio Space and we go to Bell House pretty frequently so it's nice to have a spot close by to grab some food.",4.0

"What a great oasis in industrial section of Brooklyn. Had a beautiful, large, tastey salad and some super yummy pasta. Could have used about 4 more capers on the pasta and it coulda been about a 20% larger portion. Or maybe it was just so good I woofed it down too fast and it seemed small! Before dinner I had the Gowanus Cocktail. Perfect grapefruit taste. And the 3rd & 9th cocktail with Italian bitter liqueur and muddled orange. Sort of like a large Old Fashion. Also indulged in the home made potato chips which were good but a bit overpriced at $4. Waitress was friendly, professional and fast. Atmosphere is European cafe. Overall a very nice experience.",5.0
"This place is fantastic!There is very limited seating, and when my friends and I came, there was one large family party - so we sat at the bar- but that was okay.We shared a pitcher of the Tano Sangria (white).. and it was very delicious.I had the Braised Short Rib with Polenta (substituted the carrots for escarole) and it was delicious.  Perfectly cooked, not dry at all.  I only wish the plate was a bit larger - but given the price, it was not a bad amount.My friends had the pasta - which they enjoyed.

"Oh my god.

"Bar Tano is simply awesome. It's a small space with some sidewalk seating if the weather's nice. It feels like a little Italian bistro. There are a ton of things on the menu that I want to try! Their bruschettas are amazing - I especially loved the fig jam and goat cheese one. I've been here a couple times and have had the smoked mozzarella & fungi pizza which was delicious. I also had a panini with fig jam, escarole, and fontina cheese, which came with a side of house made potato chips...mmmm, so good!Both times I've been here were for special occasions - first was my birthday, second was a friend's hen night. Both times we were treated to complimentary dessert. And neither time did anyone from our table tell the wait staff that it was an event. So I've tried their strawberry tiramisu a couple times, and it is super good. Really moist.I really can't wait to come back here and try more of their dishes. And I don't say that about many places. I love me some Bar Tano.",5.0
"Dinner here Saturday night before a show at the Bell House. A birthday party had practically bogarted the joint, so we were lucky to get a table at all. Ate starter bruschetta and drank a cola at the bar -- which is well worth perching at if you can't get seated properly. Once we got seated, they broke our party in two and smushed us in between a long row of related revelers.I had the $9 spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti sans meatballs comes in at an attractive $7, but the meatballs are well worth the $2 difference. Sausagey in flavor, they were delicious. I'd get the spaghetti again in a heartbeat. Drowned it with a limonata.Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their dishes, as well. The pizzas looked great and can easily feed two -- don't just get one for yourself!Go when it's not so crowded, and when everyone else doesn't know everyone else, and it'll feel more like a restaurant usually feels. Still, an excellent place.Update: Went last night for dinner. Hella less crowded. Weeknights might be slow. Got an outside table for the setting sun. Pleasant, but no little truck traffic from down the way. Got the pepperoni pizza, which was a little salty but otherwise OK. Other folks got the salmon, prosciutto and lettuce pizza, etc. Seemed pleased. One dish came way late because they screwed up the order, but they comped it, which was a nice gesture.",4.0
"I'd been passing by this place fo a couple of months now and finally decided to go in last Thursday for dinner.This place is not overly impressive.  It's small, the food is very well done, and the staff is extremely friendly with out being overbearing.I had the Fichi (goat cheese and fig spread on toasted foccacia) as a starter and Penne-trazione as an entree.  The Fichi was more goat cheese that fig spread, but still very well done.  The Penne-trazione through me off a bit because its a dish that, apparently, isn't served with any gravy (aka sauce).  Even without any gravy, this dish was very flavorful.I definitely plan on heading back there to try some of the other items on the menu.This is a great place to drop in on either pre or post a Bell House show.",3.0

Bruschette...I could make a meal of just these. A creamy white bean puree smoothed over crunchy bread; dark, jammy fig spread topped with tangy goat cheese; and a classic tomato. A big surprise, is the burger. The tano burger comes with mushrooms and rosemary; get the burger medium rare for a truly savory, droolingly juicy bite.Wine choices are fine, though I go for a Manhattan to start here. The other cocktails are just as well made.",4.0

"I just moved to the nabe from Williamsburg, and am very happy Bar Tano is within a block and a half distance from my house.

Kudos for that. The drinks are good, some cocktails named after local businesses, like the Flats Fixed cocktail, a nod to the tire joint across the street. The brunch is pretty good too, good sized portions, yummy eggs. Prices are pretty reasonable.My major qualm with this place is its dinner fare. There are pasta dishes, and paninis, and pizzas and such...and they're all pretty average, erring on the side of bland even. I've ordered both the classic burger and the tano burger, and was unimpressed with both of them. Maybe it was the fact that both come with no fixins. No lettuce/tomato/pickle/onion, nothing. Just a burger with cheese on hard to chomp through piece of foccacia. I guess I'd like a little more dumont-like attention to some of the dishes here. Oh Tano...you are my neighborhood light in the otherwise dark 3rd Ave...please revise your menu a bit?

No need for tomato sauce when you have the awesome flavors of juicy sauteed mushrooms and gooey smoked mozzarella battling it out on your slice.  I'm nearly at a loss for words thinking about it.  The hubs had the chicken scallopini and he was so into it, he basically inhaled it. We did pause for a moment to notice the attractive Old World-looking bar and the odd fact that the front window was filled with bottles of Campari (though after a Christmas Eve experiment with the stuff, I'd consign mine to the window, too).   Have to say I liked it much better than its big brother, Bar Toto.  Can't wait to go again.",5.0

"A perfect place to go if you're on your way to the Bell House for a show, or just hanging out.Delicious bruscetta that melts in your mouth.

The wine was affordable and a good selection, too.",4.0
"The food here isn't bad, but it's no great shakes either. Still, this place is practically the only game in town in that neck of the woods (i.e., near Bell House), and it's a cute, pleasant place.

"The best way I can sum up Bar Tano is: the decor is beautiful, the food is mediocre, the service is so-so. I wish I had nicer things to say, since I can see the restaurant from my front window. Go for their sandwiches and pizza. Don't order the pasta. Although the pasta is cooked al dente, the pesto has no flavor and the red sauce is usually too salty.  The broccoli rabe is pretty tasty for a side. The last time I tried to go, the waiter would not let us eat at 10pm, saying the restaurant was closing for a private party the next day. Yes, I know you need to prepare for a private tasting  party, but the night before? At 10pm? Somehow, I think the wait staff wanted to go home early because it was a slow night. Thank god, the cheap chinese food restaurant on 4th Ave was open. I have a feeling my pork fried rice had more flavor than Bar Tano's pasta and meatballs and was $10 cheaper.",2.0
"Went here with the negatives in mind - poor service, average food. Bar Tano exceeded expectations. Great short rib panini with homemade potato chips and a very good organic chicken dish. Good beer list - Peroni on tap (way better than in the bottle) and Corsendunk. Liked the patio but it's out near 9th and 3rd which is kind of loud and busy. Inside was really nice. Unexpected gem under the F train and 3rd ave - will definitely go again.",3.0
"Such a cute place hiding in Gowanus. The drinks were fantastic, and my friend and i sat at the bar and it was totally not stressful, rushed, and cramped. The whole place is a beacon when you're walking towards it, and the light inside is just as pleasant. The food is good if not shockingly good, but they have some cheap options for snacking, and also I've heard good things about their pasta. If you like anchovies and capers, I would highly recommend the Pizze Tano. It's cheeseless, which i appreciate since I don't regularly eat dairy, but the sauce and mixture of ingredients definitely makes up for it.My friend and I agreed we both wish we lived closer, just so we had better access!",4.0

"I really like this place; it's equally suitable for (a tasty) dinner or just a glass of wine at the bar. The pizza is also really and truly yumtastic. You almost think they're joking with the Gowanus location, though. (The NY Times agrees with me on this, BTW: nytimes.com/2008/03/16/n… )But hey, they're classing up 3rd Avenue, and I hardly blame them for that. I kind of want to walk down for some pizza and wine now, actually. Maybe I shouldn't have written this and tempted myself.",4.0

"Came here with the fam when my dad came to town.  We needed an early dinner as he had to catch an early train, and this was the only place in the area serving, but oh man, am I glad they were.  I ordered the penne with vodka sauce and peas - except I don't like peas, so they offered to put them on the side for the rest of the table to enjoy.  The penne itself was delicious, with the prosciutto adding the perfect touch.  My sister's spaghetti with meatballs was great as well.  We were in a hurry, and they made sure to get our food out as quickly as possible, and even though we were rushing, the service was fantastic.  I'd definitely return, when I have time to sit back and enjoy my meal.",4.0
"A perfect place to go if you're on your way to the Bell House for a show, or just hanging out.Delicious bruscetta that melts in your mouth. We tried one with white bean puree, and another with gorgonzola, walnuts and honey. And a light, fresh salad. The pastas looked incredible, too. Everything was well priced. The wine was affordable and a good selection, too.",4.0
"The food here isn't bad, but it's no great shakes either. Still, this place is practically the only game in town in that neck of the woods (i.e., near Bell House), and it's a cute, pleasant place. Keep in mind that it's not very big and they don't take reservations, so if you're hoping for dinner before a big show at BH, go early.",3.0
"The best way I can sum up Bar Tano is: the decor is beautiful, the food is mediocre, the service is so-so. I wish I had nicer things to say, since I can see the restaurant from my front window. Go for their sandwiches and pizza. Don't order the pasta. Although the pasta is cooked al dente, the pesto has no flavor and the red sauce is usually too salty.  The broccoli rabe is pretty tasty for a side. The last time I tried to go, the waiter would not let us eat at 10pm, saying the restaurant was closing for a private party the next day. Yes, I know you need to prepare for a private tasting  party, but the night before? At 10pm? Somehow, I think the wait staff wanted to go home early because it was a slow night. Thank god, the cheap chinese food restaurant on 4th Ave was open. I have a feeling my pork fried rice had more flavor than Bar Tano's pasta and meatballs and was $10 cheaper.",2.0
"Went here with the negatives in mind - poor service, average food. Bar Tano exceeded expectations. Great short rib panini with homemade potato chips and a very good organic chicken dish. Good beer list - Peroni on tap (way better than in the bottle) and Corsendunk. Liked the patio but it's out near 9th and 3rd which is kind of loud and busy. Inside was really nice. Unexpected gem under the F train and 3rd ave - will definitely go again.",3.0
"Such a cute place hiding in Gowanus. The drinks were fantastic, and my friend and i sat at the bar and it was totally not stressful, rushed, and cramped. The whole place is a beacon when you're walking towards it, and the light inside is just as pleasant. The food is good if not shockingly good, but they have some cheap options for snacking, and also I've heard good things about their pasta. If you like anchovies and capers, I would highly recommend the Pizze Tano. It's cheeseless, which i appreciate since I don't regularly eat dairy, but the sauce and mixture of ingredients definitely makes up for it.My friend and I agreed we both wish we lived closer, just so we had better access!",4.0

"Living half a block away from this location for the past 6 years, I've watched this former dilapidated and empty brickstone building be converted into ""luxury loft-like apartments"" [whatever that means on 3rd Ave.] a few years back.  I waited patiently over the past year, wondering what was going to end up behind the papered storefront.  I caught a sneak peak over the summer and was pleased with what I saw then and even happier when I later saw their liquor license taped in the window.And I can't deny, the space is beautiful.  Tin-stamped ceilings and walls, a gorgeous zinc bar, a wall length mirror that I would kill to have in my own apartment, and that wonderful soft lighting that eliminates everyone's flaws.  It's owned by the same people as Bar Toto up on 6th, so if you're familiar with Toto, then you'll know what to expect at Tano.  It's essentially the same thing.  The food is good, the wine is good and the beer selection is decent.  Service is still ""eh"" but the place has only been open for two weeks, so I'm sure that will improve with time.That being said, I can't help but feel that I wish this was more of a neighborhood bar than a restaurant with a bar inside of it.  It's almost a little *too* nice for me, but then again, I fell in love with Gowanus for it's gritty, dirty, industrial vibe, not it's stellar dining options.  Sure, it's great to have another restaurant option so close, but the place isn't that cheap [sorry, I'm not rich - $7 for a glass of wine or $12 for a panini just ain't cheap to me.  You want cheap?  Go across the street to Sonia's.] Maybe my opinion will change in a few months when the weather warms up - hopefully before June when my rent goes up another $400 and I'm forced to leave the place that I've called home for all these years now that the NY Times has declared Gowanus the ""new"" artist's enclave, effectively ignoring the people who have called it home for many, many years and in turn, driving up the rents to Park Slope Proper rates.

"I'm much more satisfied with the service than at sister restaurant, Bar Toto, which used to be the bomb and now bombs at lunchtime. The food is as dependable as at Toto, which is to say very. The gremelle (rope-shaped pasta) with sausage in a creamy tomato sauce was lovely and the olive bruschetta was delish. The ambiance is also lovely, if a bit cafe trite. I'm a little perplexed by the decision to have an outdoor space on that particular corner, which is really loud with truck and bus traffic. The prospect from the tables is ugly-industrial as opposed to exquisitely brutalist. If the restaurant were across 9th street, it would face towards the amazing black, pixelated, fabric-covered train trestle and the warehouses, and we'd be in business, but as it stands, the outdoor space leaves a lot to be desired (I guess better than nothing).  Confusion notwithstanding, I will be back for that yummy food and drink.

"Bar Tano stands out in an otherwise dreary industrial neighborhood; it's an elegant and charming space with a comfortable bar and impressive decor. It offers a good range of drinks and friendly service, and if it were to stand alone simply as a neighborhood bar, it would have merited a far better rating than two stars. Unfortunately, the food, at least when I went there with my fiancee, was extremely mediocre. Mixed fried seafood as an appetizer was OK, though the white fish was a little soggy and did not taste fresh; the pizza with ricotta was completely bland, the dough seemingly made with neither salt nor oil. The papardelle with short rib ragu was equally unimpressive; though the pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was watery and, again, bland in the extreme. Good short rib ragu should be beefy and robust; this was not. In fact, it was difficult to tell whether meat had indeed been used in the sauce or not. It's a shame, because it's a great space and has a lot of potential. We went just before New Year, so it's possible the kitchen was short-handed (the staff certainly appeared to be having trouble keeping up on a busy night).

"I, too, have been walking by this place on the corner of 3rd Ave & 9th St almost on a daily basis and keep saying I should stop in.  Last night I had someone take me for dinner and it was nice.  It is surprisingly small-ish inside and surprisingly full for a Wednesday evening at 7:45.  We sat at the bar and it was fine to eat there.  Having read the reviews here we started w/the goat cheese & fig spread bruschetta, it was tasty, good mix of cheese and spread.  Only complaint is that it's just one big slice of bread so it's a bit hard to share.  On to entree's, I had the spaghetti special with spicy sausage and asparagus - my leftovers today are still good.  They use big spaghetti noodles, which just seem more substantial, slice the asparagus up and don't cheat you on the sausage.  My friend had the chicken with fennel and seemed to enjoy it, although to me it looked like a whole lotta orange slices.  I could see this place being a nice, all around, where-you-go-when-you're-in-the-neighborhood or don't feel like having to travel to far to get your dinner or want fine food w/out dealing with the rest of the Slope.  Great way to convince friends to walk down from 4th Ave & 9th St instead of always going up.",4.0

"Finally got around to visiting Bar Tano and glad that I did. I live on the border of Park Slope and Gawanus and usually opt for the former when I go out in the neighborhood. I went to Bar Tano on a Thursday night, about an hour before their kitchen closed. The first thing I noticed walking into the restaurant was a contrast between the somewhat gritty 3rd ave area and the restaurant - the decor and lighting represented a casually refined atmosphere. The bartender and staff were also very friendly and accomodating. I ordered a Maker's Manhattan and it was definitely on the potent side (exactly how i want it). My meal, a panini was good, but not great. I thought it could use a bit more cheese or somethig else to take it to another level. The included chips were really good. Overall though for the price, it is hard to complain. I'll definitely be visiting here again soon for drinks or to check out the other menu choices.

Went on a Sunday night (7:30) with my wife and another couple. Our waitress managed to mix up one of our party's salads with someone's at a nearby table and then attempted to ""swap"" them after we realized the error since ""they hadn't really touched theirs yet"", forgot to put in one of our entree orders, causing it to arrive 10 minutes later (and overcooked - go figure) and was plain absent and inattentive for the majority of the meal. To make matters worse, after ordering a bourbon and waiting 10 minutes for it to arrive I was told that they were ""out of that one"" and she left before I could even pick up the menu to choose another one. Mind you, the place was empty at this point. Five minutes after ordering a different bourbon, I saw someone on a ladder behind the bar hunting through all the bottles of bourbon. After watching her pass by the one I ordered three times (it was in the front row, I could see it clearly in the mirror from our table across the restaurant) I finally got up and pointed it out to her.After all that, not a single drink or item was comped on a $160 check.

"In all honesty, It may get 4 stars simply for location. I live around the corner and have dined here a half a dozen times. They have a great panini burger and some pretty good pizza. I think the prices are a little on the high side, but it is such a fabulous looking place, I'll happily pay a few extra dollars. The bar is the highlight. Wonderful selection of craft beers, great selection of grappa and amaro.",4.0
"Excellent spot to grab a bite & a lovely cocktail before shows at the Bell House. Lovely decor & tasty treats. I especially enjoyed ""The Gowanus"" cocktail a fancied up version of a gray hound that was especially refreshing on a hot/muggy summer day.",4.0
"not my scene.but the bartenders are cool, and they have a good brunch.",3.0
"Good spot for the area. Had to get my car inspected and kill some time recently. I've been to their other places (Bar Toto and Provini), so I knew what to expect. Spent my time eating lunch at the bar - good, big salad and a bruscetta. Friendly bartender too.",3.0
very tasty italian joint in a slightly weird location--  great for bellhouse pre-show or post-game carb loading,4.0
"I, too, have been walking by this place on the corner of 3rd Ave & 9th St almost on a daily basis and keep saying I should stop in.  Last night I had someone take me for dinner and it was nice.  It is surprisingly small-ish inside and surprisingly full for a Wednesday evening at 7:45.  We sat at the bar and it was fine to eat there.  Having read the reviews here we started w/the goat cheese & fig spread bruschetta, it was tasty, good mix of cheese and spread.  Only complaint is that it's just one big slice of bread so it's a bit hard to share.  On to entree's, I had the spaghetti special with spicy sausage and asparagus - my leftovers today are still good.  They use big spaghetti noodles, which just seem more substantial, slice the asparagus up and don't cheat you on the sausage.  My friend had the chicken with fennel and seemed to enjoy it, although to me it looked like a whole lotta orange slices.  I could see this place being a nice, all around, where-you-go-when-you're-in-the-neighborhood or don't feel like having to travel to far to get your dinner or want fine food w/out dealing with the rest of the Slope.  Great way to convince friends to walk down from 4th Ave & 9th St instead of always going up.",4.0
great food. great staff. great atmosphere.,5.0
"great space, excellent details, but food is very mediocre. i had the pizza tano (the anchovy with capers delight), which was ok. the group tried five different bruschetta, all of which were ok. ingredients just didn't feel fresh. but if you're in the area, you could do worse.",3.0
"Finally got around to visiting Bar Tano and glad that I did. I live on the border of Park Slope and Gawanus and usually opt for the former when I go out in the neighborhood. I went to Bar Tano on a Thursday night, about an hour before their kitchen closed. The first thing I noticed walking into the restaurant was a contrast between the somewhat gritty 3rd ave area and the restaurant - the decor and lighting represented a casually refined atmosphere. The bartender and staff were also very friendly and accomodating. I ordered a Maker's Manhattan and it was definitely on the potent side (exactly how i want it). My meal, a panini was good, but not great. I thought it could use a bit more cheese or somethig else to take it to another level. The included chips were really good. Overall though for the price, it is hard to complain. I'll definitely be visiting here again soon for drinks or to check out the other menu choices. Overall just a very nice change of pace from the other 5th and 7th avenue offerings.",4.0

"i went on a sunday night with my husband before going to a show at the bell house (it's conveniently located nearby), and was surprised to see there was a wait for a table at 9:30pm. we decided to stay and eat at the bar, which is a beautiful bar, by the way, with a large assortment of italian liqueurs. i ordered a negroni which was done well and served up, and my hubby got a peroni on draft. the cocktails are all around $9, which seems to be pretty standard for the area these days. anyways, we were starving and i ordered a margherita pizza with the addition of ricotta (a tip from yelp), and he got a burger and gorganzola-walnut bruschetta. the bruschetta never came as an appetizer, but was delicious nonetheless. his burger was served panini-style with homemade potato chips to accompany and he devoured it. my pizza looked lovely, but i was disappointed by its lackluster taste. maybe salt was missing? the crust was a little dense and tasteless and there was no tang to the marinara. i'm sure i'll be back because i loved the bar but i'll avoid the pizza next time and maybe stick to the bruschetta.",4.0
