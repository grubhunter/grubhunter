"Well, I was dragged here by a foodie who wanted to try it out who'd heard good things. It is an utterly charming place. Very, very clean, bright and modest size. The staff is lovely and efficient. This place is getting plenty of buzz and for good reason. The food is great, great, great. My party *loved* their choices. One, the foodie, said their salmon dish was the best they've ever had. This is really saying something! I enjoyed my food too, though I tend to like it a bit on the spicier side personally, it was filling an delicious. Very fresh-tasting.They have a nice little atmosphere, good music, welcoming, but it's not really a sit-down place. They use benches instead of chairs and tables, making excellent use of the space available but if you want to have an extended meal, it's better to take the food to go so you can really spread out. We went during a brief lull in the place but by the time we finished placing our order, the restaurant was *packed*! Standing room only. The prices are great and locals as well as out of towners who've heard about it, seem to love it. The service is excellent. This place is getting a bit of buzz after being featured in a few high-profile venues. It's definitely deserved. If you're in the area, or even if you're not, this is a spot worth traveling to. Not far from public transportation, easy to get to by car, bike and near tourist destinations like the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Museum and the Brooklyn Library's beautiful central branch. The food is tasty and can accommodate different diets (vegan, pescatarian, regular, etc.) It's a winner even if you have a mixed party of restricted and non-restricted eaters.This is a great spot.",5.0
"There is an abundance of delicious Caribbean food in Crown Heights/Lefferts Gardens, but Food Sermon is the bougiest of them.  Seating is limited to several bar stools that look out on the street, but the scents while waiting make up for the lack of space. I was trying to be good by ordering just the vegetarian dish in coconut sauce, but new I had made a mistake and would need to return to try any of the meat dishes.The food hits the spot, it's not as cheap as most of the other walk-in caribbean joints but the quality is significantly better.  I would recommend Food Sermon to anyone who is in the area and wants to try Caribbean food for the first time ever, or loves Caribbean food and needs a decent delicious local spot to get some curry.",3.0
"Great local place in the neighborhood for pickup, not much seating for eating in the shop. As I typically order out, just a couple tips...The lamb is amazing fall of the bone goodness, but can take about 20 min to prepare, so call ahead if you are going to pickup.  Also if you try to order soon after they open, be prepared that lamb may not be available yet. Always tears when that happensSpicy tomato vs ginger coconut... I usually go with the coconut, creamy mild ginger flavor that I can always use leftovers on my own cooking :)My only reason for 4 stars is that while the prices are reasonable for the main, I dislike having to pay for each additional add on.  The bowl has no veges if you like to have a balance, so I typically end paying more to add broccoli/kale etc.",4.0
I stopped here bc I have had it on my list for a while but the food is nothing to call home about. The curry is a bit bland and the roti doesn't taste authentic. The decor is pretty though and the vibe is soooo relaxing. I got tofu roti btw.,3.0
"This is the first time I am struggling to find the right words to describe a dining experience. The words that come to mind are warm, inviting, home, comfort, love, and lip smacking good! There is a reason this place has earned a 5 star rating on yelp, simply put it is amazing!When I am craving a homey meal that's full of flavor I head to the food sermon. The offerings here are a wide range of island flavors with a healthy twist. Nothing here is overly salted but still manages to be fully flavored. I've sampled the island bowls which come with your choice of white or brown rice, your choice of meat, chickpeas, and a choice of the tomato or coconut curry sauces. I can never decide between the two amazing sauces so I always ask the owner to surprise me.Speaking of the owners here, these guys are the friendliest, courteous and helpful people I have met. They even always manage to remember their customer which provides a nice feeling. They are always willing to offer suggestions and give you samples if you are having a hard time making a choice. I have tried most of the menu items and I cannot say anyone thing isn't given as much love and care as the other. These guys cook with a passion and it is evident in everything they make. I am not a fan of the sorrel drink, but these guys had me drinking it like it was a tall cool glass of red kool aid on a 90 degree day! I highly recommend the drink to accompany any of the tasty dishes at the food sermon. My favorites and the must try dishes include the island bowl with your choice of sauces, and meat, the roti, and the curry goat. I am so happy to have this place in the neighborhood and I hope they stick around for a long time and expand! Make sure to stop by for some delicious and healthy island flavor.",5.0
"Quite delicious roti and isle bowl (we are pretty new to roti), could eat this every night I am pretty certain. Oxtail bowl went over very well and tofu w chickpeas was yummy. Sorrel beverage helped wash it all down and maubo, which we were warned mightn't appeal, was quite great also - itis a stewed bark beverage with an almost menthol flavor.",4.0
"Fantastic fresh Caribbean food! I ordered the Island bowl with grilled chicken- you get a choice of a spicy tomato or a coconut ginger sauce over top.  I chose the coconut ginger which for me was the star of the dish. Vibrant flavors, slightly sweet, with an amazing fragrance. I also tasted the curried goat roti- I liked the sauce and the chick peas but I am not a fan of goat... The piece I tasted had so much chewy fat on it that I had to spit it into my napkin. Overall I liked the atmosphere and food. Would return here if I was in the area.",4.0
"A complete home run. The Food Sermon team has taken the spicy, tangy and occasionally funky flavors of the Caribbean, and without dumbing them down in the slightest, created something new. Each bowl is a feast for the eyes, nose and most importantly the mouth. This really is a kitchen, so it can take a while to get food when the demand kicks in. And with the bright and festive space and wonderful cuisine, that seems to be pretty frequently. You can, however, leave your order to be picked up later. We managed to have a pint and grab our dishes to go.With a perfect 5 star rating, crowds of people and raves from the New York Times and elsewhere,  Rawlston Williams is clearly going places. Enjoy the food here before the expansion, franchising, Manhattan and Vegas spin-offs or all of the other big things that are clearly ahead for this man. Bravo.",5.0
"Every fiber of my fruffy pretentious Park Slope being wants to love this place.  It seems so perfect: Frenchy french name, fried chicken on the menu, buttery pastries... I mean, how can it possibly go wrong.  However, it would seem that the universe has other ideas for me and Du Jour... probably because it knows I don't belong here.Never have I been stymied by a menu like this before.  Multiple times now I have gone into this place, stared intently at the menu, eyes furrowed until my eyebrows join into one, willing the menu to give me something, ANYTHING, that I could eat.  Fried chicken?  Nope sorry we're out of that.  Waffles? Sorry they go with the chickens.  Pancakes?  What do we look like, some kind of cheap-ass diner to you?**If you're an egg fan, your options will be limitless here, but sadly I am not.  So every time I go after 10 minutes of intense perusing, I sigh and order myself a pastry with a side of fries.  Every. Damn. Time.  Maybe you'll have better luck.",4.0
"Fresh, delicious, healthy West Indian food. These people cook to order so nothing is really hanging around. I ordered the stew chicken over rice and peas. My food came within a timely manner. I was eating within 15 minutes. The kitchen is big and open and their head chef is so dapper with a tie on! Love it. They do have very specific hours so please check the website that they have for the days and times they're open. I will return. Regularly. Thank you for our amazing food.",5.0
"Great owner/chef , Great kitchen, Greater food. Food Sermon doesn't shy away from their identity. Their identity is somewhat ahead of it's time this particular area but they are still thriving . Their identity in regards to food is simple. It's striking that difficult yet attainable balance of exceptional taste while still remaining healthy. It's modified caribbean food with a flare! I have tried their stew chicken, oxtail ,roti minis and grilled chicken meals and they are all very very good. My favorite would be the oxtail. They aren't stingy with the amount of meat they give either which I can appreciate . They have however given me a less than desirable ratio of rice to beans with my stew chicken and oxtail meals which led to me tossing out half of the rice to balance out. A small gripe for an otherwise spectacular tasting and very healthy meal. Their roti minis can be taken up a notch if you ask for the tamarind sauce they keep in the back. Wait times can be long",4.0
"Absolutely fantastic! I haven't been so excited to find a new restaurant since I can remember. I'm a vegan and my girlfriend is not, so we're always on the hunt to find vegan-friendly spots in the Crown Heights area. I ordered the tofu bowl with coconut ginger sauce. The menu descriptions are straightforward and don't accurately describe the complexity of the flavors. The tofu was crisp, the rice and beans were perfectly cooked, and the flavors of the sauce were incredible. Vegan or otherwise, you have to go here. My one gripe is that there is so little seating, so be prepared to wait for a spot or get your food to go. I would recommend staying, if possible, though because the plating is so pretty.",5.0
"What can i say. This food was absolutely divine and so fresh. I happen to be in the area on this lovely Monday evening and decided to treat myself to a nice meal. I yelped some places and this place came up in one of my searches. I always pass this spot in the morning whilst driving to work and always wondered what it was.I checked out the yelp reviews and drove my blueberry [ the name of my car] to the kitchen. It had just opened for the evening and did not disappoint. I was being greedy so ordered curry goat roti and a side order of mac and cheese. Lets not forget the sorrel. It was so fresh and didn't have the strong kick of ginger, which I usually like, but i could taste notes of it along with blueberry. The roti was so good. Fresh and warm. The meat came out on a bed of warm sweet potatoes with chick peas. The mac and cheese wasn't greasy like they sell at the Caribbean spots on flatbush, i was cheesy and flavorful.I will definitely be back here again! Got to try their Mauby and their oxtails.",5.0
"The Food Sermon, the most appropriate name because this place is The Gospel for Caribbean food. All of the dishes I ate from TFS were delicious: the Roti skin was light and airy, the stewed chicken was tender and well seasoned, the salmon with coconut ginger sauce was yummerz, pumpkin, chick peas and lightly flavored sorrel was not syrupy and similar to a Teavana tea. The flavors are slightly different from your local grab and go Caribbean restaurant and you can tell that the seasonings were carefully chosen to provide a perfected dish. The dishes here are full of rich color, which is always a good indication of a balanced meal. It was awesome to be greeted ""Hello"" complimented with a smile, and sent off with ""Thanks for coming"" no ""push up"" faces here. The food is of restaurant quality and the open kitchen lay out gives you comfort seeing your food be prepared. There is an awesome chill out vibe here and the decor is welcoming and homey. The food is fairly priced but you feel like you have gotten a deal based on the quality. Let the church say ""Amen""! Because The Food Sermon gave the good word.",5.0

This restaurant truly stands out in quality and taste...better than anything we've had so far...considering there are mediocre at best Caribbean restaurants located on every block-smh.  The only caveat worth mentioning pertains to the lack of dinning space within the actual restaurant. You're better off planing on ordering takeout. Bottom line-awesome food and great prices, an overall great value. I will definitely be returning...for take out of course.",4.0
"I have been meaning to try this place for the longest and I'm glad I did tonight. I ordered the grill chicken island bowl with coconut ginger sauce with white rice and chickpeas. It was absolutely delicious. The chicken was actually jerk chicken with the right amount of heat not mild not too spicy, but just right with the right  touch of tenderness. Fallon at the register was very friendly and inviting. I'll definitely come back to try the food options. Only thing I this dislike is that it's small it can fit about 10 people.

"I recently moved back to New York from North Carolina and I admit I was spoiled for a little while. I always had my mother, who is Jamaican by the way, to cook for me everyday and now that I'm away, I miss it! So when I came across this place I fell in love. It's so hard to find a Jamaican spot that has great food. Especially compared to my mother.Anyway, my first visit I had the Chicken Island Bowl with the coconut sauce and the Curry Goat Roti (I was hungry that day). The roti is thicker than I'm used to but no complaints. The coconut sauce for the island bowl was different, but I loved it. I'm glad they aren't just making the ordinary dishes and are putting a spin on things. But, yea it was great I was stuffed and satisfied when I left that day. My second visit, I wanted to try something new and they recommended the salmon island bowl. Even though I don't usually get fish at restaurants, I tried it anyway and It was amazing. It was seasoned well and complimented the coconut sauce that I chose to have with it. So overall, great place, I love their presentation with the dishes as well.I will be a regular!",5.0
"Visiting Brooklyn, NY and of course I logged on Yelp to find out where the good eats were. Found The Food Sermon close. Glad I did. It's a small, corner of the block, restaurant that makes island bowls ( think carribbean Chipotle). I tried The Medley. It was a sampling of curry and stew chicken, oxtail and goat. I wanted to try a little of everything so this seemed to be the ticket. There was a small sampling of each over brown rice with red beans. Each was delicious but I think the curry goat was my favorite. The cashier asked me if I had enough gravy after my food arrived. Extra gravy? Don't mind if I do! Everything was really good.

"I try not to give 5 stars to any place that I have been to only once, but this place deserves every single star.Where to start!?The staff - Warm and welcoming you instantly feel like a distant family member coming for a family reunion, they smile with you and laugh with you. They are very kind and accommodating. I cannot even begin to imagine anything BUT friendly interactions with them.The food - the food is DELICIOUS comfort food that I would eat daily. It was not greasy, or hip and healthy. It was something a good cook would make in their kitchen for dinner. There are two portion sizes if I recall correctly, small and large. I had the large chicken bowl with spicy tomato sauce and brown rice. It was not a portion which left me hungry nor left me hating myself and being overstuffed. However if you are petite you may find it a bit much, if unsure ask them the difference between the sizes and they will show you the small and large bowl in which you will get your food. A small tofu dish and large chicken dish + tap water cost us under $20. And the water was served in cool jars with handles.  Atmosphere - Clean and elegant place, I felt very comfortable and relaxed while eating inside.

"++++- Food here is absolutely awesome !!!!!!- I had stew chicken roti, apple salad (with chicken and avocado), lamb island bowl and all were amazing- Everything taste so well prepared and fresh+++- The soundtrack is great as well-- The only downside is seating, it's more 'grab and go' and less 'hang out.'TIPS- Although it doesn't say it on the door, they take card",5.0
Oh the food sermon... Amazing. Very flavorful. I've only tried the coconut rice bowl and tofu roti- both were out of this world.  Sometimes they are not open when they are supposed to be open.  It's worth the wait. So good.,5.0
"Been to NYC many times and this place is the best meal my wife and I have ever had. Its also a very ""clean"" natural meal. Very nice folks working here to explain to us out of towners everything.",5.0
"Hands down the best food I've had in Brooklyn, maybe the best food I've had in my life. Get the mini roti, they will change you. Not much space and tricky hours, but really couldn't care less when the food is this good. Just plan on getting takeout. They also have very warm and friendly staff.",5.0
"This place is a great local gem. The open style kitchen is visually appealing and fun to watch them prepare the food while you wait. It is a very small location, but great for take out and they're open pretty late, even on Sundays. The staff was very helpful about explaining the dishes and they were very accommodating regarding my friend's gluten allergy. Most importantly, the food was excellent quality, packaged well, and good value considering the quantity and quality.",5.0
"The food was, hella delish of Carribean cuisines and vegan dishes as well. I mean who doesn't like their dishes with some green and chickpeas. LoL Of health movements  and Great yummy dishes . I bought my cousin with me. He said,  in his DEEP English accent... ""Absolutely awesome!"" That it is, that it is.... We are definitely coming , Back!",5.0
"5 Stars to this place. First and foremost. It is nice to see more BLACK business owners coming up in the neighborhood. Crown Heights is starting to feel like how it felt when I was a kid growing up. Food was also EXCELLENT. Especially the rice and beans in the ""Island Bowl"" that has coconut milk at the bottom. This was a pleasant surprise. The Verdict: Highly Recommended",5.0
"Ordered the chicken stew roti and curry goat entree. They ran out of roti, so they replaced it with a bed of veggies, which complemented the stew perfectly! The super friendly owner also offered us some lentil while we waited for our food. Everything was delicious and satisfying. Will definitely revisit often!!",5.0
"I'll spare the long story. Bottom line , this place is amazing. It had a small cafe esque vibe and soon as you walk in you can smell the lovely dishes being prepared . I had the grill chicken with beans over white rice in coconut ginger wirh potatoes. Perfect meal . It was filling and delicious. Cost about 14$ total.  Will definitely come back .",5.0
"I try not to give 5 stars to any place that I have been to only once, but this place deserves every single star.Where to start!?The staff - Warm and welcoming you instantly feel like a distant family member coming for a family reunion, they smile with you and laugh with you. They are very kind and accommodating. I cannot even begin to imagine anything BUT friendly interactions with them.The food - the food is DELICIOUS comfort food that I would eat daily. It was not greasy, or hip and healthy. It was something a good cook would make in their kitchen for dinner. There are two portion sizes if I recall correctly, small and large. I had the large chicken bowl with spicy tomato sauce and brown rice. It was not a portion which left me hungry nor left me hating myself and being overstuffed. However if you are petite you may find it a bit much, if unsure ask them the difference between the sizes and they will show you the small and large bowl in which you will get your food. A small tofu dish and large chicken dish + tap water cost us under $20. And the water was served in cool jars with handles.  Atmosphere - Clean and elegant place, I felt very comfortable and relaxed while eating inside. Not noisy, you can share an intimate moment while enjoying delicious food.Verdict - After a job in the park come in for delicious food which will not make you hate yourself and feel bloated while not breaking your wallet.

"This place is perfect. You have to really appreciate it when someone clearly has loads of culinary skill, but has the restraint to not overdo things or bury a dish in overly complicated flourishes just for the sake of it - The Food Sermon serves honest, good food, made to perfection in such a thoughtful way. It's such a classy homage to the best of what this neighborhood has to offer. I had the Island Bowl with lamb, which first of all was gorgeous - a whole lamb shank just perched in the middle of some beautifully cooked rice, chickpeas and coconut ginger sauce (and ask for tamarind sauce, it's behind the counter!). First off, I almost made a fool of myself by asking for a knife, but I'm glad I bit my tongue, because as soon as I touched the shank, it fell apart beautifully under my fork and was so succulent and tender. The spice was perfect, and the panko gave such a nice addition to the texture and complemented the taste beautifully. All of the flavors were ON POINT. The portion was huge, but I'm a relatively small person, and I inhaled that thing, with only a few bits of rice and chickpeas to take home for leftovers. I just couldn't stop eating!!!So happy to have this place in the neighborhood. Good people doing good things!",5.0
"Food is amazing- sooo flavorful and delicious!! First time I got the lamb shank with brown rice, beans and tomato ragu. This time I ordered the stewed chicken. The best Stewed Chicken I have ever had!! Not only is the food great- the customer service is delightful! Go and eat- you will not be disappointed!!",5.0
"EXCELLENT!Ordered the Island Bowl with Brown Rice and Lamb.  Good size portion and I couldn't stop eating.  Everything complimented each other and I strongly believe that the Sermon was well delivered. :)It is not a sit down restaurant as others have mentioned, so keep this in mind before visiting. Best wishes and continous growth.",5.0
"I've been a loyal customer for nearly a year and the chef has become pompous and arrogant. The customer service was horrendous and extremely dismissive. I mentioned that the sorrel tasted as if it was diluted the last time I ordered it and the chef became extremely defensive. Instead of showing any sense of compassion or understanding he clearly defended his product and stated there was no way there could be any glitch in his product. When I tried to undo what may have been a misunderstanding he dismissed and ignored me. The problem is he freezes his sorrel which can be the culprit of the watered down taste. On another occasion he forgot to add the beans to my take out order and when I mentioned that it was left out, there was no apology; his response was ""It Happens"". This is a pretty new business and you should always try to please your customers. You also have to be consistent with your food and not let the publicity give you a false sense of security.",1.0
Visited with my BF who went to College with the owner. It is absolutely stunning. Every little detail was thought of. Location is great. The food was amazing and the sorrel was to die for. Definitely not your typical Caribbean restaurant. It's a step above. Job well done. Will definitely visit every time we're in Brooklyn. Kudos,5.0
Today I followed my friends advice from Oakland CA and tried the food at Sermon. It was very good indeed and the service commendable  I met the Chef who is personable and knowledgeable re the food business. The diners were of mixed ethnicity and there was light CARIBBEAN music in the background   They will need more space soon as word spreads. I have already begin to spread same to my following !!!!could you imagine him in Sugar Cane space near to Barclays.  I could. Nice Very Nice!!!!!! Highly recommended !!,5.0
"So I wanted to wait until I tried several dishes before writing my review (chicken bowl, lamb bowl, curry chicken roti minis).  I have not been disappointed! Simple and tasty food done right with subtle touches (chick peas,different sauces) that take it to another level.  The meats are flavorful without being overly salted.  The chef is super true friends and kitchen looks hard core! I truly hope this hidden gem becomes a bit more popular enough to stay around to make me great food.",4.0

"This place deserves high praise! We actually came here because Gloria's (a block away) ran out of roti, and we're SO GLAD we did. After our surprise experience at Food Sermon, we'll never have roti anywhere else again! Seriously delicious caribbean food created by a passionate, talented, and friendly team of cooks. The chicken roti was so tender, it just fell off the bone, and the roti was not greasy at all - perfectly cooked dish! My favorite was the island bowl. I got the salmon island bowl with rice/chickpeas in coconut ginger sauce, and it was an amazing dining experience. Presentation is beautiful, and most importantly, the fish and vegetables were FRESH! Took a while to make because it was made to order (which is a good sign of course), and it was a delightful experience. Never going anywhere again for good caribbean!",5.0

"Been there twice, and loved the food the first time (take-out: mini goat roti) so I recommended it to others and returned. Although the delicious roti was the same, the fantastic portions were the same, my second experience was only okay as I found the attitude of the staff off-putting, especially the chef. Maybe because it was close to closing, or maybe because he didn't like criticism. I ordered oxtail, and even though I love that this Caribbean food is not cooked entirely traditional (e.g.: curry goat cooked with sweet potatoes), and that Americans tend to really like the sweet aspect of oxtail, but I did not expect the oxtail to taste as sweet and cloying as it did. I sent it back and ordered the goat instead (same price), much to the chagrin of the defensive and annoyed chef, who was pointedly unhappy about it and defended it by saying ""sweetness is subjective"". Sure it is, but that's really not how you should respond. In fact, if it is indeed subjective, then it shouldn't be an issue to take it back. My brother also found what we THOUGHT was a hair in his goat; it turned out to be a piece of the brush they use to cook roti, which is no big deal (so my brother even asked to have his dish back). However, I didn't like the chef's attitude towards it. He responded defensively/annoyed again, as though we should have been fine with what we THOUGHT was a hair. A piece of brush is still not food, nor was it requested with the meal, so I don't think it was unreasonable to point it out. One woman motioned for me to bring her the glasses we were done using them, which was a bit awkward as it felt like I was clearing the plates as an employee.Ultimately, I felt uncomfortable while I was dining there, as if the staff was annoyed at us the whole time. Not a good feeling.

"I LOVE the Food Sermon. The food is terrific, and the atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming. Every dish is made to order, so expect to wait about 20 minutes if you're grabbing something to go. There's limited but lovely window counter seating. A fantastic place to get healthy takeout - I""m so glad it's in the neighborhood.",5.0
"The Food Sermon Kitchen is my favorite new addition to the neighborhood. Bringing fresh new style, while still honoring the classic Caribbean recipes that can be found all over Crown Heights. I got the chicken island bowl with coconut ginger sauce, which was amazing. My boyfriend got curry goat, which was also amazing - hard to say which was better. I can't wait to try everything on the menu. The ambience is nice and the staff super friendly. It's a very casual place (order at the counter, only about 8-10 barstool soft seating), yet it's elevated by these little touches ... namely, food is served on real dishes with real silverware. Small touch, but it makes a big difference. They seem to be doing a ton of takeout too.",5.0
"Good food, nice staff. It's a little cramped in there, but I wouldn't suggest taking it to go. Just go when it's slow and enjoy it hot from the kitchen.",4.0
"Great flavor and fresh, not frozen, food. Salmon bowl and mini stew chicken roti have levels of flavor, made with natural herbs and seasonings. The mouth-watering aromas fill the air. Worth a try. Stool/ledge-counter dining, you may want to plan for takeout.",5.0
This place is fairly new and right around the corner from my apartment .  The place itself looks very nice and the food is fantastic .  I had the chicken island bowl (large) and the goat roti.  I had enough food for 3-4 meals .  The island bowl with the spicy tomato sauce was excellent and all of the food was very fresh .  It was just the right amount of spicy and I will definitely return to try more .  I've been to Gloria's as well and I was more satisfied with the food sermon.  Very friendly service as well !,5.0

"The food is amazing. I got the island bowl with curried tofu (I'm not a vegetarian, but this was amazing!) with brown rice, chickpeas and the coconut ginger sauce. The flavors were incredible and the food was fresh. I live around the corner and I'm pretty sure I'm going to be getting dinner here at least once a week!",5.0
"I live really, really, really close to this establishment. I'm happy to see what it's become. I've had the island bowl, roti minis, and oxtail from here. They were all great. Reasonably priced, great flavors, and good customer service. 5 stars and good luck to the Food Sermon Kitchen!",5.0
"Been there twice, and loved the food the first time (take-out: mini goat roti) so I recommended it to others and returned. Although the delicious roti was the same, the fantastic portions were the same, my second experience was only okay as I found the attitude of the staff off-putting, especially the chef. Maybe because it was close to closing, or maybe because he didn't like criticism. I ordered oxtail, and even though I love that this Caribbean food is not cooked entirely traditional (e.g.: curry goat cooked with sweet potatoes), and that Americans tend to really like the sweet aspect of oxtail, but I did not expect the oxtail to taste as sweet and cloying as it did. I sent it back and ordered the goat instead (same price), much to the chagrin of the defensive and annoyed chef, who was pointedly unhappy about it and defended it by saying ""sweetness is subjective"". Sure it is, but that's really not how you should respond. In fact, if it is indeed subjective, then it shouldn't be an issue to take it back. My brother also found what we THOUGHT was a hair in his goat; it turned out to be a piece of the brush they use to cook roti, which is no big deal (so my brother even asked to have his dish back). However, I didn't like the chef's attitude towards it. He responded defensively/annoyed again, as though we should have been fine with what we THOUGHT was a hair. A piece of brush is still not food, nor was it requested with the meal, so I don't think it was unreasonable to point it out. One woman motioned for me to bring her the glasses we were done using them, which was a bit awkward as it felt like I was clearing the plates as an employee.Ultimately, I felt uncomfortable while I was dining there, as if the staff was annoyed at us the whole time.

"Very tasty roti and island bowl (we're fairly new to roti), could eat this every night I'm fairly sure. Oxtail bowl went over very well and tofu w chickpeas was delicious. Sorrel drink helped wash it all down and maubo, which we were warned might not appeal, was pretty good too - it's a stewed bark drink with an almost menthol taste. The sorrel was like a sweeter cold gluwein. Super nice owners, great food in a great spot with nice vibe!",5.0
"Delicious! I am going to be so spoiled living a block away from this place. I had the tofu island bowl with chickpeas & rice and coconut-ginger dressing. The storefront is beautifully designed and has seating for about nine. I think the person that i spoke with was the owner, he was friendly and even asked if I had any allergies while he was preparing my food. So considerate to think to double check! Will be recommending this place to my friends.",5.0

"The Food Sermon, at the corner of Rogers & Sullivan has come to this store front church section of Brooklyn to lay it's culinary hands on the new age disciplines of cuisine and good taste, and to part the seas of food change for those seeking a Baptism of flavor.  The hair wrapped ladies of the culinary pulpit are hard at work with smiles on their faces as they know once you have had a bite of these home spun creations you will kneel at the county of food deliverance. The mango apple salad with bits of dried cranberries, almond and blue cheese made me want to raise my hands and praise the chef who created this . . .  And yes, we said, this is good. Make sure to share in the spirit of the Island bowls. . . The fish bowl with chickpeas , rice and coconut milk, as well as the lamb bowl with rice and coconut milk had our arms waving as will were filled with the joy of flavor, each bite lingering on your palate waiting to be washed with the nectar of the sorrel which paired wonderfully.",5.0
