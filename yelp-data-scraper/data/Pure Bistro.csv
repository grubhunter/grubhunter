"I honestly have to say, I signed up on Yelp just so I could review Pure Bistro!The environment is cute and Brooklyn cozy. The service and food is simply amazing.I do want to emphasize on the service, the waitresses are very welcoming and attentive throughout your stay.I came here as a recommendation from one of my very good friends and we haven't stopped coming back. My favorite time is getting their sangria during happy hour. Bottoms up!Their food is great, very reasonable portions and tasty. I would definitely recommend this place and will continue coming here as long as I'm in the Park Slope area. The menu has a lot of variety but what makes it even better, it's all healthy! I don't have to feel guilty about eating here and neither do my pockets lol. I've only have had a few things from their menu but they have all been really good, I can't wait to explore the rest of it.Just a tip: This place is CASH only. Unless you have American Express. If not, then make sure to keep cash handy. What are you waiting for? Go to Pure Bistro!",5.0
"Came here with my family on Easter Sunday after searching and calling many places for a last minute reservation for 12 people. No one could accommodate us and none that were serving brunch past 3pm. I finally came across Pure Bistro, and saw that they served breakfast all day long and had pretty good menu items. I called them up and they said they would be able accommodate us. Thank the lord, must have been because we went to church. Pure Bistro is a small cafe that doesn't sit too many people but it was enough for 12 people and it felt like we had our own room there. Finally, it was time to order some drinks and food, because we were all starving. I ordered the mangosa, which is a mimosa but made with fresh squeezed mango juice instead of orange juice. It was very very good! My girlfriend and other family members ordered the red sangria, and all of them said it was one of the best sangrias they have ever had! Not too sugary or sweet, and the fruit tasted very fresh. Now for the food. I was going back and forth between having an omelette or having a burger. I ultimately decided to go with the Jack Burger, which had jack cheese and jalapeños on a multi grain bun. Along with a side of their fresh cut French fries. This burger was absolutely delicious! It was definitely a burger that I would go back for. The fries were perfectly cooked and not greasy at all and felt like you were eating vey fresh potatoes. Everybody else at the table loved their food as well. Not one complaint about anything. Overall I would give this establishment a strong 5 out of 5 stars, and would love to come back here very soon! Thank you Pure Bistro!",5.0
"Just went here for the first time after passing by many times before but not stopping in.  Will never do that again!  It was SO good.  The food was amazing, I had an omelette made to order and it was perfect.  But the best part was the sweet potato home fries. Truly one of the best things I've ever eaten!  I can't forget to mention the service, which was impeccable.  A 10 from beginning to end.  I can't wait to go back.FYI: Cash and Amex only, but they have an ATM.",5.0
"I wasn't really impressed by this place.  First, it's cash or Amex. Cash only I'm fine with, but Amex?  No Visa at least?  Very odd.My 2 friends and I entered the place.  Lighting is so-so and the chairs are metal.  The server asks if we have a reservation.  Wait, a reservation on Saturday at 6PM for 3 people for a diner? Uhhhhh....no.So we're seated after the wait staff talks among themselves for a minute. The chairs are small and not comfortable. I get not wanting customers to stay too long, but I would have left if I wasn't so hungry.I ordered the whole wheat pancakes, which were really good.  I'd have appreciated them more if the table next to us, who arrived 10 minutes after we did, hadn't been served first. Poor customer service on the waitstaff's part.Overall, not a good experience.  As it's too far away from me, I likely won't be going back.",2.0
"CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY (unless you have American Express, but like, who does?).Ok aside from that major note, I'll say anyone who's watching their calories post-holidays should brunch it up here. It's got paleo, whole 30, vegan and vegetarian options, and includes a bunch of stuff your carb-loving pal will eat right up. I've never had to wait when I come in here, which is awesome!, so points for that as well. Brunch away!",4.0
"Great small space with amazing food. I love places with character like this and the food was the icing on cake. Oh, right and to top everything off it didn't kill my pocket.",4.0
I ordered a morning wrap and my boyfriend ordered another option. We both really enjoyed our breakfast wraps. Felt much healthier than ordering pancakes on a Saturday morning. I would like to try another option before I gave this spot a 5 star. Really happy with how quickly the food came and the overall good. I would order from here again.,4.0
"So I came to pure bistro around brunch time on a Wednesday early afternoon. We weren't sure where wanted to go, but decided to give here a try and I'm happy we did. The restaurant is pretty small, and decorated really cute. Getting a seat next to the floor to ceiling window is nice because you get to see right outside. Our server came over to us and gave us menus and waters that they serve out of small jar/glasses. As an appetizer we split the cheese quesadillas .... Delicious!! I never eat quesadillas unless they have chicken or steak in them, but I tried them here with just the cheese and the vegetables and they were great, I would recommend anyone to try them. For my meal I ordered a whole wheat English muffin with turkey bacon, provolone cheese and  a side salad, which was okay, the English muffin definitely wasn't toasted enough though. I also ordered the green machine drink and it was really refreshing. I would 100% come back here again. Great atmosphere and great prices as well.",4.0
"I've been here twice and have enjoyed it both times, one important thing to note is they only accept cash or Amex so no visa, mastercard or discover here, they have 2 sides to this restaurant and it's pretty spacious, the decor is very nice, they also have an all day breakfast menu which is great, they have a good selection of wraps and their sweet potato home fries are great! Last time I had the steak, onion, spinach, Swiss and bbq sauce wrap, it was delicious!",4.0

"From the prices and the pictures I saw on yelp, I got the impression that this was a super casual cafe where you order from a counter and pick up your food later. False. This is a full service restaurant. So.. don't come here in sweatpants while doing laundry, with an expectation that you can sneak out to put your clothes in the dryer mid nosh.Inaccurate preconceived notions aside, I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I adored my whole what pancakes ($5.50).. they were a bit crisp on the outside, flakey and buttery. Super soft on the inside.. really they were the perfect texture and the flavor was spot on too! I stole quite a few bites of my boyfriend's morning wrap which was a mix of eggs, creamy avocado, and crunchy bacon. It came with sweet potato home fries on the side which were super delicious, I just wish they had been served hotter.I will definitely return to sample more of the menu when I'm not mid laundry cycle!",4.0
"I only write Yelp reviews when I feel strongly about a place (whether good or bad) FYI they only accept cash and amex. Went for dinner with my dad and it was fantastic. Showed up and it was empty, so I started to have second thoughts because it looked more like a coffee shop. DO NOT DOUBT THIS PLACE!!Started with a caesar salad which was $7/8 and a very big portion. My dad and I split it.We then proceeded to order the simple salmon and skirt steak (around $17-19 each). GREAT CHOICES.Simple salmon- comes with brown rice and broccoli. Sounds very bland, but this brown rice was so flavorful it was like a party in my mouth. The salmon was cooked incredibly, and the capers added so much flavor. This dish is a must!!!! I'm drooling just thinking about it. Skirt steak- comes with mashed potatoes and spinach. Again, super flavorful! Garlic goodness all over the place! The steak was fantastic. Overall, super happy with my decision. I will definitely be coming back!!!",5.0
My FAVORITE dining spot in area. I think between my boyfriend and I we have invested close to $1200 dollars here in 2015 alone! (And it isn't expensive!) The menu has an excellent and healthy variety and the staff is always extremely friendly!!,5.0
"New York City Archery Group (Meetup.com) has been going to Pure Bistro every first Saturday monthly (give or take a few defections) for about two years now. We shoot at Gotham Archery and walk to the Bistro afterwards.  (Reservations on a Sat. afternoon for a big group -- and we are usually 10-12 -- highly recommended.)Not one of us has ever had less than a fabulous, well-cooked, beautifully presented meal here.  You wait a bit, especially if you're a big group (can be up to 40 minutes). But when the food comes, bliss -- silence -- chewing -- joy.We've had a wonderful server these past few times -- she's maybe Russian? Ukraine? Polish? Romanian?  Very tall, slender, dark-haired, more than competent: she is terrific, never makes mistakes, co-ordinates the meals coming out perfectly, and deals with separate checks so nicely.  LOVE her!Please order the veggie quesadilla: you will not be sorry.  You simply must order the sweet potato hash browns for the table: everyone will love you for it.Our meat-eaters love the burgers, BTW.PS: If you are interested in archery, look us up at meetups.com.  If you are interested in great food in this neighborhood, you have to come here!",5.0
"I ordered a sandwich and a smoothie which with delivery fee and tip came out to $30 or so. 15 min later they call me from the restaurant (with a rude tone) to inquire about my address. It's NYC so I wasn't too upset about the restaurant employee giving me attitude and the building is new so I gave them the instructions and left it at that. Some time later the delivery guy calls me, speaks very little English and tells me he can't find the place.. In the end I have to go downstairs and meet him. The sandwich and the smoothie were pretty good but it was hard to enjoy it after paying delivery fee (BS in general) and tip just so I have to go and get it myself. Weak..",2.0

"I came here to have brunch with a friend I hadn't seen in a while. He's allergic to gluten, and an app on his phone told him this place has great gluten-free items.The place is beautiful - very inviting, not too busy despite a small, cozy feel. We got a seat by the windows which have a great view of the colorful street.I ordered the Avocado Breakfast Wrap - avocado, turkey bacon, and scrambled eggs in a spinach wrap (sweet potato homefries come on the side of every breakfast wrap) with a glass of Pinot. I'm 24, but the waitress still carded me, which I genuinely appreciated.My friend wanted the same, and said ""I'll copy him, the Avocado wrap."" His speaking wasn't very clear, though, and the waitress misheard him as saying ""coffee, avocado wrap"". This was not her fault, and my friend felt really bad about refusing the coffee.The food was ready very quickly, and when we got it, we were amazed at the beautiful presentation. The home fries were delicious and full of flavor - the wrap was moist and such a complex mixture of flavors. They both went very well with the sweet, fruity Pinot.My friend quickly ate his sweet potatoes, avoiding his wrap. When I asked why, he admitted he had thought that ""spinach wrap"" meant it would be wrapped in spinach. Because he has such a severe gluten allergy, he couldn't eat the spinach tortilla that makes the wrap a wrap if it contained flour. He felt really guilty about it, but went to the waitress and asked to see the ingredients of the wrap. When he saw that it was indeed flour, he asked if they had any corn tortillas he could substitute. The waitress said no, apologetically, but he told her it wasn't her fault and that he should have checked beforehand.He decided to unwrap the wrap and eat just the innards, slowly, and to see how he does. Luckily, he was able to eat the entire filling with no incident, and loved it. Mine, with spinach wrap in tact, was also delicious.The only negative comment I have is that the place only accepts cash and American Express. I don't have an American Express card, but happened to have cash on me at the time. As long as you prepare for it, this is a non-issue, so it doesn't feel right to lower it's rating for that reason. I did feel like it needed mentioning, though.In summary: the environment, the service speed, the presentation, the food, the price ($25 for both our meals and my wine!), and the kind and patient staff make this place a new favorite of mine that I will definitely return to.

To also add ""we don't do delivery through Seamless anymore unless it's a minimum $20 order *and* we add a delivery fee as well"" is really just bad business, sorry. I can (I guess) understand enacting one policy (AmEx and/or a high delivery minimum) or the other, but not both. Delivery is how I (formerly) ordered from here about 90% of the time -- no longer. It's like they're trying to drive business away -- they should really reconsider their policies around this.

"My husband and I were enjoying Happy Hour at a bar a block away and decided that we wanted some dinner before the basketball game at Barclays Center.  We asked the bartender for a menu and were told that they don't serve food, but they gave us a huge folder of restaurant menus to choose from.  After looking through the folder, Pure Bistro jumped out to us.  I really liked that they were a healthier option.My husband walked over to Pure Bistro, ordered our food, and waited for it.  The food was prepared in a timely manner.  Before I knew it he was back in the bar with our dinner.We ordered the Guacamole to share as an appetizer.  It is served with tortilla chips.  The portion size of the guacamole was unbelievable.  We almost ran out of chips because there was so much guacamole.  And you could tell that it was freshly made.  It had incredible flavor.  I was majorly impressed and that's not easily done.We also ordered two sandwiches for our ""main course"".  When we opened up the containers, we could not believe how large the sandwiches were.  Our initial reaction was that we should have only ordered one sandwich and shared it.  But how were we supposed to know?  My husband ordered the Mediterranean Panini and I ordered the Italiano Panini.  Both sandwiches were phenomenal.  So tasty and with such natural ingredients.  The sandwiches were served with mixed greens as well, much healthier than fries or potato chips.The food was great and very reasonably priced.  This will be our go to place whenever we frequent the Barclays Center.",5.0
"Wow what a great find for a quick lunch.  The food was amazingly good, at least in the sandwich department!We split the Vivente Panini (chicken, fresh mozzarella, red peppers, pesto), and a Spicy Jack Wrap (chicken, pepper jack, bacon, avocado, and spicy mayo).  Wow the Spicy Jack Wrap was amazing! and the Vivente Panini wasn't too bad either... but wow the wrap. Not too dry, like so many wraps, not too sloppy; absolutely perfect flavor combination as well, go get one!  I can't wait to go back and try some more of the menu, though it will be hard not to just order another one of those.The only downside to the place is that they only accept American Express, and cash of course.  Seriously... American Express?",5.0

"My friend and I went for a healthy lunch at Pure Bistro, though I may have ordered one of the less healthy menu items.I was interested in having a custom juice so I asked the server for a recommendation - she suggested grapefruit and pineapple juice which was an amazing combination. I will always drink grapefruit juice with pineapple juice from now on. For my entree, I ordered the spicy jack wrap which was tasty - filled with chicken, cheese, jalapeños and other veggies. I like spicy food but I was surprised by how spicy it was (maybe because I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy) and it was on the small side. That being said, I had plenty to eat. There wasn't a wait for a table on a sunny Saturday afternoon, though it was filled with babies and toddlers (if that's not your thing). Service was fast and helpful!",4.0

"Had a decent enough brunch here once, but after our dinner delivery experience last night, we're done w/ them.First of all, my husband is annoyed by the fact that they don't offer any sort of fries other than sweet potato fries -- and they stop serving those after 2pm.  So if you want a burger or sandwich w/ fries for dinner, this is not your place.For delivery last night I ordered a Caesar salad.  It was a bed of romaine lettuce w/ Italian -- NOT Caesar --dressing.  The dressing is the key ingredient to a Caesar salad --  indeed there's nothing more in a Caesar salad than lettuce and croutons!  So, as I dislike Italian dressing, my salad was ruined.My husband got cheeseburger sliders -- they were dried out, thin, on overly-hard thick multigrain fibrous rolls.  Practically inedible.  He also ordered a chicken quesadilla which was not tasty.  The tortilla was toasted, hard, and dry; and it wasn't served w/ salsa or any other flavorful sauce that might've helped its tastelessness.The smoothie was the only decent thing we ordered.p.s.  This is just a nit picky thing but I've almost impaled myself on the hard-bamboo toothpicky thing they use to hold the sandwiches together.  It's the same color as the bread, sharp as a mofo, and organically ""knotted"" at the end so it is camouflaged in your food.",1.0

"The food is very good here -- don't get me wrong. But to go from accepting all credit cards to accepting only cash/AmEx is one (annoying) thing. To also add ""we don't do delivery through Seamless anymore unless it's a minimum $20 order *and* we add a delivery fee as well"" is really just bad business, sorry. I can (I guess) understand enacting one policy (AmEx and/or a high delivery minimum) or the other, but not both. Delivery is how I (formerly) ordered from here about 90% of the time -- no longer. It's like they're trying to drive business away -- they should really reconsider their policies around this. As someone who was a longtime customer, I typically avoid them now because of these new customer-unfriendly policies.

At a $1.25 each, we added avocado and Pepper Jack Cheese to each sandwich. Personally, I think that  is a little expensive for an add-on, but I was super hungry. So I didn't care. Our food arrived pretty quickly, which hasn't been the case from other places in the area. That alone gets two stars. The other 2 stars are for the excellent food.

I don't know how fair it is to review a place based on just this one thing but hey I just had to share! Haha! Took one star away because of the plain old wheat bread they gave me. Mine wasn't even toasted, no butter, no jelly, nothing. Just 2 slices of bread thrown on top of my eggs. Wasn't enough for me to take away anymore stars though because the rest was so delicious. And you get a pretty big portion for a good price. Can't wait to go back and try other things off the menu.",4.0

The decor is clean, earthy, and rustic with a dash of that Brooklyn industrial that is so chic now a days.I ordered the grilled vegetable wrap and substituted hummus for the vinaigrette. My fiance got a Jack burger, and I can't remember what the other two had. Most people cleaned the plates - which I'll note aren't very large. They give you just enough food, but if you're a big eater, you may want to also get some appetizers or a smoothie. The food was good and fresh and the ambiance was fantastic for enjoying a leisurely meal. Service was fine and there were no issues. The prices are good and I'd love to try something off their breakfast menu next time!",3.0

The service was poor, the food was worse than mediocre and it just wasn't a nice brunch atmosphere.  The French toast, first of all, is 3 pieces of whole wheat bread you can buy at the key food cut into halves. Anyone can make this at home and it will likely come out better.  The menu offers berries with the French toast if you pay $1.75 extra. When you actually get your plate there are about 5 blueberries and 1 strawberry mashed up. We asked for banana to add to the measly berries. The server rolled his eyes and walked away. We also had several different servers so we didn't know which waiter was ours (or who we were tipping). The peanut butter honey smoothie was quite good. The coffee and iced coffee were not.",1.0
"Pure Bistro is pleasant. Everything about it.The space is pleasantly decorated and pleasantly lit, the music is pleasantly upbeat, all the food is pleasantly fresh, the flavors in the Spicy Jack Wrap are pleasantly balanced, the waitress is pleasantly friendly about wrapping up the other half since I am trying this new thing because I am pleasantly plump...I was pleased with my lunch, and I'd be pleased to come back.",4.0
Pure is the best!!!! Seriously the best food in park slope ! Everything on the menu is great!! Great place for a quick wrap or salad ! The food is made quick and they always deliver on time !

"While at work, my co-worker and I ordered dinner from these guys via Yelp. That was super easy. We order the Portobello Burger and Hawaiian Burger. At a $1.25 each, we added avocado and Pepper Jack Cheese to each sandwich. Personally, I think that  is a little expensive for an add-on, but I was super hungry. So I didn't care. Our food arrived pretty quickly, which hasn't been the case from other places in the area. That alone gets two stars. The other 2 stars are for the excellent food. That Hawaiian Burger was to die for. I fell in love with every bite and I don't fall in love (with anything or anyone) that easily . We are definitely ordering from this place again!",4.0
"The sweet potato homefries are life changing...well are me anyway. I looove homefries but in an effort to change my eating habits, I was curious as to how I could successfully substitute regular potatoes. These sweet potato homefries did it! I don't know how fair it is to review a place based on just this one thing but hey I just had to share! Haha! Took one star away because of the plain old wheat bread they gave me. Mine wasn't even toasted, no butter, no jelly, nothing. Just 2 slices of bread thrown on top of my eggs. Wasn't enough for me to take away anymore stars though because the rest was so delicious. And you get a pretty big portion for a good price. Can't wait to go back and try other things off the menu.",4.0
"Healthy tasty food shouldn't be an oxymoron - and Pure Bistro makes it so! I stopped in with friends on a Sunday for lunch and were lucky to score a table right away. The decor is clean, earthy, and rustic with a dash of that Brooklyn industrial that is so chic now a days.I ordered the grilled vegetable wrap and substituted hummus for the vinaigrette. My fiance got a Jack burger, and I can't remember what the other two had. Most people cleaned the plates - which I'll note aren't very large. They give you just enough food, but if you're a big eater, you may want to also get some appetizers or a smoothie. The food was good and fresh and the ambiance was fantastic for enjoying a leisurely meal. Service was fine and there were no issues. The prices are good and I'd love to try something off their breakfast menu next time!",3.0

"We went on a random Thursday am when I had April vacation and took a trip for a few days from Boston. It suggested by my cousin to check it out and I'm glad she did. It's this little farm to table spot which NYC apparently had a lot of which I am very fond of after our week in NYC. My boyfriend and I had paninis/wraps-I had a breakfast wrap with avocado eggs and bacon. It was absolutely delicious and paired nicely with my sweet potato home fries. I also had a great smoothie, ""Got the Blues?"" which had some bananas, blueberries, honey and yogurt. My boyfriend got the chicken and sun-dried tomato panini which he really liked as well. Even though, we were the only ones there on that morning, I had assumed it was because it was a weekday but it must do well based on the food that we had there.

It came with apple juice that was made from fresh apples before our eyes--best apple juice I'd ever had and my daughter drained the cup.The sautéed spinach and mixed vegetables were perfect (and absent the heavy butter or oil most restaurants add in), and the burgers were amazing! That's saying a lot given all the amazing burgers in this neighborhood. I had the sliders and my husband had the spicy jalepeno with pepper jack cheese. Both came out on toasted whole wheat buns and were very juicy. I can't wait to try the breakfasts and smoothies.",5.0

I got the portobello and beef burger and I found it pretty good, but nothing memorable. I particularly liked how they served the water, which is to say, by pouring it and then leaving a small jug on the table.",4.0
"I've been in for an early dinner once and done delivery a few times. Never disappoints. I like the burgers and omelets. Love the ""pure"" ingredients like grass-fed beef and organic eggs. I really liked my iced mint tea and that they have so many options for iced.For my celiac brethren, they have a gluten free bun from Everybody Eats. YES! It's super good.",5.0
"Had dinner here recently and everything was delicious and healthy. It's so nice to be able to eat as healthy out as we do in. My daughter (3) wasn't thrilled initially when she saw that her chicken nuggets were grilled rather than baked or fried, but she loved them when she tried them. It came with apple juice that was made from fresh apples before our eyes--best apple juice I'd ever had and my daughter drained the cup.The sautéed spinach and mixed vegetables were perfect (and absent the heavy butter or oil most restaurants add in), and the burgers were amazing! That's saying a lot given all the amazing burgers in this neighborhood. I had the sliders and my husband had the spicy jalepeno with pepper jack cheese. Both came out on toasted whole wheat buns and were very juicy. I can't wait to try the breakfasts and smoothies.",5.0
Finally a healthy burger place ! The humongous burgers here are all grass fed which I totally love love love! Their smoothies they serve here are all freshly juiced at the time that you place the order. It isn't premade like most places. Their panini sandwiches here are also tasty. Healthy and tasty ? It doesn't get any better than that. 'm starting to become a regular here.,4.0
"Great location and affordable pricing. I was looking for a good burger in the area, while my friend was having a salad. My burger was perfectly cooked to my liking {medium} and was the right amount of pink, but it was lacking in the flavor department. I also ordered the mangosa, just a mango version of your everyday mimosa and that was quite good. My friend had a salad and was satisfied with its generous helping.",3.0
"This is for service only. Came in alone craving one of their salmon dishes. It was busy so the waitress placed me on the ""empty"" side of the wall at a four person table. more people came in, and then the waitress asked me to move to a seat by the window. Feeling banished for being a single, i thought they'd at least rush over to take my order. Nope. The waitress was busy taking the orders of parties that arrived AFTER me. i sat there for another five minutes then left to go to Sky Ice, who waited on me immediately and i had some fantastic salmon.",1.0
"Awesome decor, great service, food is fantastic!   Hamburger was huge and delicious...planning my next meal there already",5.0
"Spacious and sunny, it was perfect for brunch.  Paleo/primal friendly, their meats are organic and hormone free.  I had an omelet, which came with sweet potates (and toast that I didn't eat) that was fair, not amazing, but good.  The service was a tad slow considering it wasn't that busy when we were there, but nice, so if are patient this place is just fine.",4.0
"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place because we looking for some light fare and their sandwiches and wraps sounded good. We first ordered a quesadilla with cheese and avocado. It tasted more like a grilled cheese sandwich. There was way too much cheese in it, and we generally don't like cooked avocado. It would have been much better served on the side.  Further, it was hard and crunchy, not at all like traditional Mexican quesadillas. Then we ordered a Garden Morning Wrap (Eggs, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers & onions in a tomato wrap) and a Vivente Panini (Grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers & pesto on a multi-grain panini). First, the wrap was incredibly small and tasteless; my girlfriend literally had to put salt it after every bite. My panini was okay, although the chicken was over cooked and dry. In addition, the salad was disgusting. Wilted and dead greens galore.  Obviously, there is no expediter or anyone who cares about how plates come out of the kitchen. The dressing, definitely not homemade, was drizzled on top and not even properly tossed.  We complained and they assured us the second one would have fresh greens. It was worse. I should add that when we arrived we were both famished, which will usually lower our standards and be more forgiving, but the food was simply disappointing. I will say the staff was very polite and willing to rectify their mistake, but at we are not diners who believe three is a charm when it comes to eating out.Will we be back? I am reminded of Robert Frost's immortal lines,"" Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back"".",1.0
"This place is awesome.... and they deliver.  It's like healthy food, but it's american food, which doesn't seem to go together, but it does.  They really stick to their identity here... the ingredients are ""pure"" and fresh.  Everything is grass fed, organic, farm to table, etc... but it's not weird..  They serve things like burgers and chicken nuggets.  I expect to become a regular.",5.0
"Good food that's made with care.  The food is consistently good, well-flavored, and not drenched in salt or oil, which makes all the difference.  I usually order the jerk chicken wrap which is moist but not oily, and the cheese and mayo make it nicely spiced.  The steak panini is also good, as is the quesadilla (enough to feed 2 people), and the guacamole is really fresh (but not spicy if that's how you like it).  I have a feeling this place is going to do really well.  And if they keep going the way they are, they deserve to.",5.0
"What's not to love about organic and all natural food at Brooklyn price?!Good whole wheat pancakes, flakier than I prefer, and not quite as buttery and dense as I usually like, but it makes me feel less guilty so it's all good. I had a side of the vegetable du jour, which were spinach, and I loved it! It tasted really good and I can tell how fresh it was. My friend had the go green (kale, spinach and honeydew). When the owner checked to see what my friend thought of the drink, and she didn't hesitate to tell him how much she loved it! She also had the Mediterranean wrap which satisfied her brunch craving.

I didn't think the prices were too pricy if you ask me! I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Wrap/Panini and it came with a little portion of Lettuce with balsamic vinegar, it took about 10-15 to get the food, but it was delicious and I was full and completely satisfied, I am definitely going to go back and try more foods on their menu, if your in the area I recommend you check it out.",5.0

"The food was pretty good...once it got to us. We went here on a Saturday mid-day for brunch with our nine month old daughter who is just the right age to sit in a high chair for an hour or so and let her moms enjoy some food while entertaining us by eating some of everything.  We ordered pretty standard fare, an omelet for me, a veggie burger for my wife and some pancakes for the baby. We sat and waited, without even a check in from the waitress for what seemed like a really long time. Another two women with a chid came in at least 10-15 minutes after we did and got their food before we did so that got us suspicious. I went to check in with the waitress, ""you did get our order right?""  she just looked at me and said ""uh-huh"" without any emotion what so ever. The other table near us that had come in much later got their food and I was pretty sure she had forgotten to put our order in. Then, finally after 45 minutes our food came out. We almost left, my wife wanted to, but I knew since we had someplace to be we would likely skip eating altogether if we didn't eat here. I don't know for a fact that she didn't put our order in because even after my inquiry there was no apology for our food being late, no check in if she could get us anything, nothing. Did she not understand that basic rule that if you apologize and explain most people will understand and forgive?  The way she handled it made me wonder what was really going on here. Needless to say she didn't get much of a tip from us. My wife wants to never go back. I thought the food was decent and as long as there were another server I'd give it one more try.
