"I'm always dragging my boyfriend out to Gowanus or Carroll Gardens to eat at new places that I read about, and I was glad we made it here! I loved the ambience of the place, from our little table in the back to the lighting and carefully curated decor. This part of Gowanus is growing so fast and it's always exciting to see which new places are popping up. At The Pines, we ordered:-bread with butter-cabbage with boar belly-blade steak-some kind of broccoli (it's not on the menu that's on their website) -a glass of wine each Everything was really good! The only negative that I would mention seems to be something that others have also noticed: high prices and small portions! I'm all for small plates, but these were some pretty small portions that were pretty expensive. We weren't full by the time we finished!Another great thing about The Pines is the backyard! I don't know if a lot of people know about it, but it's awesome! Super laid back and low key. Lights strung above and an assorted array of seating for different types of groups. There is beer by the can and also a bbq grilling up cheap and tasty treats! We went out to back after dinner, had a beer, and enjoyed the summer night. I was hoping we would be able to eat dinner in the back, but they don't serve the full menu there. Overall I really like The Pines and the feel of the restaurant, but it's a bit expensive to be a casual dinner.",4.0
"Food: average to good.  Zero option for friends with slight diet restrictions (e.g., vegan celiac)  Presentation: sickening.  Shishito peppers were smoothed in the sauce on the side of the plate.  Chocolate dessert looked like someone took a dump in the plate.  Cleanliness: sickening too. Glasses were dirty, plates were rough from being badly cleaned.  Service: mediocre to average.  It might be a hipster thing that ugly and dirty and rude is cool.",2.0
"Whatever positive vibes my fiancee and I had after our first visit to The Pines a few months ago--I recall solid drinks and a tasty blade steak--were erased by our last dinner here.  I'm not sure I've ever paid so much for such distinctly unenjoyable food.  The best part of it was the bread we ordered at the beginning with honey butter.  (If I had to guess, the bread seems likely to have come from across the street at Runner & Stone--a much better bet for your dinner.)  The shishito appetizer came next:  preciously plated off-center on a huge plate, the peppers were flabby and dominated by a way-too-creamy romesco.  We then had an hour-plus wait for the mains (as did everyone else around us, it seemed, because no one had food on their tables.  The wait staff did not indicate to anyone what was going on other than to say ""it will be right out."")  We had the duck breast and the pork.  The duck's flavor was quite nice, but they had absolutely cooked the crap out of it.  Skin was crisp to the point of leathery, and the flesh was gray.  But that pork...my god.  ""Bonito"" was the final ingredient listed among seven or eight, but when it arrived, the plate was literally crawling with an enormous mound of bonito flakes reacting to the heat.  The overwhelming fishiness in combination with barbecue sauce, pork, and kimchi...apologies to the chef, but disgusting really isn't too strong of a word.  We ate about five bites of it before giving up (the waitress didn't bat an eye, probably because this reaction is a frequent occurrence).  The chefs may have thought this was a good idea on the chalkboard, but it was truly disturbing in execution.I debated two stars given that my recollection was that we had an above average meal the first time...but no.  I can't even remember what happened anymore because my mouth still tastes like fish flakes.  Slow service, bizarre food, premium prices.  Pass.",1.0
"I came here last night with three other people and felt I needed to write about this place because it was incredibly disappointing.First off, and not to be missed - pricing is out of control. The dishes are small (I get it, it's small plates) but even when you order a bunch, you still leave unsatisfied. Many people have commented on the pricing of this restaurant and I think management should really take a look at it. You are in Gowanus - not midtown, plates are tiny, and the service - oh boy, the service. Service is a whole paragraph in itself.The menu is meat heavy, with little option for people who like things other than meat. There were two things ordered that we were told were sold out for the night. It was 8pm on a Saturday. It wasn't like it was 10:30pm on Saturday and the kitchen was closing, so we really should not have run into the issue of the kitchen running out of items!We ordered 5 appetizers, to which the waiter cleared our plates after the fourth. I asked if we would get new plates for our fifth appetizer and he looked baffled. It was clearly forgotten. We then waited an additional 40 minutes for our entrees to come out. This was a full hour and 15 minutes from when we initially ordered. In my mind, this is absurd and a complete lack of organization of the kitchen to prepare in a timely fashion. Not to forget that the food was really lackluster and nothing to write home about.The waiter was struggling and might consider another profession. The whole night things were just off. One thing that really sticks out is that one person in our group ordered a wine and asked several questions about the wines to make sure she got what she wanted. When the glass of wine arrived, it was the wrong one. The person in our party is a really nice person so said ""its ok, I'll just have this I guess"", and instead of the waiter saying ""no of course not, let me get you the wine you ordered and had so many questions about"", he said ""ok"" and just left the wine. POOOOOR execution, and noted. That was tough, but it all came to a culmination when it came dessert time. We brought a cake to be served, and it was quite large. Probably a cake to feed 10-12 people. We asked him to cut us 4 pieces, and in return he brought the cake out, cut into four quarters. Four giant quarters. My mind was blow. It is still blow, and I am still laughing about this. He brought out coffee and asked if we wanted milk, to which we said yes. The milk arrived 15 minutes later. Hmmmph.When we were finished with the cake (we cut one quarter into fours and had the remaining three quarters to take home) we asked for the box to wrap it back up. The waiter looked at us like a deer in headlights and told us that he threw the box out. I mean....I think you all get the points I'm making on the waiter by now. I'll leave it be.Finally the bill arrives and of course, it is an insane number for what we have just endured. They also slipped in a $25 cake cutting fee. REALLY? It took so much work to cut our cake into quarters, throw out the box and smile unapologetically. For our experience, the food quality, the service and all else, we should have paid atleast half of what we paid.End of the day, this restaurant was pretty bad. So much so that I woke up today still pretty pissed about it. There are so many great restaurants in NY, Brooklyn and so on, and I'm bummed we spent our money here.",1.0
"I have never heard of scales on a fish being ""the way it's cooked"". I can only hope that the person who gave this excuse improvised but failed. I expected more from a $30 fish dish maybe scAles add to the weight?",3.0
"As we were walking in I felt a little nervous about this place. I read a ton of mixed reviews, and I wasn't sure what to expect. When I left I definitely had a very lukewarm feeling about the Pines. I didn't pick the place but we were going on a triple date with out of town friends who had never been to Brooklyn. I was wondering how much this place would affect their view of Brooklyn and their regard for our taste in food. So the dinner was fun and engaging and intellectually stimulating. The service was amazing. Our waitress came by to explain each dish. The servers came by to wipe the crumbs off the tables multiple times. Glasses was constantly filled with cucumber and squash soaked water. They were quick to ask if we ran out of wine or needed more beer. Each dish was beautiful. Looked appetizing. And we had plentiful for it to go around. So why only three stars? Each dish was slightly off. Perhaps I shouldn't read the reviews before going. I definitely felt a little underwhelmed for the price we paid.The food was not horrible, but it was off on some dishes and most dishes were not compelling or amazing. And if you want to charge these prices for food, I would expect a novel surprising experience. THE FOODAmuse bouche of gazpacho with mint oil. The combination did not taste great together. The gazpacho was thick and chunky and the mint oil was barely there. The dressed salad with greens. The vinaigrette was sweet and sour, very appetizing. I liked the hazelnuts that topped this dish.Ripped bread with freshly whipped butter. This was my favorite part of the meal. Crisp crunchy outer crust of a caraway baguette that snaps as you twist it. Soft fluffy white innards of the bread with fluffy, slightly salted butter. Delicious. Sugar snap peas with dill crème fraîche. The sugar snap peas for crisp and sweet, they were the best part of this dish. The dill was light, a fresh take on creme fraîche. Roasted Cauliflower with sautéed red cabbage and smoked bacon. The bacon was savory and delicious, and perfect to the meaty umami flavor of the roasted cauliflower. You could do with or without the red cabbage. The red cabbage was sauteed with the bacon, so there was a smoky lardo flavor. Delicious. This would have been the best dish except there was a slight malodor after the dish was sautéed and the green sauce was too salty. The last four spoonfuls of this dish tasted like a mouthful of salt. We had to forgo the last bits because they were inedible.  Pasta. This dish did not have a description. I saw bits of broccoli Rabe and enoki mushrooms. Simple dish. It would have been good except it was a little over salted as well. The prime rib was medium rare, juicy, well seasoned, and missing a good crust. The roasted fingerlings and mushrooms were a good touch. An even better accompaniment was the cooked mini cast iron of kimchi to go with the prime rib. Very good pairing. The fish had a good crispy skin, was tender and had some peas in the broth. The dessert was raspberry sorbet, chocolate olive oil cake, plum and toasted hazelnuts. The chocolate olive oil cake was a great execution of olive oil cake. You could taste the rich, slightly bitter olive oil and it was paired with a dark chocolate. I loved the toasted hazelnuts. The poached plum was sour, but didn't really fit into the whole dessert. The space looked like someone's abandoned farmhouse/ motel that no one bothered to renovate. The waitress told us that most of the installations were from a restaurant upstate that the owner decided to reopen in Brooklyn. Kinda cool, kinda spooky, kinda run down. I hope the chef would adjust and add new dishes. Its wonderful to hear a restaurant is so buzzed about in this neighborhood. I look forward to the day when his great ideas are consistently executed.",3.0
"We had a good meal at The Pines.  Though I think our experience indicates that this restaurants has a little more work to do to truly hit the mark of excellence.I understand the concept is farm to table.  The service was excellent as our server was able to explain each dish to us and taylor the meal to our party's pace.  However I feel that the menu lacks emphasis and force and overall lacks a theme.We had the Prix Fixe dinner family style which included * great bread with a whipped butter.* Amuse Bouche of Gazpacho with mint oil... Not a bad start to cleanse the pallet* A dressed salad with a bed of what tasted to be Gai Lan?  It was not bad but it was just a salad.* Sugar Snap Peas - Surprisingly my favorite dish of the night as the Peas were really crunchy and full of flavor* Roasted cauliflower with sautéed red cabbage and bacon - Very good in fact I really enjoyed the aroma and the various textures of this dish* A small Pasta bowl - It's pasta* 45 day old dry aged prime rib with a bone marrow - Not bad, nicely cooked but not enough punch* Flaky fish with crispy skin - I loved the oily and crunchiness of the skin.* Raspberry Sorbet, chocolate olive oil cake, plum and toasted hazelnuts - This was delightful actually, not too sweet, not to heavy.  But subtle enough to capture the meal.I think The Pines has work to do, and the pricing is sightly too high for the neighborhood if the menu isn't hitting it out of the park.But I'm hopeful that they'll get there.",3.0
"The Pines, I would love to return to again and again. The only thing I wish I would have done was collect the names of each and every worker there. The Pines has such a beautiful staff of people and one can tell that love goes into each dish.My meal was absolutely fantastic to say the very least. I started my meal with a crisp endive salad with toasted granola and a most savory vinaigrette. I then moved on to a most scrumptious Foie gras which was to die for and I rounded out my meal with sea bass atop fresh mushrooms, garden vegetables in a flavorful seafood broth. Along the way, I ate from a basket of breads that i understand was made right across the street that would make you slap your momma.I was so pleased to hear that they will be opening up another restaurant in Bed-sty Brooklyn in April. I'm very excited because if the food and service is anything like this location, I'm sure I will become a loyal customer for sure.",4.0
"Earth to New York City (and The Pines): OK, so there's a trend of offering plates ""designed for sharing"" at this point in dining history. Then why are are all the portions cut in half? Earth to the Pines: 1. See above; 2. You have such an interesting approach to the food itself. Why not throw caution to the wind and consider your diners' physical comfort? Are you aware that chairs sometimes come with backs and even cushioning? Could you keep your sleevecuffs out of the food?  Do you need to disinfect RIGHT in the middle of dinner service with an overpowering dose of PineSol that permeates the dining room? And I will simply add that you might have applied that same zeal to the restroom with better effect.",1.0
"I found this small gem recently, and I loved  it. The restaurant has a decent craft beer list, and I enjoyed the Hefe. This was accompanied by the bread --normally something I avoid -- which was nothing short of amazing. The caraway baguette with whipped salty butter was enough reason to go here. The treme pasta with grilled shrimp was in the top 10 pasta dishes I've ever experienced, and I would return to The Pine just for this dish. The spicy dish had remnants of an Asian influence while staying true to its Italian pasta origins. My bartender / server was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable while retaining a casual warmth.The restaurant is a bit pricey, but completely worth it in terms of uniqueness and quality.",4.0
"I really do love this place, and I keep coming back, but it needs to come down a notch in pricing. I get that the execution is beautiful, and the ingredients are fresh as can be, but we left here at around $60 a person, without drinks. Don't get me wrong, the service is amazing, and I cant' get enough of the food. It's just with all things considered, the food is exorbitantly overpriced given the venue and location. The servers always suggest 2-3 items per person, (two appetizers and an entree). The appetizers range from $14-16, the pastas are $24-26, and the entrees are $24-26. I guess what I'm saying is that I want this place to be accessible and not luxury, because that's what the food, ambiance, and vibe protrudes, but that's not what the price affords. It scares me when $60 dinners become the norm for casual dining.",4.0
"I have been wanting to go to this place since it opened. I had heard some great things form friends and thought it would be a sure bet. The sure bet was that the food was awful.

"From the service to the decor and the outstanding food, we enjoyed The Pines tremendously. Every dish was thoughtfully prepared and delicious. We enjoyed the grazing format so we got to try more of the dishes.  The duck rillettes were excellent with nice garnishes. I took a chance on the rutabaga soup, and I am glad we did - little bits of blue cheese, croutons and an excellent stock made the root vegetable soup very tasty. The shisito peppers had a fabulous swipe of romesco sauce that I want to figure out how to make. Their little purses mushroom pasta was creamy goodness. To top it off, they had our favorite wine, Lambrusco!  And an interesting list of cocktails (although a bit short). We didn't have dessert, and we were plenty full. All in all, our best meal in the area, definitely. Yes, Yelpers, it is expensive, but it is a quality, not quantity, experience.",5.0
"Bread is good but the foie gras is better. It's served very simply, without any kind of precious presentation. The pastas change frequently; it seems like there will be the same base pasta but with different meats and sauces and vegetables within. Try at least one, such as the borsa vuota. In fact, my recommended dinner for 2 is bread, foie gras, a vegetable, a pasta, and the blade steak and/or another entree.If you're imbibing, the cocktails are great (Air & Sea if you want something lighter, The Pines if you don't mind sipping on Christmas trees) but the wine list is also great. They're all about biodynamic wines and all the servers are good at making recommendations based on what you plan to order.They're on OpenTable but the peak dinner times usually book up a few days prior. Might be worth it to sit at the bar or little bench in the back to wait.",4.0

"After a very in depth search for a venue to host my low-fi wedding reception, we chose The Pines.  We looked at every scenario--renting venue space + bringing in catering, restaurant buyouts--and discovered that most places weren't flexible to any of our ideas, the vibe we wanted to create, within the budget we had.The straw that broke the bride & groom's back was learning about Gran Electrica's $5/cakeage fee per guest, right on the heels of ReBar fu@&*ing people out of their wedding reception deposit money...It was refreshing to receive an email from The Pines manager, Anthony, saying ""Thanks so much for choosing The Pines for your wedding reception! I will attach our pricing sheet for events so that you can check it out. There are always ways to work with different budgets so I am happy to schedule a meeting with you so that we can make your budget work."" And work it did.Anthony, the owners of The Pines, and Chef John Poiarkoff were not only open to what we wanted but were very supportive of our ideas.  With the expertise and direction from Chef John, we chose a wide range of canapés to serve, a selection of red, white and rose wine, beer and two signature cocktails. John asked all the right questions and our guests were blown away by the food--steak sandwiches, twice-fried chicken, mini lobster rolls, lamb tacos, salad with ricotta cheese and so much more. They embraced the idea of us bringing in a brass band to play New Orleans Jazz and Klezmer during cocktail hour yelp.com/biz/street-beat… and, the staff was super accommodating to our demanding guests which included me the bride, our foodie-friends from New York and LA, and finicky children--the on-site manager Brian cut 5 wedding cakes (that I made) happily and without a fee. The décor of The Pines was icing on the cake. And, they busted-ass to get the outdoor garden open a weekend earlier in order to accommodate our guests both in and out of doors. Our wedding reception had everyone buzzing long after the event, and, we will remember it always.I can't thank this team enough.",5.0
"It's a French style/Asian fusion restaurant in a semi industrial area. Yeah, Gowanus is still like that. I don't get the 5 star reviews of this place. Overall, the individual flavors of the ingredients were tasty BUT they don't meld well. The portions are also below average. As you can see from other peoples pics, they serve tiny(er) portions on big plates. I really wanted to try the Blade/Chuck steak but they only had a dry aged ribeye available. For a ribeye, I'd much rather go to an actual steak place.Squid - the squid and shishisto peppers were perfectly cooked and delicious. The black squid ink...not sure what to call it...paste? underneath didn't do anything for the dish. It was thick but surprisingly light in flavor.Cabbage - It's cabbage. Cabbage is cheap but the plate was only 1/3 full. There was barely any pork belly, maybe less than half a normal slice. Definitely less than what you would get on a tonkatsu ramen for some context. It had a slight citrus and fish sauce dressing. Why add fish sauce? Is it there to mask the small portions of pork belly? Also, when you eat a piece of cabbage with pork belly, the fish sauce overpowered it. Remove the fish sauce, add more pork belly, and this dish would be golden.Pork Jowl - Salty, ham like texture with a little bit of fat. Sweet potatoes. And I believe...a mandarin? The mandarin didn't mix. There was a little bit of mint sauce underneath. This was the best dish surprisingly.Duck Breast - I've had good duck breast at pure French restaurants. It was cooked well, but the skin was a bit soggy. The beans did not taste good with the duck and downgraded the overall dish.Drinks Nochera - this was solid. Fiery and slightly smokyStaff - they were nice and friendly. Pretty good overall.Environment/Atmosphere - The chairs/tables all look like they came from a second hand store/Goodwill. Or some would say, 'antique'. Hiphop was blasting which made conversation a bit hard but not a big deal. Would I come back here? Nope. If you want fusion, I don't have another place to recommend nearby. I'm still looking as well. Otherwise just go French, or go Malaysian, or Thai etc.",2.0
"I wish I could give this place 3 and 1/2 stars. Service was Excellent. Very friendly, amiable, laid back but on their game for sure. We started with bread with cultured butter. The bread was from Runner and Stone just across the street. Both items were yummy, very satisfying. Also the squid starter was delicious and had many things going on with its components and flavors. My husband got the Borsa Vuota which was fantastic. Vegetarian but still satiating and sooo good. Get it. I got the blade steak entree and the steak itself which was described as tender after being cooked sous vide was actually quite tough. I had to spit a part out after 3 minutes of chewing. My jaw was sore. The other stuff on the plate was good. Potatoes, ramps, harissa. The server noticed that half the steak was left on the plate, inquired, apologized and comped us dessert. How nice! We got the cheesecake. It's not really cheesecake. It's deconstructed. It's crust over here and cream over there. It was pretty good but not cheesecake. Overall we probably won't return but then again we might.",3.0

"I'll put this in my Top 5 restaurants in NYC, but the Blade Steak is easily in the top 3 dishes. What did we have? The squid - Beautiful plating will make you not want to eat it but it's time to grow up and be a man. Shut up and eat it. The kumquat was ILL. Great contrast from the heartiness of the other ingredients. Also you can never fail with shishitos.Scallops - Delicious. Some type of lobster sauce. Cooked perfect. No added water.Cabbage - One of my favorites of the night. Oh, it's got bacon? No sir, for that is belly of boar.Borsa Vuota - FUCK THATS DELICIOUS. Anthony recommended it. We got it. He was right. If you don't eat meat get this. It's just about as perfect as you can get. Ciriole - Whoa complex city.

Sous Vide for I think 2 days and then gradually brought up to temperature and then seared on the sides. The result is basically the best most delicious piece of red meat ever eaten.

Moist (sorry) chocolate cake with homemade pistachio ice cream and a fennel and lemon something that I can't remember. They were all on point but that chocolate cake was the artery-clogging winner as far as I was concerned with the ricotta in second. The staff knows and loves the food.

"Came here for a birthday dinner and the place was so cute and quaint!Excellent dishes, I tried about ten different ones and the Borsa Vuota was by far my favorite. The Good:- Borsa Vuota--MUST GET. Al dente pasta in a browned butter sauce. I could eat ten bowls of this and DID NOT want to share. - Bread w/whipped butter--Buckwheat, sourdough and sesame bread..all delicious! With fluffy butter on the side, it was carb heavin- Squid--so aromatic. I loved the element of fried garlic and felt it tied everything together so perfectly- Duck--prepared wonderfully- Lobster--came with potato chips and asparagus. I was a little thrown off that the lobster was cold but felt like it was so fresh and not overdone in any way. It was a very light dish which I found refreshing-Foie Gras--didn't try this because it made me feel like an animal abuser but heard really good things from the companyThe Okay:- Bass--I thought it was really interesting the way they prepared this dish. They left it skin on which I don't usually like but scraped the skin in a way to get a really crunchy. This dish just wasn't that memorable compared to the others- Cabbage--This dish was entirely pickled which I actually liked! There were also chilis in it which gave it a nice flavor and rounded out everything. It was just a bit too salty which is why I put it in the Okay. Overall, I enjoyed my experience. I think across the board everything was a tad too salty for me but I would come back. It's great for a special occasion.",4.0
"I went back to the Pines with my friend Saturday night to give it another try. We started out with the bread basket that had eluded me on my previous visit, and it was absolutely delicious!

The seafood was just average, and while the overall dishes were tasty, both were served lukewarm. However, the turnip whip, topped with mint oil and served at the beginning of the meal, was palatable and refreshing.Also, the service was both friendly and helpful this time around, and we were able to take our time ordering.

"After a very in depth search for a venue to host my low-fi wedding reception, we chose The Pines.  We looked at every scenario--renting venue space + bringing in catering, restaurant buyouts--and discovered that most places weren't flexible to any of our ideas, the vibe we wanted to create, within the budget we had.The straw that broke the bride & groom's back was learning about Gran Electrica's $5/cakeage fee per guest, right on the heels of ReBar fu@&*ing people out of their wedding reception deposit money...It was refreshing to receive an email from The Pines manager, Anthony, saying ""Thanks so much for choosing The Pines for your wedding reception! I will attach our pricing sheet for events so that you can check it out. There are always ways to work with different budgets so I am happy to schedule a meeting with you so that we can make your budget work."" And work it did.Anthony, the owners of The Pines, and Chef John Poiarkoff were not only open to what we wanted but were very supportive of our ideas.  With the expertise and direction from Chef John, we chose a wide range of canapés to serve, a selection of red, white and rose wine, beer and two signature cocktails. John asked all the right questions and our guests were blown away by the food--steak sandwiches, twice-fried chicken, mini lobster rolls, lamb tacos, salad with ricotta cheese and so much more. They embraced the idea of us bringing in a brass band to play New Orleans Jazz and Klezmer during cocktail hour yelp.com/biz/street-beat… and, the staff was super accommodating to our demanding guests which included me the bride, our foodie-friends from New York and LA, and finicky children--the on-site manager Brian cut 5 wedding cakes (that I made) happily and without a fee. The décor of The Pines was icing on the cake. And, they busted-ass to get the outdoor garden open a weekend earlier in order to accommodate our guests both in and out of doors. Our wedding reception had everyone buzzing long after the event, and, we will remember it always.I can't thank this team enough.",5.0
"It's a French style/Asian fusion restaurant in a semi industrial area. Yeah, Gowanus is still like that. I don't get the 5 star reviews of this place. Overall, the individual flavors of the ingredients were tasty BUT they don't meld well. The portions are also below average. As you can see from other peoples pics, they serve tiny(er) portions on big plates. I really wanted to try the Blade/Chuck steak but they only had a dry aged ribeye available. For a ribeye, I'd much rather go to an actual steak place.Squid - the squid and shishisto peppers were perfectly cooked and delicious. The black squid ink...not sure what to call it...paste? underneath didn't do anything for the dish. It was thick but surprisingly light in flavor.Cabbage - It's cabbage. Cabbage is cheap but the plate was only 1/3 full. There was barely any pork belly, maybe less than half a normal slice. Definitely less than what you would get on a tonkatsu ramen for some context. It had a slight citrus and fish sauce dressing. Why add fish sauce? Is it there to mask the small portions of pork belly? Also, when you eat a piece of cabbage with pork belly, the fish sauce overpowered it. Remove the fish sauce, add more pork belly, and this dish would be golden.Pork Jowl - Salty, ham like texture with a little bit of fat. Sweet potatoes. And I believe...a mandarin? The mandarin didn't mix. There was a little bit of mint sauce underneath. This was the best dish surprisingly.Duck Breast - I've had good duck breast at pure French restaurants. It was cooked well, but the skin was a bit soggy. The beans did not taste good with the duck and downgraded the overall dish.Drinks Nochera - this was solid. Fiery and slightly smokyStaff - they were nice and friendly. Pretty good overall.Environment/Atmosphere - The chairs/tables all look like they came from a second hand store/Goodwill. Or some would say, 'antique'. Hiphop was blasting which made conversation a bit hard but not a big deal. Would I come back here? Nope. If you want fusion, I don't have another place to recommend nearby. I'm still looking as well. Otherwise just go French, or go Malaysian, or Thai etc.",2.0
"I wish I could give this place 3 and 1/2 stars. Service was Excellent. Very friendly, amiable, laid back but on their game for sure. We started with bread with cultured butter. The bread was from Runner and Stone just across the street. Both items were yummy, very satisfying. Also the squid starter was delicious and had many things going on with its components and flavors. My husband got the Borsa Vuota which was fantastic. Vegetarian but still satiating and sooo good. Get it. I got the blade steak entree and the steak itself which was described as tender after being cooked sous vide was actually quite tough. I had to spit a part out after 3 minutes of chewing. My jaw was sore. The other stuff on the plate was good. Potatoes, ramps, harissa. The server noticed that half the steak was left on the plate, inquired, apologized and comped us dessert. How nice! We got the cheesecake. It's not really cheesecake. It's deconstructed. It's crust over here and cream over there. It was pretty good but not cheesecake. Overall we probably won't return but then again we might.",3.0
"One of the best meals I have had!Dishes ordered (share between two):Squid - love that squid ink!Cabbage - just do it!Pork Jowl - fatty and salty yum!Beet Cake - beautiful and satisfying!All were incredibly special and flavorful. The plating was insanely gorgeous and each bite was filled with flavor explosions!The waitstaff were also chill and friendly. Smiles all night!Thank you for a lovely experience, The Pines! I can't wait to be back!",5.0
"I'll put this in my Top 5 restaurants in NYC, but the Blade Steak is easily in the top 3 dishes. What did we have? The squid - Beautiful plating will make you not want to eat it but it's time to grow up and be a man. Shut up and eat it. The kumquat was ILL. Great contrast from the heartiness of the other ingredients. Also you can never fail with shishitos.Scallops - Delicious. Some type of lobster sauce. Cooked perfect. No added water.Cabbage - One of my favorites of the night. Oh, it's got bacon? No sir, for that is belly of boar.Borsa Vuota - FUCK THATS DELICIOUS. Anthony recommended it. We got it. He was right. If you don't eat meat get this. It's just about as perfect as you can get. Ciriole - Whoa complex city. I'm not sure what's going on here but I really really like it. ...and of course the star of the show, the blade. Sous Vide for I think 2 days and then gradually brought up to temperature and then seared on the sides. The result is basically the best most delicious piece of red meat ever eaten.

"Excellent food! I read about this place on seriouseats so we decided to check it out before rock climbing at BK Boulders. It's a very low-key spot with an unpretentious vibe with a friendly staff and a great menu. I liked the space as well along with the mismatched furniture. It's a little bit like grungy chic, if you will. The brunch was delightful! I ordered the mushroom hash - 2 kinds of potatoes, wild mushrooms, egg, and cheese. The combination was wonderfully savory and delicious. My bf had the chorizo sandwich - a spicy house made chorizo topped with avocado. It was also very good. They have brunch cocktails of course but I opted to have coffee instead. They use a French press and there's nothing like really good coffee made in this manner. To top it all off we had a slice of strawberry balsamic pie. The pie comes from the a bakery nearby so credit goes to them but it went great with the rest of the meal.I'd definitely want to come back here again  and check out their dinner menu. They are also opening up their backyard for the summer so that's something I look forward to.",4.0

Service was great too.Get the Bread.  It's weird I know to order bread but it was really really tasty.  (Shout out to Runner & Stone!) The vegetable dishes (we ordered two) were good but not that memorable unfortunately.  The pasta was AMAZING.  We shared the steak (you order by weight to determine how big of a cut you get) which was good but a little on the fibrous side.  It came with these tasty pierogis with some crazy osso bucco/oxtail filling.  Overall a good meal but I think this is one of those places where you really need to know what to order to make it a 5 star spot.",4.0
"I moved to this part of Brooklyn from the West Village about a year ago, and though I love and prefer my new nabe, I've found that, with exceptions, the restaurants here can't really compare with my downtown Manhattan favorites.  The Pines is definitely one of those exceptions -- I'm pretty crazy about the food here, especially the insanely good bread, the duck rillettes, the luscious radicchio, the shishito peppers, every pasta dish I've ever ordered, the lamb shank -- all a little surprising and sophisticated, while also hearty and satisfying. Cocktails are good. I love sitting at the bar, which I find more comfortable than most and so far the service has been above par, as well.  But I have one major complaint, and it keeps me from fully enjoying my meals here, and that is the music.  Every single time I've come, I've been forced to endure nonstop conversation-crippling sessions of mid-market rap (a la Jay Z) which both I and my friends happen to loathe. (I'm passionate about other rap styles, from Eric B and Rakim to Azalea Banks. Just can't stand the commercial, middlebrow stuff that the owners here insist on inflicting on their patrons at top volume.)  It's actually off-putting enough, since they keep turning up the volume, to make me hesitate about suggesting dinner here to friends.  Reminds me of the aggressive background music at early Momofuku, but David Chang's playlists were varied and smarter.  So 4 for food and 2 for ambience.  I hope they broaden their musical palette eventually.",4.0

"It was the best of dinners, it was the worst of dinners. I have been meaning to dine at The Pines for quite some time (divine rhymes in that line, I opine), but a combination of winter and my lady friend's justifiable hatred for the R Train had kept us away thus far. Perhaps it was the combination of anticipation and glowing reports from a few trusted friends that led to out-sized expectations, but unfortunately the end result was a touch underwhelming.This is not to say that anything was bad; I just found dinner to be uneven. There were ups and downs, flashes of brilliance coupled with baffling choices; disappointingly though, the only underlying theme of the experience seemed to be that of an out-sized markup. We arrived early on a weeknight which in Gowanus will usually add up to being immediately seated, and this was no exception. Each of the large number of staff members we encountered during our meal was exceptionally friendly, and yet it took more than 10 minutes before we were offered a drink. We spent the time poring over the menu, which is peppered with so many unique ingredients (nduja, crosnes, uni, abalone mushroom, testa) that one almost wonders if novelty was the driving force behind their choices, rather than flavor. When we finally were able to order a cocktail, I, a bourbon man, couldn't resist the Baked Apple. I'm all for innovation, and I appreciated the theater involved in the bourbon and cider combination being poured in a glass that arrives full of smoke. Personally though, I found the woodsmoke to be completely overpowering, and the overall effect lacked the balance I would expect from a $14 cocktail.* We started with the apples that came highly recommended by our server, and the flavors were fresh and light and unimpeachable. In truth, one of the healthiest things I've eaten at a restaurant in quite some time, and I enjoyed the dish thoroughly. However, it was literally just wedges of apple, tossed in a bit of yogurt and sprinkled with black sesame. This is a kid's snack,** but one that ran us $11.The pastas on the menu both appealed to us, and we decided on the cappellacci. These mid-sized ravioli were filled with braised oxtail in a tomato based sauce, and they were absolutely delicious. However, at $28, it worked out to around $5 per little piece of pasta. Of course, I'm sure we were actually paying for the substantial amount of grated black truffle, but it lacked the sweet and earthy flavor I anticipated. (Perhaps it was grated too long before serving?) We also opted for the duck, and it was masterfully cooked. Although it appeared as though it could be soggy, the skin was crisp, the meat tender, and the blood orange gelee was an excellent touch of acid. I was a bit bewildered by the inclusion of ostensibly seared, undoubtedly raw hearts of palm, but the duck was satisfying and at $24, appropriately priced. The space itself, other than the wood paneling by the tables in the windows, takes shabby chic to new levels. It's almost as if they are striving to offer as great a contrast as possible between the quality of the food [and the prices] and the room in which you eat it. I can appreciate such a contradiction, but the execution fell a little flat, especially considering I dropped $100 (cash only) on a meal consisting of three dishes and one drink. In sum, The Pines confuses me. Perhaps it's just me, and the flavors aren't in my wheelhouse. After all, confusion is not necessarily a bad thing...but when I drop a bill on dinner, I'd rather by satisfied than confused._____________*Yes, a $14 cocktail. No longer the $12 listed on the online menu, and the ingredients of the Baked Apple in particular seem to have changed as well. Perhaps because honeycrisp apples are no longer in season?  Either way, in my mind, this is a price point that needs to be justified by quality, and in this case it wasn't. **Similarly, they offer Ants on a Log for dessert. The ingredients are listed as celery, peanut butter and raisins. The same ones used when your mom made it for you. And the price is $10. I didn't order it, so I'm not sure if there is some peanut butter powder with a celery foam and frozen raisin sorbet or what, but if not this might be an elaborate joke being played on the diners of Brooklyn.",3.0
"That's right; 5 stars! I offer up these five fat stars for several reasons:1 - Creativity2 - Execution3 - Service4 - Ambience/VibeThis restaurant is taking major chances with its food and it pays off. I went several times when they first opened and loved it, though the food could be reaching perhaps a bit too far on occasion. These days it seems as adventurous but the dishes are bolted-down tight before they make the menu.I love the vibe both at the bar and table where I've encountered only warm and attentive service. Questions were answered thoroughly with regards to ingredients and drink pairings, as well as how much food to get for the group. They also take credit cards now which is fantastic. Now that there are a couple of additional spots in the area such as the Royal Palms and Lavender Lake it's easier to make it a part of your night as opposed to a destination (not that there's anything wrong with Canal Bar!).Great job Pines! I'll be back soon.",5.0
"Delicious meal, great service, wonderful experience.  My husband and I came after an archery lesson on Saturday night, needless to say we were hungry!  We shared the cabbage with boar belly, the squid with shishitos, the asparagus with poached egg, the black bass and the blade steak.  All delicious, but the cabbage and the squid ruled the day!  The service was lovely too, everyone had a warm smile.  We will be back!",5.0
"I had been wanting to check out The Pines for quite some time and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. I would recommend it to all my friends, and I plan on going back with my friends who I know will love this place as well.A bit of a trek for me, going all the way down to Gowanus, but definitely worth it.Some of the food was borderline too salty, but it didn't numb my tongue, and the food was extremely flavorful (a lot of umami), so I think it would be fine for the average American. I'm a little sensitive to salt. They have a great beverage program- you can tell that it's thoughtful, and the wine list is very easy to navigate as the grape varietal names are on the first line. We had a bottle of Lambrusco, which was amazing! A much drier and funkier Lambrusco than others that I've tried before. The staff were very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the beverage selections.We ordered the squid, duck rillette, beef tartare, cabbage with boar belly, grouper with tomato dashi, beef chuck steak and black trumpet mushroom pasta with lamb belly bacon. My absolute favorite was the chuck steak. Such great flavor in the meat!!! And amazing texture. The lamb belly in the pasta was one of my favorites too. The food was some of the best I've had in a while in NYC and the service was spot on. They were personable but also knowledgeable about the way the food was cooked.There is a sense of passion and enthusiasm that you don't find in many restaurants here.Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!",4.0

I offer up these five fat stars for several reasons:1 - Creativity2 - Execution3 - Service4 - Ambience/VibeThis restaurant is taking major chances with its food and it pays off. I went several times when they first opened and loved it, though the food could be reaching perhaps a bit too far on occasion. These days it seems as adventurous but the dishes are bolted-down tight before they make the menu.I love the vibe both at the bar and table where I've encountered only warm and attentive service. Questions were answered thoroughly with regards to ingredients and drink pairings, as well as how much food to get for the group. They also take credit cards now which is fantastic. Now that there are a couple of additional spots in the area such as the Royal Palms and Lavender Lake it's easier to make it a part of your night as opposed to a destination (not that there's anything wrong with Canal Bar!).Great job Pines! I'll be back soon.",5.0
"Delicious meal, great service, wonderful experience.  My husband and I came after an archery lesson on Saturday night, needless to say we were hungry!  We shared the cabbage with boar belly, the squid with shishitos, the asparagus with poached egg, the black bass and the blade steak.  All delicious, but the cabbage and the squid ruled the day!  The service was lovely too, everyone had a warm smile.  We will be back!",5.0
"I had been wanting to check out The Pines for quite some time and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. I would recommend it to all my friends, and I plan on going back with my friends who I know will love this place as well.A bit of a trek for me, going all the way down to Gowanus, but definitely worth it.Some of the food was borderline too salty, but it didn't numb my tongue, and the food was extremely flavorful (a lot of umami), so I think it would be fine for the average American. I'm a little sensitive to salt. They have a great beverage program- you can tell that it's thoughtful, and the wine list is very easy to navigate as the grape varietal names are on the first line. We had a bottle of Lambrusco, which was amazing! A much drier and funkier Lambrusco than others that I've tried before. The staff were very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the beverage selections.We ordered the squid, duck rillette, beef tartare, cabbage with boar belly, grouper with tomato dashi, beef chuck steak and black trumpet mushroom pasta with lamb belly bacon. My absolute favorite was the chuck steak. Such great flavor in the meat!!! And amazing texture. The lamb belly in the pasta was one of my favorites too. The food was some of the best I've had in a while in NYC and the service was spot on. They were personable but also knowledgeable about the way the food was cooked.There is a sense of passion and enthusiasm that you don't find in many restaurants here.Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!",4.0
"Even during a busy Sunday dinner the staff kept their cool to maintain the great service.  Oh the squid app, warm charred cabbage, and the pork jowl were all amazing.  Can't wait to go back!",5.0
"This was our second time eating at The Pines. Food was good but expensive.  Our favorites were the duck breast and the pork jowls.  Something happened to our waiter mid way through the meal. At first he was chatty and friendly, but by mid meal he was almost surly.  Not a good vibe. We probably won't go back a third time.",3.0
"Such a lovely dinner! Me and my boyfriend went there to try a new place in the hood, and we had such a wonderful meal.The place really looks like a Berlin-based restaurant, not the usual Brooklyn-vintage-style that you can find everywhere in these days.Meal was excellent. We had appetizers of cheese selection and fish. Then two main meal of ravioli with rabbit, broccoli and cheese, and a mules seafood soup. It's really interesting how the chef mix food culture and traditions. You will be surprised! Maybe it's a little bit pricy, but it is worth. Oh and they keep bringing free samples to try new chef experiments. Can't wait to go back!",4.0
"some things were good, but the most important things were not. like, the $6 bread that was too salty to eat. and the appetizer that was too salty to eat. and the two empty glasses of wine during our meal, which is completely unacceptable when you are charging $27 for the entree. get it together. you are not in a convenient location and your hipster-ness will only get you so far.",2.0
"I'd give them five stars, except that the portions are so skimpy. Don't get me wrong: they warn you. They say you need 2-3 dishes per person, and boy are they right. If you're hungry, could be 3-4 dishes per person. But even in the world of ""small plates,"" which, admittedly, is not my thing, the portions are small. Meanwhile, the prices are not. $6 for bread and 'house-cultured' butter, $10-15 for small vegetable micro-appetizers, and $21-24 for what's a half-portion of pasta. Make no mistake: these would be high-end prices not just for Brooklyn but would hold their own in Manhattan! They are definitely not passing along their relatively inexpensive industrial zone rents to the consumer; I sure hope they pay the staff extra well!And while the atmosphere is nice and funky and lively, it's also very loud. At this price point, I'd like a little more breathing room between tables.All that being said, the food is utterly outstanding. Creative, yet simple. Amazingly flavorful. Different than what you'll get most places, unless you're a much bigger foodie than I am (and you probably are!). As much as I've just bitched about it, it's pretty close to being worth spending $70 per person (with tax and tip and a single glass of beer/wine). If you regularly spend this much and think nothing of it, definitely go for it. Bonus: they take reservations, which is more than you can say for a lot of trendy, hip, ultra-tasty places in Brooklyn!",4.0

"Gowanus is not a part of town I normally frequent, but I'm so glad I made the trip to go to The Pines. This is a casual spot that takes its food seriously - a winning combo to me. The space is super cute, with lots of artful, DIY touches. The back yard is closed until the weather warms up, but it looks like a great place to hang out.I went with a vegetarian friend so couldn't go as all out as I wanted to, but we had a great meal. The trio of breads were super homey and satisfying. That cultured butter tasted like cheese, it was so rich.The broccoli dish with yogurt, salsa verde, sunflower seeds, and horseradish - sounded like a weird combination of flavors, but this worked surprising well. Being surprised at a restaurant is a welcome experience.The trenette pasta with uni and shrimp was a little spicier than I imagined, overall a nice dish but not super memorable. My friend's borsa vuota on the other hand was phenomenal. That is some damn good pasta.Black bass with watermelon radish, brown butter dashi, and do I detect yuzu? This dish was a quiet stunner. Subtle flavors, awesome textural complements between the flesh and skin (not sure what they did to those scales, but it was fascinating to see and also delicious.) Yes.The DESSERTS though! Where the mains and apps were low-key and serious, the desserts were FUN and serious. I was so delighted by them that I laughed and clapped. Visually, they are simply gorgeous.Chocolate and beet cake - really, really beautiful, a nice subtle play of earthy flavorsParsnip, caramel, and buttermilk - not even sure how to begin to describe this. Playful plating, complex layers of flavor. Don't miss this whatever you do.Rice pudding and cara cara - not the type of dessert I would normally go for, but so glad I did. Sweet, creamy, tangy, and refreshing all at once.We had a few cocktails. They were good for sure, but maybe a little overwrought. The staff is super knowledgeable about the wine, cocktails, and food. They're not overly friendly, but I suppose it doesn't hurt to be chill when the food is so serious. I really hated the music - some glitchy hip-hop that clashed with the overall vibe - but that's not insurmountable.I'm looking forward to coming back as the seasonal menu changes.

"Apps: Bread with butter was great. Fluke tartar was well balanced in texture and beautifully plated. Foie Gras was simply done and really delicious (get it). Duck rillete was delicious, my personal favorite. The broccoli was fine but pass on it. Entree: the pork Jowl was so fatty half of it was left over to be fed to the dogs. I understand marbling but that was really not edible. The steak my friend ordered was tough and undercooked, I had spoke to the waiter about it because it was an expensive dish at $35 and she couldn't/didn't even eat it. The black bass with spaghetti squash was okay but very odd. The waitress was great and the drinks interesting. Try the baked apple drink.

"The Pines does two things really well: cocktails and giving you a block of butter to go with your small plates. While the cocktail menu is limited, they are interesting and strong.

It strangely adds an interesting experience when sipping on your cocktail. Neither of us were starving so we went with three of their small plates - cured olives, bread and salumi. The bread consists of several types on a big plate with a huge slab of herbed butter - for those on a low-carb diet, stay away from this. I loved how much butter came with our bread and salumi plate because butter makes everything better.

We got one dish at a time and just digged in when served - absolutely great way to share a meal at this spot.Drinks was out of this world as well.",5.0
"Had a really good meal with my parents here tonight. Service was all very polite and casual and accommodating. My folks don't eat mammals and I have lots of dietary restrictions, and these limits were welcomed easily and accounted for readily. We started with an amuse of whipped carrot soup with mint oil that had us all scraping our tiny glasses for the last smear. This was followed by the bread and cultured butter--this bread was so good, crackly, earthy, delicious, and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt, even more delicious. We ordered the cabbage, boar belly on the side, which was also really good if maybe a bit too salty; both pastas, one an inky round noodle with eggplant and a creamy tomato sauce, very good, and the borsa vuota with maitake mushrooms and spinach dressed with lemon and ground chestnut, which was subtle and perfect with really excellent texture. Then a much-needed pause happened, and after about 10 minutes, we were served the tilefish in broth with julienned zucchini, really very tasty, and the duck breast with brussels sprouts, sweet potato and peanut. The duck was really well cooked, crispy and chewy, and the plate was full of flavor, though again, maybe too salty. Maybe the saltedness really came along with the meat--and maybe in part because I'm not really a meat lover, I felt like the two dishes with meat in them were the least compelling, really just showcases for salt and fat (though we still cleaned those plates!). We could have had no meat at all--not even the fish, though it was good--and probably had a perfect meal.We were pretty delighted to be delivered a post-meal gastrique of fennel and ginger, which was not too sweet and tasted like a really healthful digestif. We capped the night with the lemon steamed pudding with fennel (two kinds--maybe poached and sugared/dehydrated?) and black pepper on top of a bruleed smear of meringue, drizzled with fennel seeds. Definitely not a combo I would have assembled myself, and a really great one. This meal was expensive, which is why I saved it for an occasion where my parents were paying. For three of us ordering six dishes plus dessert and a drink apiece, we made it to $200. It was great to be treated to that--my parents only come to town every couple of years--and the food was really tasty and inventive. This is definitely a special occasion-type place for me, though. For a cheaper and more casual but still very tasty meal, I'd probably head next door to Littleneck.",4.0
"Absolutely love this place!I have been there for dinner twice and went for the Superbowl recently.Since it was superbowl, I wanted some beer (coming from a wine and vodka kind of a girl), and I literally tasted every beer on the menu before deciding - with nothing but graciousness from our server.  Also had the wagyu steak, which was as delicious and tender as it was beautiful.  Even the bread and butter is homemade and rave-worthy.  Favorite part is the non-pretentious vibe, which is hard to find.  People are just themselves, and the food speaks for itself.Will definitely be back. and back and back.",5.0
"So, I decided to give The Pines another chance. The owner had kindly written to me after my first unfavorable review and invited me to return and give them a second chance. I am very glad I did. On this Sunday night, the ambiance was both relaxing and welcoming. The grating music of my previous visit was gone, replaced by a pleasant soundtrack of eclectic music that did not compete with the dining experience. My daughter and I shared a warm cabbage salad to start, which was astringent and delicious. She ordered the duck breast, crisp and succulent, and I had the pasta with lemon and mushrooms, light and flavorful. For dessert we shared a platter of soft cheeses. We took our time and never felt rushed, though the restaurant did fill up. Our waiter was very attentive but not overbearing. This experience was a complete correction to my first unpleasant visit.

That shit will cleanse my palate later!  The crudo didn't need the beef fat, but shhhhh, don't tell anyone.  Tilefish was a revelation--and the dish didn't actually need the tilefish, the accompaniments were so delish (wheatberries, rutabaga and cranberry? I don't recall--it was so good, I barely ate my delish fish).  Cray, right? The crowd was a cross of hipsters, daters and P.Slopers in pearls.  The noise level was loud and the room was HAWT (including ""it's getting hot in here"" on the sound system).  I loved it.  It was a hit.  I'll be back.  I heart 3rd Ave.",5.0

We ordered the cabbage with miatake mushrooms and boar belly bacon, the borsa vuota with chestnuts, spinach and mushrooms, the chuck steak with chanterelles,  and the chocolate cake.

"There are literally an infinite number of food combinations that can be made. From ingredients, to preparation, to plating, everything can change. It's a reason I don't eat out as much as I used to... there are a lot of places that keep doing the same old, same old. It's true that there's a reason why the classics are the classics. Lord knows that I've gotten more tacos than are actually needed, but I love that places like The Pines exist to explore new and different food combinations.Right off the bat, the Oxtail Cappellacci w/ crab brodo, buddha's hand, chickweed is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The pasta was tender and perfectly cooked, the oxtail exploded with creamy flavor, and the brodo (italian for broth I found out) was a great compliment. Totally amazing dish. I recommend it to anybody.The Pork Shoulder w/ rye berry, kohlrabi, quince was good, but the flavors didn't hit a home run. While the pork was cooked nicely, I kept hoping everything would sort of become extraordinary in my mouth, and it didn't.On a kind of similar note, I liked the Yam w/ buttermilk, sardine, brussel sprouts, but it wasn't amazing. The buttermilk was creamy and nice with the yam. And while I really like brussel sprouts, they were just sort of ""there"" rather than a part of the dish. They tasted good though.I had read about the Apples w/ sheep's milk, sesame, som, and was excited to try it. Most of the time when I think about eating apples, textures like ""crisp"" and ""juicy"" come to mind. But this dish would best be described as ""creamy crunchy"". It was a good combination with subtle flavors.Normally, I'm not a big fan of olives, but it tasted like they cured them in house, which is great. The dried peppers, radish, white balsamic also totally worked, and I think I ate more olives at that meal than I have at any other. The juice was so good that I dipped other stuff in it.And speaking of bread, what they served was fine, if a little bit too crusty for my taste. But holy moly, the caraway butter was fantastic. And putting it on rye bread was like mana from heaven.The Jicama w/ coconut, pancetta, sea beans was pretty good too. To be honest, I don't eat a lot of jicama, so I don't have a lot to compare it too, but it was a bit crunchy and refreshing.One of my friends commented that he enjoyed eating nice food in more humble establishments like this, because it takes a lot of the pretense out of the meal. I had to agree. I like fancy schmancy restaurants, but places like this will hopefully prove that the white table cloths aren't necessary.If I had one big complaint though, it was the service. They didn't seem to remember that I had made a reservation about a month prior. It luckily didn't matter, since we arrived pretty early, but it could have been an issue. I was also not informed that groups six and larger all eat from essentially the same tasting menu, because of their small kitchen. We didn't have a problem with this, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time.It also said on the menu that they enjoy making substitutions to meals, which struck me as really interesting, and the opposite from what most places are like. And being that we had one person in our group who was a pescetarian, and another who didn't eat dairy or gluten, they certainly got their wish.Lastly, let's talk about cocktails, because they had some great ones. The all-star, in my opinion, was the Baked Apple. You get a brandy snifter that's filled with smoke, and has a small, metal plate on top of it to trap the smoke. The waiter then removes the plate, letting the smoke escape, and pours in a wonderful combination of bourbon, scotch, honey crisp apple, maple bitters, and fall herbs. It was smoky, sweet and packed a punch.Their eponymous drink was also very good. Rye, douglas fir, bitters, yuzu. Like the food, not ingredients that you would normally put together, but a good drink.I also got a Verano Cesar, which has tequila, hibiscus, cucumber, lime, soda. It was light, refreshing, and didn't overpower you with tequila. My friend, who doesn't like tequila tried it and liked it so much, she got her own. That's the sign of a well thought out drink.They also had High West Double Rye on their shelf, and I asked if the bartender could make me a Manhattan with it. They did, but I was informed that they don't have cherries, but would make a substitution. I'm not sure what they put in its place (maybe gooseberry?) but it worked, and I was happy.",4.0
"I went to The Pines yesterday, pleasantly surprised that they had started brunch service earlier this month. We were seated right away. Loved the ambiance, and every staff member was professional and courteous.The food? Delicious. Starting with the french-pressed coffee (you get your own little press at the table that beeps when it's ready to pour) and amazing bread, the entire meal was a solid five stars. Seriously, their carraway brioche was so good that I wish I could have a bit with my coffee at work each morning. I sipped on a grimosa (grapefruit and champagne), while the beau drank a bloody mary. For those of you that want to drink a bloody mary instead of eating it, get it here: they have the essence of horseradish without those little pieces floating in it. Clear, really refreshing.Our entrees were delicious as well: the mushroom hash had a nice spicy kick to it, and the apples were light and fresh with sheeps milk yogurt and house-made granola. I can't speak for the carnivores in my party, but their satisfied faces and pats on the belly afterwards made it clear that the chorizo and fried egg were equally tasty.It's a little pricey (and it's cash only), but I didn't have that sense of regret I sometimes have when I feel I spent too much on food that comes up short. The Pines doesn't come up short in any aspect. As we were leaving, we took a peek at the spacious backyard and found out they make s'mores when the weather is nicer, so in case we weren't going to make a return trip, that sealed the deal.",5.0
Really good addition to 3rd ave. The wait staff were very nice and super helpful. The drinks are delicious and the food was exceptional. Friendly atmosphere and great local food.This remains one of my favorite spots in this part of Brooklyn.,5.0
"A needle in a haystack!  This is from the same guys that opened Littleneck down the block, and is a needed addition to the neighborhood.The Pines is the closest to contemporary fine dining you can get in the Gowanus/Park Slope neighborhood.  We went here on an off-night (maybe a Tuesday) with a brunch of friends, and were immediately accomodated.  We decided to go family style, ordering a bunch of dishes.As we ordered a variety of dishes, I will just go with the hits.  The amuse-bouche was refreshing.  The bread was awesome.  Nicely crusty, and the salty butter was off the chain.  The oxtail cappellacci is a can't-miss.  Pasta was cooked to perfection, and the oxtail was divine.  The pork shoulder was also very tastyOverall, a much-needed restaurant in this part of town, and I will definitely be coming back.",4.0
"An adventure in eating!I love The Pines because it feels like every time I go, I get to learn about a new food item or cooking technique I've never heard of. Go with your adventurous friends and ask questions, go with the servers' recommendations, just enjoy yourself! This is a place that feels like it was designed by a chef who makes what he feels like eating - very exciting, delicious and flavorful dishes. Also, cool music and a funky atmosphere inside.I've never tried the backyard grill, but it looks like they have a casual, tasty menu online and I'd love to check it out. This place is pure Gowanus awesomeness!A casual, hip spot to try something new.",5.0
"Don't pay attention to all the 4s on here. They are just trying to be trendy and watching too much of the food network.  Small portions, average to below average food. Anyone know a good pizza place to go to after this in gowanus?  Want to check my credibility - sorry I give 4 stars to st anselm, kuma inn, tomoe, hibino, Lugers, raoul's - save yourself a trip. Extremely mediocre.",2.0
"Absolutely delicious! Went to The Pines with two other adventurous eaters and opted for the cheese appetizer (2 for $10), 3 of the ""Markets"" (~$15 per plate) and the Rabbit (yes, Rabbit) for 2 (around $60).  The bread accompanying the cheese was perfectly crusty and chewy  but the cheese selection was pretty small. ""Cabbage"" was a highlight and it came sauteed with Maitake mushrooms and some type of crispy pancetta/bacon. I really wanted to eat the whole plate by myself. ""Carrot"" was well dressed but I don't remember much of the accompanying elements. ""Gem Lettuce"" was the only salad type place they had and was very refreshing. Dressing was on point and the bonito flakes added an umami flavor that resembled the addition of anchovis in a ceasar salad. Now the Rabbit...It came 4 ways... 1) In a ragu sauce over housemade pasta 2) the leg confit 3) the loin wrapped in bacon 4) the ribs (or really...rib-lets). The first course of the rabbit ragu was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. It had such an earthy, rich taste that was appropriately brightened with herbs. We pretty much licked the bowl clean. While the other rabbit items were all tender, rich and delicious, the plate lacked something to tie it all together. It came with shaved raw maitakes that were OK but didn't really add much to the dish. I think it really needed a shmear of polenta or some type of starch to get more of an ""entre"" feel. Overall, left very satisfied and excited to come back. Definitely on the high end for price but you get what you pay for and a menu that changes daily based on local/farm ingredients isn't cheap.",4.0

"I cant say enough good things about my experience at the Pines. The staff was amazing.. friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, fun, etc etc. The food was just as good, if not better. I'm a vegetarian (I know, I know) so given the menu, I was really just going to the pines for my significant other. They were very accommodating to me... and the veggie stuff should DEFINITELY be put on the menu. The veggie pasta is to die for. Seriously. My favorite app was also the gem lettuce... much better then it sounds. I wish this restaurant was closer to me, so I could go every night. HIGHLY recommended",5.0
"Had a great experience here last night!  I had to chime in since the mixed reviews on here had me hesitating- but now I'm convinced that The Pines is well worth the trek.We sat inside since the bar menu outside is limited to small plates; the garden is sweet and would make a great weekend afternoon drinking spot.  $3 Budweisers make that likely in my future.Our window table was slightly awkward but the decor is Brooklyn semi-fance and comfortable.  It wasn't too packed; it was nice to have a reservation and we were seated right away.Service was above and beyond.  When we waited a bit too long for our drinks, they were comped- and we never waited too long between courses.  Our lovely server was attentive & generous with her time, since the cryptic menu begs for explanation.  I went with her recommendations and was impressed with: the variety on the salumi plate, the decadence of the fois gras (could be a dessert), and the rich simplicity of my duck agnolatti.  All could have used a bit more of their amazing bread for dipping and spreading, but when we asked, we received- so plus points for less waste!The dessert menu was surprisingly slim, but when the savory menu is ever-changing, you can't be fooling around with your sweets every night.  Overall I was impressed with the ingredients, simplicity & share-ability.  I'd love to try the outside bar menu, and whatever they invent as the seasons change!         The somewhat high price point will keep this place reserved for special occasions- this is still next to Gowanus, after all.  That being said, I look forward to the next special occasion!",4.0

"I went to The Pines yesterday, pleasantly surprised that they had started brunch service earlier this month. We were seated right away. Loved the ambiance, and every staff member was professional and courteous.The food? Delicious. Starting with the french-pressed coffee (you get your own little press at the table that beeps when it's ready to pour) and amazing bread, the entire meal was a solid five stars. Seriously, their carraway brioche was so good that I wish I could have a bit with my coffee at work each morning. I sipped on a grimosa (grapefruit and champagne), while the beau drank a bloody mary. For those of you that want to drink a bloody mary instead of eating it, get it here: they have the essence of horseradish without those little pieces floating in it. Clear, really refreshing.Our entrees were delicious as well: the mushroom hash had a nice spicy kick to it, and the apples were light and fresh with sheeps milk yogurt and house-made granola. I can't speak for the carnivores in my party, but their satisfied faces and pats on the belly afterwards made it clear that the chorizo and fried egg were equally tasty.It's a little pricey (and it's cash only), but I didn't have that sense of regret I sometimes have when I feel I spent too much on food that comes up short. The Pines doesn't come up short in any aspect. As we were leaving, we took a peek at the spacious backyard and found out they make s'mores when the weather is nicer, so in case we weren't going to make a return trip, that sealed the deal.",5.0
Really good addition to 3rd ave. The wait staff were very nice and super helpful. The drinks are delicious and the food was exceptional. Friendly atmosphere and great local food.This remains one of my favorite spots in this part of Brooklyn.,5.0
"A needle in a haystack!  This is from the same guys that opened Littleneck down the block, and is a needed addition to the neighborhood.The Pines is the closest to contemporary fine dining you can get in the Gowanus/Park Slope neighborhood.  We went here on an off-night (maybe a Tuesday) with a brunch of friends, and were immediately accomodated.  We decided to go family style, ordering a bunch of dishes.As we ordered a variety of dishes, I will just go with the hits.  The amuse-bouche was refreshing.  The bread was awesome.  Nicely crusty, and the salty butter was off the chain.  The oxtail cappellacci is a can't-miss.  Pasta was cooked to perfection, and the oxtail was divine.  The pork shoulder was also very tastyOverall, a much-needed restaurant in this part of town, and I will definitely be coming back.",4.0
"An adventure in eating!I love The Pines because it feels like every time I go, I get to learn about a new food item or cooking technique I've never heard of. Go with your adventurous friends and ask questions, go with the servers' recommendations, just enjoy yourself! This is a place that feels like it was designed by a chef who makes what he feels like eating - very exciting, delicious and flavorful dishes. Also, cool music and a funky atmosphere inside.I've never tried the backyard grill, but it looks like they have a casual, tasty menu online and I'd love to check it out. This place is pure Gowanus awesomeness!A casual, hip spot to try something new.",5.0
"Don't pay attention to all the 4s on here. They are just trying to be trendy and watching too much of the food network.  Small portions, average to below average food. Anyone know a good pizza place to go to after this in gowanus?  Want to check my credibility - sorry I give 4 stars to st anselm, kuma inn, tomoe, hibino, Lugers, raoul's - save yourself a trip. Extremely mediocre.",2.0
"Absolutely delicious! Went to The Pines with two other adventurous eaters and opted for the cheese appetizer (2 for $10), 3 of the ""Markets"" (~$15 per plate) and the Rabbit (yes, Rabbit) for 2 (around $60).  The bread accompanying the cheese was perfectly crusty and chewy  but the cheese selection was pretty small. ""Cabbage"" was a highlight and it came sauteed with Maitake mushrooms and some type of crispy pancetta/bacon. I really wanted to eat the whole plate by myself. ""Carrot"" was well dressed but I don't remember much of the accompanying elements. ""Gem Lettuce"" was the only salad type place they had and was very refreshing. Dressing was on point and the bonito flakes added an umami flavor that resembled the addition of anchovis in a ceasar salad. Now the Rabbit...It came 4 ways... 1) In a ragu sauce over housemade pasta 2) the leg confit 3) the loin wrapped in bacon 4) the ribs (or really...rib-lets). The first course of the rabbit ragu was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. It had such an earthy, rich taste that was appropriately brightened with herbs. We pretty much licked the bowl clean. While the other rabbit items were all tender, rich and delicious, the plate lacked something to tie it all together. It came with shaved raw maitakes that were OK but didn't really add much to the dish. I think it really needed a shmear of polenta or some type of starch to get more of an ""entre"" feel. Overall, left very satisfied and excited to come back. Definitely on the high end for price but you get what you pay for and a menu that changes daily based on local/farm ingredients isn't cheap.",4.0
Best meal I have had in a while. Pork jowl was amazing as well as the squid-ink romesco. Great bartenders and service.,5.0
"I cant say enough good things about my experience at the Pines. The staff was amazing.. friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, fun, etc etc. The food was just as good, if not better. I'm a vegetarian (I know, I know) so given the menu, I was really just going to the pines for my significant other. They were very accommodating to me... and the veggie stuff should DEFINITELY be put on the menu. The veggie pasta is to die for. Seriously. My favorite app was also the gem lettuce... much better then it sounds. I wish this restaurant was closer to me, so I could go every night. HIGHLY recommended",5.0
"Had a great experience here last night!  I had to chime in since the mixed reviews on here had me hesitating- but now I'm convinced that The Pines is well worth the trek.We sat inside since the bar menu outside is limited to small plates; the garden is sweet and would make a great weekend afternoon drinking spot.  $3 Budweisers make that likely in my future.Our window table was slightly awkward but the decor is Brooklyn semi-fance and comfortable.  It wasn't too packed; it was nice to have a reservation and we were seated right away.Service was above and beyond.  When we waited a bit too long for our drinks, they were comped- and we never waited too long between courses.  Our lovely server was attentive & generous with her time, since the cryptic menu begs for explanation.  I went with her recommendations and was impressed with: the variety on the salumi plate, the decadence of the fois gras (could be a dessert), and the rich simplicity of my duck agnolatti.  All could have used a bit more of their amazing bread for dipping and spreading, but when we asked, we received- so plus points for less waste!The dessert menu was surprisingly slim, but when the savory menu is ever-changing, you can't be fooling around with your sweets every night.  Overall I was impressed with the ingredients, simplicity & share-ability.  I'd love to try the outside bar menu, and whatever they invent as the seasons change!         The somewhat high price point will keep this place reserved for special occasions- this is still next to Gowanus, after all.  That being said, I look forward to the next special occasion!",4.0

Nobody came over at any point in time to ask if we wanted another drink which was interesting.  After we were done, again another wait for the desert menu. And lastly to get the check, was painful as well as getting someone to take our money.  Overall, while the food was good, service needs to be ramped up.  I counted at least 4 people on the floor and this is a small restaurant so there was no reason for poor service.",2.0
"Was super excited to check out The Pines. Happened to get right in on a snowy night. The good : cocktails. anything they made was great, but the menu was a bit over the top. ordering a solid cocktail was the way to go. The bad : No olives, dont expect a martini. The service. So awkward and in a way pushy to order. The food menu was strange and lackluster. A cheese plate with one cheese, a meat plate with a giant hunk of butter. This place blasts sort of raunchy hip hop that really does not fit in with the 'anthropologie' style of the entire. All around too bad.",1.0
"Exceptional food with interesting and intensely flavorful combinations.  The whole meal is like a delicious science experiment for your mouth!  The ambiance is rustic and charming.  BUT the BEST part about this place is the owner who takes a genuine interest and concern in the customers to make sure they have an enjoyable experience. Exceptionally nice guy who is invested in the people of the neighborhood and not just solely interested in turning a profit, which is a rare find in a restaurateur in NYC!

"An excellent meal; if it was a bit more reasonably priced, I would feel comfortable with a 5 star review.  Unfortunately, unlike their sister-restraurant Littleneck, you are paying for every penny of enjoyment you are getting at The Pines. We were a table for four.  We were greeted by a host who told us there would be a 90 minute wait, but also that we were the next table of the list.  I scanned the room and saw people halfway through their entrees--I said, ""you think those people will be there for another hour and a half?""  He said, ""well, I was just being conservative.""  One drink at Canal Bar and 45 minutes later, we were seated.  The Room: I love the ambiance of this place.  It has a great vibe and the seating choices are excellent.  Also, the backyard looks amazing for when it gets warm.  Definitely a great date spot.  The Drinks: 14 dollars for cocktails is pretty annoying, even if they are excellent.  14 dollars for a cocktail that I could finish in 3-5 sips, sucks even more.  The cocktails are beautifully presented, but should be 11 dollars.  The Food: We had the Apples (really great), the greens (should be more in the serving--ordered two of them), and the sweet potato (a knockout) to start.  I think the appetizers were all great, the apple and sweet potato were 5 star dishes, the greens probably a 3.5.   For entrees, we shared the streak and tileflish, and I loved both.  The steak was prepared perfectly and the titlefish was also delicious.We had dessert as well, but it was not particularly memorable.  Overall, I really liked the Pines.  But if I am choosing between Littleneck and the Pines in the future, I will likely return to Littleneck first because there is a lot more bang for your buck.",4.0

"My overall experience at The Pines was wonderful. We arrived as walk ins while it was already quite busy. We grabbed drinks from the bar and headed out to the courtyard. While waiting we enjoyed sitting beside a campfire. The owner of the restaurant was outside and offered us S'mores. We passed on them, but enjoyed them after dinner. Our first course was the Testa, a dish that we had no idea what to expect. It was quite good. The mix of head cheese, huckleberries and celery was a great combination.Next we had the Jicama salad.The combination and textures of the jicama, coconut and sea urchin were unique and interesting. I was not crazy about the salad, but I did find it to be very fun and inventive compared to my average salad.Next came the Bone Marrow. Having never had marrow before I was nervous and excited at what the experience would be like. I must say I loved it. The presentation was excellent. A large, natural dish with heaping portions of bread beside it.Next arrived the Monk Fish. I enjoyed this plate very much, especially the broth it came in..Our final dish was what knocked my socks off. The Ox Tail Cappelacci with shaved black truffle on top. These flavorful little envelopes possessed the stinky truffle aroma; and a flavor that was incredible. I think I could eat these every day. The environment was very warm, conversations sparked with tables beside us about the food and wine. It was very fun to interact with the other diners, which I find doesnt happen all that frequently. The service was great. My glass was always full with the cucumber infused water, and my wine was always filled without me even noticing. The servers were also knowledgable about the food and the wine offerings. After the meal we returned outside and enjoyed the fire and friendly conversations with patrons and staff members.An excellent evening!",5.0

"I never write reviews, but my wife and I had such amazing food here I had to take the time to do so.  Starting with our well crafted and unique cocktails then moving onto every beautiful shared plate that was brought out to us, each item was wonderfully delicious.  We loved it so much that it was the first place we both thought of when we picked a place for a Valentine's day dinner.  I highly recommend The Pines for a date or dinner with friends or family.",5.0
"My overall experience at The Pines was wonderful. We arrived as walk ins while it was already quite busy. We grabbed drinks from the bar and headed out to the courtyard. While waiting we enjoyed sitting beside a campfire. The owner of the restaurant was outside and offered us S'mores. We passed on them, but enjoyed them after dinner. Our first course was the Testa, a dish that we had no idea what to expect. It was quite good. The mix of head cheese, huckleberries and celery was a great combination.Next we had the Jicama salad.The combination and textures of the jicama, coconut and sea urchin were unique and interesting. I was not crazy about the salad, but I did find it to be very fun and inventive compared to my average salad.Next came the Bone Marrow. Having never had marrow before I was nervous and excited at what the experience would be like. I must say I loved it. The presentation was excellent. A large, natural dish with heaping portions of bread beside it.Next arrived the Monk Fish. I enjoyed this plate very much, especially the broth it came in..Our final dish was what knocked my socks off. The Ox Tail Cappelacci with shaved black truffle on top. These flavorful little envelopes possessed the stinky truffle aroma; and a flavor that was incredible. I think I could eat these every day. The environment was very warm, conversations sparked with tables beside us about the food and wine. It was very fun to interact with the other diners, which I find doesnt happen all that frequently. The service was great. My glass was always full with the cucumber infused water, and my wine was always filled without me even noticing. The servers were also knowledgable about the food and the wine offerings. After the meal we returned outside and enjoyed the fire and friendly conversations with patrons and staff members.An excellent evening!",5.0
"Awesome food, great drinks, nice backyard. Nice little spot in out of the way Gowanus has lots of cutting edge food with a menu that is totally different every time we go. My favorite is sitting in the back yard with their extensive french cider menu (wine bottle sized, perfect for two people), their big selection of natural and interesting wines, and a lot of the really interesting modern styled cooking (foams, sous vide, etc.) that makes for great meat dishes that aren't just big steaks plopped on a plate.",5.0
"With an ever changing menu, I wouldn't want to recommend anything that may not be available so the only thing I can recommend is EVERYTHING! As it is all unique, delicious and like nothing you'll have anywhere else. Very cool place, they get the brooklyn chic right without being cliche and there is a great overall vibe. The kitchen is packed with young masterminds and their excellent food coupled with very nice service makes for a great experience. Will be back often.",5.0

"It's as if the chef of The Pines went on an Italian joyride with Lil Wayne, Jackson Pollock, and a bunch of local burly Italian chefs and they all did head stands and drank excessive amounts of Hennessy and tripped on shots of pork infused seafood butter and deep earth funk and they heard the earth whisper her secrets and Angelo was the only one who made it out. Once you see the platings and taste the food for yourself, you'll understand. The chef, Angelo Romano, is doing something very true to the ingredients but completely unique and from his own school of thought. Very fun, surprising, and delicious.The menu reads deceptively simple, but behind the scenes the art of cooking is absolutely complex. The understanding of hitting all the flavor notes is incredible, the tastes are all sublimely constructed.Some faves: Oxtail agnolotti in crab brodo, the apples in sheepsmilk, the mussels & pasta, the steak, the japanese grilled half lobster... really, EVERYthing... didn't have a miss, and we tasted the whole menu. I especially recommend all the handmade pastas and any course with shellfish.Hands Down, Top 5 Restaurants to open in 2012.

"Are you fucking kidding me? A restaurant where a light meal comes out to $140 taking cash only?  HOW IS THE IRS NOT AUDITING THE SHIT OUT OF THIS SHITHOLE?  I was so tempted to not tip and just tell the servers to get their tips from their obvious tax-cheat boss. The octopus was good - it's hard to fuck up octopus.  The umi/sea urchin/whatever was the most disgusting food I have ever eaten.  I have no idea what they did to the texture or how they cooked it but the chef managed the seemingly impossible - make one of my favorite foods utterly inedible.  I seriously felt sick after my first bite.  The pork shoulder, which our inattentive waitress recommended, was basically thick slabs of pastrami.

"I took my husband there a couple of weeks ago for his birthday. I e-mailed the restaurant to make a reservation for the 5 course tasting menu and to find out if they can accommodate all of my food allergies. The chef came through for me big time. The food was incredible!!!!! Roasted carrots with a pistachio pesto, risotto with sea urchin and lobster, roasted cauliflower, red cabbage and hen of the wood mushrooms served with a slightly spicy scallion sauce., were just some of the dishes. Course after course the meal just kept getting better and better! I look forward to going back!!!!!!The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the wine selection. The wines are organic and bio-dynamic, but these are funky and odd tasting. We were able to taste a few and i chose the least weird. The wines are expensive for what they are, ranging in price from $14-$19 a glass. If they were really good the price would not have been an issue.",4.0

She very kindly replaced it with an odd sweet potato dish free of charge. It definitely was edible, and thoughtfully put together, but too abrasive for an appetizer. The pici & ragu -- well, if you've had one fancy ragu, you've had'em all. The ""pici"" are basically wonton noodles and the bowl its served in hints at wonton also.

"I made the awful mistake of having ""brunch"" at The Pines yesterday and it was by far my worst dining experience in the 20 years I've lived in NYC.  Let me recap:I arrive solo at 12:45 for a 1pm table of 5.  When I arrive the place was dead, and also ~5 degrees warmer than the heat-waved sidewalk.I ask for a bloody mary and the bartender says I'm lucky bc they only have enough mix left for about 3.  I ask what time brunch ends and she said 3pm. I mentioned that we have a table of 5 coming in and asked if she'd put aside one drink's worth for the bday boy (which she did).  When I mentioned having a reservation she looked puzzled and said that there were no reservations in the book for today.  I should note that a non NYer in my group found this place and made the reservation, and she did so about two weeks back.  I looked at the book with her, which had no entries in the time/date grid, and then spotted our reservation written small in the corner, versus being on the grid.  Odd.Anyhow, I remained optimisted and glanced the menu, which was about as anti-brunch as any brunch menu I've ever seen. A total of seven items -- three of them fish -- with no eggs or anything else remotely brunch-like.  I remained positive while chatting with the bartender and mentioned that it was a very whimsical menu, and asked her what her favorite item was.  She went through the list saying why each dish was great (not what I asked her) and then went on to mention that they might already be out of a couple of their [seven] choices.  Really?! At this point my spidey senses were tingling big time.My party arrives [on time] and we're sat.  By that time a pretty decent crowd had amassed in the dining room, which was somewhat reassuring.  We were given warm, ice-less water (in their hotter-than-outside restaurant) and proceed to sit for -- I shit you not -- 45 minutes with nothing but our warm water.  We asked for ice and they eventually came back with a water pitcher that had a handful of mostly melted ice cubes at the top, and then went on to top off our warm water glasses (making almost no difference to the temp).  To confirm, we did place a drink order about 30 minutes prior, at which time they announced the lack of bloody mix (short of the one they saved for me) and so the rest of the table ordered their only other drink option -- a grapefruit juice mimosa.  After we got our 45 minute melted ice refresh we asked about the drinks, only to find out they they WERE OUT OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICE.  We should have walked out at that point but I refrained from pushing bc I already had the person in my group who chose the place feeling bad, and I could tell she wanted to ride it out and seen if the food brought any redemption (it didn't).  Anyway, we were told that they were at that very moment squeezing fresh OJ to get us drinks (never even asked if orange was ok).  15 minutes later (the ONE HOUR mark), we were brought the most lackluster mimosas ever, most of the let down being the 45 minute wait for the drinks to arrive.  I should also note, btw, that the bloody mary mix was absolute crap: Watery, no horseradish, extremely underwhelming.  Oh, and they used a jigger to measure out the single shot of vodka, so it was both crappy AND stingy.So somewhere in that first hour we placed our food order -- never being told they were out of anything -- and when the meal finally dropped (at 2:15pm -- the first food we've seen all day, including no bread, for our 1pm reservation), we find out that, AFTER ALL THAT TIME, one of the items ordered was out, which amounted to one of us not being served anything.  So four of us sat there with food, sharing portions with the 5th, while the kitchen ""scrambled""  to bring out the alternate dish they recommended to our unlucky party member: some salmon crudo.  It took them 15 minutes to throw together a plate that consisted of 5 pieces of salmon sashimi strewn amidst pieces of torn rye sandwich bread (with a sauce drizzle of some sort).  THAT took 15 minutes??!!  Christ, after all we've been through they should have had that out in 15 SECONDS, especially given what a simple/boring dish it was.  The rest of us were done when the salmon finally arrived.The entire meal should have been comped. It wasn't (very little was).  The Pines should be ashamed of itself for their disgraceful performance. Amateur hour x1000.

"It pains me a little bit to give the Pines 3 stars.  I adore its older seester Littleneck, and I was so excited to give this landlubber sibling a try.  It just did not come close to what we were expecting and left us with a decent, but sadly not a very memorable meal.We got there on a weekend evening around 9 and there was a 40 minute wait.  No big deal, went to Canal Bar for a drink and the Pines staff nicely called within half and hour.  Interior of the restaurant is purposefully shabby rustic, with an antiquey feel throughout.  A few bottles of wine and one of the appetizers were no longer available - ok on the appetizer, but perhaps the wine shortage can be avoided by keeping more in stock, especially on a weekend evening?Started off fun, got the amuse bouche while Biggie's ""Juicy"" was playing.  Orange wedge over a tofu cream, refreshing.  Then we started with the bone marrow appetizer, which is topped with tobiko and chickweed, and served with olive bread.  Olive bread was torn by hand, warm and deliciously crusty.  Scooping the bone marrow on to the bread, it was a nice dish.  I liked the tobiko addition texturally, had no idea why the chickweed was on top as it seemed like a hinderance on the dish to be pushed aside to get to the marrow.  Large bone, not so much marrow, but tasty.   Seemed to need some salt or something to bring out the marrow.  Next, the much touted pici, thick strands of pasta with trotter ragu.  Decent dish, nothing revelatory, simple but a little doughy.  Tiny pieces of pork were tasty but scarce.  Main dishes were decent, especially the skirt steak - beautifully sliced and presented, tasty with beefy flavor.  However, the evening was soured by the pork shoulder dish which was truly a little odd on the palate.  Some of the pieces were very fatty and chewy (not in a good way) and the nduja (a spicy spreadable sausage saucey residue - and lots of it) was really offputting.  Had a cornmeal texture which did not go well with the pork and its spice overwhelmed the delicate pork.  I really think the Pines should rethink this dish, as we love spicy dishes and pork, and especially spicy pork dishes, but this one fell flat.  We did not have dessert which is a choice of gelatos.For the prices the Pines is charging, there needs to be more than a loud soundtrack, beavis and butthead scrawled on a menu, and random ingredients thrown in because they sound exotic.   Things need to come togerher so that a restaurant sticks around past the hype.  Overall, I'd like to give the Pines another shot as its success will be integral to Gowanus' culinary boom, but the night we went was not its night.  Cash only.",3.0
"Sunday night at 6:30 pm.  That's when we walked to The Pines because they don't take reservations for parties under six people and we really really wanted to try the food at The Pines.  We were not disappointed.We started with the La Quercia prosciutto.  Ahhh... buttery good and tasty.  And if it wasn't buttery enough, butter on the plate to slather on the rustic bread that accompanied the meat.Do you like bone marrow?  Then try the dish served up at The Pines.  Soft juicy and scraped from the bone, it was flavorful and wonderful.Pasta called ""pici"" served al dente and with ""trotter"" which from the taste was a rich gamey pork.  Covered in tomato and pecorino cheese.

"After a wildly negative experience months back, my dining partner-in-crime/BFF and I decided to give The Pines another chance. Why not? We both read some great reviews from trusted sources, so we felt like we must've gotten them on an off night. Or something. So we went back for dinner on a rainy, muggy Tuesday evening, and the place was packed. I did have some flashbacks to being deserted at our table for several minutes, but all anxious thoughts were forgotten soon into this meal.Our plan of attack was one dish from each section (minus the pasta). We had a very attentive and knowledgeable waiter, who even swapped out our first glasses of wine that for us were simply not enjoyable. Apparently they dig the earthy, funky varietals at this place. Okay. So long as I get wine that I can drink, I'm cool with that. The kitchen surprised us with an amuse-bouche - a delightful sorbetto with mint. We got some hudson valley goat/cow's milk cheese blend to start, which comes with a hefty hunk of crusty bread. A promising beginning. We moved onto a spicy octopus with melon. Mmm. Hot and sweet, very nice. We also got a cucumber dish that had different types of cucumbers stacked neatly. Very inventive, simple yet smart and balanced. And finally, duck. With a smoky barbecue-like sauce. It almost tasted as if the duck was smoked in some way, but I think it was just the sauce. Who knows. I do know it was delicious and we demolished the plate, along with everything else. With a surprise dessert from the kitchen to top it off, we left with very good tastes in our mouths (literally and figuratively this time, thankfully). My only complaint was the pacing: the cheese, octopus and cucumber appetizers were thrown at us within three minutes of each other, even though our waiter gave us a bit of an itinerary for the night which specifically involved cheese first, then the other apps as they came out of the kitchen, then the duck. After the onslaught of appetizers, we waited an absurdly long amount of time for our duck entree, to the point that we were a little concerned they had forgotten about it.So now I get it. The Pines serves inventive, creative, well thought-out dishes that with a little more focus as they seem to have now that they've been open for some time, is well worth it.",4.0
"I have been here at least half a dozen times, however never for brunch, the menu changes quite often which is great because i tend to get stuck in routine at my favorite restaurants.  Anyway I especially enjoyed the 2 rabbit dishes, i've never had rabbit before and I was pleasantly surprised!  When i can swing it I always get the Wag-yu steak, they have some secrete way of cooking it that the chef tried to explain to me but I'm no foodie so i cant tell you what it was.  The ""Ants on a log"" desert is probably my favorite of all time, its just so friggin clever!  The rest of the menu is really creative and fun and I have never been totally disappointed in anything i ordered, I would always recommend the salumi plate for starters! I think the food is quite unique even for brooklyn, and the booze selection is quite good (I don't drink wine!).  DON'T TELL ANYONE! but sometimes on the weekends they have a free DIY S'mores bar by the fire pit in the back yard, hardly anyone ever ventures back there, but its a super sweet treat to end any meal! especially if anyone in your group smokes...lol.  My only gripe about this place is that they don't have a burger on the menu, ever! and I'm pretty sure they take credit cards now.",5.0

"I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short. This place isn't on par with Roberta's. I don't know how they managed this, but the pork shoulder and duck breast had an identical consistency. The pork shoulder was good but not fantastic. The duck breast was pretty good. The best part of our meal was the amuse-bouche and the bread (which is incredible). Overall I was disappointed and feel that we overpaid for the quality of food.The wine selection is pretty good. Supposedly the cocktails are great, but I didn't have any...probably should have.",2.0
"WAY too expensive for the amount of  food. I'm not some glutinous American either but it was just shameful for that area. On the other hand, it was very delicious! The interior was really cool, great wines, and amazing cheese appetizer. I got the oxtail entree which was great. My husband got the pork shoulder aka 5 bite sized pieces of fat which was pretty disappointing. It may be difficult to get him to go back for a second try but I thought the quality and pairings of food was interesting. Sadly not the prices:( OH and the menu is the horribly designed, please straiten out the content so people can actually understand what goes with what... apparently the two tables who sat next to us also agree with me on this.",3.0
"an incredible meal was had at the pines. this spot is a little pricey - with 2 drinks (1 mixed, 1 beer) and a shared entree - we still spent $200 with tip. that said, we also made our way through the menu from top to bottom starting with the cheese plate. it comes with an outstanding amount of breads and delicious cheeses. we asked for some of the caraway butter (which comes with the bread dish, not the cheese dish).  I recommend you ask for and taste before leaving. we made our way next to the foie gras which was velvety rich and divine - just like you want and expect your foie gras to be!next we had the persling salad with egg. this was a nice ""in between""  to have after the foi gras and before hitting the next two entrees that we ordered. razor clam pasta was fresh and flavorful (however our least favorite dish of them all). our last dish was the waygu beef with kimchi and it was just melt in your mouth outstanding. too full for dessert, we rolled out of there still talking about the amazing meal that was had at the pines!",4.0
"I made the awful mistake of having ""brunch"" at The Pines yesterday and it was by far my worst dining experience in the 20 years I've lived in NYC.  Let me recap:I arrive solo at 12:45 for a 1pm table of 5.  When I arrive the place was dead, and also ~5 degrees warmer than the heat-waved sidewalk.I ask for a bloody mary and the bartender says I'm lucky bc they only have enough mix left for about 3.  I ask what time brunch ends and she said 3pm. I mentioned that we have a table of 5 coming in and asked if she'd put aside one drink's worth for the bday boy (which she did).  When I mentioned having a reservation she looked puzzled and said that there were no reservations in the book for today.  I should note that a non NYer in my group found this place and made the reservation, and she did so about two weeks back.  I looked at the book with her, which had no entries in the time/date grid, and then spotted our reservation written small in the corner, versus being on the grid.  Odd.Anyhow, I remained optimisted and glanced the menu, which was about as anti-brunch as any brunch menu I've ever seen. A total of seven items -- three of them fish -- with no eggs or anything else remotely brunch-like.  I remained positive while chatting with the bartender and mentioned that it was a very whimsical menu, and asked her what her favorite item was.  She went through the list saying why each dish was great (not what I asked her) and then went on to mention that they might already be out of a couple of their [seven] choices.  Really?! At this point my spidey senses were tingling big time.My party arrives [on time] and we're sat.  By that time a pretty decent crowd had amassed in the dining room, which was somewhat reassuring.  We were given warm, ice-less water (in their hotter-than-outside restaurant) and proceed to sit for -- I shit you not -- 45 minutes with nothing but our warm water.  We asked for ice and they eventually came back with a water pitcher that had a handful of mostly melted ice cubes at the top, and then went on to top off our warm water glasses (making almost no difference to the temp).  To confirm, we did place a drink order about 30 minutes prior, at which time they announced the lack of bloody mix (short of the one they saved for me) and so the rest of the table ordered their only other drink option -- a grapefruit juice mimosa.  After we got our 45 minute melted ice refresh we asked about the drinks, only to find out they they WERE OUT OF GRAPEFRUIT JUICE.  We should have walked out at that point but I refrained from pushing bc I already had the person in my group who chose the place feeling bad, and I could tell she wanted to ride it out and seen if the food brought any redemption (it didn't).  Anyway, we were told that they were at that very moment squeezing fresh OJ to get us drinks (never even asked if orange was ok).  15 minutes later (the ONE HOUR mark), we were brought the most lackluster mimosas ever, most of the let down being the 45 minute wait for the drinks to arrive.  I should also note, btw, that the bloody mary mix was absolute crap: Watery, no horseradish, extremely underwhelming.  Oh, and they used a jigger to measure out the single shot of vodka, so it was both crappy AND stingy.So somewhere in that first hour we placed our food order -- never being told they were out of anything -- and when the meal finally dropped (at 2:15pm -- the first food we've seen all day, including no bread, for our 1pm reservation), we find out that, AFTER ALL THAT TIME, one of the items ordered was out, which amounted to one of us not being served anything.  So four of us sat there with food, sharing portions with the 5th, while the kitchen ""scrambled""  to bring out the alternate dish they recommended to our unlucky party member: some salmon crudo.  It took them 15 minutes to throw together a plate that consisted of 5 pieces of salmon sashimi strewn amidst pieces of torn rye sandwich bread (with a sauce drizzle of some sort).  THAT took 15 minutes??!!  Christ, after all we've been through they should have had that out in 15 SECONDS, especially given what a simple/boring dish it was.  The rest of us were done when the salmon finally arrived.The entire meal should have been comped. It wasn't (very little was).  The Pines should be ashamed of itself for their disgraceful performance. Amateur hour x1000. And all this comes from a bonafide foody with YEARS of fine dining service experience, btw.

"Wow! Where am I eating dinner...Gowanus?!? I was so pleasantly surprised with the food and service in this hidden gem in Brooklyn. Admittedly, I went there only after ignoring the hype of friends who had gone before me and raved about the food. Finally, I needed to go for myself and I was AMAZED! My cocktail was expertly prepared by a very friendly bartender who I had mistakenly called Phil all night due to the blasting hip hop music. Volume withstanding the drink, the Quincy's Jam, was delicious with a touch of tart and plenty of booze. It is served in a vintage coupe glass that made me feel like I had traveled through time to the days when a bartender cared about his customer and did not try to rush dinner to get the next table seated.  For the record the bartender's name was Will and he is very very easy on the eyes! Onto dinner, after handsome Will thoroughly explained the menu items and ingredients, I was drooling and ready to gorge on everything! I settled on the bread which was a medley of fresh baked wheat baguette, seeded brioche, and some type of Italian deliciousness I can't remember-all served with this blend of cheese and butter. CHEESE AND BUTTER people and it was so good I nearly ate the entire batch alone. Next, I had a Sweet Potato plate with Brussels sprouts and pork fat with a touch of buttercream. The perfect sweet and savory combination. Oh I just remembered the bread had an olive oil drizzle and sea salt sprinkle...so tasty! Lastly, Will recommended the Duck Cappalacchi. I am positive I misspelled this dish but it is a delicious dumpling like pasta stuffed with braised duck meat in a scrumptious broth topped with mustard greens. Hands down the best meal I have had in Brooklyn by far, including Williamsburg-for all the food snobs out there on YELP, there is better food in BK than Wburg. My only regret was I did not save room for dessert. I saw a couple of gelato looking desserts pass my way, but after 3 drinks and a million questions about the menu, it was time for me to go. In sum, check this place out if you want a delicious meal, superior service, and some eye candy while you digest your meal. Better yet go there if you are tired of rude waiters or overcrowded small spaces and want an exquisite dining experience. One more shout out to the host or manager, Anthony, for providing me with a space to have dinner without a reservation. He was very accommodating and another piece of eye candy!",5.0

The word ""slop"" comes to mind.  The service, however, was very good and the atmosphere is charming. If our meal had been just middling, these qualities would probably have prevented me from submitting a bad review.  Our octopus appetizer was pretty decent, but our entrees -- pork shoulder and lamb neck -- were simply terrible, flavor-wise and presentation-wise. It felt like bizarro world, where we couldn't wrap our brains around how anybody could think those flavors worked.  We've always liked Littleneck, its sister restaurant, so this really threw us for a loop.

Onto dinner, after handsome Will thoroughly explained the menu items and ingredients, I was drooling and ready to gorge on everything! I settled on the bread which was a medley of fresh baked wheat baguette, seeded brioche, and some type of Italian deliciousness I can't remember-all served with this blend of cheese and butter. CHEESE AND BUTTER people and it was so good I nearly ate the entire batch alone. Next, I had a Sweet Potato plate with Brussels sprouts and pork fat with a touch of buttercream. The perfect sweet and savory combination. Oh I just remembered the bread had an olive oil drizzle and sea salt sprinkle...so tasty! Lastly, Will recommended the Duck Cappalacchi. I am positive I misspelled this dish but it is a delicious dumpling like pasta stuffed with braised duck meat in a scrumptious broth topped with mustard greens. Hands down the best meal I have had in Brooklyn by far, including Williamsburg-for all the food snobs out there on YELP, there is better food in BK than Wburg. My only regret was I did not save room for dessert. I saw a couple of gelato looking desserts pass my way, but after 3 drinks and a million questions about the menu, it was time for me to go. In sum, check this place out if you want a delicious meal, superior service, and some eye candy while you digest your meal. Better yet go there if you are tired of rude waiters or overcrowded small spaces and want an exquisite dining experience. One more shout out to the host or manager, Anthony, for providing me with a space to have dinner without a reservation. He was very accommodating and another piece of eye candy!",5.0
"We had every expectation of enjoying a good meal here, so was surprised to have what was undoubtedly the worst meal we've had in recent memory. The word ""slop"" comes to mind.  The service, however, was very good and the atmosphere is charming. If our meal had been just middling, these qualities would probably have prevented me from submitting a bad review.  Our octopus appetizer was pretty decent, but our entrees -- pork shoulder and lamb neck -- were simply terrible, flavor-wise and presentation-wise. It felt like bizarro world, where we couldn't wrap our brains around how anybody could think those flavors worked.  We've always liked Littleneck, its sister restaurant, so this really threw us for a loop. I actually feel a little nauseated thinking about it...",1.0
"i love going to a restaurant and knowing that i'm going to love anything i order that night for dinner.  i've been to the pines a handful of times since they opened, and always walk out thinking that that  meal was my favorite...every single time!but, what makes it always my favorite meal is that the space is chill, crowd is relaxed and the service is friendly.  it's like being at a very fun and interesting friend's dinner party.  everyone's there to have a nice evening, so there's this great buzz in the air.  stand out plates:  foie, chanterelle, cavatelli, and pork shoulder stand out cocktails:  the pines and the uncle buckcan't wait to go back!",5.0
"holy moly, this place is freaking delicious and service is great!short rib was good and richgarganelli with mussels and burrata is heavenly and comforting.chef is particularly awesome: Sweet crab smell wafted from the kitchen and I asked our bartender if I could have whatever dish the crab was in. He notified me that the chef was preparing crab for the next night's dinner special. So I opted for the garnganelli. Then during the middle of dinner, the chef presented a bowl of pasta with the crab sauce he was preparing for the next night! How cool is that!",5.0

"Went on Friday night.  Ambiance is ""cool"" - super hip restaurant, very ""Brooklyn"" with a soundtrack of hip-hop in the background, which I appreciated.  The food was good - but I don't get the fuss.  It didn't blow me away, the portions were ""ok"" and some of it just wasn't great.  I had the pasta which actually was very good - but it's no Al Di La.  The service was fine.  Cash only which is annoying.  Now I'd definitely come back.  I'm told the cocktails are good as are the small plates, neither of  which I tried... and they have the most delightful backyard!  You can roast marshmallows in the back over the fire.  That gets them an additional star.",4.0
"First time here. I don't think they put 5k into the place when they renovated. Drinks and wine list are good! Though the baked apple will make people at the other table cough.Our amuse was a single garbanzo bean. A single bean. Thanks for the spoon and the cobwebs on the light fixtures. You pay for the bread, that's fancy. They let you know ahead of time the kitchen sends out food when it's ready. So timing and coordination in this place is not practiced. You could be done with your first sharing plate and 1 min later the next comes then while you're still working on your 2nd the 3rd comes and when you finish that there will be a 20 min gap until entrees.

"Got to ""The Pines"" at 6:30 on a Friday and was delighted to hear they had an open table, even though reservations are highly recommended (wish it said that on their site).  The service was fantastic, the lovely gentlemen took care of everything we needed and answered every question I had-  even when I asked if ""The Pines"" was a nod to the Fire Island ""Pines""? Apparently  it had nothing to with it, although there were plenty of handsome boys!  With that said, although the service was great, I really felt it was way overpriced. Two people sharing the recommended 4-6 dishes, two drinks each, $180 with tip. The meal was good, but not THAT good, and neither were the serving sizes, it was a good thing we got the bread (which is delicious).  And the thing that may or may not bother some people, but I'm in the service industry, so it bothers me: ""The Pines"" is cash only, however, you will conveniently find an ATM where you can withdrawal money so they'll make a profit off of you having to pay in cash.  If a meal is going to be over $100 and you're putting yourself in an higher class restaurant category, get a credit card machine.",3.0

Always love Chef Angelo's cheese plates: attests to his ability to source perfect ingredients.Greens: Various dark greens with spicy pickled peppers served with an egg yolk dressing. Very tasty!Vegetables:  Small sweet potatoes baked(?) whole and then served with kefir lime sour cream and pistachios. Simple but so good.Protein: Impossibly fluffy scrambled eggs with black truffle. I can't explain how incredibly tasty these eggs were. My favorite dish.Pasta: Pici with chard and a smoky tomato sauce.  Honestly, by the time this came out, I was already stuffed. Angelo's pici is the star of the pasta world. Hand-rolled, long with a nice bite! Dessert: I am a sadist for ordering dessert, but I couldn't resist the ants on a log: candied celery strips and celery juice dressed the plate, bits of peanut butter crumbs and gelato with raisin cake. MMMMMMMmmmmmm. Wine: We enjoyed a Spanish Rose at the staff's suggestion. The rest of the wine list is really great with lots of natural wine choices. This is a good place to try something new, because Angelo who curates the wine has an excellent palate.",5.0
"After two visits, I am in love with this place - the food, the ambiance, the soundtrack - it all comes together for a memorable meal.   Somebody here cares about food and the experience of those eating his or her food.  Actually, it seems everyone that works there, cares about the details and your experience.  This restaurant is everything that is right with the Brooklyn dining scene - but don't even categorize it as that - just a wonderful restaurant that you will want to go back to and keep trying.  The bone marrow is so simple, beautiful and delicious, I crave the pasta with duck and I had a tripe dish last night that tasted like home (I'm 1st generation Italian - and I do NOT call sauce GRAVY).   This is not a place for big groups - so don't go with 5 of your friends - keep it simple, like they do and you will have a great experience.",5.0
"Time for a reality check friends.  I admire the ambition but please keep in mind that you are not in Manhattan and 80s nouvelle cuisine is over.  A glass of wine should have a lot of wine in it.  Two flowers on a spoon do not an amuse bouche make.  And four tortellone do not make a meal.  The food is good but the presentation is über precious.  This is Gowanus Brooklyn and we want to EAT and DRINK.  We do, sort of, next door at Littleneck.  Next time, please feed me, OK?",2.0
Charming setup and our service was helpful and friendly but definitely overpriced relative to location and quality of the food & drinks.,3.0
"Got to ""The Pines"" at 6:30 on a Friday and was delighted to hear they had an open table, even though reservations are highly recommended (wish it said that on their site).  The service was fantastic, the lovely gentlemen took care of everything we needed and answered every question I had-  even when I asked if ""The Pines"" was a nod to the Fire Island ""Pines""? Apparently  it had nothing to with it, although there were plenty of handsome boys!  With that said, although the service was great, I really felt it was way overpriced. Two people sharing the recommended 4-6 dishes, two drinks each, $180 with tip. The meal was good, but not THAT good, and neither were the serving sizes, it was a good thing we got the bread (which is delicious).  And the thing that may or may not bother some people, but I'm in the service industry, so it bothers me: ""The Pines"" is cash only, however, you will conveniently find an ATM where you can withdrawal money so they'll make a profit off of you having to pay in cash.  If a meal is going to be over $100 and you're putting yourself in an higher class restaurant category, get a credit card machine.",3.0
"Very good, but CASH ONLY and quite expensive for 3rd Ave Bklyn. I make it a habit to avoid restaurants that don't care enough about their customers to allow them the convenience of accepting plastic. I won't be back until they do.",3.0
