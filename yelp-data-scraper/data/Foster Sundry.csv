"This review is really only for the meat and service. The meat is good, yo. SO GOOD. I buy 4 of the leg quarters like clockwork every week. They don't even need seasoning. A little salt and pepper and a quick bake and they're heavenly. The people who work there are great too. But TBH, I'd deal with assholes for such good meat.",5.0
"I'm like Toucan Sam when it comes to certain pleasures in life like cheese, bread, beer and coffee and Foster & Sundry has most of these things. There's a curated selection of cheeses! And the bonus is they normally have a little sample area highlighting one of the cheeses. There's fresh fruit that looks so perfect that it almost doesn't look real. Extra fancy pantry items from high class salts to decadent hot chocolates. I love that this specialty shop also serves as a coffee shop serving up steaming cups of Parlor coffee. The counter has there gorgeous packaged beans, with a Virgin Mary candle and a small bouquet. And the fun doesn't stop there, there's homemade caramels and candies at the check out too. And like s mouse lured by the cheese, I am always snatching up a load of L'Imprimerie bread also laid by the coffee counter.   Was super helpful to bag it up with an extra plastic bag for freshness. And even though this lovely shop is ahead of its time with the neighborhood I'm looking forward to treating myself with nice ingredients. I do hope they add a fish selection since that is something I struggle with finding in Bushwick.",4.0
"Pretty expensive spot, but sometimes you need the goods and this spot can deliver. I picked up grass fed, dry aged ribeyes here and they were great on flavor and quality. They were about $50 each with tax and a tip to the helpful butcher. The equivalent steak at a restaurant will run you $145 - $200 depending on where you go to get it. Around the corner at the store you can get a decent rib-steak or a t-bone which will do the trick most of the time, but it'll never be close to the quality cuts you can get at Foster. I'll be back soon for cheeses, and all the other goods.",4.0
"This is a great spot!!! Service was amazing and friendly. I tried their grilled cheese and I must say, it was perfect!!! Great price, the place is clean, the products and ingredients are really high quality. Totally amazing!!!",5.0
"I've been here twice. It is one of the places you can walk in and guarantee you will receive the best customer service and helpful tips, in addition to AMAZING meat (haven't tried cheese yet).The first time I got a piece of steak, and the second I decided to try something new and bought duck breast. I was convinced by the guy who helped me (sorry didn't get your name!) that duck breast was easy to cook - and he was absolutely right. This place has given me the confidence that I can cook, and I am loving my rekindled interest in cooking.",5.0
"Finally, the cheese and dairy gods have answered our calls! The border of Bushwick and Ridgewood have received an amazing gift this holiday season, and it's come in the form of a beautiful cheese and meat shop. Foster Sundry is walking distance from Maria Hernandez park, so this spring, definitely expect to see me brown bagging some fine cheeses in public. The cheese counter is HUGE and full of just about every type of cheese your lactose loving heart could dream of. The cheese monger will totally hook you up too, so if you're in the mood for something specific, just let her know!The meat counter wasn't fully stocked for our visit, but I'm expecting that it will be pretty soon. The kitchen in the back looks huge and there's even a seating area, a few groceries for sale, and a coffee bar. They also sell baked goods from neighborhood bakery, L'imprimerie. It's great to see local businesses supporting and uplifting each other and Rus and I are going to be really happy patrons of this place. During our first visit, the cheese monger helped us pick out a goat cheese and treated us to some samples. We got a pretty nice chunk (about 1/4 of a pound) for about $8. Pretty affordable!Foster Sundry, I welcome you with open arms. So glad that I'll no longer have to trek all the way out on the L for good cheese. A more affordable option is now right around the corner from where I live. Hooray for cheese!",5.0
"Haven't wrote a Yelp review in a long time. But this place is really Yelp worthy! The butcher was super knowledgable and gave great cooking suggestions. At the beginning, I thought the meat was a bit pricey (compared to supermarket similar quality meat) but after cooking it and devouring it... It was absolutely incredible! The chicken breast was so tender, juicy, soft, just amazing! Honestly both my boyfriend and I thought it was one of the best chicken we have had! The sirloin steak was also really good! Still need to cook up the herb sausages... Overall, really glad this new place opened and will defiantly be back for more!Oh, also they have bread from l'imprimerie! Not sure if they have their amazing lemon poppy seed cake...",5.0
"Amazing coffee and cheese. Gourmet condiments. Clean, new, and quality food. What more can I ask for?",5.0
"If the L train does indeed stop going into Manhattan for years on end, I won't even care because Foster Sundry will be here for us. There are lots of solid grocery options in the neighborhood, but for us, FS is filling in the some very specific cheese and meat gaps. I can endorse the following: high quality unconventional cuts (trotters, oxtail), whole chicken, bacon, topo chico mineral water (first sighting in BK), green beans, Gotham Greens, the seed and sourdough loaves of bread from l'Imprimerie, pimento cheese potato chips, butter, any of the candy at the register, and coffee made by Barista Owen. Also, cheese. I endorse all of the cheese (and taking home a while wheel of epoisses).",5.0
Great selection of carefully selected cheeses will make you want to buy the whole case! There's a also a sweet array of unique condiments and sauces for the foodie at heart. Can't wait to come back for the grand opening,5.0
A unique place unlike any I've ever been to in NY. Their well curated collection of cheese is what draws me there while and unique collection of snacks leaves me wanting to return to try something new. A must visit when in the area.,5.0
"I live 2 blocks away and my boyfriend and I look forward to seeing what's new every weekend. We cook almost every day and love the experience of being able to look into our fridge, run around the block, grab some (high quality) meat and a couple random add-ons, and whipping up a meal that any chef would envy. Every single person in the shop is educated without being a snob, and everyone seems to have great passion. The butchers (of both genders, mind you) know exactly what they are doing, easily deboning a chicken or slicing meat for a stir fry. One of the better places to spend your hard earned dough for some dough.",5.0
I'm so glad I found this place.  Such an awesome addition to the neighborhood!  The cheese case is quite impressive... I can only assume that the meat offerings will be equally as fab.  Will definitely be back when they are fully operational.,5.0
