"I enjoyed my meal at Suzume very much. I went with a friend and there was a 30 minute wait - reasonable for a Friday night in NY. We went to the Alligator Lounge around the corner for a $6 drink that came with a free small pizza. (What's not to love?!) The food was delicious. This is the kind of place where everything is going to be reliably tasty. Highly recommend the crunchy spicy tuna and the butter wings. The YaoYao Ramen was great but no Ippudo. The prices were reasonable... but it's cash only. I hate that, but some may not mind.The service was quick and the seating comfortable. You're eating close to your neighbors, but this is NY, get used to it.Highly recommend Suzume, but come with cash or pay the $1.50 atm fee. At least they have a reasonably priced atm.",5.0
"Only few items on menu so it should be perfection?..Salmon ramen, salmon was good but soup base was bland,  no flavors, noodles tasted like the ones you buy in the fridge in the supermarket. Same for pork ramen. Soup no flavors. Tacos, pork was not tasty. Spam ap..u can make at home.",2.0
"Attentive staffs, average food.went to williamsburg to find a nice spot to have dinner with friend.We ended up coming here because the originally picked spot had a long waiting list.I like this place, even though it s very small, but it's cozy.Tried their scallop sushi, it was not as fresh as I had at other sushi places, bad choice.We had a roll, and and the other appetizer.I tried the today special, chicken ramen, the chicken was tender, but the broth tasted like, braised chicken with hot water soup base, i was not amazed but rather bored.It is a good hang out/happy hour/tappas spot.....just to chill and chat.  It's not a great place to have dinner for real food craving though.",3.0
Adorable little restaurant. We had ramen and a brunch of appetizers. And the waitress was FRIENDLY we would go back.,4.0
"Decent bowl of salmon ramen, portion is good, you get what you pay for. The unique salmon flavor makes this a really good alternative from the traditional pork bowl. The ramen was $11, and $2 extra for a poached egg. I would probably gave it 5 stars if the $11 came with the poached egg.Overall, good neighborhood  gem.",4.0
"The last time I went, everything was not quite right, from the salad to the salmon ramen, which I usually love, but this time was somewhat fishy/overly salty; am hoping it was just an off night, as the usual chef in position #1 was not there.",3.0
"CASH ONLY! Cool vibe. Very small space. I ordered the salmon ramen, which was very light and tasty. However the noodles are not traditional ramen noodles - more like thin spaghetti noodles. The sushi chef was just some white guy hipster... So in sum, decent place to stop in and try, but by no means authentic Japanese food.",3.0
"Short review because I am just building off my previous one.  Particularly, I have tried the ramen on subsequent visits, and thought it was excellent and a good value.  Really, other than sushi, which was a little disappointing, including fish that had been previously frozen, I love this place.  4+ stars, even if not quite 5.",4.0
This place may be a ramen spot but it's all about their Japanese tapas. They have great small bites and starters to enjoy over drinks. I would pass on the ramen because I found the broth to be lacking depth in flavor which I look forward to when it comes to ramen. I added a poched egg to my pork ramen and it helped to solve the missing link but still wasn't enough. The service is amazing and totally worth 5 stars. It gets busy so try to dine early,3.0
Delicious food. Tiny portions. That was probably the main takeaway from dinner at Suzume. I came here for dinner not too hungry but with a friend who was ravenous. We ordered: Spam Musubi ($5): Probably the first time I've had spam in almost a decade and boy did i miss it. That nostalgic processed flavor that coats your tongue in saltiness was mellowed out by the rice and sweetness from the pineapple jam. I would definitely come back to order this again!Spicy Scallop Sushi ($3.50 per piece):  Super fresh scallop and avocado. Also aesthetically pleasing since everything was cut proportionally! Didn't notice much spice though and for $3.50 for each small piece was not really worth it.Yao Yao Ramen ($11): Pretty darn perfect. A thick pork shoulder broth that was super flavorful yet at the same time not overwhelmingly salty. Noodles were perfectly cooked to a little more than an al dente consistency. Portion size was perfect since I wasn't really hungry and am also a tiny 4'10 person but probably not enough for someone that was actually hungry.Hawaiian Chicken Rice Bowl ($11+$2 egg): Really unique and tasty! Had a few bites but was a big fan of the macaroni salad.Would definitely recommend for a light dinner. No credit cards though - cash only!,4.0
"Suzume is phenomenal! It's a little small inside but have never had an issue with being seating in a timely matter.  I've been here a few times now, and it has never disappointed. Tuna poke was a great little starterI've had both the salmon ramen and the pork ramen- both are great in their own ways, the salmon is lighter- I like it in the warmer weather and the pork one is just so rich and warming! Only downfall is that their glasses of wine are REALLY small.",4.0
"I would dine at Suzume just to have the buffalo wings again. They pair the wings with this Greek yogurt-style dip and it complements the dish so perfectly. If a restaurant can make their buffalo wings taste light and organic, they are doing something right. The ramen is just as good, but the wings stood out the most to me.",4.0
"Came by a half hour before closing time on a weekday. Got the spicy tuna roll and blistered shishito special to start. Roll was good and tasted super similar to Momo's sushi bomb variation. Shishitos came in an unusually generous portion (medium sized soup bowl) but were wayyyy too salty (lips started pruning). Yao Yao ramen tasted closer Taiwanese beef noodle than your traditional tonkotsu ramen. Personally not mad at that but hate the pulled pork shoulder that topped it. I don't get the appeal of pre-chewed meat but I get that that's a thing for some of you. Adobo chicken ramen was enjoyable as well. Pleased with the dark meat and broth especially. There was one waitress serving all the tables as well as manning the bar and she did a phenomenal job. Super friendly but not saccharine, attentive but not smothery. Food overall is head and shoulders above the hot effing garbage at Shinobi Ramen and value/ambience is preferable to ultra-hyped Yuji nearby. Would def come back to scratch my frequent sodium whore late night soup noodle itches but if you're looking for authentic ramen/sushi, this isn't it.",3.0
"So, I am impressed. Why?Well, because I had a chilled cucumber ramen bowl that delighted and inspired me. This place is seasonally conscious and I am into that - hot ramen on a hot day is not so appealing. The flavor of my bowl was not overwhelming - it had the right amount of savory sweetness and it complimented the perfectly cooked fish that bowl was topped with. The portion was just right for a lady like me because usually it takes me 3 days to get through a bowl of ramen, but I was able to finish mine at Suzume, which I think made me feel special cause I felt it was 'my sized'. If you have a big appetite I suggest trying a few things - this is definitely a 'tapas' style place.Aesthetic:  Hipster, adorable, quaintly romantic   Service: Attentive, caring, and respectful of dietary restrictions I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!",4.0

"Great place!  I was surprised how delicious the food was. At first I wasn't expecting much. Don't take the advice from some of these dumb reviewers in yelp. It's not meant to be fully japanese.

"Suzume exceeded my expectations. On a rainy night my gf and I had a taste for ramen in the area. We chose Suzume and it was well worth it. We started with poke sushi and a kalifornia roll, made fresh by the sushi chef working in front of us. Next we had the butter buffalo wings. Although the buffalo sauce tasted surprisingly familiar the chicken was cooked perfectly crispy. Best part of this dish was the ginger yogurt dipping sauce. Perfect amount of sweetness and coolness to replace a traditional blue cheese or ranch. Onto the ramen.  We both had the Yao Yao, I had mine with boiled egg. They arrived steaming hot. Noodles were cooked perfectly along with a good amount of bak Choy but an underwhelming amount of the delicious pork. Best part was the broth. Creamy and Flavorful with the pork and egg and scallion/bok Choy mixture.Prices were on the high end but worth it. Cash only but they have an atm. Pretty chill environment.

And so I thought that their rolls will just be fine. I was wrong they were amazing. After we had 2 bowls=soup. One was the salmon and the other was pork. Pork was a little spicy. But both was good.

"Sushi, ramen, Hawaiian food and hipsters, together at last.This tiny, dimly lit, cozy restaurant that is the epitome of Williamsburg with a completely hipster staff and customer base gets attention mostly for the bowls of ramen, but has a bunch of other great things on the menu too:- Spam Musubi ($5)If you are lucky enough to see this on the specials menu, you must try it. It's different and not really as good as the stuff in Hawaii, but it is still really excellent. It's actually even better than the version at Onomea, the only other reputable Hawaiian restaurant I have seen.- Cynthia Roll ($7)This roll contains mackerel, which is not as frequently seen on sushi menus, so I jumped at the chance to try it. It was delicious and was beautifully presented too.- Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll ($9)This was very similar to the Cynthia Roll, both in taste and presentation. I would just pick one instead of both since there are too many other good things to try, so it depends on whether you prefer spicy tuna or mackerel.- Hawaiian Style Rice Bowl ($11) with poached egg (+ $2)This was really excellent. There is a generous amount of katsu style fried chicken strips along with the Hawaiian staples of rice and macaroni salad. This is a very satisfying option and a nice change to go along with a bowl of the ramen.- Yao Yao Ramen ($11) with poached egg (+ $2)Decent ramen, but the broth was pretty weak. The noodles were fine and the pork shoulder was a nice change over the typical pork chashu, but I couldn't get past the very thin broth. The huge clumps of bok choy also weren't all that pleasant to deal with as they were hard to cut or bite into.- Roasted Salmon Ramen ($11)This is the dish they are most known for here, and I didn't find it to be particularly special. It is different than any other bowl of ramen you will find in the city, but that is not necessarily a good thing as it is not up to par with most of them. The components other than the salmon were all very similar to the Yao Yao, except that the broth obviously ended up being a little fishier. I would just stick with the Yao Yao unless you are trying to be healthier, but there is no need to try both due to the very similar flavor.The service is typical careless hipster treatment, which you should be used to in small places like this in Bushwick and Williamsburg. Going in with that expectation you should be fine. The place is pretty tiny and feels more like a trendy new small plates joint than it does a ramen shop.If you are solely interested in ramen, there are better places to go, but for a deliciously satisfying meal of different styles of Japanese food, this is a solid choice. As long as you have cash and don't mind the hipster atmosphere.P.S. Pretttttttty sure I got food poisoning from this meal, but the 4 stars are for the experience of the food going down, not the misery of it coming up afterward.",4.0
Great food and the atmosphere is perfect for both groups of friends or couples.Try the Spam Musubi - sounds weird but it tastes delicious! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.We'll definitely go there again!,4.0
"Atmosphere: whether at the bar or next to the entrance, this place is pretty darn romantic and relaxing. It is a small restaurant but it's expected because of the location, so that's excusable.Service: quick and friendly but not too over bearing which is good because you ain't here to dine with the servers now are you? Food: the spicy tuna roll had a good amount of tuna and the balance of the spice was perfect. The fish taco was alright only because there was too much sauce and it just pour down from the taco when you held it to your mouth, messsssy. Broth for the salmon ramen was lacking flavor but the salmon was cooked to perfection so that was nice. The Hawaiian rice dish was way better than the ramen. The Hawaiian rice dish was the perfect comfort dish with its macaroni and rice and fried chicken.",4.0
"I really wanted to like this place more, but the ramen isn't the best I've had. Maybe I've just been spoiled, but I didn't find anything too special about their selection. I tried both the salmon and the pork shoulder. The salmon had better broth, but the fish itself was pretty tasteless. The pork broth wasn't as full in flavor (a little sour), but the pork shoulder was so tender and melty. The noodles were more reminiscent of wonton noodles in terms of texture, size, and lack of springiness. Up to you to decide if that's good or bad.I also tried the spicy scallop roll. It wasn't spicy at all, but it was pretty fresh. We also ordered the spam musubi, but it never came (we weren't charged for it).The space itself is a bit uncomfortable. If you sit at the tables against the store front window, you have limited elbow room between tables. If you're in the middle table, you have nowhere to put your coat (if the coat rack all the way in the back is full).

"Yum! I love coming here for dinner. I have been a few times and always look forward to the next. There were two of us and we decided to sit at the bar to eat (no wait since we went around 9pm on Monday). We ended up sharing the salmon and avocado roll as a start... amazing... then as a main course we each ordered ramen - Salmon dish and pork dish ramen.. also tasty. The flavor from both meals were flavorful and filling; along with saki - it was a great meal. FYI - cash only, and limiting seating. May be hard with larger groups.",4.0
"Great neighborhood place. The ramen is incredibly rich and very filling. The sushi and rolls are on the expensive side but it's hard to argue when they're so good. The bok choi salad is our go to - fresh, zesty, and delicious.",4.0
"One of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to. Before you come here, make sure you have cash since this establishment is cash only.The salmon ramen is out of this world. Its a must every time I come here. In addition, they have a great juice with beets, carrots, ginger, apple, etc (that you can choose to add alcohol to). The sushi is also delicious. The staff is super friendly and accommodating and really ensures that you have a great experience.Definitely worth checking out. I've been here 10+ times and will definitely be back",5.0
"Cozy, good food, great service.If you go at prime times with a group you'll probably have to wait. I often go there on my own as well, they always have a seat for you at the bar and you feel very welcome. I am more about the small tapa plates than the ramen. Service is always super nice and fast. Cash only, atm Inside.",4.0
Everything tasted good! But the salmon and pork ramen tasted a lot alike...,3.0
"Sushi, ramen, Hawaiian food and hipsters, together at last.This tiny, dimly lit, cozy restaurant that is the epitome of Williamsburg with a completely hipster staff and customer base gets attention mostly for the bowls of ramen, but has a bunch of other great things on the menu too:- Spam Musubi ($5)If you are lucky enough to see this on the specials menu, you must try it. It's different and not really as good as the stuff in Hawaii, but it is still really excellent. It's actually even better than the version at Onomea, the only other reputable Hawaiian restaurant I have seen.- Cynthia Roll ($7)This roll contains mackerel, which is not as frequently seen on sushi menus, so I jumped at the chance to try it. It was delicious and was beautifully presented too.- Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll ($9)This was very similar to the Cynthia Roll, both in taste and presentation. I would just pick one instead of both since there are too many other good things to try, so it depends on whether you prefer spicy tuna or mackerel.- Hawaiian Style Rice Bowl ($11) with poached egg (+ $2)This was really excellent. There is a generous amount of katsu style fried chicken strips along with the Hawaiian staples of rice and macaroni salad. This is a very satisfying option and a nice change to go along with a bowl of the ramen.- Yao Yao Ramen ($11) with poached egg (+ $2)Decent ramen, but the broth was pretty weak. The noodles were fine and the pork shoulder was a nice change over the typical pork chashu, but I couldn't get past the very thin broth. The huge clumps of bok choy also weren't all that pleasant to deal with as they were hard to cut or bite into.- Roasted Salmon Ramen ($11)This is the dish they are most known for here, and I didn't find it to be particularly special. It is different than any other bowl of ramen you will find in the city, but that is not necessarily a good thing as it is not up to par with most of them. The components other than the salmon were all very similar to the Yao Yao, except that the broth obviously ended up being a little fishier. I would just stick with the Yao Yao unless you are trying to be healthier, but there is no need to try both due to the very similar flavor.The service is typical careless hipster treatment, which you should be used to in small places like this in Bushwick and Williamsburg. Going in with that expectation you should be fine. The place is pretty tiny and feels more like a trendy new small plates joint than it does a ramen shop.If you are solely interested in ramen, there are better places to go, but for a deliciously satisfying meal of different styles of Japanese food, this is a solid choice. As long as you have cash and don't mind the hipster atmosphere.P.S. Pretttttttty sure I got food poisoning from this meal, but the 4 stars are for the experience of the food going down, not the misery of it coming up afterward.",4.0
Great food and the atmosphere is perfect for both groups of friends or couples.Try the Spam Musubi - sounds weird but it tastes delicious! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.We'll definitely go there again!,4.0
"Atmosphere: whether at the bar or next to the entrance, this place is pretty darn romantic and relaxing. It is a small restaurant but it's expected because of the location, so that's excusable.Service: quick and friendly but not too over bearing which is good because you ain't here to dine with the servers now are you? Food: the spicy tuna roll had a good amount of tuna and the balance of the spice was perfect. The fish taco was alright only because there was too much sauce and it just pour down from the taco when you held it to your mouth, messsssy. Broth for the salmon ramen was lacking flavor but the salmon was cooked to perfection so that was nice. The Hawaiian rice dish was way better than the ramen. The Hawaiian rice dish was the perfect comfort dish with its macaroni and rice and fried chicken.",4.0
"I really wanted to like this place more, but the ramen isn't the best I've had. Maybe I've just been spoiled, but I didn't find anything too special about their selection. I tried both the salmon and the pork shoulder. The salmon had better broth, but the fish itself was pretty tasteless. The pork broth wasn't as full in flavor (a little sour), but the pork shoulder was so tender and melty. The noodles were more reminiscent of wonton noodles in terms of texture, size, and lack of springiness. Up to you to decide if that's good or bad.I also tried the spicy scallop roll. It wasn't spicy at all, but it was pretty fresh. We also ordered the spam musubi, but it never came (we weren't charged for it).The space itself is a bit uncomfortable. If you sit at the tables against the store front window, you have limited elbow room between tables. If you're in the middle table, you have nowhere to put your coat (if the coat rack all the way in the back is full). The backless stools are also uncomfortable and I hit my head on the overhead light twice (okay, maybe that last one was my fault).Service was good, and I really want this place to exist since it's so conveniently located off the Lorimer/Metropolitan stop.

It was actually really good and certainly a fun food to try at least once if you don't think too hard about what it's made out of.My friend ordered the Hawaiian Fried Chicken Rice bowl + poached egg and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was probably the most filling item on the menu and only $13 with the added egg.Tip: Try the San Miguel toasted dark lager.

It was all really tasty and minus the fluke sashimi, the portions were spot on.What was not good, and would keep me from returning, was the way the food was brought out. None of us had our food together, and nearly each order came out separately.

"Wow. So average. Below average, actually, for the price.This place is a really overhyped hipster joint.

They offer wings but just one kind: spicy butter with ginger yogurt sauce on the side.They have 3 options of ramen: salmon, pork and the chicken special. I saw another noodle dish that I don't recall, also some sort of Hawaiian rice and 3 taco options.We ordered the wings and they were ok. Just a little spicy and the sauce on the side was interesting and it did not taste bad.Then, we ordered the salmon ramen and the yaoyao ramen.The broth of both ramens was tasty and thick but it was not the typical ramen broth. Now, the amount of salmon they gave me was good but friend thought her piece of meat on the yaoyao was small. Unfortunately, this ramen is just that; the broth tastes a little spicy and they put some bok choy (Chinese cabbage) and scallions but that's it.I personally like to have toppings to choose from, to add to my ramen but this was not the case.

I got the YaoYao ramen which was satisfying, but had a very overwhelming salty pork flavor which I only really enjoyed because of how hungry I was. I also tasted the spam musubi, which was okay but very small and not worth $5. The portions of all our food were very very small for the price.

The salmon ramen is actually pretty good/unique. Small portion and the noodles were kinda weak but the broth was interesting/tasty. The little filet of salmon that was in it had a perfect mix of crispy outside and slightly raw inside.I'd normally want more for $11 but it was creative. Also cash only (annoying cause they clearly have a modern POS machine).,4.0

"After class at The Brooklyn Kitchen, we headed to Suzume for ramen and tacos. My friends had the ramen and said it was very tasty. The bowl was smaller than typical ramen houses, but satisfying.

The tacos were small, about 3-4 bites. If you're terribly hungry, this will not fill you up. I recommend Suzume for a great bite and drinks. They're near the train station and open late.",4.0

There were 2-3 people waiting in front of us, but we actually got seated within 15 minutes of standing by the front door. We got seated towards the back of the restaurant (yay, away from the front door where all the cold air kept coming in) -- and proceeded to order:(1) Spam masubi $5 - can't go wrong with this item, since spam masubi is ALWAYS good. I think this one had pineapple in there.(2) Spicy crunchy tuna roll $9 - delicious!! my husband enjoyed this roll(3) Yao Yao noodles with poached egg $11 - this was their only ramen dish and it was decent, but not particularly memorable. thought the broth was a bit too oily. too bad they didn't have their pork belly ramen anymore; it was taken off the menu.Fast friendly service!",4.0

This is my neighborhood go-to in the winter. They don't deliver but is close to pick up from and is really cute inside for dining in. It's small and dark and romantical.

Limited menu with no real direction. My cocktail was the best thing I had. Sad considering I tried 8 items -all small-that was about half the menu. BS rules like they won't seat the 1st of a party of 2 in an empty restaurant until the 2nd arrives. And we were shorted $4 of our change with no apology when we pointed it out. So many far better places to eat at. Baffled by the high ratings.,2.0
The salmon ramen is actually pretty good/unique. Small portion and the noodles were kinda weak but the broth was interesting/tasty. The little filet of salmon that was in it had a perfect mix of crispy outside and slightly raw inside.I'd normally want more for $11 but it was creative. Also cash only (annoying cause they clearly have a modern POS machine).,4.0
"This is one of my favorite spots in Brooklyn. The ramen is delicious, beer selection is solid and the sushi is amazing. It gets a bit packed and the wait can be annoying but it's for a good reason, the place is great.",5.0
"Great ramen at a great price.  I tried the YaoYao Ramen with pork shoulder, sesame garlic chili broth, bok choy and scallion. It was enjoyable, to say the least. Also: really enjoyable interior at this little gem located in Williamsburg. Nice music and friendly staff.",4.0
"After class at The Brooklyn Kitchen, we headed to Suzume for ramen and tacos. My friends had the ramen and said it was very tasty. The bowl was smaller than typical ramen houses, but satisfying. I had the Aloha Taco Program to get a sample of each taco available at Suzume. If I were to choose a specific taco from the program to have again, I would recommend the Chicken Adobo taco. The tacos were small, about 3-4 bites. If you're terribly hungry, this will not fill you up. I recommend Suzume for a great bite and drinks. They're near the train station and open late.",4.0
"11/7/2013We had just arrived to NYC from a long-flight from Austria...and it was FREEZING that evening in Brooklyn. We were starving and my husband's cousin suggested this ramen place down the street from her apartment. We decided to check it out and see if we can warm up our bodies!Upon arrival, the restaurant was crowded. There were 2-3 people waiting in front of us, but we actually got seated within 15 minutes of standing by the front door. We got seated towards the back of the restaurant (yay, away from the front door where all the cold air kept coming in) -- and proceeded to order:(1) Spam masubi $5 - can't go wrong with this item, since spam masubi is ALWAYS good. I think this one had pineapple in there.(2) Spicy crunchy tuna roll $9 - delicious!! my husband enjoyed this roll(3) Yao Yao noodles with poached egg $11 - this was their only ramen dish and it was decent, but not particularly memorable. thought the broth was a bit too oily. too bad they didn't have their pork belly ramen anymore; it was taken off the menu.Fast friendly service!",4.0

This ramen is also spicy, perfect for fall weather. We also tried the peashooter bok choy salad with calamansi shallot vin and cashew tuile. Really refreshing salad and you can taste the calamansi flavor. Yum!  Never thought bok choy can be eaten as a salad. We always cooked this veggie.

"I went early knowing that the place is small and therefore busy.  The female bartender/server/jackofalltrades was excellent and very friendly, and maintained her friendly and attentive demeanor as the place got more packed, and never seemed rushed or flustered.I started with a couple of the chicken tacos which were really tasty.  I also tried a tuna sushi which was also very tasty.  Salmon ramen was good, but out of the three my least favorite, I thought it could have a bit more flavor, broth was a bit bland but noodles were good.  I got it with the egg which glad I did as it give it a bit more energy.  I also got a tapioca pudding dessert which was yummy and just enough.  All that food and 2 beers came in at a good price.Only complaint is when the male bartender came on he was abrupt to say the least.  Whereas the female server was calm and cool after 2 minutes there he was already flustered. I guess he takes over the bar customers upon arrival.  Which maybe they pull tips who knows, but after an hour of having a nice rapport with a lovely server and then this guy comes in with a ""anything else"" trying to rush me out -- kinda soured things.  He took my money with a ""don't worry I'll give it to her"" - kinda rude.  Let the server finish out her guests even if you pull tips or what have you or are taking over and for goodness sakes if you are going to now be the server at least introduce yourself.

Suzume is great and everyone must know it because this place is busy busy busy. They don't take reservations unfortunately and they have roughly 12 tables fit for 2 people. (I'm sure you could see how this could fill up quick). We came by on Thursday for dinner and we timed it PERFECTLY. We got here at 7:45ish and by 8pm about 5 couples came streaming in looking for seats. I would say be prepared for a wait but nothing too crazy the food comes out quick.This place has the best tacos... mmm They are the puffy type and so delicious I could eat one everyday! I really like the fish and pork ones. They both are so different and so full of flavor. The BF always gets the yao yao ramen and says it is great and pretty spicy. I have been getting the Hawaiian rice bowl lately and the chicken is to die for but I am not a big fan of the macaroni. It is kind of weird... the menu says (if I am not mistaken) that it is pineapple mac but I end up only tasting and finding cucumber. I am not a cucumber fan :-(I guess I just need to branch out more and try something new next time!!Either way - I love this place but you shouldn't so it doesn't get any busier than it already is ;-),4.0
Suzume is decent. I took my order to go so this review is based on that. I do want to try it again and dine in there. The ramen was ok. Ordered the YaoYao ramen and the portion was kinda small. Taste wise it was good but not as good as my usual spots. I would like to try the Hawaiian style bowl when I go back. They have a few sushi items on the list that I also want to try. They serve alcohol which is a plus as the other ramen spots do not (some places only beer and wine). Sake menu looks good. Its small inside and they do get busy. Call ahead to find out if they got room. You can do take out which is good. Not sure if they deliver but that would also be a huge plus.,3.0

There was no wasabi but there was a spicy mayo and homemade soy sauce that had an almost hickory smoked kick to it, very interesting.The hot sake was good quality, and the star of our meal was the butter wings. The menu was very small, maybe 4 rolls, two appetizers and a few ramen, but everything I had was great. I've never really had proper ramen, so I assume I'll be back here to try it soon.Overall, decent value, all that for $45 before tip and we got a big hot sake.

The broth was really thick and delicious, there were a lot of noodles and a nice hearty slice of pork belly. I couldn't finish anywhere close to all of it.

"I hate to blow up this spot as I've learned that Yelping goes against my interests of enjoying a calm, soulful joint without having to fight (sometimes literally) crowds of followers - yelper scum.After David Chang mainstream'd the bowl of pork ramen noodles in the New York scene, everybody and their third cousin began opening sub-par unauthentic ramen joints.  This place goes above and beyond and it's clear that they hold themselves to higher standards.The YaoYao ramen was one of the best I've had.  Really smooth stock - the flavor was on point, not too salty, and perfect temperature.  Pork was cooked to perfection and bok choy blanched well.  Don't forget your poached egg!  Oh...forgot about the noodles.  I'll be honest...I don't remember much but they were pretty standard and didn't jump out.  Thin rice noodles, but I actually prefer the squiggly yellow alkaline variety.Spam musubi was something I hadn't had in a while and was nice.  But how hard is it to f'k up spam musubi??  They were flavored with pineapple - a nice highlight.Really looking forward to going back, but it's a tight space and already getting really popular.  I wish them the best and hope they open up a 2nd closer to me - come to Bed-Stuy!",5.0

"So happy to find this gem!

Needed.My friend had the salmon ramen with a poached egg, she loved it. I had the pork ramen and it was decent. The noodles were not what I'm used to in ramen, a bit thick and the broth was hearty which again isn't what I prefer for texture,but it was good. Perhaps it's the Filipino execution of ramen and I'm married to the days of living in Japan and eating ramen for warmth.The price was pretty high, but that's pretty standard for ramen these days. What is cheap noodle shop drunk food overseas has somehow gotten a price tag of $12+ dollars here. Not trying to be all elite ""had it overseas"" here, but I'm having a hard time accepting how expensive ramen in the states is, dc is just as guilty as NYC.Our waitress was rad. Defo going back.",5.0
"Second time here for us within 7 days. Last time we were here we tried the fish tacos which was delicious and the Yaoyao ramen and Salmon ramen. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend them.This time I got the spam musubi which I really liked but my fiancée didn't partake because she doesn't like spam. She got the Yaoyao again and it's still delicious as always. I got the Chicken Ramen Action on the special menu. I say it was kinda meh. Just tastes like ramen in plain chicken stock. It also came with some really sour shiitake in it which tastes like they were soaked in vinegar. Not sure if people would like that but I appreciated the change in texture in the middle of the meal.So if this your first time here, definitely get the Yaoyao and the Tacos. Next timeI'm here I wanna try the Wings.",4.0

"My friend and I arrived on a Tuesday night and it was packed and steamy in this cozy little wooden crate. Decor is simple, dark, and modern, perfectly typical of a trendy ramen spot. We were told 15 minutes but the sushi chef said he would take care of us and gestured to his little kitchenette island where we squeezed in. We were famished and excited and ordered three rolls and two bowls of ramen between us: the mackerel, spicy tuna, and salmon avocado rolls as appetizers, and the Yao Yao ramen for my friend and the salmon ramen for my entree. The rolls were beautifully presented and very tasty. The seafood was fresh and upon asking for his recommendation, promised us extra salmon on the side, which was very sweet of him. Our waitress forgot the soy sauce, but I felt it was somewhat forgivable since they seemed to have entrusted us to the sushi chef. The ramen, however, was more or less lackluster. The Yao Yao had a satisfactory richness and complexity to the broth, but was cloyingly sweet. The salmon ramen fell flat, the broth being thin and uninspiring. The proportions were also off. I expected more broth for the amount of noodles offered. The noodles crowded the bowl a bit. The poached egg was the star in that dish, and unfortunately was the most and only exciting part. For a ramen spot, I expected more. My tip for this place is to depend more on the sushi for a great meal, and try to sit at the sushi bar if you can and chat up the chef. He'll hook you up. For his service, artistry, and generosity, I offer 4 stars instead of 3.",4.0
"Went here to try the Pork Ramen...I didn't come here for the sushi, at all. Tried the tacos, which my friend and I shared as an appetizer.

Of course, I had to add Sriracha sauce to it for some kick.Ramen was a bit thick in consistency, including the noodles and meat. It was like a Ramen stew with a porky flavor. The soup to noodle ratio was not good. Seemed like there was a ton of noodles, which were chewey, but got thicker with the broth, the longer they sat. Broth was flavorful, but tasted a bit too ""Ham-ey""...Pork was very tasty and cooked great. Was extremely tender and I didn't mind the thick chunks of meat...it was more of a fusion Ramen, IMO. Overall, I would eat that Ramen again...but, compared to other traditional Ramen places, it is in another category.Interior is nice, but the seats are not very comfy. I think they have the potential to be a solid restaurant in the neighborhood, but they need to tweak a few things on the menu.Happy Hour is everyday, which is good - Bottled Beer is $3",3.0
"My roommate had been here several times and raved about it so much I had to come and try - I was not disappointed. Can't speak for the noodles or wings, but the spicy salmon & avocado roll as well as the spicy tuna & fried potatos roll were both amazing. Furthermore, we ordered the fish tacos which were also fantastic.The prices aren't the cheapest, but the food is worth it, at least what we ordered. Also, I see people complaining about how salty the soy sauce is and I have 2 suggestions: a) use less, or b) bring your own? seriously, stupid gripe to have, it's SOY SAUCE. Finally, I love the simplicity of the menu - it may seem limited, but it also makes you think that was IS available has had careful thought put into it. Combine that with the ambiance the place has and it's a perfect spot for some good ""Asian fusion"" for anything from date night to just going to have a dinner locally with a roommate (we live 3 blocks south on Lorimer)",5.0
"I hate to blow up this spot as I've learned that Yelping goes against my interests of enjoying a calm, soulful joint without having to fight (sometimes literally) crowds of followers - yelper scum.After David Chang mainstream'd the bowl of pork ramen noodles in the New York scene, everybody and their third cousin began opening sub-par unauthentic ramen joints.  This place goes above and beyond and it's clear that they hold themselves to higher standards.The YaoYao ramen was one of the best I've had.  Really smooth stock - the flavor was on point, not too salty, and perfect temperature.  Pork was cooked to perfection and bok choy blanched well.  Don't forget your poached egg!  Oh...forgot about the noodles.  I'll be honest...I don't remember much but they were pretty standard and didn't jump out.  Thin rice noodles, but I actually prefer the squiggly yellow alkaline variety.Spam musubi was something I hadn't had in a while and was nice.  But how hard is it to f'k up spam musubi??  They were flavored with pineapple - a nice highlight.Really looking forward to going back, but it's a tight space and already getting really popular.  I wish them the best and hope they open up a 2nd closer to me - come to Bed-Stuy!",5.0

"Yao Yao ramen with a poached egg and drinks. Absolutely the best ramen I've had in Brooklyn and maybe all of NY, coming from the west coast. My girlfriend and I try to make it here at least once a week to this gem and are always greeted with a friendly hostess and great bartenders. If you're coming on a Friday night expect the longest you may need to wait for a seat to be 25 minutes.",5.0
"So happy to find this gem! My buddy and I had been planning to grab dinner for weeks and she proposed the ""new ramen joint in our hood.""We ordered some asahi's the big ones, cause why not drink a liter of beer on a Monday. Needed.My friend had the salmon ramen with a poached egg, she loved it. I had the pork ramen and it was decent. The noodles were not what I'm used to in ramen, a bit thick and the broth was hearty which again isn't what I prefer for texture,but it was good. Perhaps it's the Filipino execution of ramen and I'm married to the days of living in Japan and eating ramen for warmth.The price was pretty high, but that's pretty standard for ramen these days. What is cheap noodle shop drunk food overseas has somehow gotten a price tag of $12+ dollars here. Not trying to be all elite ""had it overseas"" here, but I'm having a hard time accepting how expensive ramen in the states is, dc is just as guilty as NYC.Our waitress was rad. Defo going back.",5.0
"Second time here for us within 7 days. Last time we were here we tried the fish tacos which was delicious and the Yaoyao ramen and Salmon ramen. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend them.This time I got the spam musubi which I really liked but my fiancée didn't partake because she doesn't like spam. She got the Yaoyao again and it's still delicious as always. I got the Chicken Ramen Action on the special menu. I say it was kinda meh. Just tastes like ramen in plain chicken stock. It also came with some really sour shiitake in it which tastes like they were soaked in vinegar. Not sure if people would like that but I appreciated the change in texture in the middle of the meal.So if this your first time here, definitely get the Yaoyao and the Tacos. Next timeI'm here I wanna try the Wings.",4.0
Very cute and cozy secret right around the corner from my apartment. I took my  girlfriend there for a date night. The staff is welcoming a accommodating. I love the roasted salmon ramen. After writing this I'm definitely heading there for dinner tonight.,5.0
"My friend and I arrived on a Tuesday night and it was packed and steamy in this cozy little wooden crate. Decor is simple, dark, and modern, perfectly typical of a trendy ramen spot. We were told 15 minutes but the sushi chef said he would take care of us and gestured to his little kitchenette island where we squeezed in. We were famished and excited and ordered three rolls and two bowls of ramen between us: the mackerel, spicy tuna, and salmon avocado rolls as appetizers, and the Yao Yao ramen for my friend and the salmon ramen for my entree. The rolls were beautifully presented and very tasty. The seafood was fresh and upon asking for his recommendation, promised us extra salmon on the side, which was very sweet of him. Our waitress forgot the soy sauce, but I felt it was somewhat forgivable since they seemed to have entrusted us to the sushi chef. The ramen, however, was more or less lackluster. The Yao Yao had a satisfactory richness and complexity to the broth, but was cloyingly sweet. The salmon ramen fell flat, the broth being thin and uninspiring. The proportions were also off. I expected more broth for the amount of noodles offered. The noodles crowded the bowl a bit. The poached egg was the star in that dish, and unfortunately was the most and only exciting part. For a ramen spot, I expected more. My tip for this place is to depend more on the sushi for a great meal, and try to sit at the sushi bar if you can and chat up the chef. He'll hook you up. For his service, artistry, and generosity, I offer 4 stars instead of 3.",4.0

"Post-script: I am rarely THIS compelled, but when it comes to wings, I gotta break it down for all of these self-proclaimed critics who are losing their panties over these overpriced wings. You clearly all grew up eating KFC. I can make better wings than these at 3am. Show me down, homie. If this place is supposed to be redeemed by some chicken wings, you're going to have to come harder than that. 2 of the 5 wings served to use were over fried - I don't care if you sprinkle crack in your sauce, but if your wing wasn't cooked right, it should not be served. This is not Monday night at Croxley. Oh, yeah, check this 5 wings for $8 - that's nearly $2 a wing. You're trying to sell yourself as affordable?

"I was really excited for ramen to come out further than Bedford in Williamsburg! The place is very small, but we got there at 7:15pm last night and it didn't take too long to get a table. It could be that there isn't too much buzz about it yet.For starters, we got the wings and the hamachi sushi roll. The wings were tiny, and there about 7 of them on the dish with a whitish sauce on the side. The flavor was pretty good, but the wings were a bit dry (probably due to overcooking). The hamachi sushi roll was just... ok. The fish seemed really fresh, but the sushi rice wasn't cooked properly. It was either overcooked or not cooled properly, because the roll itself was kind of mushy. Not my favorite, at all.The bowls of ramen have got to be the smallest bowls I've seen in a ramen shop in NYC. I tried the spicy tofu one ($10), and my friends all got the tonkatsu ramen ($13). Both of these were with the pork broth, because it was recommended by the waiter. I have to say I was disappointed. First -- the pork broth. It didn't taste like pork. It tasted like mushrooms. I mean, I love mushrooms, but I ordered pork broth. So the richness that usually comes with a ramen pork broth was not there, at all. Second -- for a ""spicy tofu"" ramen dish, there was absolutely no spice to the dish. I think I saw a chili flake or two, but it was exceedingly dark at our table, so it was hard to find. I didn't get the kick that I usually get with a spicy ramen soup. Third -- the tofu was just one triangular block of tofu. And the pork in the tonkatsu soups was also just a block. I was kind of... expecting a little more to be in my ramen bowl. The tofu was pretty well cooked, a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. But then again, it was the only accompaniment to my dish. The pork in the tonkatsu was like 60% fat, 40% meat, so you only get a little bit of pork flavor (which was also a bit dry), but also a lot of greasy fat in your mouth.Fourth -- The noodles were actually pretty good and well cooked. They were the straight ramen noodles, and I found them pleasantly chewy. However, the noodle to soup ratio was completely off. It was like I was eating a noodle dish, with some mushroom sauce puddled up on the bottom.The four of us who ate all LOVE ramen, and we were exceedingly disappointed by the place. If it's cold and the only place to go within a block radius, I don't mind eating there. But I wouldn't go out of my way to visit. I'm not a traditional ramen snob, but I would not call this sh*t ramen... their ramen is really like a semi-tasty mushroom-y noodle dish.TL;DR -- I'd rather take the L further into Manhattan to get better ramen.",2.0

Second -- for a ""spicy tofu"" ramen dish, there was absolutely no spice to the dish. I think I saw a chili flake or two, but it was exceedingly dark at our table, so it was hard to find. I didn't get the kick that I usually get with a spicy ramen soup. Third -- the tofu was just one triangular block of tofu. And the pork in the tonkatsu soups was also just a block. I was kind of... expecting a little more to be in my ramen bowl. The tofu was pretty well cooked, a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. But then again, it was the only accompaniment to my dish. The pork in the tonkatsu was like 60% fat, 40% meat, so you only get a little bit of pork flavor (which was also a bit dry), but also a lot of greasy fat in your mouth.Fourth -- The noodles were actually pretty good and well cooked. They were the straight ramen noodles, and I found them pleasantly chewy. However, the noodle to soup ratio was completely off. It was like I was eating a noodle dish, with some mushroom sauce puddled up on the bottom.The four of us who ate all LOVE ramen, and we were exceedingly disappointed by the place. If it's cold and the only place to go within a block radius, I don't mind eating there. But I wouldn't go out of my way to visit. I'm not a traditional ramen snob, but I would not call this sh*t ramen... their ramen is really like a semi-tasty mushroom-y noodle dish.TL;DR -- I'd rather take the L further into Manhattan to get better ramen.",2.0
"Went there on a date on a Friday night and loved it. We had some hot sake, sashimi special (bass caught earlier that day in RI with an apple relish), pork ramen (delicious), and the spicy salmon roll, which was the best thing we ate all night. The owner/manager knew the names of the boats where the fish were caught, which was a nice touch. Cool atmosphere with a lot of unique wood furniture. The wood tables are exceptionally cool. Definitely had a line when we were leaving, but since we showed up around 7:45 we got a table no problem.",5.0
"I had a lovely dining experience at Suzume. I went after peak hours, around 11pm. It's small, quaint, low-lighting, excellent for a date or a quick, low-key bite to eat. The roasted salmon ramen was delectable and the 90s dirty south hip-hop soundtrack put me at ease.",4.0

"The salmon ramen is so good. Well maybe not so much the ramen, it wasn't anything special but the Salmon was perfectly cooked and so delicious. Was such a small piece though.

"Sushi snobs will find ways to nitpick, and hell, I'm about as snobby as it comes when it comes to sushi, but hold on a moment. Yes, Suzume definitely has a Japanese-dominant influence with its heavy sushi, sashimi, ramen menu offerings, but traditional Japanese is not what this place is about. This place is about GOOD FOOD people. It's more Asian fusion with Hawaiian and Filipino and wherever the hell else cuisine the chef chooses to be inspired by and then create. It's about caring enough to source quality ingredients from smaller boutique purveyors like briny fresh fish from Gabe the Fish Babe of Rhode Island. It's about making homey comfort food at an accessable price point so people can actually sample a variety of the offerings like the killer butter chicken wings, perfectly cooked ramen with melty Berkshire pork and chicken adobo tacos that I told the chef sullied my childhood memories forever because that freaking adobo was better than my grandmother's.

Yoghurt sauce was ok and supposedly infused with ginger but it really lacked any bite.

The noodles held bite but lacked any real flavour, pretty bland. The broth lacked the usual depth and mouth coating quality that a quality ramen should. The balance of the bowl was also odd - ALOT of noodles, not much broth and the usual add-ins (scallions, sesame, bamboo shoot, egg etc) were nowhere to be found.

"I think this is a good addition in the neighborhood, I typically head to Bozu when I want good sushi, but this is much closer which is nice. We split two rolls--the spicy crunchy tuna with potato and the spicy salmon/avocado/shishito. Both were great quality, and well sized (not that many slices but they weren't skinny). I would consider dropping the price $1 or $2 on each roll--I think you'll make up for it by groups of two ordering more.  I appreciate the short menu though. I worry if I wanted to make a meal of sushi and was REALLY hungry this wouldn't be affordable.Anyway, we also tried the butter wings--we thought they might be awesome since they were a little different than everything else on the menu. They need to punch up the flavor on these, they weren't crispy or spicy--basically just buttery. The yogurt sauce could use more flavor as well. All said--still nice to have this place around I think and excited to see what they do. I might suggest they take a look at the menu for Miya's in New Haven. As someone who lives near Suzume I'd love for this to be a place I can drop in for quality, well priced sushi that won't be too expensive.

Wings to start- they're not like any I""ve had, buttery, perfect starter. They're way down on the right corner of the menu so you could miss it...but don't. YumSushi: You can't go wrong with any of the sushi, it's so fresh, perfect rice to fish balance. Plain excellent. The tuna is seriously the best I""ve ever had.Ramen: When I first checked out the ramen, I wasn't impressed. It was not as rich as I like and there wasn't enough stuff in it, which I guess is a style, but not my favorite. The last two times I've been in though the broth was perfect; they clearly beefed it up. The salmon ramen is my favorite; the pork belly is a close second.Also the place is super cute, kinda like an asian pub or something, it's a great date spot. PLUS- this is a big one: the staff smiles. They ask you what you want. They're(oh my god)friendly. In Williamsburg. Grateful to have Susume in the hood.",4.0
"I think this is a good addition in the neighborhood, I typically head to Bozu when I want good sushi, but this is much closer which is nice. We split two rolls--the spicy crunchy tuna with potato and the spicy salmon/avocado/shishito. Both were great quality, and well sized (not that many slices but they weren't skinny). I would consider dropping the price $1 or $2 on each roll--I think you'll make up for it by groups of two ordering more.  I appreciate the short menu though. I worry if I wanted to make a meal of sushi and was REALLY hungry this wouldn't be affordable.Anyway, we also tried the butter wings--we thought they might be awesome since they were a little different than everything else on the menu. They need to punch up the flavor on these, they weren't crispy or spicy--basically just buttery. The yogurt sauce could use more flavor as well. All said--still nice to have this place around I think and excited to see what they do. I might suggest they take a look at the menu for Miya's in New Haven. As someone who lives near Suzume I'd love for this to be a place I can drop in for quality, well priced sushi that won't be too expensive. If you cook at home a lot sushi is one of the things you can really justify going out for when you want it near your apartment!",4.0
"I was excited when I found out that a ramen/sushi spot opened near my apt. I went there with my husband. After looking at their meek menu, we ordered some $13 braised pork belly ramen. I thought it was over priced since this spot is definitely not Ipuddo but still wanted to give it a try. The ramen came in the tiniest bowl which at that point I thought, why wouldn't they at least use a bigger bowl to give it a fake facade to please the customer for charging them $13 for a bowl of noodles. I used my chopstick to go through the noodles to find it still stuck in the same shape it must of come in the package and I also noticed how little broth was in the bowl. I proceeded to separate the noodles and finally got to taste the noodles/broth and I was VERY disappointed. I'm from Japan and I was so offended that they dared to call this concoction of hipster joke ""ramen"".  I'm not even a chef but I can make a better pork belly that was in the ramen. Don't name your restaurant with a Japanese word when you're serving some make shift non authentic Japanese-ish food. I can't believe how many people gave 4&5 stars reviews here, but again I'm sure this restaurant is here to cater to those types of customers that doesn't know any better. I'm giving them an extra star because I didn't try their sushi but really, since it's some made up sushi rolls along with a $5/piece sushi, I rather go use my hard earned cash at a Japanese sushi spot.

"I can only guess what the owners were thinking when they opened this place, ""hey white hipsters will pay anything for sub par ramen at momofuku, why don't we open a ramen joint in williamsburg!"".  The suzume ramen was BAD, they basically use the soy sauce they braised the pork in, threw some egg noodles on top, added a borderline raw egg and seaweed on top and called it tonkotsu ramen.  Sorry ramen lovers, this place is not worth checking out!  The noodles had a heavy ammonia smell to them and the soy sauce they use is very cheap because I was downing glasses of water and my lips were raw from itching them cause of all the preservatives.  The service was pretty bad too, the waitress was stand offish and the Asian chick who came in later was so nasty!  The Asian guy who served us our ramen was very friendly and smiley, must be the owner?  Got the special sushi for $5, it was a scallop sliced in half with a slice of avocado on some rice, literally ONE piece.  Chicken wings were just ok, not enough breading in my opinion. Sigh, had high hopes!",2.0
"Ate here Oscar night in a drunken stupor with a close friend. She had the fat belly pork ramen, and I had the salmon tacos... The tacos were AMAZING. Something about the spicy mayo like sauce. The bartender made me a wonderfully modified Manhattan w/ Fernet that equally hit the spot. My only complaint would be the incredibly small serving size for the value, but the quality was on point.",4.0
"Overpriced, no flavor, tiny portions. Don't get me wrong, not inedible by any means, just nothing worth the $70 I paid here for dinner last night (one glass of wine each x 2 people). Has all the lacquer and atmosphere of a great restaurant but with lackluster food. Also, disappointing service. Great interior though.",1.0
"i have mixed feelings. The salmon ramen was amazing. And it was probably worth $13 since it came with a sizable piece of salmon. My girlfriend ordered the spicy tuna roll and the ""california roll"". She complained that the california roll tasted like supermarket sushi and she was right. They use that premade fake crab stuff and the roll was not tasty. The spicy tuna for was better but nowhere near worth $9. The staff was overly friendly, fake even, and overly attentive. No, I do not need you to ask me how everything is four different times by two different people. Let me fucking eat my food. All things considered, I would eat here again for the salmon ramen but its' definitely a splurge.",3.0

"Suzume is a fantastic new ramen spot in Williamsburg; I can't wait to go back. It's a little too pricey for sushi (although their fish offerings are fresh and delicious), so I recommend sticking with the giant, reasonably priced bowls of ramen and their interesting cocktails. I usually go for a pork belly variety when ordering ramen, but I decided to be different this time around and went for their salmon option. I am so glad that I did. It was possibly some of the best ramen that I've ever had; why don't more places use salmon in their ramen? My husband and our friend both agreed that my salmon version was better than their pork belly/egg, even though they were all really good. The bowls are huge and almost unfinishable (in a good way), the service is friendly, and while the tables are small and chairs somewhat uncomfortable, the food is wonderful enough so that you won't even mind being packed into your table.",5.0

"Ate at Suzume last evening. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good and tasty the dishes were.  I'm a very picky, finicky, fish-hating vegetarian, first of all, and not a big fan of Asian cuisines.  Yet, the bok choy salad turned out to be very refreshing and delicious. The small chopped cashew bits blended so nicely with the light dressing and the little cracker things they had going on in it too. Just blended so well together on the palate.  I really enjoyed it. (And I thought I didn't even like bok choy.)  The topper was the greenmarket noodle ramen I had after the salad.  The noodles were so good, I could barely put my sticks down.  I've had ramen at popular ""in"" places occasionally.  But I found the ramen dishes to be bland and uninteresting.  Suzume's, however, was thoroughly enjoyable--wonderfully flavored and textured noodles and a nice helping to boot. I'd go back for more anytime.",4.0
